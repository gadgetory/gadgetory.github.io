and this is what's in my tech travel
backpack my god
and alright guys here we have a case
logic backpack now these always have
weird model numbers so I'll leave a link
down below in the description to this
and everything else in the video if
you're interested in it now with this
backpack I went with something a lot
smaller I wanted this to be a travel
backpack so if I'm going out on a day
trip I can carry the tech I need with me
in this tiny backpack without it looking
too large so let's take a look at what's
inside of it the first compartment is
where I hold like accessories and you
know cables things like that nothing too
special I've got a pen and pencil so I
can always have those options favorite
pen pilot g2 and this is a pretty cool
pencil I don't know if they has a
special name but it's really nice I like
them both and let's see I've also got of
course my 3ds XL now this is the new 3ds
XL I really like the improvements the
tracking for the 3d is amazing so this
is what I always have to have with me if
I go anywhere I might have some downtime
so I definitely want to be able to get
on my 3s love this thing and of course
this is a really awesome case with it
I'm able to hold up to eight games more
if I double stuff but it's pretty cool I
get some awesome stylus as well and of
course I've got some cables and chargers
in here for the devices that need them
so a couple of cables put those right
there and of course the wall adapters
I'm going to need those and
here where I have a USB 3.0 adapter so
USB 3.0 - regular USB gotta have that as
well and let's see I've also got this
little flash drive now this is an
awesome flash drive this is APN why I
believe this is P my flash drive is 128
gigs and it's USB 3.0 and it was really
inexpensive I think it was maybe like 30
bucks
that's a lot of storage at some really
fast speeds for a very low amount of
money I'm super happy with this best
flash drive I've ever used definitely
recommend getting that you guys are
interested I've also got a tiny little
tripod here from nan Frodo so if I have
my camera I can set it up on this and it
gives me a lot of flexibility I can
position the camera however I want
pretty inexpensive as Wapping goes only
like 20 bucks so let's see and that's it
for these little pockets here now in
this little zipper have a couple of few
things as well now I don't usually carry
my phone in my backpack because it's
always in my pocket but nowadays I carry
two phones one for Android and one for
iOS the iPhone 6 plus is my daily driver
right now so that is in my pocket but
this is the galaxy s6 with a spigen case
on it this is my combo for Android
whenever I want to get on Android and
use it this is what I'm using so this is
my daily driver for Android also in here
I do have a moto 360 so if I do want to
take off the Apple watch and get rid of
the 6 plus I go full Android with
Android wear on my moto 360 and my
galaxy s6 and I also have in here a pair
of jaybird blue buds X now these are
awesome Bluetooth earbuds amazing I'll
use these a lot probably one of my this
is actually my favorite bluetooth earbud
that's so small and compact
definitely
that we work it so that little
compartment held quite a bit of stuff
here so very happy with that and on top
you've got a little compartment here
this is a nicely cushioned area so
you've got space for something like a
digital camera this is my rx100 mark 3
so this is my vlogging camera this is
the camera that you guys should see me
shoot with for all your average couple
videos this is an awesome and amazing
camera I hope but this is what I use
right now big mark 3 and this is an
awesome little pouch to hold it it's got
a nice little fiber microfiber filling
inside so this is awesome and I've got
an extra battery to go along with it now
that's that now the sides also have some
pockets so right here I've got a
portable battery it's in this little
case so this thing is a pretty awesome
portable battery this thing has 13,000
milliamps something like a portable
charger is a must-have for any techie I
think regular people should be using
this whether you're a techie or not this
portable charger in particular is the
Brio lux and is by sentry what I really
like the bottom the reason I picked it
up is because it has a high capacity and
it also tells you it gives you a
percentage right on the screen of how
much battery you've got left and you can
charge two devices at once
can't beat that also inside of this
little pouch it comes with a tiny micro
USB cable so I get to use this to charge
any device I need really nice stuff now
let's see what else we've got on this
side you've got a mouse this is the
Logitech performance MX master this is
an awesome Mouse on the go because it
works on just about any surface so that
makes you perfect for traveling really
good stuff and it connects by a
bluetooth or with a dongle but however
you want to use it I like to use it with
bluetooth so this thing has been killer
love this
now that's about it for there now let's
see what I have in the main compartment
the biggest one of course I have a
little journal travel journal I tend to
jot down a lot of video ideas on here so
this is why I carry this around I've
also got a small little speaker this is
the JBL pulse now this speaker is
awesome and it actually surprised me
quite a bit it's got all these funky
lights and colors it's really really
cool-looking the sound quality on this
room very surprising very good for
something so small it has quite a bit of
bass and it's just got a lot of
interactive little designs and color
schemes to go with it so it's really
cool definitely like to travel around
this especially since it doesn't take up
too much space now I've also got this
guy these are a pair of bluetooth
headphones you guys know I'm all about
Bluetooth and this is the sonne xb9 50
bt now you guys have heard me talk about
these headphones quite a bit and i'm in
love with them if you're a bass lover
and you know it's all about the bass
you're gonna love these they're
bluetooth you can use them with a cable
if you decide to so if the battery dies
you can still use it but for bass lovers
this is an amazing pair of headphones
really love this this is my go-to pair
of headphones whenever i'm going to go
now this is a case that I got from the
Sony mdr-1r it didn't come with it but
it works perfectly for these headphones
especially since they're bluetooth I
want to travel with it this is the
perfect case to go with it so that's
where I got it and last but not least
we've got this guy the 12-inch MacBook
now this is not a device I recommend for
a lot of people because you guys
probably have seen that video I don't
really recommend it but I cannot deny
the portability is amazing I love how
portable this is this is my go-to laptop
whenever I'm reaching for one because
it's just so simple and quick and easy
to use this thing is tiny guys
and it looks great so for portability
being a travel backpack something really
light this is my go to love it
now this backpack can hold a much larger
device than the 12-inch MacBook it can
hold something like the 15-inch so if
you have a bigger laptop it'll
definitely fit in here there's a lot of
space in here but this is my travel size
bag so this is it all right here guys
this is everything that I will take with
me when I'm making a short day trip so
that's why I chose this bag this thing
can hold a ton of tech while still
looking very compact and small but this
is definitely my choice I don't want to
have a lot of stuff on me whenever I'm
going out and speaking of travel I'm
sure you guys like to look clean
whenever you're going out and this is
where Harry's comes in if you ever had
to buy razors at a drugstore you know
they can be pretty expensive
Harry's makes their own high-quality
razors so they're able to cut out the
middleman and offer better prices I've
got the Winston set right here but if
you want to get started with Harry's
Truman set it's just 15 dollars it
includes your razor three blades your
choice of Harry shave cream or foam
shave gel and you get free shipping and
that's great because nobody wants to
spend more on shipping than the actual
product UAC fans get to say five dollars
off the order when they use the code UAC
ten dollars for a month's worth of
shaving supplies sounds like a good deal
to me so if you want to get started we
have a Stefano check the links down
below in the description but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it this is all the
stuff that I bring with me whenever I'm
going out for a short trip this is my
tech travel backpack so till the next
video guys your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
