consumer and today I'm going to be going
over all of the remote play features
that you get with the PlayStation Vita
when connected with your new Playstation
4 now you guys know I love the
PlayStation Vita so I have to test out
every nook and cranny of remote play and
hopefully you guys enjoy this so let's
not waste any time get right into it so
here we have the PlayStation Vita and
the ps4 if you have a Vita you know one
of the biggest features on the system is
remote play if you aren't familiar with
remote play let me tell you now it's an
amazing feature it allows users to
stream their ps4 and somewhat ps3 game
play to their PS Vita system with the
use of Wi-Fi essentially allowing you to
free up your television for others to
use or simply allowing you to play your
PlayStation when you're somewhere
further away game developers can work
around the lack of buttons on the Vita
with the use of the front and rear touch
panels and Sony does state that most
titles will be supported unless they
require the PlayStation camera remote
play works well with a solid internet
connection and without a solid
connection you can definitely expect to
see some lag if you try to use the
feature my experience has been pretty
solid with both systems on Wi-Fi but
even better with my ps4 connected with
an Ethernet cable this goes for playing
outdoors as well here's a quick
demonstration of my experience with
remote play while outside and very far
away from my system I use my galaxy s4
and t-mobile's LTE network to act as a
hotspot for my Vita and the speeds were
pretty decent at a little more than 13
megabits down and 13 up I also had a
ping of 34 if that matters to you my
Vita connection to my hotspot was pretty
solid so when I fired up my ps4 link app
which can only be found if you updated
the Vita to the latest firmware I had no
issues since my ps4 wasn't nearby it
took an extra minute to connect via
internet after that it was smooth
sailing I was surprised at how smooth
that was able to run and was very
impressed with the quality although
tethering data it consumes is something
I need to continue testing you're free
to roam your ps4 is menus and games when
you're using remote play and you can
check out your friends profile and join
parties although you won't be able to
use the chat features unless you use the
villa's primary party app you really do
get the whole shebang with using this
feature and this includes sound music
and sounds are also streamed so you can
throw on some headphones and listen to
your game if the speakers on the Vita
just aren't enough for you overall I'm
very happy and impressed by the Remote
Play feature and which this is how it
functions out the gate with the ps3
if remote play on your Vita was
something you've been dreaming about
rest assured it's here and it works
exactly the way we all wanted it to
finally Sony finally anyway this has
been my overview of the PS Vita's Remote
Play feature with the ps4 if you enjoyed
this video be the cool guy that hits the
thumbs up button and be sure to
subscribe to the channel for more ps4
coverage all right guys it's your
average consumer and tilt the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
