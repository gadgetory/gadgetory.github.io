consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the Logitech g600
Wireless Gaming Mouse and I also have
this G 240 mouse pad to go along with it
so hey let's not waste any time let's
get right into it
all right guys here we have the Logitech
g600 Wireless Gaming Mouse now this is
supposed to be a beast of a mouse for
gaming but I'm actually going to be
trying to use it for video editing as
well as some gaming here and there but
the main purpose is the video editing
and that's because it has a ton of
controls so these are all there are a
lot of programmable buttons on this
thing and I want to see if that could
make my workflow easier for editing
videos I'm just taking a quick look
around the box
on the right side it'll tell you what's
inside um in the back it'll tell you
some of the features on here like 11
programmable controls it has up to 250
hours of wireless gaming and I think it
runs on two double-a batteries it's got
really high accuracy on the fly
adjustable dpi which is 250 to 200 2500
which is quite a bit LED battery life
indicator and performance and endurance
mode to change up how much battery life
is being used so there's like an
endurance mode where you can laughs a
really long time and a gaming mode where
it got better performance so you can
actually customize this and this thing
is built for longevity it's supposed to
last up to 20 million clicks so ask a
lot of clicking you have to do there but
it supposed to last a while if we open
up the box you can actually see the
mouse itself right here and it's a
pretty nice looking Mouse I really like
to look I use a performance MX like a
Logitech performance MX mouse and I'm
going to see if this can be a
replacement for that and because that's
an amazing Mouse but I'm really
interested in these programmable buttons
so let's see if we can actually get this
thing open and here they have a little
tag about what it does and all that
stuff so it has a bunch of tape here
we're going to slice right through this
boom that's taken care of so let's see
if we can pull this thing
and boom that's pretty much it for the
box so let's see what else we've got
here what we can pull out so we've got
some instructions I'm sure of course
so we've got some instructions warranty
information stuff like that so this
comes with a wireless receiver so it's
not like Bluetooth or anything you're
going to have this to use this little
USB dongle to plug it in and I think
this runs have 500 Hertz so it should be
very responsive very fast so let's see
if we can actually get the mouse out
when you open up inside you also get
this little a USB cable so if you want
to get the wireless dongle to be closer
to you maybe you want a better response
maybe this will help to get it just a
little bit closer but that's included as
well and let's see if we can get some of
this stuff off alright guys so in order
to get to this thing you really have to
duck deconstruct the box and it finally
gets you to the mouse itself and of
course got to take out this little
dongle so boom that's everything here
we're gonna put this away for now so
here's the mouse and this has a very
interesting feel this is not really a
rubberized feel on the sides but I can't
even tell what I can't even describe
this really it's very interesting feel
it's a very interesting texture it
doesn't feel bad though just not
something I'm used to it feels pretty
comfortable in the hand so far so good
like it feels pretty solid I like this
so far just show you guys a little bit
around the mouse itself you have the
programmable buttons on the sides here
they're all actually numbered so you can
know which button is which you don't
have to take a guess and you also have
two along the sides here so in total you
get 11 buttons and of course you've got
the scroll wheel and down here you have
a little switch where you can actually
switch to endurance mode or performance
mode on let's see if we can take out
this a piece of paper here so that we
can act
we get this thing on and as you guys can
see it actually lights up blue when
you're in I think this is the gaming
mode and in performance mode is green
and if I'm not right about that I can
add I'll add an annotation to let you
guys know but so far this is it it feels
really nice it feels very very similar
to the performance MX I'm really hoping
I can customize the commands to these
buttons to make it you know do whatever
I want this could be a really really
helpful tool when video editing so that
I don't have to hit any keyboard
shortcuts so this would be really cool
to see it's got a nice little texture on
the in the middle of it right here and
it feels actually really nice it's like
a rubberized feel I'm still not sure
what this feeling is right here but I'll
let you guys know it feels very nice
though and of course is the dongle right
here it's 500 Hertz as I mentioned
before and I also got this gaming mouse
pad and this is supposed to be like a
large mouse pad so that you know you can
have a lot of surface let's see here if
I can open this up this was the main
unboxing this is just kind of like a
bonus so it's the G 240 mouse pad and I
wanted something that's really nice I
have like a youtube mouse pad right now
but I wanted something that was a little
bit larger than that so I'm getting this
open here you can just pull it out and
pretty much that's it this is a really
simple unboxing for that and I guess
this is all of the paperwork that you
get right here so nothing too special
and this is a actually this is actually
a very very large mouse pad guys this is
huge a lot bigger than I expected but
this is exactly the kind I wanted I
wanted something with a lot of surface
area so this is actually really really
nice I'm going to try this out let you
guys know how it works and let you guys
know how performs outside of the gaming
um also you know with gaming I'll
include both those in my review see how
it works for video editing gaming all
that good stuff but pretty much that's
it for this unboxing guys hopefully you
enjoyed it this is only details this
only retails for about
60 bucks so it's not very expensive so
that's about it guys hopefully you
enjoyed this unboxing I'm going to have
a full review for you guys as well so

comments down below and if you enjoyed
