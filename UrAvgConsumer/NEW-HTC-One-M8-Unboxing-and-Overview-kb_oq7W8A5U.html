consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the brand new HTC One m8
this is HTC's latest flagship device and
we're gonna go over all the things that
you get inside and hey let's not waste
any time let's get right into it
and alright guys here we have the HTC
One m8 and like I said this is HCC's
latest flagship device and I have the
gunmetal version and taking a quick look
around the box there's not much to it
it's very small packaging and but some
of the features that they're toting at
the bottom is the Zoe featured in the
gallery HTC boomsound motion launch HTC
blinkfeed and the dual camera and we'll
get into all of that in a second but
let's get this bad boy opened up so I'm
gonna get my little unboxing knife and
here we have it so flip that open and
let's cut some of this plastic off so
there we go get some of that going and I
can probably just lift the rest off
alright so now I can put this thing away
get rid of this so here we have it and
actually there's still some tape on the
sides so we're gonna want to cut that
open as well so here we go alright so
now we can put this away and let's lift
this up and of course kinda like shake
it a bit so that's that put that here
and let's see what we're greeted with so
here we have the HTC One advantage that
they're Alfre now what the HTC One
advantages if you drop your phone or
crack the screen you get a free one-time
cracked screen replacement within the
first six months of ownership of the
device and you get 50 gigs of free
online storage and you get an Angela
software update commitment
so HTC phones don't always get all the
latest updates so I'm not sure how far
how long this commitment lasts but we
will see but these phones are so
powerful now I can't
engine that they'd stop supporting them
in the future considering how strong
they are
so with that stuff aside let's pull the
device out or flip it out and we're
gonna put this to the side and see what
else we get in the box so we've got a
couple of things here now this is the
unlocked version
I got it directly from HTC's website I
think it ran me about 650 dollars so you
might see some differences between like
the carrier versions so we've got a
couple of things here in this plastic
but some of the paperwork here we've got
our details on numbers we've got a SIM
card ejector so this is what you're
gonna use to throw in your SIM card you
got a get started guide and you got to
contact us and your warranty information
so I'm going to need the SIM card
ejector so I'm gonna pluck this out
right here and you also get an HTC
spiffs you get two HTC stickers actually
so you get two HTC stickers if you want
to put this on your car or notebook or
whatever just to show your HTC love so
we're gonna put this paperwork away and
let's see what we get inside this little
packaging now the first one is going to
be the charger for the wall so this is
the wall adapter so here it is and it's
got a little bit of a new design
typically it's just this glossy portion
but now they've got a little matte part
at the bottom so this is a pretty cool
USB charger let's see what this cable
looks like here let's see how long it is
and it's got some decent length to it
you probably won't be able to put this
into a wall outlet and use it on a desk
or anything but it's got some decent
length so it won't be too bad so this is
a USB cable and the wall charger right
here alright and last but not least I
think we've got some ear buds here now
this is the thing I don't know if the
carrier versions will offer because
typically I know the carrier versions
don't offer them AT&amp;amp;T is usually pretty
good about it but um I know t-mobile
isn't so let's see here we've got the
ear buds so it looks like we've got a
tangle free design these kind of remind
me of like the the Beats headphones to
your Beats headphones and yeah it's
pretty basic
I know HTC doesn't work with Beats
anymore they sold their shares and
them so they don't offer beatsaudio
experience anymore but um yeah these
look like standard headphones um let's
see here it has a play and pause button
and that makes sense because typically
Android devices don't really have the
volume up and volume down controls only
real um phones that I've seen with that
feature on the headset is the Samsung
devices so this has the play and pause
and mic of course and a pretty regular
earbud so I don't know how these sound
probably not the greatest but it's very
cool that they come with it and it also
comes with some free ear tips so
depending on your size you probably have
large and small inside of here so you've
got that option as well so we're gonna
put this stuff on to the side we're
gonna put these Chargers everything all
over here so now after the actual bad
boy itself this is the HTC one so now
let's get rid of some of this plastic
here so we've got a little flap that we
can peel off and it might be able to
just slide right out so boom we can do
that and there we have it and guys I
must say this is a pretty large phone it
has a 5-inch display but this is pretty
long due to the speakers it has boom
sound speakers so there's speakers on
the top and bottom portion and what's
really cool is that the speakers are
facing you so the sound comes directly
at you instead of at the back where you
can't really hear it or your hands can
block it so the boom sound speakers are
always a great great thing now I'll take
a look around the actual device in the
back of course we've got the gunmetal
version and it looks very clean feels
very very nice you got the HTC logo here
you've got dual flash and you've got two
rear cameras they're both four
megapixels and this is the ultra pixel
that HTC is touting now everyone says
the camera isn't great resolutions is
pretty bad because of the 4 megapixels
but um I'll see how that goes in my
tests and lets you know guys know for
myself how my what my opinion is and up
front you've got a 5 megapixel front
facing camera and it's a wide-angle lens
so that means you're gonna get a lot
more into the
more of your scenery into the filter or
video so it's not a regular lens it's a
wide-angle but it's very interesting to
me that they provided a 5 megapixel
camera up front and you know these are 4
megapixels but we'll see how this all
goes I'll let you guys know in the
review or and some tests now looking at
the left side of the phone you'll see
that there's a little hole and you can
use your sim ejector to go and plug this
in and then you have access to your SIM
card tray so you can put in your SIM
card here take some nano SIM so it's the
smaller version and on the right side
you have your volume rocker so this is
where you have your volume controls and
above that is where you can put in your
SD card so what's really cool about this
phone usually these unibody phones where
they have like you know no backplate or
anything you usually don't get a micro
SIM card slot so this is really cool
that they offer this now and at the top
you have the power button and the bottom
is where you'll find your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack as well as your micro USB
port so you can plug in a micro USB
cable and you know get this thing all
charged up and at the top you also have
the IR blaster so you can control your
TV with this and pretty much that's all
there is to the actual phone itself
you've got a couple of microphones all
over there's one in the back I believe
one at the bottom so you got a couple of
those but now let's actually power on
this device and let's see what it's got
going on this is actually featuring
Sense 6 so this is their newest version
of sense from what I've seen so far this
there aren't too many huge changes but
um I'll let you guys know in the full
review what exactly has changed so far
and there you have it now this is a
5-inch display and it's running at 1080p
and it's an LCD through a super LCD 3
display so I heard that the colors were
pretty nice on this it looks very
natural and this also comes with 32 gigs
of storage that's how much mine has and
like I said you can upgrade the storage
if you want with the micro SD card slot
and that supports up to 128 gigs so you
can have a lot of storage here
if you want this also has Bluetooth 4.0
and it also has NFC so if you want to be
able to connect things you can always do
that and it has a Snapdragon 801
processor which is the latest Snapdragon
processor so it's very powerful its quad
core and it's clocked at 2.3 gigahertz
and as far as the battery capacity goes
is running with twenty six hundred
milliamps so this should give you some
pretty decent battery life of a CCS
having that this has 40% more battery
life and when you're running really low
it goes into the same power sipping mode
where you can actually have about 15
extra hours when it gets really really
low so I'm gonna test all that stuff out
I really like the fact that they paid
attention to the battery because I was
one of the flaws of the original HTC One
so now we're just gonna see how this
thing looks once you actually get
through all the settings and setting it
up and I'm gonna give you guys a quick
run-through of what you can expect
alright guys so I got past the initial
setup process so I was logged into a
couple of accounts and here you have the
original screen and to the right there's
nothing there yet and to the left you've
got blinkfeed which has all of your
social media apps and you can go and get
your updates and stuff from here so this
is pretty cool so far I have a couple of
things showing up so this is my blink
feed I'll give you guys more detailed
overview of what this does in the review
and yeah so far it just seems pretty
snappy um you know there's nothing on it
just yet so I'm not expecting this thing
to be slow at all so as you guys can see
it's pretty simple stuff is what you
come to expect but um I'm liking the
feel of this phone so far it feels very
nice it is pretty slippery but it's not
too bad
if you have a nice firm grip on it you
should be okay I always like to give my
phone some support with a little pinky
at the bottom just in case but holding
it like this is pretty scary because it
does slip and it slides pretty quickly
so it's kind of dangerous uh-huh but
overall it does feel nice it feels a
little pretty light actually I expected
it to be a little more hefty but it's
pretty light it feels very durable if
you can hear that a solid man so so far
things are looking good I'm gonna give
you guys a full review probably have a
couple of videos on this comparing it to
other devices
and just letting you know how
performance goes so if you enjoyed this
unboxing guys and quick overview of the
details and what you can expect in the
box
