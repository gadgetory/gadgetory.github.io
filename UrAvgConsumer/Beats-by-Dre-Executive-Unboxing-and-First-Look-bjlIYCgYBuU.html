consumer if you can't tell I am very
excited to be bringing this unboxing to
you guys these are the new beats
executives these just came out today I
don't even know about it - my friend
high-five guy check him out right here
he told me that they were selling them
in Apple stores today so I gave my local
Apple Store a call and they told me they
had them some of the workers didn't even
know that they had them in so it's
probably a good idea if you guys are
interested in these getting them early
give them a call and find out whether or
not they carry them so enough about all
that let's not wasting time let's get
right into it
all right guys here we have the Beats
executive now these retail for 299 99
basically $300 and this has noise cancer
like noise canceling features it takes
batteries this is right up there with
the studio's so this is like directly in
line with what the studio's offer so
it's going to be interesting to check
these out but I'm really excited about
these beats hasn't come out with a new
pair of headphones since like earlier in
the year with the wireless and mixers so
very excited about these and um enough
talking let me open this thing up and I
don't really need my unboxing knife but
I'm gonna use it anyway I'm a boss like
that and get this open
so here we are let's open them up slide
a top but that's it side let's see what
these bad boys look like ok and one
thing to note about the box it's very
flat this isn't as tall of a box as on
the previous beats used to come in and
look at the caves interesting it's a
very flat case it's got a nice beyond
there you would think the tablet is
inside of this very interesting but
Before we jump into this without a way
let's get to the boring stuff we're off
to get inside of here oh that was tough
alright so two triple A batteries so
that's already I hope that these were I
don't think these run without the
batteries that's so I've heard pretty
disappointing but we'll see you get your
standard on 3.5 audio audio track right
there and this is the one with an inline
remote pretty standard beat stuff and
here you have to chord it into doctor
says deets on here and give you guys a
real close-up and alright guys this is
the quarter inch adapter says beats on
it not too fancy and I believe you just
yeah you just throw these in I don't
know if you screw them in or anything
now you don't screw these in but yeah
quarter inch adapter and we also get
this airplane adapter nothing special
about this this is what you plug in to
use it on a plane and of course we got
some packaging here now you're gonna
open this up and you get a black
microfiber cloth it's got the little
beats B at the bottom and that's about
it so all this boring stuff aside we
pull these out get these batteries to
the side
close this up and now to grab to use bad
boys get out this is so flat guys check
it out this is real flat so I'm really
interested in seeing how these
headphones fold up put this to the side
too and all right let's see it for the
first time there they go
very nice this is a pretty sweet case I
must say I like this case it shows you
let me give you guys a close-up real
quick so here you have a picture of the
Beast executive inside from this picture
they look like they're pretty flexible
I'm interested in seeing how they fold
up so that's pretty interesting right
there and at the top you see it says um
beats executive and um pretty much this
is the case guys it's a hardshell case
if you have the UM the studios then it's
a similar kind of material to that and
up top front up front here says beats
executive as well while having to be in
the back and pretty much this is it and
alright guys here are the executives
great cushions already I can already see
these feel great um wow you feel great
the top feels pretty good too says beats
on the top and it's got a lot of move
around pretty pretty nicely it can go in
this direction but that's about it can't
go in not the right direction but this
look these feel like they're going to be
extremely comfortable and this is like
an aluminum this is really nice guys I
am totally impressed the design of these
are just great I'm very impressed um let
me give you guys a close-up of what I'm
seeing
alright guys and this is a pretty close
close-up I want you guys to see this
texture around the B this is pretty nice
this is smooth so this is pretty cool um
I'm a fan of that
and I'm guessing I didn't even know
there was a little button here but if
just like the studio this is probably a
mute button
so you can hear that clicking and here
you can see the switch this switch is
going to control the power of the
executives now I'm not sure if these
require batteries to operate like the
studios but I'll definitely let you guys
know as soon as I try them out and these
definitely control Dean um noise
cancelling though so let me also show
you guys inside these ear cups and these
ear cups look pretty nice as well
they're so soft guys very soft
it's got a nice little feeling here so
far I'm extremely impressed by the
design these look great they feel great
they feel pretty high-quality and let me
give you guys let me zoom out of this so
you guys can see the whole thing and
here you have them they're just pretty
nice looking headphones pretty nice I am
I thought I sound like a fanboy right
now but these look great and they feel
great so this is really exciting I'm
hoping they sound good as well if they
sound as good as they look I'll be very
very happy and I can't wait to try these
out guys look pretty sweet and also I
think right here we have this little
sticker this is where you put in the
batteries this is the left ear cup and
you can see that you can just pull down
this latch and this is what would be
putting in our batteries might as well
do that right now and then let's put
those batteries in right now got one got
two and good thing to add this little
string here so you don't go losing this
little piece and it's magnetic so I
didn't even know that that's magnetic
guys so you don't even have to twist it
or anything you just clips right on
there and this is where you put in your
cable and I think that's about it guys
that's all there is to it
alright guys and that pretty much wraps
up this unboxing I hope I showed you
guys all there is to it when you tear
all real quick when you turn it on
there's a little green light that
appears so that's pretty cool so I can't
wait to try these out guys I'm gonna
stop recording this video
and get to using these and letting you
guys know how I how I think about them
so expect tons of videos guys girlfriend
test review all that good stuff and I'll
catch you guys in the next video if you
enjoyed this please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and stay tuned for
more videos on the beats Executives till
then as your average consumer peace
