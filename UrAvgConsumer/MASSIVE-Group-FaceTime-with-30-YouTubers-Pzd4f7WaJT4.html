guys so we are attempting the biggest
group FaceTime chat ever and we're
running through a little bit of issues
the craziest thing is that a lot of
people aren't on the latest update the
call sort of happened six minutes ago so
some people are updating their phones
some people are I gave me numbers that
don't work with iMessage or FaceTime so
trying to wrangle this thing together is
a way bigger deal than I ever thought oh
hi okay so I was making a group to make
it all one quick easy FaceTime and I hit
cancel again this is driving me insane
alright guys we are starting the
FaceTime actually tested this everybody
smile I'm taking a picture
general aside I
I picked him up in there we go I got
questions or like two or three questions
so that we can actually make some most
interesting phone of the year so far
interesting not very British not who was
is better just interesting I think that
new shame that came out with the display
on the back so you can yeah I like the
design is a one yeah okay so one thing
we got one thing we gotta try is adding
people to the group let me see if I can
get Dave in here as well if it is right
thanks when they come to the core
anything if they were all in a grid and
I could just scroll the dredge I just
put a sticker
[Laughter]
marques yeah I got here but I'm glad I
got to experience this if they those
guys leave if they wanted they could
jump right back into it afterwards gonna
stay in there has to stay on though how
people keep coming in like even if
there's no attention there as soon as I
start talking boom there goes mark we
were just talking about and he said one
thing he's in the middle of the screen
now that's what's that I gotta say has
been dominating it knows it's a me
you can you you know so are we gonna try
for 32 next weekend or what's up okay
guys that was absolutely insane but I am
very surprised at how well it worked
like people popped in when they spoke
nobody was hidden for too long unless
they just stayed quiet so that was
actually really really good I'm very
surprised Apple made it work some people
didn't jump in but you know that's cool
I think you got 228 people or so
twenty-nine people there you go alright
guys hopefully you enjoyed this look
into it what a group FaceTime looks like
with a ton of youtubers but till next
video guys your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
