consumer and today we're gonna see what
happened when I relied on just wireless
charging for a full day now I'm talking
no plugging in no portable chargers just
straight-up wireless charging so when
the wireless power consortium reached
out to sponsors today's video I knew a
challenge video like this would be the
best way to see how useful it is now as
many of you guys know Apple recently
introduced wireless charging in its
newest iPhones so now everybody's
talking about it but it's existed for
quite some time with the new Galaxy
phones LG phones and a couple of other
Android devices and because of that
there are already a ton of devices on
the market like Doc's phone holders
charging pads and the first thing I
wanted to do is get some stuff that
would help me get ready for this
challenge alright guys so the first stop
we had to make was IKEA so apparently
they sell some Qi wireless charging pads
so I figured why not try it out and see
if they've got anything decent that
could go in the office or maybe a home
but you guys see this room I need to
have my house look like this yes yes so
we found some lamps with built-in
wireless chargers we're gonna go
actually give this thing a shot okay so
check this out guys boom so this is
actually pretty cool this is a pretty
good-looking lamp I could definitely
have this on the desk yeah I guess we
just gotta find one that works best for
us I think we're gonna go with this one
probably try to switch off the shade or
something I don't know if we're feeling
this one too much so we're gonna try and
maybe get this one and switch out the
shade make our smart bedroom even
smarter it even has a USB port so if you
want to charge something else at the
same time you've got options and guys
look you see this right here is the Qi
wireless charging symbol so this is how
you know if your product is legit and
it's actually certified to provide qi
wireless charging and i feel like we
really got to see how useful it was when
re was editing our videos editor over
here
it's a pretty bad phase but you are
using my wireless charger do you like it
though she never charges her phone folks
never it's always dead once I finish
it'll be it like maybe no probably
before by the time you're done with this
up so I had to call a because this is
pretty funny I was shooting something
for another video and then I realized
while using this I have some wireless
chargers that I've gotten for other
phones in the past but over here I've
got this iPhone charging on this Samsung
wireless charger it just feels it feels
taboo but you know it works because it's
the Qi standard so the Qi wireless
standard no matter what no matter who
makes it if they all follow the same
standard which wireless charging works
on you'll be able to use it regardless
of what company makes whatever products
so Apple and Samsung working together
get me some juice baby and while we were
working it was easy to just drop it off
on the charging pad rather than just
leaving it somewhere on the desk and
that was kind of a trend that we noticed
even though our phones have pretty
decent battery already it was nice and
convenience to be able to just drop it
off on a wireless charger without really
giving it much of a second thought but I
gotta save my favorite kind of
functionality since me and I hurry tend
to drive around a lot was actually using
the wireless charging cradle that I have
in my car all right come on paparazzi so
over here I've got my phone in hand
right jump into the car really quickly
and you can see right here I have my
wireless charging dock I just throw my
phone and really quick turn on the car
and just like that I'm already charging
no need to find cables or anything like
that just pop it in and I'm good to go
alright guys so I've been driving for a
while now
I'm gonna be stuck in traffic for a bit
if you can't tell but that's not even a
big deal to me I've got my GPS going I'm
not worried about losing any power
because it's actually sitting on my
wireless charging dock over here so I'm
good on juice don't have to worry about
that
Gary's cable definitely got caught in
the steering wheel before which was
actually quite scary with this all I
gotta do is make sure my dock is plugged
in and I don't have to touch the cable
ever again definitely a lot nicer on my
heart guys you see that right there
this phone is charging with a portable
charger it has wireless charging built
into it it's the end of the day so we
are we trying trying to enjoy some curry
here but her phone was dying so we've
got to juice it up while eating ah I got
around the hole no wire no portable
charger thing we got wireless charging
qi wireless charging built into that so
we're still juicing up as we eat some
food so it was great being able to use
it in the studio and out in the real
world but let's see how I managed that
home alright guys so we got the two lamp
from Ikea over there with the wireless
charging built into it so you guys can
take a look over here I've already got
my iPhone but I can just pop and boom
good to go but I want to take a look at
this guys this is a mess that I had
before now I always have a ton of
devices that I check out and if I'm
testing them or if I need to keep them
charged by me when I'm going to bed at
night I'm usually dealing with all these
cables there's microUSB cables USB
type-c lightning cables all kinds of
stuff but nowadays since a lot of them
have wireless charging built into them I
can kind of just leave this here and
rock out at night put that phone down
right there and be done with it so I can
probably get rid of this unless I want
to charge my Nintendo switch or
something but uh I'm really liking the
convenience of having that at the
bedside now and I will say if there is
any kind of drawback to having wireless
charging at the bedside is the fact that
you can't charge it and use your phone
at the same
but if you're supposed to be going to
bed it's probably a good thing that you
can't use it I know I struggle with
going to sleep on time because I'm
always on my phone so knowing that I can
just put it down to charge it will help
me to go to bed a bit earlier so there's
a silver lining there which is actually
pretty good so boom I did it
I spent the full day with just wireless
charging and I know you guys want to
know what's the verdict well personally
I really like wireless charging I think
it's super convenient I'm gonna be
keeping all of these wireless charging
pads around because it just makes life a
lot easier but while it's convenient and
easy to use it is a bit slower than the
traditional sense of charging but it
wasn't a huge deal since my phone was
charging consistently throughout the day
and in a world with fast charging I
don't think wireless charging is meant
to replace those options but I do feel
like having wireless charging integrated
into our daily environment will
definitely help with us not having to
always plug in but overall guys I think
wireless charging is a great feature to
have in our devices I can completely
understand what people are upset when
it's not featured in the device that
comes out in today's age it should
definitely happen I think next year most
if not all phones should absolutely have
wireless charging built into it it's
just a game changer it's the new way to
do it hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video let me know what your thoughts are
on wireless charging if you enjoyed it
be the cool guy or girl that goes this
video thumbs up and I'll catch you guys
in the next one till then it's your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
