consumer and today i've gotten unboxing
for you guys of google's latest addition
to the nexus 5 line this is the bright
red version and this is just in time for
Valentine's Day but hey let's not waste
any time let's get right into it and all
right guys so here we have the nexus 5
now the nexus 5 has been out for quite
some time now but they just released a
bright red color and i gave me an excuse
to pick it up so if you're not familiar
with the nexus brand what Google does is
it doesn't manufacture any phones itself
but what it does is it lets these
companies like LG here make these phones
or tablets for them under the Nexus
brand and pretty much it embodies what
Google would do as a phone if they were
a hardware manufacturer so just a little
insight into what the Nexus brand is so
this is exactly what Google wants this
is how they intended the phone to be for
this version and enough my blabbering
let's get to actually opening this up so
when we take this out it's pretty simple
packaging as always you get an all white
box bottom says google so we've got a
little tape over here so i'm going to
use my unboxing knife to cut that open
and here we have it so we slice that
right here let me see if I get this
straight so there we go for that and
there we go for that and let's see here
I can pull this up and here we have it
now this has a 5-inch display so it's a
5-inch phone and wow this is really
really bright I don't even know if the
camera does it justice this is a really
really bright phone but first we're
going to put this off to the side and
we'll talk about that in a second let's
see what else we get inside the box so
we have a little tab here we can put
that up and there's nothing inside of
here so let's see so of course you get
some manuals and some paper documents
and I believe this is a sim ejector so
you can take the
and use it to pop out the sim card from
your current phone and then put it in
nexus 5 so here we have some quick start
guides in a couple of languages so we
can put those to the side you have your
safety and warranty information got two
booklets here and yeah that's about it
so the boring stuff will get that out of
the way and let's see what else we've
got inside the box so this is a charger
now this is should be a regular micro
USB charger take a look inside alright
so now that we've got that off and like
I said this is a pretty standard micro
USB cable so you can plug this up and
let's see here it's got some pretty
decent length so you don't have to be
too close to the outlet or the computer
or whatever you're charging it from so
this is pretty good regular stuff here
let's see and we've got the wall adapter
and all right so now that that's out of
the packaging so here you have it this
is just a LG wall adapter so you'll just
plug yours in right here like so and
start charging it and pretty much that's
about it for what comes inside the box
you got some paperwork charger and
that's it so we can put all of this
stuff to the side throw that over here
put this there and let's go back to this
nexus 5 this is a really really bright
Nexus 5 but let me give you guys a quick
close up of what I'm actually seeing and
give you guys a quick tour of the phone
a front you have the speaker grill in
the same bright red color and you also
have the 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera and an 8 megapixel rear camera
now the Nexus line hasn't always been
known for its camera quality and I don't
think you'll be too surprised with the
quality here but um we'll see how that
goes i'm going to test the camera out
for myself and see I'm looking around it
you also have your volume rocker so you
can press the volume up and down on the
side you have your sim tray you're going
to use the little piece that you've got
here to just push this open and then
you'll be able to put in your
card so that's that and this is where
you put on the power you have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack as well as a
microphone for like noise cancellation
at the bottom you have your speaker
grilles and you also have your micro USB
port so you can charge it up and the
back says nexus of course it shows LG
because they've manufactured it for
Google and pretty much that's about it
for the device itself so let's power
this thing on alright so we'll see if
this thing has you need juice and most
likely it will says Google so now let's
take this little film off see if I can
get that out and bam so here you have it
and this is a 5 inch display but it's
not much bigger than most phones that
you see today definitely a lot bigger
than the iphone I'm sure and all right
so now after what felt like the longest
boot up ever you can actually start
setting this up so I'm going to set this
thing up and then i'm going to show you
guys a quick tour around it and just
show you how zippy it is this has a
snapdragon 800 processor so it should be
really fast and nexus ones are typically
very fast because it has android and
it's optimized to run it very smoothly
so let me get this set up and show you
guys and all right guys so I've got it
all turned on now just to show you guys
a quick look around you can pretty much
get through everything really quickly
it's a very snappy phone um like I said
this has a Snapdragon 800 processor and
pretty much what that is just a really
really fast processor out there so that
you can use your apps with no problem
you can jump between them really quickly
without having any issues so one thing
Nexus phones are known for is speed so
definitely feel comfortable with
throwing a ton of apps on here and using
them at lightning speed now of course
this does support LTE I'm with tmobile
so i will get LTE here so i'm looking
forward to that the last nexus 4 didn't
have LTE support not for at least the
t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T which was pretty
unfortunate but this does i'm looking
forward to testing out the speeds now
one thing I do want to know is this
happening has two hundred two thousand
three hundred milliamps of battery which
isn't the greatest and I've heard that
nexus5 does suffer from battery issues
so it's not the greatest battery but I'm
going to test that out myself and see
how it is do normal stage a normal state
you use and I'll let you guys know in a
review but one of the best attributes
about the Nexus phones is that it is a
complete Android experience so there's
no touch with skin that you would get
from a samsung or there's no sense UI
that you would get from HTC this is
straight-up Android and this is exactly
what Google intended it to look like so
you get the purest version here so when
you're using a Nexus device you don't
have to worry about carriers or
manufacturers getting in the way Google
will send the latest updates out to
these phones and get them running on the
best software available so this has been
a quick unboxing guys i just wanted to
show you guys exactly what you get when
you purchase the bright red version that
or the valentines day version whatever
you want to call it but wanted to show
you guys that and i'm going to have some
reviews and maybe some other videos on
this as well and of course i'm going to
compare it to the galaxy s5 and the new
HTC phone that's coming out soon so
definitely stay tuned for that and if
you want to see anything in particular
about this phone be sure to let me know
down below and i'll be sure to work on
video about it so if you enjoyed this
video be the cool guy that hits the
thumbs up button and subscribe to the
channel for more content from me and
i'll catch you guys in the next video
till then is your average consumer
please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
