consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with a
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and for those of
you who have never seen one of my real
day-in-the-life videos you're pretty
much gonna be spending the day with me
and the note 9 now we're gonna test out
a bunch of stuff like the performance
battery life the camera that new s-pen
and we're gonna see how it handles a
date in the real world now Before we
jump into the real day in the life
you guys must know I'm given one of
these away in my last video of the
galaxy note 9 I teamed up with my buddy
Jon from TLD today and we're giving one
away I'll include the same link that we
use for the giveaway in that video down
below in the description so you guys
could go ahead and enter but let's see
how the note 9 did in a real danger life
all right guys now we're gonna spend
some time talking about the design of
what this phone looks like kind of specs
and all that good stuff but I actually
have to head out to New York for a bit
to actually take this guy in my red
camera one of the accessories or the
attachments on it is giving me a little
bit of an issue so we have to take it
into the store and see what they say but
before I go in and do anything like that
I gotta take pictures of this guy I
don't know about you guys but whenever I
send in any piece of tech to a company
to get repaired or something I take
pictures of it so I know exactly the
condition it was in before I sent it
that way when they sent it back you
can't say oh that scratch was already
there all that stuff so perfect time to
try out the note 9 camera and I'm pretty
familiar with this camera since is
pretty much what was on the galaxy s 9
plus and oh this is such a good camera
check this out guys
this camera is just so so good this guy
right here this is the issue picture of
that now let's take a look at some of
these shots and man this this camera is
insane it is so sharp like look how much
I'm zooming in before I see it get
blurry like look guys that's insane this
is such a good camera I just love it oh
listen honestly guys this Bigsby button
I hate it
I hate it so much I press it by accident
so many times I just wish they'd let us
remap it but that's another conversation
now before we fly over to the red store
I've got to get this video up this is a
back-to-school video of the baller
Edition so if you didn't see it you
gotta hit the links down below in the
description but real quick I had to take
a minute over here I've got some
giveaway prizes from Cola where these
were the 16 bit retro edition joy cons
and pro controller for the Nintendo
switch and I've been talking to the
winner over here on Instagram and just
so you guys have an idea of what the
typing experience is like it's a big
phone so it feels like you're typing on
half of the screen and using keyboards
take up a big portion of the screen but
this one it literally feels like the
same way I would hold a normal phone I'm
only holding half of the phone and I'm
just typing down here and I've got like
a bunch of real estate up here it's kind
of crazy but this is a really big phone
become typing on it nonetheless not so
bad so we're in an uber now and it's
about 432 p.m. a little too late to head
over to New York so we're scrapping the
whole red store idea probably just do
that later on this week but we do have
the giveaway in hand the giveaway prize
and we're gonna be sending this thing
out so while we're in this I figured we
play this some fortnight but
unfortunately it's downloading an update
but let me update you guys on the
battery life right now we've got 72%
left and let's see the screen on time oh
wow so we got 2 hours and 24 minutes of
screen on time with 72% that's that's
what I expect to see from a note device
four thousand milliamp hours I expect to
see good battery life from two hours in
24 minutes so far and still having 72%
left this is really good
so while I'll try to figure out this
whole update thing with fortnight I
don't know if you guys noticed as to
bring out the gear s3 I love this watch
the gear watch looks pretty interesting
but the gear s buriai I'm a huge fan
I even used this thing with my iPhone
for a long period of time but the Find
My iPhone feature is so critical for me
that I needed to switch back to the
Apple watch but it feels good to have
this thing back this is such a good
device to have if you owned a galaxy
phone all right so I never did get
fortnight up and running but funny
enough the winner of this giveaway prize
and guys I have no connection to him
actually lived a block away from my old
apartment which is just insane so I felt
like I had to do something special and
so I'm gonna be the delivery guy who
gives them this prizes let's ring the
bell you Gomez all you no prob nice to
meet you oh by the way I'm doing a real
day-in-the-life with the galaxy note 9
mind if I take a selfie with you guys if
the reason why I got a warm place oh
really yeah awesome that's dope so let's
see if I can Oh big speed I told you
guys that happened so often see now we
got the focus rings the last shot may be
blurry interesting so that's one of the
new features sorry I'm like going into
explaining mode here but one of the new
features with the note 9 is that it can
detect whether or not there's an issue
with the picture you just took so we
just took a picture it came out blurry
and it gave me a little notification
right at the bottom said this picture
may be blurry so I know I have to take
another one so and it is blurry it's
pretty blurry now I don't know if
there's a smudge on the front-facing
camera but we are going to try that one
last time before I eat up too much of
your time
there we go a solid selfie alright
alright you guys like 14 handshakes by
the end of the day take care of guys and
that ladies and gentlemen is how you do
a giveaway so guys check this out look
at these cool little uh lamp I don't
even know what to call these but they're
spinning these are juice cartons but I
figured this could be a pretty cool time
to check out the super slow-mo they're
spinning pretty quickly but let's see
how it is super slow-mo style so we'll
go with this guy right here and a so
this is actually pretty cool you'll see
it spin normally at first and it slows
all the way down that's pretty sick and
it's got a little music playing in the
back you could chop it up the way you
want to but this is actually cool I love
super slow-mo we captured some really
cool stuff in the s9 + video that was
fun now the galaxy note 9 does have face
unlock
but it's like it's okay it's not the
fastest kind of reminds me of face ID
where it takes a little bit to scan your
face I'm honestly just a little bit
spoiled by the one plus six that has
like that instant unlock where this one
honestly it's just faster to use your
fingerprint so face unlock for me on the
note nine it's okay so we're actually
close to a supermarket right now so I
figured I'd hit up Airy and just ask her
if she needed anything from there
hey oh there's an extra volume feature
Hey oh nice okay so I'm actually close
to the supermarket right now what kind
of stuff do you need me to pick up yes
oh the obvious answer milk turkey slices
okay I'm taking I'm using I'm writing
all of this down with the s-pen cuz I'm
fancy like that hey hey we don't need
you taking shots Ari
long story short I'm a slow texter you
guys want to see my lovely handwriting
I'm gonna take a screenshot right now so
you guys can see it all right guys got
what we needed low key this is the most
important part of any shopping trip the
serial baby alright guys so now we are
back at the studio
it is 6:15 p.m. so we are sitting at 3
hours and 29 minutes of screen on time
which is just bananas because we still
have 55% left so if we get double this
that's like 6 hours maybe more because
we have 5% more we have at least six
hours right out of the box
that's pretty nice you can't complain
four thousand milliamp hours men that
should be the standard in 2018 where at
least 2019
four thousand milliamp hours the lowest
I want to see if I can get some
fortnight going that's like I was like
the thing so I finally got it updated
and I'm going to try and play a few
rounds I have like this much fortnight
experience so don't laugh but one thing
I will say though guys this screen and
fortnight
it's a nice combo man it's a nice combo
is that a like for tonight is so
colorful and the note 9 has such a nice
saturated display content is looks so
good
stop shooting at me no and I gotta say
performance wise this is pretty solid
I'm not seeing a ton of dropped frames
I'm not seeing any dropped frames right
now really it was very smooth controls
are okay
but for the most part this looks pretty
good I just saw one drop frame right
there see if I can run up on him
lacy lagging yeah one new versus another
I got him though hahaha probably gonna
turn on some anime get some food
watching the enemy why he sounds like a
plan so guys check this out so I'm
eating some lunch a really really late
lunch but I mean some lunch lunch
nonetheless
and one thing I find that's pretty cool
I can be eating like a savage here and
not worry about my hands getting all
messy and touching my screen to play and
pause a video but the s-pen having the
new Bluetooth features I can kind of
just press a little button that's on it
and continue watching whatever I'm
watching without worrying about getting
my screen messy and you guys know me I'm
crazy about keeping my screens clean
that's why I walk around with a
microfiber cloth all the time
it was kind of cool to have some of
these features built right into it do it
I don't know if it's really gonna catch
on but it's cool that it's possible
nonetheless I'm a fan of having options
and this one's not so bad and as for
this case that you might have seen here
guys look at JD over here about to kill
john-boy anyway if you've seen this case
guys I am NOT a fan of it but it is
pretty convenient in that it turns into
a kickstand so he can kind of pop your
phone up like this that's nice but I am
really
not crazy about this case it's not my
style and that was kind of our day uh
I'm not gonna lie to you guys I'll be
completely honest that I saw me eating
that thing put me out so I ended up
missing the very very last shot I needed
to update you guys in terms of the
battery life but just to let you guys
know I ended off with about six hours of
battery life I think when I last checked
it I had about 10 to 15% so with that
end six hours of screen on time that is
great battery life on the note 9 and
honestly I feel like that is a win for
the note series battery life was
starting to get a little bit weak on it
in comparison to other phones that are
out right now so forget to finally be
able to hold its ground like you used to
is a really good thing but let's talk
about the overall phone so the design
very similar to the last iteration of it
but now it does have a slightly larger
screen honestly you can't really tell
the difference it's a nice big display
which is also one of the issues with the
note 9 it's one of the very few issues
with the note 9 it's really a big phone
not everyone's gonna be crazy about
having a phone that long some people
might think it's a bit ridiculous and I
do agree it does Teeter on the edge of
being too large but if you do like a
bigger display this one is beautiful
it works well honestly Samsung is one of
the best when it comes to screen
displays so it's all gonna come down to
personal preference and like I said this
is very similar to last iteration of the
note and even the s9 plus so let's talk
about what kind of separates this from
the rest
besides that bigger battery of course
the biggest thing is that s-pen now the
pen is probably a gimmick to some people
me personally I like having the option
I'm an options guy I like being able to
pull it out whenever I need it or even
use it to do special things like take
selfies or take pictures without
actually having to touch the camera so
there are some cool things that have
been added to the note 9 is it a selling
feature samsung obviously thinks so but
I'm curious what you guys think is it
something that you'd use or even other
hardcore no users how often do you use
the s-pen I don't know how much it'll
influence my purchasing decision but
when you think of it as a package and
everything else that I can do it
definitely doesn't hurt and that's kind
of the story of the note 9 Samsung
pretty much gives you
everything you could possibly want and
you can pick and choose how you actually
use the device and trust me the note 9
its packing everything but the kitchen
sink I'm talking wireless charging water
resistance stereo speakers a headphone
jack
Samsung please never get rid of the
headphone jack you're doing it right
face unlock fingerprint scanner although
I will say I find the fingerprint
scanner a bit more reliable than face
unlock it's just so much faster so face
unlock is there but yeah also you can
get expandable storage so you can get a
micro SD card and add up to 512
gigabytes and if you fifty 512 gigabyte
model you're looking at about a terabyte
on your phone not to mention you do get
that s-pen as well as Samsung decks
built into it so if you have a monitor
that uses USB type-c
you can plug it right into the phone and
start taking advantage of a full desktop
version of the note 9 which i think is
just awesome to have as an option and it
spent any time on that during the real
day into life but if you've got to
monitor that supports USB type-c or
you've got the Samsung X adapter this is
a really nice feature to have especially
if you depend on your phone which note 9
users tend to do since the typically
power users they try to keep everything
on there I think it's awesome to have
the VEX available to you whenever you
want now we've got to talk about camera
performance it's pretty much the same
camera as the galaxy s 9 plus all the
photos that I've taken up in pretty
sharp have great dynamic range very
vivid lots of detail so no complaints
when it comes to the camera department
definitely good stuff it also has a dual
camera lens so that you can have
portrait mode effects or live focus
effects which also looks very nice and
the note 9 seems to handle it pretty
well it also handles video like a champ
I actually shot a video with my boy John
unboxing the note 9 with a note 9 and a
video came out surprisingly well that
stabilization is really nice now when it
comes to the AI camera it's cool that
it's available I honestly had a very
hard time finding the difference between
a regular shot and a shot that was
detected through AI so it's there I'm
not really sure how much it impacts
the actual end result but if at least
identifies it now this thing is running
a snapdragon 845 processor so honestly
guys you'll be able to throw whatever
you want at this and have it perform
well the biggest test will of course be
through gaming and with the note 9 of
course comes that for tonight and for
tonight actually ran pretty well a
couple of dropped frames here and there
basically what that means is the game
would skip just a tiny bit but
definitely not enough to impact the game
whatsoever ran pretty well and on that
screen it just looks really really good
replaying the sonic game that I love to
play it was just fine so performance
this is right up there with all the
other flagships this is an awesome phone
in terms of performance but at the end
of the day we got to talk about whether
or not this is a good phone to buy and I
will go on record and say this the note
9 is the best no compromise phone out
there right now now there are three
things worth considering that caused
this to not be an instant buy first one
being of course that price things over
$1000 it's a very very expensive phone
but I honestly do feel like you get your
money's worth if you're looking for a
phone with no compromises that has all
the features you're looking for and
performs well this is that phone but a
thousand dollars it's a lot of money for
a phone too the other thing being the
straight-up size this thing is a larger
device not everyone is going to be
comfortable with that and the last thing
worth considering is how good is the
phone that you currently have if you
have a phone that came out of 2017
there's chances are you probably won't
need to upgrade it if it's a flagship
device but if you're rocking something
older where this was gonna be a
significant upgrade come on it's a no
brainer but if you do have something a
bit more recent is it worth spending
that thousand dollars probably not you
probably won't see a massive spike in
performance but you will see all the
features that it currently has which is
a good thing but that about wraps it up
for this video guys you have you've
heard me ramble enough I'm singing its
praises I really enjoyed this phone I
think it's a great phone and it is going
to be the Android device
keep on me at all times but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up definitely subscribe and make
sure you enter into the giveaway links
