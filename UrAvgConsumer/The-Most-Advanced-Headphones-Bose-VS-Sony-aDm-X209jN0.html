consumer and today we've got a showdown
between two of the best noise cancelling
bluetooth headphones you can find on the
market right now the bose qc25 twos and
the sony wh 1000 x mark twos these are
both top of the top headphones but we're
gonna see which one deserves your money
so first let's compare the design now
the bow is pretty much share the same
look as all the other Bose headphones
that are out right now they vary very
slightly and this really looks just like
the original both QC 35s but what I like
your design is that it is lightweight
foldable and the ear cups can swivel so
you've got a lot of flexibility here in
terms of being able to take this around
and how you want to put it away
whenever you're storing it now you can
pretty much say the same for the Wii
Sony's they've got pretty much the same
look as the original 1000x maybe a few
material changes but overall it's a very
similar design to the original versions
so when it comes to the flexibility and
the function of the design these are
pretty much tied they do all the same
things
both gets a slight knob simply because
it's maybe a tiny bit lighter one thing
I will give to the Sony's though is
since it has fewer buttons I think it
overall looks a lot cleaner that is also
because of that touchpad on the side
that has a few controls which we'll get
through later and because of the cleaner
look I'm gonna be giving the design
point over to Sony now our next category
is Comfort and while I think that the
Sony's are very comfortable headphones I
can wear these for quite some time with
no problem to both quiet comforts they
live up to their name and they are
definitely the more comfortable
headphone whenever you throw these on it
completely engulfs your ears the
cushions are nice and soft this is not a
contest Bose has comfort down so they
get the point for this one
now the next category we're gonna talk
about is active noise-cancelling which
is one of the biggest selling points of
these headphones and Boas has been known
as the king of active noise-cancelling
they pretty much have a very very strong
rep for their active noise-cancelling
because it's very good but I have found
that just like last year's iteration of
these headphones the Sony's do perform
quite a bit better one thing I do like
Debose is that they've introduced
different levels of active noise
cancellation so there's a high-low and
then you can actually just turn it off
before it was just on or off but now
they've got that extra level and I still
get that weird sensation with the boast
when I have it on it feels like my head
is engulfed like it's underwater or it's
like it's um submerged in something so
it's got that weird feeling and you
absolutely get used to it after some
time but I do find that the so nice I
didn't get that weird sensation with
these at all and they still perform
better and they've also got that ambient
noise cancelling feature which allows
you to hear certain things that are
going on around you
so if someone's speaking to you while
you're listening to your music it
doesn't completely drown them out you
can actually hear what's going on so in
terms of noise canceling I gotta give it
to the Sony's I do think that these are
just overall better but they're both
freakin amazing so you really can't go
wrong with either one if you're really
looking at noise cancelling now
obviously noise cancelling is one of
their biggest features but they've got
some more features that make them a bit
more special
now the last iteration both simply had
noise canceling NFC Bluetooth and those
were really it there were no real
special features here but with the mark
twos they have a new feature with this
little button over here and what this
does is it allows you to use Google
assistance and no you don't need to have
an Android phone and take advantage of
this you can download the Google
assistant app right onto your iPhone so
it'll let you know if you've got a
package coming or your flight status any
of the kind of information that you
would expect to see in your Google now
page you can get with the press of a
button which i think is awesome you can
also change this button to toggle
through your active noise-cancelling
settings so if you wanted to turn it off
or make it low or high you can use this
button for that as well now when it
comes to the Sony's the 1000x have
always had a ton of features sometimes I
sit up here and I'm like did I get them
all um let's see first thing of course
is the fact that they are noise
canceling bluetooth half NFC but they've
also got this touchpad on the side which
you can use to control your music as
well as your calls and your volume and
if you hold it it'll activate your voice
assistance so if you've got Siri or
maybe your Google assistant you can
actually call it up by just holding this
not a dedicated button like what you'll
find with the bose qc25 s but you still
have access to it here and when you're
wearing it there's also this cool
feature whether you're listening to
music or not where you can cover the
right ear cup everything kind of pauses
and the mics kick in so you can hear
what's going on around you so if
someone's trying to speak to you and you
do this you'll be able to hear them
without an issue and once you take your
hand off you'll be right back to normal
I'm all it's a bit of an extended
feature both these headphones have apps
now with the post QC 35s with that app
you'll be able to change the active
noise-cancelling level and also
connected to another device so you can
pair more than one device to these
headphones which i think is a really
awesome feature but that's pretty much
the most functionality that you'll get
out of that app while the Sony's have a
ton of customization options but screen
changing up your active noise-cancelling
optimization there's also the ability to
change the sound positioning and you're
also able to change the sound of your
music so that you can sound like you're
in a concert or in a hall so features go
to some of these now when it comes to
battery you've got 20 hours with the
Bose on a wireless connection and when
you use the cable and active
noise-cancelling you got 40 hours which
is pretty good and with the Sony you get
30 hours on a wireless connection and
also 40 hours when it's wired and not
only that but if you charge the Sony's
for 10 minutes you get 70 minutes of
playback so you get an hour in change of
music listening on a wireless connection
for just 10 minutes of charging which is
awesome so when it comes to battery
again we go to Sony's I mean it feels
like an unfair fight but we got to do it
for the people and just to be clear here
guys there's no bias going on over here
a lot of the numbers speak for
themselves but Sony's never sent me
anything and neither has both so these
all came out of my pocket it's like
unless you guys know which one's better
now for what you've all been waiting for
the sound quality what do these actually
sound like and I gotta say they both
sound really really good and they better
for the price but there is a clear
winner and that is again the Sony's the
Sony's hard that they're better sounding
headphones what can I say they offer
more dynamic rain
they have a nicer low-end so if you like
a bit more bass you can definitely
achieve that with these Sony's I feel
like Bose has done a really really good
job in improving their sound quality
from their headphones I've never really
been a fan but with the QC 35 s in the
QC 35 to s these actually have a
surprisingly good bit of bass I've been
able to listen to any of the music that
I like with these and not really have
any complaints so these sound great but
B sound better and so I will give it to
the Sony's in the sound Department and
while we're on the topic of sound
quality one thing I want to mention is
that these both have mics built into it
so you can use them as Bluetooth
headsets but I did find that the bow
sounded way better than the Sony's the
Saudis didn't sound bad they work the
person could hear me but it sounded like
I was using a bluetooth headphone or
some kind of external device to speak or
like I was on speaker while the Bose
sounded like I was actually holding the
phone so I do find that the mic quality
is better on this I tested it quite a
bit and every time the both sounded
better and with every showdown we have
to have a winner and I think if we tally
up the scores here the clear winner
are the Sony's so the Sony's beat this
in almost every department except for
comfort which I honestly think is a
pretty solid department for this thing
to win and they both go for 350 bucks
but you'll definitely be getting more
for your money with the Sony's but in
case you want the bow still I'll have
them both link down below in the
description but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully this
helped you to make a better purchasing
decision if you enjoyed it be the cool
guy or girl like there's a video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
