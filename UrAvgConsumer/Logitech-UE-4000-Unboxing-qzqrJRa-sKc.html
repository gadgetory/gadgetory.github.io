consumer and today I'm going to be
unboxing the Logitech UE 4000s so that's
not wasting time right into it alright
guys here we have the Logitech UE 4000s
and these actually retail for 100 bucks
but you can find them online at Best Buy
and even Amazon for about 50 so it's
pretty much half off so that's really
great and this is part of the UE line
which has done amazingly so far in my
opinion the six thousand and nine
thousand sounds amazing so this is a
very cheap alternative for people who
are on a budget so as you can see it
includes a couple of accessories here
and it's got some more information on
the back but let's get to the actual
unboxing the fun stuff so let's pop this
open with the little unboxing knife and
let's see here just get this next side
there we are so we'll put this away and
let's see here you pull this out grab
this and they've also they also do
really great on the packaging at
Logitech so wouldn't be surprised if
this looks great there we go and here we
are just pop these out and these are
tiny guys these are really really tiny
actually smaller than the solo HD is I
think so let's grab everything out of
here here we have that splitter so you
can have two people listen to one audio
source at once so that's included here
the six thousands included one of these
as well so that's pretty cool let's see
if there's anything behind here okay
we've got some warranty information and
QuickStart guides all the standard stuff
you would expect so we can put that over
here and inside here we've got a little
pouch
over here there's nothing else in here
so we can put this stuff to the side and
we've got this pouch and the cable so
this is a very nice-looking pouch feels
pretty nice and it's actually pretty
durable so that's really cool this is a
very nice pouch best pouch I've seen
actually ever so good job to them and
here we have the cable with an inline
remote so there's nothing too fancy here
it's a standard cable with an inline
remote and give you guys a quick close
up of the remote so here you can see
it's got the play and pause of course
this will work with all Apple devices
for Android it'll most likely just work
with playing pause and in the back here
I don't know if you guys can actually
see it but it says Logitech UE so pretty
simple stuff only comes with one cable
and all right now for the star of the
show the actual headphones themselves
and guys I am amazed at how small these
are like these are really small and can
these Bend I don't think these can fold
so that's interesting I would definitely
have expected these to fold but I guess
that's why they come in a pouch like
this so let's see here this is all there
is to it guys I'm give you guys a quick
close-up of what I'm seeing alright guys
so here it is as you can see it says UE
and this is the black version so it is a
glossy finish you can get probably a ton
of fingerprints on here
overall Dustin's has some really soft
cushions these are really soft these are
really small I'm just floored by how
small these are these are an on-ear
design so these will be going directly
on your ears so it's not over the ear
and pretty much guys this is all there
is to it you got the left and right
cymbals it's a very thin headband so um
pretty much this is it guys and that's
about it guys for this unboxing this was
really short really quick and simple
there is much to the whole packaging
you've got the pouch you've got a
splitter you've also got a inline remote
with a cable and you got the headphones
themselves
and that's about it and for being able
to find these for 50 bucks that is not a
bad deal Logitech puts out some great
products so I can't wait to try this out
and before we close out this video
here's a quick message from our sponsor
hotspot Shield is a free internet
security and privacy solution that
allows you to surf the web without any
roadblocks so if there are black sites
in your country or maybe black sites on
a certain Wi-Fi network or firewalls or
anything like that hotspot Shield
actually allows you to go bypass all of
that so if you're at work or school or
something or in Germany you're able to
access sites like YouTube and things
like that with no issues so if you want
to get started with hotspot Shield check
the link down below in the description
and start watching some average consumer
at school no kids I'm joking but really
you can do it if you want with hotspot
Shield so just want to say thanks again
to our sponsors over at hotspot Shield
that's about it this is a really quick
unboxing hopefully you enjoyed it if you
did please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe and let me know if you want to
see a girlfriend test for this if so
I'll definitely get on that and I'll
have a review for you guys as well so
Levin is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
