Sumer and today we're going to be taking
a look at some of my favorite tech of
the month whether it's old and new but
these are things that I genuinely love
and I find myself using on a daily basis
which i think is a pretty refreshing
change from telling you guys which new
products to buy or not to buy so let's
check out the first one now this is the
Bose Soundlink mini
2 now I actually got this from Verizon
they sent me this holiday package no
sponsors on this video just so you know
but the extended holiday package and it
included this Bluetooth portable speaker
now this was absolutely not on my radar
I would never look for a Bose Bluetooth
speaker this size it just didn't occur
to me that this could be something
decent now I have a ton of Bluetooth
speakers but I have found that this is
probably my favorite ever
this thing has awesome awesome sound
quality gets really loud it's super
compact like I can put it in my backpack
without worrying about it taking up a
lot of space whatsoever I think it goes
for like one $79.99 so about 180 close
to 200 bucks but it is extremely worth
it
it feels very high-quality buy premium
metal all over here this is actually
really good stuff so shut off the boat
for killing the speaker and I use it
like daily when I'm recording my videos
doing b-roll that guy is usually on
playing some music for me there's
actually sitting on this cool little box
whenever I'm done using it you just
throw it on there charges it up but
that's actually connected to this whole
little charging station that I've got
going on as you can see I have a ton of
cables all over here but this one is my
favorite I actually recently got my
hands on this this is a lightning cable
with a built-in portable charger this is
by nomads and they've got some actually
really nice stuff now imagine this you
charged me a phone right you plug this
guy in
and you got to go somewhere really quick
the phones not done charging and go
ahead and pick this up the charging
continues you can wrap this up it has a
little thing so that you can wrap the
cable build in your pocket and you're
still charging on the go so you don't
even have to unplug this from your phone
just pick it off the charger keep going
and it will continue to charge your
phone which i think is awesome and
actually the kicks that I'm using right
now is currently one of my favorites
this is a Nomad case I think they're
rugged case so it has like this little
honey comb design it looks awesome feels
great I'm not super crazy about the
buttons I'm a little slow by Apple's new
cases the band new buttons those are
amazing but this was good enough for me
to replace that because this design and
the protection problem
so there's Nomad stuff is pretty legit
there definitely a company I'm going to
keep my eye on if they keep coming out
with cool stuff like this portable
charger cable access cope row though now
check this out I don't know if you guys
have seen my playstation platinum
headset video where I showed off this
guy this amazing looking PlayStation 4
pro this is a retro PlayStation 4 pro
customized by color where they did all
the coloring over here they make dope
stuff it customized a lot of great
things I'll have the link down below in
the description but they nailed it in
terms of the attention to detail if you
see a regular PlayStation you'll notice
that above the while player 1 and player
2 controllers they forgot these numbers
which they be nailed over here as well
they've got the original PlayStation
logo and the colors they've got it down
to a few guys but having this amazing
paint job isn't only reason why I'm
talking about the PlayStation 4 Pro I'm
actually playing it a ton right now this
is like my go-to systems because of
Final Fantasy 15 I cannot stop playing
this game
actually it's open right now uh let's
see some difference I've got in 129
hours of playtime right now a little
crazy now some of that may be me falling
asleep while playing but I'd say a good
eighty-five percent of that is actually
me trying to kill all the quest went
platinum I feel good but the
presentation for pros has been killing
me for me I've been loving it and that
is why it's on the list and it just
looked so beautiful now my next favorite
thing is over here not in this gadget
backpack but actually in this one the
tech travel backpack now this is new
obviously video coming soon but inside
of it there's a little bunch of goodies
but I want to show you guys is this now
you might be familiar you might not have
seen this in another video but these are
shown here in wireless earbuds these
actually happen to be one of my
favorites because look at the color but
no I'll finish these are some really
awesome here bud I fell in love with the
earbuds that have this neck band design
something that hangs around your neck
and pretty much keeps it here but in
place I don't have to worry about them
falling out of my ears at all so it's
extremely comfortable things that I've
said in the past about why I like these
are all really true
they've won me over B sounds really good
I forget how much they cost but after
getting them I never look back these are
like my go-to earbuds always if you're
curious about my personal earbud this
nice guys and the cool kid bit about
these is that they actually have this
cable here that plugs into the micro USB
port and you've got a regular 3.5
millimeter
but so that you can listen with your
phone if the battery dies on this or for
whatever reason if you want to save your
battery you can always plug it into any
device even if doesn't have bluetooth
really really cool feature that you
don't typically see on Bluetooth in
earbud but let me actually show you guys
my last favorite thing which actually
happens to be a mouse now you guys know
I've been getting my PC gaming on and I
actually have quite a few of them right
here plus all the fit aside though
because this guy the logitech g502 is an
amazing Mouse now that might be because
I've been using the Logitech g600 with
my Mac to do a lot of editing so maybe
the comfort is what I'm used to over
here but I love this mount now my only
complaint is that it's not Wireless but
that doesn't change anything I'm still
willing to use it because this thing is
great as a nice looking design the
ergonomics are great a kind of
programmable button so you can pretty
much do whatever you want with it
honestly I'm just really really liking
that doctor when I keep seeing myself go
back to you so that has to be my last
favorite thing guys so that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed having some insight into some of
the tags that I'm using on a daily basis
my personal favorite things that I'm
loving right now if you want to see this
be a series I can do it every month let
me know with a thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next one so that is your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
