consumer and the holidays are still
amongst us so I have to let you guys
know my favorite tech gift ideas this
time under $200 let's kickstart this
list with the field II twelve portable
headphone amp now I've used a couple of
amps and backs in the past but the
portable amp I feel is the first I've
been able to take with me on the go and
man I got to tell you guys I'm in love
with this thing I get asked a lot how
loud the headphones I review are but
with something like this every
headphones volume can be amplified an
amp like this will allow you to be able
to give your headphones the power they
need to deliver the best sound quality
but let's take a look at this thing it's
got a very nice brushed metal design
with a couple of switches and knobs
around it the front has two 3.5
millimeter inputs one for an audio
source like your phone and the other for
your headphones you also have a volume
dial which also powers it on on the left
side you'll find a microUSB port to
charge it and a switch that'll give it a
very nice increase in bass obviously you
know I love this feature but it's
actually nice being able to give a boost
to headphones that don't quite have
enough on the other side you'll have a
cross feed and a gain switch and if your
headphones don't quite get loud enough
for you this will definitely help it
also comes with a carrying case and some
bands to strap it to an audio device
like an mp3 player or a phone you can
find these for about 125 dollars which i
think is well worth it and it's a great
gift for someone who loves using
headphones or even if you like listening
to headphones yourself next up we have
the Samsung smartthings home monitoring
kit and huge shout out to Samsung for
sending these over and sponsoring this
video with some more things you can do a
couple of cool things to your home like
increasing your security adding some
automation monitoring what's going on
and controlling things when you aren't
even around there are tons of different
pieces to the system since it's modular
which means you can add and remove
things as you see fit but let's take a
look at some of the things I've got here
first is the most important piece the
hub that connects everything and talks
to your phone there's a smart things app
for both iOS and Android so you don't
have to worry about which one you have
if you want to use this
then you've got a couple of different
sensors a multi-purpose sensor which has
two pieces and sends an alert to your
phone when the contact is broken between
them this means if your doors and
windows are open by anyone you'll get a
notification it can also detect
temperatures which can activate a smart
thermostat if you wanted there's also a
motion sensor which as you guess lets
you know when motion is detected in
front of it this is what I like to use
to make sure nobody's touching my
valuables when they shouldn't be another
cool addition is a smart outlet with
this you can control whatever is plugged
in right from your smartphone and since
it's part of the system it works with
any of the motion sensors this is an
awesome way to have your lights turn on
automatically whenever you enter a room
speaking of entering the room smart
things also has an HD smart cam which
can also be triggered by the sensors so
you'll know if someone enters a room
they shouldn't and you can peek in on
the surroundings whenever you want with
the app now all of this might seem a bit
overwhelming at first but once you get
past the setup process is well worth it
and would make a pretty nice gift for
dads the hub goes for around 100 bucks
and all the other components are less
than that but you can grab the home
monitoring kit if you want to save a bit
more on some accessories so be sure to
hit up smartthings comm slash your
average consumer if you want to learn
more next up we've got the HyperX cloud
2 gaming headset know somebody
struggling with one of these time to
give them an upgrade the HyperX cloud 2
is a pretty awesome gaming headset with
7.1 virtual surround sound that won't
break the bank compared to some of its
competition it also has a pretty simple
but nice design and comes in a few
colors but I'm rocking the black and red
version which I think looks pretty sick
it has a pretty basic design and isn't
foldable but I don't think that's an
issue considering that this is a gaming
headset it has a solid build quality and
has some really large and soft air cup
cushions and the head then is also very
soft making this extremely comfortable
and when it comes to a gaming headset
that's very important for long gaming
sessions it also comes with a detachable
mic which offers some pretty good flex
and some nice audio quality it has a
thick braided cable that has a normal
3.5 millimeter
but which can be used with any PC ps4
and of course the latest Xbox one
controllers but it also comes with an
additional cable that uses a USB input
which gives you access to headset
controls by game and mic volume the 7.1
surround sound feature as well as a mute
switch on the side this additional cable
can be used for the PC and ps4 but
you'll only get access to 7.1 surround
sound on the PC currently but to be
honest I don't think that's a deal
breaker as 7.1 surround sound is a love
it or hate it kind of feature but even
in stereo mode the sound quality is very
solid and I've used this with all kinds
of game genres from shooters to RPGs and
even racing games and enjoyed my
experience these go for about a hundred
and fifty dollars normally but I've seen
these on Amazon and B&amp;amp;H for a hundred
bucks and at that price these are
absolutely worth it and last up we've
got the Logitech z5o 6 these are
surround sound speakers that I've been
using for at least three years and I
haven't been able to bring myself to
upgrade or swap them out for another
system because they work so well
honestly I just love this thing and I
think it's an amazing value you can find
these for like 60 bucks on Amazon which
is awesome for what you're getting and
it features 5.1 surround sound so you're
working with five different speakers and
a very solid subwoofer these are an
awesome addition to any desk set up or
even if you want to use them with a TV
it comes with a few inputs so you can
use this with a couple of different
sources I have no complaints about sound
whatsoever as these sound great and have
enough power that I barely ever need to
exceed setting my volume past 40% so my
neighbors don't flip out if I had to
call out a flaw with these only thing
I'd say is that it's very cable heavy
but considering these are surround sound
speakers and not Wireless is to be
expected that some of the speakers have
a very long cable so they can be placed
further away from your computer or
television the problem with this though
is that cables on the bottom floor and
then you have to do a bit more work to
conceal them but I wholeheartedly
recommend these if you want to get some
amazing sound without even spending
close to 100 bucks for your computer or
TV but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it and
I've got another gift guide under
bucks coming out soon so stay tuned for
that as well if you enjoy be the cool
guy that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
so then it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
