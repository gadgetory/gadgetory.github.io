consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the erase case for the
iPhone 5 and 5s now this is a pretty
interesting case so hey let's not waste
any time let's get right into it so here
we have the erase case for the iphone 5
and iphone 5s now you might be wondering
why is it called the erase case
well think of it as your personal canvas
or notepad on the back of your iPhone
now let me say this first this is not a
case for protection the case is pretty
thin and doesn't cover enough of the
iPhone to give you that solid protection
you need from impact or anything of the
sort
I've actually dropped my iPhone with
this case and walk away without a single
scratch but this isn't something I would
risk doing again this case is mainly for
the artistic types out there or anyone
who wants to guarantee that they have a
unique iPhone case when you initially
get the case you'll be supplied with a
black marker and a special solution to
clean the case the set will run you
about twenty-five dollars and five more
dollars if you want to get the
additional assortment of colored markers
all main colors are present for your
artistic needs and I think it's a must
to get the colored markers so you can
truly have options when using the case
$30 total is a bit steep for a case that
doesn't offer much protection but for
those of you who want a unique case that
can be changed on a whim will definitely
be able to see the value now on to the
actual case as mentioned before this is
a pretty thin case and it has an all
white glossy design it has all the
standard cutouts for the mute switch
volume buttons and camera that you'd
expect but the top and bottom portion
have little to no covering the idea is
to think of the case as your canvas and
the markers as your brushes it gives you
plenty of room to get creative with the
designs your iPhone will be toting I
would have liked the colors to come out
a bit darker when using it first but a
bit of pressure and using a sketch
fashion to draw the colors get a bit
deeper just a warning guys you don't
want to use markers that aren't made for
the erase case especially sharpies since
those are permanent and we don't want
anything permanent on something called
the erase case do we and now about that
name even though it's called the erase
case your art doesn't simply
once you complete it even with some
light rubbing everything will stay in
place for the most part so if you want
to throw this in your pocket or purse
you don't have to worry about your
artwork rubbing out the markers are even
a bit water resistant so if it gets a
little wet you don't have to worry about
anything getting washed away once you're
done with your art you're able to erase
what's on the case by spraying the
special solution and wiping it down with
a regular paper towel this is the only
real way to clean off the case but if
you really wanted to you could put the
case under running water and really rub
at it to eventually clean it off a word
of caution though if you have sweaty
palms and hold a phone for a while you
could expect to see some sliced Mudge's
either way you use to get the markers
off I suggest doing it while the case
isn't on the phone because as we all
know liquids and tech don't exactly go
together overall I think the concept of
the erase case is pretty nice and it's
great that you can draw anything you
want on it without worrying about your
artwork going away unless you want it to
you can of course go the artsy route or
you can use it to write yourself notes
or reminders even a little small to-do
list as possible I can also imagine this
being pretty cool for younger kids but I
don't know if you want to leave your
phone and a marker with say young one
there are tons of different things you
can do with this case and that's what I
really liked most about it now as I
mentioned guys this is not a case for
anyone who's looking for any kind of
protection for their phone this is
simply for those who want to be artistic
or have a very unique design for their
case there are lots of cool things you
can do with it but let me know down
below in the comments if it's worth your
30 bucks and that's about it for this
