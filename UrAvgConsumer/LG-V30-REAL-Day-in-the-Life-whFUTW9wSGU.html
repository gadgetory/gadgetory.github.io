consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
LGV ferry you're pretty much gonna be
spending a full day with me and the
phone we're gonna be testing out things
like the battery performance those dual
cameras and a ton of other stuff so
let's see how we did all right guys so
we've got the LGV 30 in hand got a
couple things to do today
that son though it is killing me
might as well see if the screen looks
good in direct sunlight because it's
like crazy sunny alright so you guys
probably have no chance of seeing the
screen because of how bright it is but
from what I'm seeing it looks pretty
good that's just like fingerprints all
over hold on give me one second but yeah
the screen brightness is pretty good
it's in direct sunlight I'm able to see
everything that's on my screen with no
problem
this isn't OLED display and I don't know
some people tend to complain that OLED
this place don't get bright enough but
regular everyday use I'm able to see my
screen and direct sunlight with no
problem guys look at our car this thing
is a mess birds got to it so I figured
right now we'll take this thing to the
carwash but this is a good chance to try
out the dual cameras take a couple of
before and after pictures and we'll see
how this thing holds up now what I love
about LG is that they have dual camera
systems in their phones but one of them
is a really wide angle lens so we're
able to get a lot more in the shot so
with a regular lens right now I snap a
picture I didn't get the whole car in
the shot and so instead of having to
move back and try to get the best shot
all I do is hit the little wide-angle
button and I can see the entire thing
with no problem so we went from looking
at this to this
and that shot looks nice quality looks
really good it's a little dark in the
shadowy areas but for the most part it
looks clean I love the flexibility of
having a dual camera system with a
wide-angle lens telephoto I don't really
care for that but wide-angle is the way
to go all right guys so right now we're
trying to find a car wash to take this
car to but we want something that's
highly rated so we're using you know
Google Maps trying to find something
with some good ratings but one thing to
note is right now we've got 92% it's 11
o'clock so we're doing pretty good on
juice Molino took it off the charger at
100 and we're gonna see throughout the
day how long this thing last what kind
of screen on time we get all the good
stuff my baby's in there y'all just can
all cleaned up all right guys so while
the car is getting washed we can talk a
bit more about the design since we
haven't touched on that yet and the v30
looks like a beautiful beautiful phone
it's got the small bezels this is the
year that the bezels kind of go away and
I'm loving it
the v30 looks extremely nice it's very
comfortable to hold in the hand too
unlike the Galaxy s8 it doesn't have a
crazy curve but it does have a slight
curve on the edges which you don't
really notice when you're looking
straight on but if you put your thumb
here you can kind of feel be a curve and
it's not a big deal I actually like this
a bit more than the X and then you
display because all your content is
still right in front of you and you
still get that little edge effect now
something you will notice is that there
is no second display here instead
they've got this little software feature
where you kind of kind of just get
everything you would have gotten with
the second screen now right here so v30
no more second display like the v10 and
b20 alright guys so my baby fire our
baby
ari it's all cleaned up which it looks
good right
yep so now it's time for some active
shots so you can kind of see how much it
cleaned up BAM one
let's check out the back was so bad so
let's see what that whoa
you're looking good Lexi you see them
wheels right there
forty inch rims ounces alright so now we
got to take little cookie monster over
to the groomers we got GPS gun so I was
gonna see how much of an impact it has
on battery alright so eighty-three
percent fifteen minutes on this so we'll
see how it all goes so we finally made
it to the groomers and what are we so we
were driving for about 21 minutes anyway
and we were driving for about 21 minutes
and we lost 5 percent so that's not yeah
too bad so we got 78 percent left and
it's what time it's one that's that
we've been doing pretty solid so far
alright guys so somehow we've ended up
in Walmart so the audio that you're
getting or you're hearing right now is
actually from the V 30 but one thing
that's pretty cool about the
front-facing camera
is that can always go into the
wide-angle mode so you still have access
to that you don't know that's not like a
dual camera system up front you got that
wide-angle lens so you take advantage of
that great for group selfies or
something but yeah this is the kind of
quality you could expect and I'm gonna
try out the rear facing camera as well
maybe go to the tech section so we came
across a little fish tank section with a
ton of props for inside of a tank very
very colorful stuff so it's gotta take
some pictures and see how the camera
captures all of that color just perfect
let's try this out they're a little
submarine over here
let's go a little wide of course oh just
a nuts try to focus on it yeah so much
color this is really vibrant yeah yeah
yeah looks awesome so something I've
noticed is that when you're using the
wide-angle lens the minimum focus
distance is actually kind of far with
the v30
so basically what that means is you
can't get really close to a subject with
the wide-angle lens and expected to be
in focused it'll have to be kind of far
away and that kind of makes sense this
is more so for like landscape shots or
maybe a picture where you're not too
close to someone since you're using the
wide-angle lens so if you want to get
really close to something and get a
detailed shot of it and have it be in
focus you want to use the regular lens
it's not a new picture alright folks
right now you're seeing my husband
acting like a kid in Walmart but this is
the rare camera of the LGP 30 so right
now we're in this stupid hair section
thanks to arey so I figured I'd watch
some anime kind of show off the display
here and I gotta say guys this is the
best screen that LG has come out with
for a phone this thing looks amazing of
course they have the old LED technology
from their TVs and it's not surprising
that they brought it down here to the
phone level but man
it just looks really really good so
content conception on this guy a one so
very real-world situation I got a bunch
of bags in hand so I got my phone in my
pocket over here and it fits just fine
isn't too bad I can move around with no
problem but uh you know it's a big phone
so you curious how it fits in the pocket
fits fine shouldn't be an issue so this
little girl is back she's all done up
perfect time for a selfie camera test I
try to get some cool pictures with her
see how we can make this stuff look good
all right cooks you ready for this one
mama and let's try the wide angle all
wide angles awesome so let's see what we
got here now in terms of the quality
qualities okay nothing too crazy but
once you zoom in I'm not really a big
fan it looks like it falls apart you can
see it gets like a it's not very sharp
this looks kind of weird though to be
honest when you really zoom in so yeah
it's all right
won't win any awards in my book not the
best selfie cam I've ever seen all right
so we're finally back in the studio
still messing around with the phone it's
five twenty six pm
I've got about 36% of battery life and
let's see how much screen on time I've
had so far so so far I've had about
three hours and 19 minutes of screen on
time which and this is thing that this
thing is that full brightness which is
crazy this is pretty decent so far but
that's not what I wanted to talk about I
wanted to talk about how comfortable
this thing is in the hand it's really
nice and easy to hold it's no not an
awkward design nothing to get used to
this thing is just straight-up
traditional but like very 2017 if that
makes sense
and even though I'm using this thing
without a case for this video I probably
would still throw on a case even though
this thing is comfortable in the hand
it's still a thin phone expensive a case
should be on this guy well I guess that
guy this is a very comfortable phone in
the hand
typing not a big deal I like to use
swipe so
you might have a factor into it but
either way two-handed typing one-handed
typing swiping still feels very very
natural something that you don't
typically feel with the really big
phones so we're gonna use HDR and see if
we can get some detail between the dark
and bright areas and let's see how this
works okay and that's actually pretty
good those trees are really dark but you
can still see the clouds in the sky this
is actually a very very nice shot this
is an impressive cameraman so you know
what I respect about LG not only did
they make sure to keep the headphone
jack but these guys with the V series
that they have they also have this high
5 quad DAC so 32 bit DAC and it sounds
amazing what it does is it basically
amps up the power for your headphones so
you get better sound quality so instead
of ignoring the headphone jack these
guys made it even better for people who
want to use the headphone and listen to
music on their phone which is awesome
this the opposite what if a lot of
companies are doing right now and it's
just great to see LG focus on that as a
headphone lover I can definitely
definitely appreciate it alright guys so
it's like 10 o'clock
I've got about 8% of battery left it
lasted throughout the whole day which is
really good
4 hours and 20 minutes of screen on time
which is still really awesome that
sounds pretty average but this has been
a maximum brightness and I used to GPS
so much today just driving around a
bunch of different places so this is
really good battery life in my opinion
and that was pretty much my day now I've
had this phone for well over a week so I
was able to test it quite a bit more
than what you guys saw in today's video
this is a pre-production unit so things
might be different when it comes to the
final product but really quickly here my
main takeaways from that vibrant OLED
display - the emphasis on listening to
music with headphones I think this is a
fantastic phone I love that it's large
but not too large so even with one
handed use it's still comfortable and
this thing just performs like a 2017
flagship phone should
everyday tasks it can handle with no
problem and hey we cannot forget about
that rear camera the rear camera quality
was very solid photos were vibrant and
sharp and even in low-light situations
that handled it really well and I love
that LG opted for a wide-angle lens
instead of a telephoto lens I feel like
it's more versatile that way unless
you're looking for those portrait mode
features that you can find on the iPhone
7 plus I just think that the wide-angle
lens is a better option my only real
disappointment with the phone has to be
that five megapixel front facing camera
I feel like the shots that I got from it
lacked a lot of detail and often came
out very soft and this might not be a
big deal to a lot of people I don't know
how important selfie canons are to
everyone but for me when you're
comparing this to another high-end
flagship device like to know eight or
the seven plus you're gonna notice that
that front-facing camera is a bit weaker
but even still the LG v 30 is LG's most
powerful phone yet with very few
sacrifices and a ton of features that we
come to expect nowadays I'm talking
wireless charging expandable storage
water-resistant quick charge 3.0 a
fingerprint scanner and it's hun more
there's even facial recognition which is
a bit slow but you know it's a good
start but either way this has been a
really good year for LG the g6 did
pretty well that's a great phone and now
that'd be 30 which is I think gonna be
blowing away a lot of people's minds so
very good trail G hats off to you you
did great but yeah guys hopefully you
enjoyed this video if you did be the
cool guy girl that gives the video a
thumbs up let me know if you're
interested in the V 30 down below and
I'll catch you guys in the next one so
then it's your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
