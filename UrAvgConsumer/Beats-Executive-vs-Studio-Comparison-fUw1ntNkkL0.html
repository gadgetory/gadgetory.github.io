consumer and today I'm gonna be finally
doing the comparison between the beats
executive and the beat Studios so let's
not wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys inside here we have the
beats executive and of course in here we
have the beats studios now I'd like to
talk about the cases because these are
bigger headphones and knowing how you're
gonna carry them is always a big factor
the executives have this flat
rectangular design for their case which
is pretty nice and easy for storage
stowing it in a bag throwing in a
briefcase anything like that this is
really nice and easy to store whereas
the studios is a little bigger and it's
um it's not as easy to put away in a bag
or anything but it does have this clip
so you can you know attach it to your
straps or something like that
so whatever you want to attach this to
this does have the option to be attached
to something that's pretty nice with the
studios
they're both heartfelt cases so they're
offered good protection for your own
your headphones so there's no where you
stand but I do have my gripes with the
executives I'm not too happy with the
fact that when you open them up there's
nowhere for your cable to go it's just
kind of loose inside of here and it's
also an awkward positioning to get the
headphones in there you gotta have it in
this way there's a diagram that shows
you how to put in the headphones but
it's just weird and awkward to have it
like this rather than the standard for
the standard way that's just folded up
like this whereas the studios it's
pretty simple to to have them like this
you just close them up and you want to
put them away so it's very fast to store
these you just fold them up and I do
like the fact that this has a pouch that
holds your cables so this is definitely
a bonus so you kind of lose that speed
factor for a sleeker design here with
the executives but overall they're both
nice cases aesthetically I think the
executives look better but functionality
wise I would go with the studio's case
but those are just the case
those are just my little opinions about
them let's get these out the way and
actually start talking about these
headphones in all right guys here we
have the stars of the show the beats
executive and the beat studios now these
are very similar headphones they're in
the same price range they both cost
three hundred dollars and they have a
lot of the same features the that both
they both have active noise-cancelling
they both require bat triple-a batteries
to triple-a batteries at that and that's
probably one of my biggest gripes with
these headphones is that they require
triple-a batteries I'm not a big fan of
the studios for that reason I don't like
the fact that you need the triple-a
batteries in order for it to operate
without it it's not going to play any
music when the batteries start dying the
music starts sounding a little worse
than normal so I'm not a fan of that I
don't know why they adopted that with
the executives after all this time I
think that they could have moved away
from needing the batteries to work the
beats Wireless which are one of my
favorite beats headphones they can they
can be charged they have rechargeable
batteries and when that battery dies
it'll still play music as long as the
cable is plugged in so I'm not too sure
why they went the same route as two
studios it seems more of a like a
setback than anything so I'm not sure
why they did that with the executives
but that is one of the things they have
in common if they do have the batteries
also on the beats studios you have this
door here that you kind of have to twist
to to get the to get access to the
batteries and as you can see how that
just popped out it is possible for you
to lose this little piece when I'm you
know taking out the batteries or putting
in new ones and it's just a little hard
to open so I am happy that with the
executives they did kind of change that
with the executives you do have the
ability to just pull a latch and have
access to your batteries it also has
this little string that
Nexxus so that you won't go losing this
piece also you don't have to twist it
anymore as these are just magnets and
you can go like this and it sticks right
on so that's pretty cool at least they'd
that they improved on that feature of
the executives compared to the sole on
the studios also um they both have new
buttons for when you're listening to
your music impress mute and kind of
listen to someone talking to you or for
whatever reason you'd need to press the
mute button it's cool that they both
offer that also their power buttons they
both like I said they both require the
power switch to be used in order to UM
use the headphones and I do like that
they improve this on the executives
compared to the studio's the executives
it's very easy to just push your finger
on the switch and turn them on and push
it back it's very very easy to use you
can just go back and forth but the
studio's it's a little harder the switch
isn't as raised as the executives so you
kind of have to use your the front of
your finger a bit or your nail to kind
of get that going and it's on the side
of the headphones instead of the top so
it's just a little harder to access but
it's not a deal breaker or anything but
it is easier to just turn these on and
off on the executives compared to the
studios and that's about it for matching
features just the executives also have
the ability to swivel their ear cups
like this they can go backwards these
are the back and they can't go forward
but they can do this so that's pretty
cool now on to the noise cancelling of
these headphones you know noise
canceling is a pretty cool feature I'm a
fan of it I know a lot of people are in
fact bat enthusiastic about noise
cancelling but I actually like it and
it's never been a bother to me but I'm
very disappointed with how the
executives execute their noise
cancelling it's a very loud hiss when
you're when you have your head
zon and normally that's not a problem
once I start listening to my music you
know I don't hear any kind of hiss
so it's no big deal but with the
executives sometimes that loud hiss can
carry over to your music now over time
I'm sure you'll get used you can get
used to that and it's not a problem but
it just sucks knowing that you know
you're listening to your music and
sometimes you hear that so it's a little
disappointing there whereas the studios
if you thought that the hiss was loud on
this it's a lot worse on this the
executives so that's probably my number
one gripe with the executives as well as
needing batteries those two things the
fact that it has such a loud hiss and
the fact that it uses batteries but
since they both use batteries that's not
a pro or con compared to one another and
that about wraps up the differences in
the features and you know all the
features that they do share now let's
talk a bit about the build quality the
so the studios are made of a plastic but
they do feel kind of sturdy and as you
can see you can stretch them out a bit
if you need to if you have a big head or
anything like that it'll fit almost
anyone so that's not really a concern
but I know some people are always always
scared of their studios or solo HDS
whatever their beads from they're always
scared of a snapping because this is
plastic so people tend to have that fear
the beats usually don't snap not the new
ones anyway with them you know they have
reinforced bands and whatnot so that's
not really an issue so much anymore
but some people still get concerned
about that and one of the executives
they're made out of an aluminum material
and it's got a really nice feel to it
they feel sturdy
there's gotten they've got some nice
heft to them and it's just a really nice
feel I'm I'm really happy with how these
um these feel in the hand they do feel
like a premium product I can't say much
more about it I am pleased with the
build quality of this they feel sturdy
I don't feel these breaking anytime soon
the hinges seems strong so that's
definitely a good thing and the band
isn't made of plastic or anything so you
can't you don't really have to worry
about it snapping anything like that
this can also stretch pretty wide
depending on the size of your head so
this fits all
it's got great durability so the
executives easily win in the department
of durability and just having a premium
feel to them so I do like the build
quality of the executives more and the
design I must say I got to give it to
the executives in that department as
well because I think these are some
really sleek looking headphones now I'm
everyone knows I'm a big beats fan and I
like the fact I like the way the
studio's look and I'm not a fan of
having big headphones but these are both
pretty similar in size so there's no
losing any points here the action
actually the studios have like a bigger
a bigger ring I guess you could say
that's made from the headband whereas
the suit seems a bit more weight
executives they seem a bit more slim but
they both you know they both pretty much
the same size so there's no pluses or
minuses there but I do like the design
of the executives a bit more I think it
looks classier I I don't know the red B
it's weird that this doesn't have it but
it goes well with the design the B is
still affair so it still looks good but
it's just some it's interesting that
they didn't put the red B especially
when they do include our red cable
there's no black or gray cable with the
executives so that kind of throws the
whole look off a bit where is this you
know the studios they had it has a red B
so the red cable matches so that's one
one little gripe I have with the
executives the studios do come with a
black cable so I'm not sure why they
wouldn't include that with these so
durability and and design I'm giving it
to the executives now in comfort they're
both very
very comfortable the executives have a
very nice and soft cushion and the
studios do as well they're both very
very comfortable but I do find it easier
to UM to adapt to the executives field
than it is the studios the studios have
a very a very thin opening for the ears
as you can see this is an oval shape so
it's a very thin opening but this does
get your ear in completely and securely
so your ears will feel very secure on
these and that's pretty cool too but I
can imagine someone someone's ear
sweating more with the studio's than the
executives because of that now it's it's
a nice comforting feel it's um very it
feels very secure where this is a you
know a bit looser as they do have um
wider circles but I do think that the
executives are a bit more comfortable
because it's not such a tight feel
around the ears but that is because
these are more comfortable doesn't mean
that these aren't comfortable these are
still very comfortable but I do like the
the comfort of the executives
now we've spoken about the hardware of
these headphones two features to feel
all that good stuff now of course we got
to talk about the sound quality the
sound quality between the two are quite
a bit different actually the executives
are a lot more toned down than the beat
the beat Studios the executives have
less bass and they're not as loud but
what that also means is that they don't
leak sound nearly as badly as the um the
studio's do the studios are notorious
for leaking sound it's you know if you
if you simply don't care about sound
leakage you don't care if someone next
to you here's your music then you know
that you have no issues with the sound
quality that's fine but I know a lot of
people take that into consideration and
the studios just are really really bad
when it comes to that department where
the executives don't really have that
issue at all but I must say that the
studios do
sound a bit louder and they do offer a
lot more bass now this can be a good
thing or a bad thing me as a bass head I
am a huge fan of how much bass the
studios have some people feel I know a
lot of people feel that the studios bass
is too strong and it can drown out some
of the other stuff and where's the
executives there's not as much bass so
you'll probably have a more complete
feel for all your music guys you'll
probably feel like you hear hearing more
and it's not all drowned out by such
heavy bass now this doesn't mean that
this lacks bass this does have some good
bass on it but I must say that the
studios have superior bass and um I just
think that the students are relaxed are
a bit clearer as far as um sound goes
it's because it's a bit louder so you
know you do hear more with the studio's
than you do with the executives but I
think the approach that they're going
with the executives is you know that
classy you know adult look and you know
the typically adults are concerned about
bothering others like let's say if
you're an executive you're on a plane
you're on a bus or something and you
know you're traveling you don't want
your headphones to be bothering the
person next to you where that's
definitely going to be an issue with the
studios so that's something that I think
they've probably done on purpose where
they toned it down a bit and try to step
away from that really loud booming sound
quality that the studios have so it's
really pick and choose you know as an
average consumer I must say these both
sound really great to me I like I said I
do favor the studios because it does
have more bass it's a little louder but
if I were to go outside I'd probably be
going with the executives more so than
the studios because I don't want to
bother anyone with loud music or
anything like that and so sound leakage
is definitely a concern for me and the
studios they did support in that
department for me to really feel
comfortable on a on being a public
transportation or a plane or something
like that so I would go with the studio
I'm the executives
when leaving the house and pretty much
