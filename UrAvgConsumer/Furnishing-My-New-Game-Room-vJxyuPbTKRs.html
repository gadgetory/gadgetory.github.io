consumer and right now I'm standing in
the ultimate gamers paradise but as you
can tell it is pretty empty in here but
today we're gonna talk about how I'm
gonna set this whole thing up I'm gonna
homeschool that's the sponsor today's
video I'm not gonna lie guys when I got
the call I was pretty hyped because as
you can see I kinda need some furniture
in here so we're gonna be using the
Amazon app to pick up everything that we
need to set here up now obviously we
need a dope sofa over here something
that's really comfortable so while
you're gaming you're able to be
comfortable and relaxed and I've been
looking at this guy I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna go for it but there's this cool
feature where you can view it in your
room and it uses augmented reality look
at this place it right here boom this is
the sofa and I can turn it around
position it where exactly where I want
to put it but what's nice about this is
that the feature is already in the
Amazon app I feel like everybody's got
the Amazon app and if you just look for
furniture you'll be able to find this
feature there so nothing you need to add
or download it's all built into the app
this chairs though not behind not in
front of YouTube plaque gotta keep that
yeah I like this but of course I got to
show you guys the upstairs alright and
here we have it it is a pretty much of a
mess over here lots and lots of the
Gundams I finally brought them over but
this is gonna be a cool space I think I
definitely see some kind of PC setup
happening over here something's got to
happen over here because when you're
able to look over like this I feel like
you should be kind of close to that I
guess we just have to pick the furniture
now Amazon even has a discover feature
on their site which is really cool if
you have like a theme that you want to
go with let's say I wanted to do more of
these that is awesome
okay now this I like I think that would
look really good right here with a TV
above it and probably not sitting
I would probably mount it alright so we
got our TV stand so we've been doing
this for a little while now we're
probably not gonna finish picking out
everything that we need to in one
sitting so I'll probably sit on this for
a little bit kind of start planning
upstairs in that room but it's gonna
take a little bit for us to make our
decision
alright guys so it is day two we have a
few cool packages over here these aren't
gonna require like crazy assembly and
these are actually really cool so let's
unbox them see what kills me is when
they say don't use a knife but it's like
see the trick is to do a small cut and
then just pull the rest apart yeah that
teal chair for you
got a nice little accent chair this is
the one I showed off with the AR oh this
is nice
this is this fits perfectly with what
we've got going on in here so far next
now this should be a really cool lamp
and this is going to look awesome in
here I can tell already
alright I'll show you guys the final
look just the last part is to just plug
it in then we should have light BAM oh
this is gonna be fun nice and you can
pick the level you want oh that's what's
up
it is getting late so we are probably
gonna call it a day I think we made some
really good progress and tomorrow we're
going to finalize what this place is
going to look like before we start
adding the tech so it's day three and I
think we finally nailed the layout of
the new ultimate gamers paradise and I
gotta say guys I am loving what we've
got going on so far and I like the TV
stand that we've got over here actually
this thing is pretty cool I like the
look and it also has like USB ports
built into it and what I'm really love
is the seating I love how comfortable
these chairs are I got these little
accent pillows in peel because you know
that's how we do it here and we even got
this dope teal accent chair over here
which is also very nice and comfortable
and in the back of us we've got a nice
desk area over here is where we're gonna
do some of the more PC based actions so
we got a gaming chair over here we've
got this nice desk and this is like a
rising death so if you want to stand you
can stand here or if you want to sit you
can do all that and we got the dope LED
lamp over there and we even have like a
little bookshelf that matches the TV
stand and I got my 1 million subscriber
plaque up there to represent we still
need to put the tech inside of this
place but everything that I did mention
all of the cool furniture accent pieces
everything that I got I'll have a link
down below in the description so you
guys can go ahead and check it out if
you're interested but one thing I do
recommend guys if you are looking for
furniture definitely check out Amazon
and use those tools that I mentioned it
actually helps a lot in the purchasing
process but hopefully you guys enjoyed
it if you did be the cool guy girl that
gives video thumbs up and definitely
stay tuned to the official ultimate
gamers paradise video 3.0 til then is
your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
