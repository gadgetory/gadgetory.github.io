consumer and you might remember this guy
this is my dad I'm back YouTube no today
we're going to be checking out the
Jitterbug smartphone and huge shot it's
a great call for sponsoring today's
video and sending us a couple of these
to check out now you probably never
heard of the jitterbug but that's
probably because it's geared towards
people with a few years of life
experience under their belt
a macho mom I'm being nice that yeah now
how my dad trying to have smart phones
use one of these for a while
welcome to the reviewer life so that you
guys can get a better insight into what
it's actually like for someone who this
phone is geared towards rather than
someone like me to tell you it's a good
phone
just get it for your grandparents he can
actually tell you if it's good or not so
that what do you like about this first
thing you like the first thing is the
big numbers mmm big letters and the
simplicity of it and you see I don't
even use my glasses
yeah yeah that's dad so that's one of
the advantages here folks this is a
simple menu
it has about what six items here well
seven though we'll get into the last one
later even though this has a super
simple layout it's still a smart phone
and it runs Android marshmallow so all
you have to do is hit all apps and you
get access to things like Google Chrome
so you got a browser YouTube is on here
and you even got the Play Store so you
can go ahead and download more apps so
even though it's simple you don't have
to feel like you're giving your dad or
granddad a dummy phone this phone is
still a smart phone and still has all
those apps that you're gonna want just
in a much simpler layout now that'd be
real simple menu like this did you find
anything seriously missing here No
because I wasn't going to send you
messages I have my camera
and I have my photo album or I put all
of you there to look at you when I build
that right there yeah
when I need to and then email and then I
have games in when I'm bored and I can
you know play with and what's cooler
than that I have something get something
here called five stars I ready true
believe me that would be really really
useful for somebody like me yeah this is
the seventh menu item that I was talking
about earlier with the five star button
you can actually get access to a highly
trained agent who can help you out in
any emergency something happens to
grandma and she has to press the five
star button so you can get in contact
with an agent who can get in touch with
an ambulance or doctors nurses and they
can even share medical history medical
information in case grandma can't talk
at the moment but what's also cool is
that you get this app called med coach
which sends from the reminders about
taking prescriptions so if they tend to
forget to take certain pills they can
get reminders with this which is I think
a nice little bonus
all right we joked around the bit but my
dad isn't quite grandma five star status
yet but who do you see that could
actually use some of these features
actually my uncle who 78 years old and
live alone has it that way if I knew he
has one of this I would be assured that
it will get the help he needs before I
can get to yeah I mean it just gives you
that extra layer of what see exactly all
right that so favorite feature go even
doing house on big letters I have no
problem you know sing but the best thing
I bought it is the voice typing I will
just talk and then you'll type out the
message and then all that I do is press
ENTER at this end but listen this guy is
really my dad because you guys know I
love voice integration I love using my
voice you know the room you know the
room I use voices all the time to
activate my devices so I'm right I'm
right there with you on that
now for the jitterbug great call
actually has a few different plans based
on how much the person will use the
phone but luckily it starts as low as 17
around 1749 a month foot
17:49 or online yeah right cheap is
always good though you don't have to
give shout out a few hundred bucks for a
crazy smartphone where you know they're
not going to use all the features this
gives them all the essentials plus
whatever more they need from the app
store but that about wraps up guys
hopefully you enjoyed it huge shout out
to this man for coming on board again
and you saw that's a great call for
sponsoring today's video and we'll catch
you in the next one peace I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
