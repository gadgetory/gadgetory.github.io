want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone is your average consumer today
I'm gonna have a quick review for you
guys on the Asus Transformer Prime
alright let's not waste any time let's
get right into it all right first things
first let's talk about the hardware this
comes with a 10.1 inch display it has a
resolution of 1280 by 800 and it's I PS
Plus which is really good for reading
outdoors or like if you just like to
have really high brightness also it
features a 1.2 megapixel front facing
camera and an 8 megapixel back camera
what comes also with flash and autofocus
the quality of the pictures are there
all right for a tablet um of course it
won't be at a normal camera but it's
probably one of the best timbers I've
seen on a tablet so far aside from the
new iPad also around the tablet has a
proprietary Jack here for its USB and
here i remember in my unboxing i wasn't
sure what these wear these were filled
by some rubber pieces but this is
actually for the doc extension and this
is where it locks it into place here you
have expandable memory slot for micro
sd's and you have your hdmi out and your
volume rocker your power button and your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack um and
also your mic is also right next to your
microSD slot one thing I wasn't too
particularly fond of was the buttons on
the Prime itself found them a little
hard to press sometimes especially
coming from the front it can be a little
tough and while I might be used to iPad
to a bit as it you know protrudes a
little and makes it easier to press
where as far as this one it's pretty
much blocked by the front screen
and yet to really come around to get a
good feel on the button itself and not
so much for the value but I've I know
I'm reused to die pad to wear about the
buttons come out a bit more and it's
just easier to press another little
issue i had was on with a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack it just felt a little
weird that my headphones didn't ever
seem to really go inside all the way as
an example i'll show you guys these are
some beats tours if i connect it it
stays right there but you see how easily
it slides out it's as if it never really
got in there and it'll show up as you
know a headphones plugged in when you
turn it on as you can see it says the
auto audio jack connected but it comes
out very easily and it never really
feels secure when you first put it in so
you don't know if you have to like push
a little more or what but those are
don't like that was only a shot found
with that it still works fine but it was
just long a little problem I've had with
it this isn't any heavier than the ipad
2 it feels it you honestly won't be able
to tell a difference guys I think
statists like you know staff like that
don't really matter because unless it's
just really heavy you won't tell people
who say all this is heavier than the
ipad 2 or this is lighter than the app
and you really won't ever notice that I
I assure you as a regular you know
everyday person you won't feel that
difference the IPS plus display is great
on this my brightness is about half way
without is PS Plus turned on look at the
difference between this and when I put
the volume the brightness all the way up
that's her an IPS plus on you see a huge
difference so this is made for outdoor
you know for outdoor use and really I I
just love it all all the time indoors
outdoors it won't matter I love I PS
Plus and I always have my brightness at
the max it does take a hampering on the
battery but I don't know it charges
quickly enough for me not to worry about
that also the battery life
lasts about 12 hours without the dock
with the dockets it goes up to about 18
it charges relatively quickly armed with
the IPS plus it does I can definitely
tell you that it drains quicker than one
would want so you know use that feature
at your discretion I honestly don't mind
charging my products you know frequently
throughout the day so I go ahead and put
it all the way up I'm I used them a lot
when I'm home and when I'm outside
they'll usually lasts more than enough
time for me to not feel a problem with
it well when i purchased this this
already had ice cream sandwich on it so
you get all the neat features from there
there's really fast this thing is really
responsive the only time I honestly felt
a bit of a lag or is the browser now I
don't know if that is because I the
Wi-Fi know this has Wi-Fi issues where
you know Wi-Fi connection isn't the
greatest because of the back panel being
completely ma'am aluminum but I don't
know the browser didn't seem like the
quickest to me I've definitely had
faster experience on the iPad this does
have flash though so that definitely
Trump's the ipad so yeah it's pretty
snappy on the quad core processor makes
it really great um I've experienced no
real lag Assad aside from using the
browser my overall experience with the
transform prime um by itself it didn't
really wow me coming from the ipad 2 you
know certain things you know we're
grateful being able to use flash be
improvement on the the camera was nice
but it didn't really sell me until i
actually got a hold of the doc for it
and that's really what changed
everything for me here i have the doc
and when you connect it it really does
enhance your experience with the
transformer prime by leaps and nones
it's really great
as you see I just connected it you just
heard the sound and what's great about
this is it increases the battery life of
the transformer prime as well as you
know makes a it adds a cursor and really
transforms us into a netbook now the
keyboard is pretty small on the dock
itself I don't feel I have big hands but
even I found it a little cramp when
using it also the touchpad isn't as
responsive as i would like but i'm sure
since this is like one of the first of
its kind that you know that will improve
with time the less I button access like
you know you're a regular clicker and
then the right side acts as a back
button and you can change the options
inside your settings no problem um one
issue I've had is when typing but
suddenly when usually you keep your hand
your thumbs like this and as you can see
just by putting my hand there I was
changing the the screams because if my
thumb's can't help but touch the
touchpad that becomes very annoying
after a while because you're typing
something and all of a sudden you see
I'm not even trying to replicate the
issue but it's just doing it on its own
so if i would type something and then
you know either screen would just change
or would select something else which
became quite annoying for me a great
thing about the doc is that the battery
life also increases from your standard
12 hours with the tablet alone to 18
hours and when charging it it charges
the tablet first and then the doc so its
primary focuses on the battery life of
the tablet itself from you know in case
you don't use this you won't have been
wasting your time charging the doc also
it drains when batteries being used it
takes from the doc first and then the
tablet itself which is great it seems
like asa start of everything when it
comes to you know making the user happy
because something like that is just
wonderful i think that this is a gray
experience you
be transformer prime and the doc
together is the size of it changes no it
gets it gets a bit hefty especially
around the connecting part but it's
still a great experience I really like
it it feels great this actually feels
like a netbook overall this is a great
it has a great feel it's um a little
hefty at the part where it connects but
you know what can what do you expect you
know but it feels exactly like in that
book once it's like once it's in the doc
you can't help but look at it as in that
book rather than a tablet it becomes
just the end it becomes an Android
netbook and issues did a really good job
at making the you know the experience as
much as the netbook as possible and that
pretty much covers it guys um if you
have any more questions feel free to let
me know I don't know if it is i covered
everything but i think i did cover all
the points that I wanted to coming in so
if you have any questions feel free to
ask them and i'll be sure to get back to
you please feel free to rate comment
subscribe ask me any questions I'll be
happy to answer them and just stay tuned
for my other videos alright I really
appreciate you guys watching this is
