what's going on guys it's ravage
consumer and as you can see here we've
got all the parts to build our very own
PC this isn't gonna be my first attempt
at doing this some let alone I got my
buddy Austin Evans on video over here
and I got somebody on standby just in
case but uh I'm gonna be attempting this
whole thing by myself let's get started
and I know a lot of you guys wanted me
to record my experience and kind of let
you know how it went and of course I did
that but honestly a lot of it was me
watching my buddy Austin's videos as
well as me reading a ton of manuals and
it was a pretty standard process but
there were a few bumps in the road okay
so I got the CPU I got the hard drive
alright guys so unfortunately looks like
I bent depends on my motherboard so that
kind of sucks I'm gonna have to I'm
gonna have to replace this guy ah well
that's it for today so there's been a
hiccup with this and we're back in micro
centers trying to yeah remedy dis okay
guys so we've got some new developments
last night I've had to run over to Micro
Center to see if I could pick up a new
motherboard because I thought all the
pins were bent turns out it was actually
an issue with the processor so as you
can see here I've got two I nine
processors in front of me well
technically I only have one what was
actually inside of the box of this guy
was some Intel Xeon processor with a
quad quad core processor it was an older
processor that had no business inside of
this box but thankfully Micra Center had
a processor for me to get it's all good
got some good stuff right here I don't
know how that makes up happen but I know
I'm getting my money back and after that
guys there was way more manual reading I
just wanted to take everything slow and
make sure I did everything by the book
okay guys so after hours of trying to
make these corsair cables work with this
EVGA PSU turns out I should just use the
cables that came with the PSU in the
first place
but hours of trying to do some little
cable management just gone to waste so
now all these white cables gotta go
bye-bye
good times and I think my overall
experience building the whole thing
really wasn't that bad so getting over
that hump of building it got to the
exciting part which was actually turning
it on now let's turn it all the way on
let's see how it goes we got power
first impressions there's a lot of color
going on here but all of these are going
to be able to be changed when I get it
all set up and the software installed so
I'm gonna be able to control the
lighting which is gonna be awesome
okay this is even crazier you know
massive GPUs and they're hiding the
beautiful motherboard so we gotta get
some we gotta get a 2.0 going already I
feel it but now I think it's time we
check out what I put together
now in terms of a part list I decided to
go with the Corsair crystal m5 70 X case
and a soos rampage 6 extreme motherboard
and let me tell you guys that thing is
beautiful I also want an Intel Core i 9
processor with 16 cores 128 gigs of
g.skill tridon z r gb ram and - a su
Strix version of the GT X 1080 T ice in
sli and yes I know SLI is not that
popular anymore but I can't help but do
it but I'm not gonna lie I am a little
bit upset by how big they are they take
out way more room on the motherboard and
they pretty much hide the motherboards
beauty which is a bit upsetting and
that's why we're getting a 2.0 version
sometime soon with water cooling and of
course I had to get some RGB strips
because I love me some RGB lights even
though I probably complicated my build a
bit more than I would have liked for my
first time by myself but overall it
wasn't so bad and I even went for a
liquid cooler for my CPU with the Kraken
X 72 by NZXT and I even changed out the
fans for some fans by Corsair with RGB
lights so I can control the colors of
the entire system and of course there
are other parts that make up the build
and I'll have a complete list and links
to everything
in the description now you can call me a
noob if you want that I've been super
real with you guys about my entire
experience I'm not gonna sit here and
act like everything came out super
peachy because there are some issues
that I am currently working through like
figuring out why all my ram isn't being
detected by the system and even why I'm
getting super slow boot times much
slower than I am used to with any of my
other machines but even though I've got
those current issues to work through
this thing is still no slouch I'm still
able to gain with pretty much max
settings and even use some more work
base software like Adobe Premiere or
After Effects since one of the guys on
our team uses that and of course not got
my fancy new machine that can handle all
these things I gotta make sure it's
protected and so of course I had to
download BitDefender total security 2018
and the security suite has a ton of
features to protect your Android iOS Mac
or PC from hackers and like I mentioned
in my last video about keeping your
devices safe I love having this on here
because it protects me from ransomware
so I don't have to worry about my files
being taken by hackers and I can also
get that webcam protection so that again
hackers can't access it and I stay
protected and if you're the type that
tends to connect to a ton of public
Wi-Fi networks like coffee shops or
airports this is gonna be great because
it can also scan the connection to make
sure that you're safe and with their
safe pay feature you can jump into their
built-in browser so you can shop online
as much as you want without worrying
about risking your financial information
and bit the feather is actually a great
tool for parents if you want to monitor
your kids activities even if you aren't
home you can check it right from your
smartphone which is a really cool plus
and what's great is that it does all
this in the background so you can go
ahead and browse and do your thing
uninterrupted and if you're in a user
you definitely want to check the links
down below in the description because
right now but defender is giving away
six free months to new users which is
great because they're an award-winning
software company for its protection and
performance and again if you chop it's a
bit defended for sponsoring today's
video make sure you guys check out the
link down below so you can get your free
six months so you can get protection
from ransomware safely use public Wi-Fi
networks and a lot more but like I said
guys this PC does still have those
issues that I need to sort out and I'm
already thinking about upgrades and
changing some parts because there are a
few things that I'm not too crazy about
and honestly this makes me pretty happy
that I built this rig by myself this can
be my personal pet project
I see this as an evolution this thing is
going to continue to grow as I make
different tweaks and changes and all
kinds of stuff so I'm pretty excited
that I took it into my own hands
so personally for me I'm gonna continue
to call it by its code name which is
leaked where Eric took shots at me for
this not being as good as my other pcs
but either way once it does get as good
as those I'm going to start calling it
by typhoon and we'll see when that
happens but hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video
you guys got to sit there with me and
see my struggles and you know just how
this PC experience went if you enjoyed
it be the cool guy or girl that gives
this video a thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next one till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
