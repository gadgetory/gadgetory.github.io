and if you watch some of my recent
videos you might have seen that I was at
the LA Auto Show
and I was actually out there with Ford
since they decided to sponsor today's
video and then we check out some of the
new features in their new 2017 lineups
as well let's try on a new little
challenge we're calling this the no
hands parking challenge so check out how
it did alright guys right now we're at
the LA Auto Show with Ford we're in
their booth right now and we're checking
out some of the new cars and features
that they're bringing to the new lineup
so come check this out so Aries been
messing with this screen for the whole
time that we've been here so right now
they kind of list all the cool new
features so we're talking an active Park
Assist blind spot information system
adaptive cruise control which I really
like that's like one of our favorites
right I mean my favorite active Park
Assist well I like adaptive cruise
control lane keep assist and cross
traffic alert great so let's take a look
at the progress assistant when I'm most
excited for because whenever I go to
Manhattan which is not very frequent but
when I do go I get really really really
nervous about parking in those streets
because people are so impatient in
Manhattan take a look at me in this car
look at this cool uh monitor guys it can
actually spin and rotate feels like a
touchscreen we have these sensors see
what's around it and they allow the car
to park in such a way where you don't
hit anything and it's seamless alright
guys so right now we're back home if you
couldn't tell
ours over here freezing yeah I can go
and we got the coats on but we finally
got our hands on the Ford Fusion so here
it is this is what we're going to be
using for the no hand parking challenge
but we're going to explain it inside the
car because it's cold alright guys so
let's explain this parking towns three
different parking scenarios a parking
garage what you're in right now a
parking lot and parallel parking in New
York City Manhattan this is absolutely
terrible yeah remember how I said last
time it makes me anxious so I'm really
excited to see how that's gonna work out
and the feature we're going to be using
here is called Park Assist and all you
got to do to activate that is press the
single button drive along wherever you
want to park the car will detect the
parking spot once it finds one and then
it'll tell you how to go on from there
and we're gonna get this started right
here in the parking garage it's going to
be our first parking challenge this spot
that we have in this parking garage is
actually really really difficult to park
himself I'm curious to see how this car
is going to handle it and now that we
are in the general vicinity we're going
to activate Park Assist and he's
switching over to perpendicular part
because that's kind of I found the
parking spot already because that's kind
of park we want to do not parallel once
he finds the park at Elson what to do so
right now I just got by for now wants me
to stop release the steering you know
hands go in reverse and just kind of
follow the instructions it'll tell you
to back up prepare to stop doing all the
adjusting by itself
look at that wheel go there we go put it
in drive that will is crazy it's like
the car has a mind of its own
right oh my god okay
I think it's doing a better job in Yuja
so sweet and cakewalk oh so cool
dang it killed so garage parking it
passed the challenge sir alright let's
see how it does with the parallel park
so we've done the impossible we have
found a spot in Manhattan look at all
these yellow cabs in Manhattan to park
so we are going I'm gonna step off the
car and you're gonna let this thing do
its job huh yeah after all these cars at
this point the car has detected a spot
which is why the reverse is on and at
this point he should be doing this with
no hands at all
showoff no hands
it's shooting itself up nice job you did
it with no hands so now we're in a
parking lot
and we're going to try and do this
parking thing again so instead of
parallel park we're going to go
perpendicular and let's see how this
goes all right so I see a spot right
there let's see if the car detects it
though and it does all right drive
forward and this feature will reverse us
into the parking spots since most people
can pull in forward so we want to stop
okay
so put in Reverse and this with a magic
happen go car okay stop put it in Drive
see this of you
but in Reverse all right
so detects this little cart behind them
nice it's a dry one more time and boom
done yeah yeah simple enough I stopped
parking lot parking challenges good to
go
ohm got it and that's about it guys the
Ford Fusion actually killed those
parking challenges it did really well
and just seeing that wheel go is pretty
insane but hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video if you did be the cool guy
girl that gives it a thumbs up and we'll
catch you in the next one so then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
