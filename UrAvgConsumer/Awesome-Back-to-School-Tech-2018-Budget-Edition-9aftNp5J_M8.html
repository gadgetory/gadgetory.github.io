consumer right and it's that time of
year it's time for back-to-school I know
some of you are upset but at least we
got some cool tech to take a look at
this is the budget edition I know
students are broke I get it you got to
get the inexpensive stuff student life
is rough so here we have the budget
edition of back school attack so first
up we're gonna talk about the backpack
and this is probably one of the most
essential pieces of gear that you need
for back-to-school and this is by your
Peck I actually really really like this
bag it's a pretty big bag with a
ridiculous amount of compartments and
it's also got some really cool features
things we've seen in the past but this
thing does a really good job and it
comes in at only 50 bucks so it's not
gonna break the bank 50 bucks shouldn't
be too bad and if that is too bad I'll
of course link some of my favorites that
cost even less than that but let's take
a look at the bag so here we have it now
up front here and now the first thing we
gotta have a microfiber cloth you got
all your tech it gets dirty your phone
you put it to your face your camera
smudges and then you take blurry photos
we got to have a good microfiber cloth
so we gotta have the spuds microfiber
cloth this is like my favorite of all
time gotta have this so that's a great
way to start this video except we've got
a little small flash drive this is by
Kingston now I've shown this in the past
but I feel like it hasn't been more
relevant than it is today so this is a
how big is this 64 gig Drive and I think
they're all the way up to 250 gigs right
now I'll have it all linked down below
in the description but the reason why I
think this is more relevant than ever is
the fact that it has a USB see end as
well as a regular USB and USB a so that
means you can put this up to any
computer and a lot of devices now that
have USB C as the standard so if you're
rocking an Android device you could plug
this right into it get more storage and
if you have maybe one of those new
MacBooks that only use USB type-c with
the Thunderbolt
then you can have that too so this is a
great great flash drive to store your
stuff it's good quality and super
cheap so you can't beat that and you
guys can already see right here tons of
little pouches in this backpack little
compartments for all kinds of stuff I
can't possibly use all the compartments
inside of here not on a budget anyway I
have blessing what we have in here now
these are cables by anchor now anchor
cables I feel like are a bit on the
premium side of things when you look on
Amazon but they are pretty good quality
and you can find all the cables that you
want for under like 20 bucks
this one is USB see it has a regular USB
end and it's a pretty long cable I
believe this one is 6 feet so if you
need some distance you want to charge
your phone while having it be plugged
into a wall
you got that distance right here so this
is a nice long cable and there's also a
lightning cable as well I think this is
their power line plus plus if you
compare this to what Apple puts in their
boxes it's night and day so this is a
really high quality cable and there's
also another lighting cable but this
one's a lot shorter if you have a
portable charger that you take around
with you this one will be very nice so
that you don't have a long cable
dangling in your hand while you have
your portable charger and your phone
together charging next up let's see
we've got right here a pair of bluetooth
earbuds so these are the Samsung level
you I believe and with these I found
this for 30-something bucks less than 40
bucks which is just mind-blowing and
they actually sound pretty decent now
I'm personally a fan of the neckband
design when you've got these in your ear
you don't have to worry about them
falling out gravity is not working
against you because you have this little
neck band here and the cable just goes
right into your ears I think this is a
really nice option if you're looking for
a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that won't
break the bank and it's got like a
little magnet so whenever you're not
using it these can stick together and I
don't know about you guys but for me
when I was walking to school I always
had some music in my ears this is a nice
way to you know kill time on the bus or
train whatever it may be
having a nice pair of solid earbuds
can't go wrong so if you don't want to
go with a pair of bluetooth earbuds
maybe you want something a little bit
more hardcore
you can go with these guys right here
these are the audio technica ath m20x
now if you guys have never heard of
audio technica before they make some
pretty solid headphones that don't break
the bank have some good sound quality
these are the 88 mm 20 X that cost only
$39.99
I believe less than 40 bucks for these
and they sound really really good now
the only thing about these is that it
has like a really long cable so that's
something to keep in mind but if you
guys aren't super thrilled with this
idea I'll have alternatives to what
we've got in this little backpack down
below in the description but if you want
something that gives you a little bit
more sound than a pair of earbuds then
these are definitely a nice way to get
that without breaking the bank
so right here now this backpack has a
pretty interesting little feature here
where it has these pockets that hold a
smartphone so you can put your
smartphone right here and the smartphone
that we've got is the essential phone
now I've reviewed this phone in the past
and when I first got it it was 700 bucks
wasn't impressed enough to think it was
worth that but now this thing only goes
from $400 I think you maybe get it for
even less on Amazon it's really
inexpensive and at $400 this is a really
really good value probably one of the
best values that you can find on a smart
phone along with oneplus now you're
getting some solid specs great battery
life it doesn't have a headphone jack
which is a little annoying so you would
have to use the adapter that comes in
the box to use something like the m20x
but it still is a really decent phone
pretty decent camera a really great
screen and the build quality is just
superb and not to mention along with the
pixel it's one of the first phones to
get Android P so you can easily just
update this to the latest version of
Android which is really really nice so
this is worth looking at if you're
looking for an upgrade for the new year
the essential phone $400
check it out and this actually this
small tiny compartment right here I
don't know if you guys can even see it
but this thing is really small and I
didn't know what to use it for but I
found the way and I think a pair of
regular earbuds was the right way to go
so right here we've got the RHA m8 390s
now the reason why I like RHA these are
about 40 bucks now at this price these
are probably one of the highest poly
pair of earbuds that I've used in the
$40 range RJ has great great quality
stuff and in terms of sound D sound
great if you happen to be a fan of bass
I am you're really gonna enjoy the sound
out of this and you also get a little
inline remote where you can play and
pause your music it has a little
microphone so that you can speak into it
this is something that I feel could last
you the entire year instead of getting a
cheap pair of earbuds that will break
down on you and you need one in a couple
of weeks now a really cool feature in
this backpack that you might have seen
me talk about in previous videos is a
included USB port now you might be
wondering why a USB port on a backpack
well if you have a portable charger you
can actually connect it to the backpack
and we've got one right here
and when you connect it to the backpack
instead of having to carry the portable
charger in your hand you can go ahead
and take one of your cables plug it into
the USB port and once you've got that
you can just plug your phone in and boom
you're charging so I think this is
really cool who wants to carry a
portable charger in the hand or put it
in their pocket having it right in your
backpack is the best way to go so it's
great that you have the ability to
charge your device right from your
backpack I think all backpacks should
have this feature now I think is really
awesome now as for the portable charger
that we're using for this this one is by
jakhary now this guy right here has
eight ten thousand 15 milli amp hour
battery so it'll charge your phone at
least twice and then some but in terms
of cables and ports this thing has a
regular USB port so you can plug
whatever you need into it but it does
have a built in
microUSB cable as well as a lightning
cable now the ideal would be a lightning
cable and a USB type-c cable but here's
the thing a lot of accessories and
devices still use microUSB cables to
charge so if you have something like
your you know samsung level use you can
charge them up with this guy and not to
mention this thing feels really
high-quality this is like straight-up
metal these cables don't feel cheap and
thin so these are solid cables on the
sides and it's even got a flashlight
right yeah there it is now I'm not even
sure if you guys notice but we went
through one compartment with a bunch of
little pockets we got another little
compartment here we went with another
compartment here another compartment
here and we've got another compartment
to hold our laptop it's very safe to say
this thing can carry a lot now another
nice little feature is that with this
you have these little straps that you
can open up and you can zip this down
all the way so whenever you're going to
on a trip maybe you're taking a flight
somewhere TSA open it all up get out no
worries and this is the laptop
compartment as well as another big mesh
pouch so you can fit whatever you want
in here guys be creative but right here
we have the laptop inside of a sleeve
this one is by lack dude and this is
very inexpensive and really really nice
you can go to school without even having
this maybe if you're in college or
something where you don't need as many
books or anything like that
just pick your laptop you can put some
papers in the back and you can have
whatever you need stored up front
pencils pens whatever you may be ours so
you can store all those little puffs
right here but now for the laptop that
we've got inside of here this is the
Acer Aspire be 15 now this is a really
solid laptop only 600 bucks so it's
definitely budget-friendly for what it
can do it's got some decent specs and
some pretty good build quality so
is a bit of a larger display too and I
actually really like the display usually
the displays look really cheap but this
one's a really solid 1080p display with
a bunch of great io so on the left side
we've got a USB C port which is nice
you've got your Ethernet you've got the
old-school VGA jack
you also have HDMI two USB 3.0 ports as
well as a regular USB on the other side
and your headphone jack and surprisingly
you also get a DVD drive inside of here
not something I expect to see on a
laptop with a USB C port I honestly
really thought that I got an older
device by accident when I purchased this
but if you got DVDs lying around hey
doesn't hurt but inside of here you also
have an SSD that has eight gigs of RAM
and it comes in a few different
configurations so if you want a little
bit more power you can get that it has
intellisense generation processors which
is nice and it also has a dedicated
graphics card that's got the gtx MX 150
so it's not a really powerful chip but
if you want a game at some point maybe
in that game super seriously but you're
gonna be able to game on this as well so
600 bucks it's powerful as fast has good
build quality you can even game on it a
bit it's a really nice all-around great
device so I definitely recommend it but
we do have one more thing this thing
also has a bunch of side compartments so
got one over here
let's pull this guy out we got a mouse
this is the Logitech g600 now some of
you might have seen this coming because
this is like my favorite Mouse of all
time but it's only 30-something bucks
that it shifts but it's under 40 bucks
that's a really really good price for
this mouse and this is really great if
you're a gamer you've got the macro
buttons on the side or if you're an
editor you can use these for different
shortcuts that you use and this thing is
super comfortable I keep recommending it
in multiple videos but that's because
it's
good but that about wraps it up for this
video guys lots of great stuff here all
very inexpensive I don't think anything
here cost more than 50 bucks besides the
phone in the laptop of course but yeah
let me know what you guys think I'll
have some alternatives if you guys are
really still hunting for more stuff I
have a bunch of links down below in the
description for things that I think you
guys might want to check out the baller
Edition is coming up so you got to stay
tuned for that that's where we take all
of these and just take it to the next
level but it's not a problem but till
then guys your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
