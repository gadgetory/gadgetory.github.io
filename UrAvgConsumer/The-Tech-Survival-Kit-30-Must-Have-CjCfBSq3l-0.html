it's that time of year again
time for another tech survival kit to
help you out in all of your potential
tech emergencies
aka your first of all problems the case
holding all of the gear this time around
is from the same company as last year's
bag smart now this kit is a bit bigger
than the previous survival case I've
shown but that also means is going to be
able to hold more which is great
depending on your needs and I still
think the previous kits are great
options even today if you're looking for
something a bit smaller but I like this
bag smart case it looks great has a ton
of compartments and a nice price tag in
the first pocket we've got headphone
adaptors for those phones without a
headphone jack and it's great to have
this here since these little adapters
are easy to lose so if you happen to
misplace yours
you know the survival kit has a backup
and it's also nice if you tend to the
pin on a bluetooth headphone and the
battery dies on you you can use the
cable that comes with the headphone plug
it into the adapter I still use it and
next we have a headphone splitter by
Belkin and I like to have these around
in case you're going on a long trip and
you're watching something and you want
to share it with someone next to you you
both can just plug in some headphones
and enjoy whatever you're watching this
is the orbit card which is typically
used to find wallets having this here
will give you the ability to locate your
kit from your smartphone if you happen
to misplace it and you can even make it
ring if you're trying to pinpoint its
exact location and vice versa it's a
little bit more expensive than what I
typically like to put in the case but I
definitely think it's worth it
especially considering its longevity
with being able to be recharged but if
you definitely want to go with something
cheaper there's always tile options I'll
have a few of my favorites down below in
the description so you guys could go
ahead and check them out now when you go
beyond that first pocket and open this
thing up you'll see quite a few cables
on the left at the top we've got a
generic 3.5 millimeter auxiliary cable
this could be really helpful if you
forget to cable to your Bluetooth
headphones or if you want to plug in an
audio device to a pair of speakers like
you might in a car and next to that
we've got a really inexpensive pair of
earbuds by chrono these are a great pair
of backup ear but if you happen to
forget your normal ear buds or even your
headphone at home they sound pretty
decent and have some cool features like
a volume slider right on the inline
remote and the earbuds themselves are
magnetic so it's easy to store or wear
around your neck next up we've got the
Chaffin multi head us
the cable which has adaptors for any
phone or device you can imagine you've
got lightning USB type-c microUSB and
even mini USB which is dated but it's
cool to have this thing available since
nobody's carrying that cable around
anymore so it's nice to have that here
just in case you need it also if you
don't like the squid look up the chief
on cable that we mentioned earlier we
have a more traditional one here by
thinking this one's got pretty good
quality and has some more length to it
than the chiffon cable and when you buy
it you also get a much longer version as
well you definitely don't need both this
and the chiffon cable in your kit at the
same time but I wanted to show you guys
a few more options I actually know a
couple more that I like that I'll have
link down below as well so you guys can
pick the one that works best for your
kid and again we've got the anchor 4
port USB hub which is definitely clutch
when you find yourself needing more USB
ports and it's USB 3.0 so you don't have
to worry about speeds now moving on to
the right side since this is a bag smart
case you've got some slots for some SD
cards and I even got the SD card reader
here so in case your laptop doesn't have
an SD card slot like a macbook pro are
you gonna still be able to get your
files from your cards i think having an
extra SD card or SD card reader is great
for anybody who wants to move files
around or if you happen to forget your
SD card when you take your camera out
this is going to have a backup for you
and we've also got some other things in
this pots for media like some flash
drives that can actually be connected to
your smartphones we have one here from
silicon power for those Android devices
with USB C and of course we have one for
the iPhone but you'll need an app to get
the full use out of it and we've also
got some USB a2c adapters so if you
happen to need to plug something into a
macbook that's you're not expecting you
know you got some adapters in your
survival kit to back you up now below
those we have our portable charger from
Jack Reed and this guy I actually like
because we're getting 20,000 milliamp
hours from a twenty dollar portable
charger this thing even features two USB
ports and one has quick charge 3.0 so
you get access to fast charging if your
device supports it and it's not a big
bulky portable charger for at 20 bucks I
really like this and of course you know
I don't play around you gotta have some
riding utensils they were a favorite
Caraga mechanical pencil which is self
sharpening thanks to the gear inside of
it but what's really crazy is the
multi-use tactical pen that I've
next to it this is from Bell v and this
thing is nuts not only does it have an
actual pen but it also has a blade
portion that functions as a bottle
opener a normal blade for cutting a saw
blade a wrench twist and the tip even
functions as a screwdriver which gives
us ting a lot of functionality this
thing even has a glass breaking tip so
if you're trapped in a car or something
this thing can help you survive in a
more literal sense and it's even got a
flashlight which is very handy to have
around and the next side we've got a
couple more compartments now in this
little pouch right here you know I had
to have a microfiber cloth this thing is
a lifesaver if you have a really dirty
screen so just wipe an onion shirt you
get a good microfiber cloth like this
one from spuds my absolute favorite
clean up your devices make them look
pretty now so the right of that we've
got a pair of Bluetooth earbuds I didn't
think it was possible but I actually
found a decent pair that only costs 20
bucks so if you really don't feel like
dealing with cables or you forgot your
normal gym headphones at home this will
be a nice backup now these sound paints
aren't crazy or anything but they're
meant to be a backup for your normal
things just like everything else in this
kit and the last thing we've got are
some power options like this Belkin
surge protector that we featured in the
first tech survival kit and I really
love the flexibility that you get from
this thing being able to take one outlet
and turn it into three with two USB
ports is a win for anyone especially if
you're in a place with limited outlets
like a coffee shop or even a library you
can also go with the option I used in
the last kit which includes a portable
charger but you miss out on the USB port
and extra outlet they're both
inexpensive so you can pick whichever
one you think will fit your needs
but I have them both linked down below
and last we've got this travel wall
adapter from época something like this
is a definitely a must when traveling
overseas since it includes adapters for
different outlets from different
countries one thing to note though is
that it doesn't convert voltage so you
got to keep that in mind an area and I
have used this in the past but what
makes this thing special is that not
only can you plug in your normal device
in the outlet but you can also charge
for different devices with the four USB
ports that it comes with I really wish
we had is in our last trip to Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona because the
one we had didn't have as many ports and
so it made charging things just a lot
slower having all four ports here would
have meant we would have been
good to go in less time so if you want
to be able to charge multiple devices
when you're overseas definitely pick
this thing up whether it's for your
survival kit or if you just want to keep
it in your suitcase this is a must-buy
but that about wraps it up guys like I
do with every other survival kit I try
to make the things inside of it as
inexpensive as possible so anybody can
go ahead and build out their own kit and
I do still think it's worth checking out
my first and second tech survival kit
since I did a couple things differently
in there that might still be useful
today so definitely check those out but
sold next one guys hopefully you enjoyed
it if you did be the cool guy or girl
that gives this video a thumbs up and
I'm gonna catch you guys on the next one
till then it's your average consumer
