Wi-Fi disk and I must say this is a
pretty interesting device
it's a 3000 milliamp portable charger
which isn't that impressive on its own
but it has some extra features you just
can't find on other portable chargers
this device contained a built-in Wi-Fi
system that allows you to connect up to
five devices why would you need this
feature you might ask well this thing
works as a hub for your digital content
that your computer smartphones and
tablets have access to through streaming
when you want to stream your content the
dish will put on a Wi-Fi signal for your
device to connect to and you don't have
to worry about anyone jumping on your
signal and accessing your stuff as
you'll need a password to get connected
taking a closer look you'll see that the
Wi-Fi this has a standard SD card slot
as well as a USB 2.0 port naturally you
can use SD cards from your camera and a
thumb drive or a hard drive with the USB
port when one or more of these are
connected to the Wi-Fi disk you'll be
able to stream the contents with device
on the Wi-Fi this network also in the
front you'll notice some LED lights that
indicate when it's powered on has a
device connected to it has its Wi-Fi
turned on and is working as a hotspot in
order to access your content you will
need an app from the Play Store or the
App Store called air store in this app
you'll get a simple file explorer
interface which allows you to see your
folders and files and access the storage
devices connected to the Wi-Fi disk the
app works pretty well although it can
sometimes be a little sluggish so if
multiple people are accessing the device
at once but this is an amazing feature
because it allows you to travel with
media that doesn't have to be directly
on your phone or tablet taking up that
valuable hard disk space and of course
we can't forget that this thing is a
portable charger that can charge your
phone if it's running low on power I
think that's a very useful feature for
the average consumer as we always have
our phones or tablets dying on us when
you're outdoors it should be able to
charge most phones at least once back to
100% depending on how large your phone's
battery cap
city is an iPhone can probably get two
charges out of this and Android
depending on how new it is it can get at
least one to one-and-a-half charges as
many of you know I'm a huge fan of
portable chargers as I think there are
amongst the most useful gadgets you can
carry around with you I definitely
recommend the ravpower Wi-Fi this as it
only retails for 45 bucks
and it offers a ton of functionality and
value you can find a link in the
description if you plan on picking one
of these up but before we head out
here's a quick message from our sponsor

security and privacy solution for all of
us average consumers out there who just
want to surf the web without any worries
about getting our identity stolen or our
secure passwords taken so hotspot Shield
does this through what's called a VPN
and a VPN is a virtual private network
that pretty much makes a bubble around
your internet browsing and it protects
you from all the malicious things out
there like hackers spammers all kinds of
crazy stuff so you can use this in
places like airports hotels things like
that where the average consumer
sometimes doesn't know is that sometimes
there are people lurking on these
networks who are just waiting for you to
log in and steal your identity when you
log into like let's say your bank
account or anything like that
so hotspot Shield does provide you
protection from things like that so if
