consumer and today I just want to give
you guys a quick update about things
that are going on with channel things
that I have planned so hey let's get
right into it first off I want to tell
you guys that I'm working on a ton of
videos right now I've shown a couple of
pictures on Twitter and Instagram I've
got a lot of stuff in the works um most
of the products that you've seen me
unbox as of late will most likely have a
review and I'm working on having all
that footage and all that stuff we'll
sort it out now so you over the next
couple of days you should be seeing them
roll out so just stay tuned for that I
know a ton of you guys are waiting for a
couple of stuff but I also wanted to ask
you guys aside from the things that
you've seen me unbox and review so far
again update me on a couple of things
you want to see I know people asked for
tons of headphones
of course I'm seeing that all the time I
know you guys want to see the monster
DNA some logitech ue series um and a
couple of other things but what else do
you guys want to see it I also try to do
other things outside of headphones so if
you guys give me some insight into what
you want to see please feel free to
leave a comment down below on some other
things outside of the headphone realm
and I'll be trying to get my hands on
some of those too also talking about the
products I've pulled Twitter and
Facebook asking for people's opinions
I'm going to be trying to introduce a
new segment about products that are not
as expensive as some of the ones I've
been reviewing as of late and probably
more in the you know budget-friendly
realm and I'm not sure what to call this
segment or how often to do it but I
definitely plan on doing something with
it um a winner was something about
something around the name of bang for
your buck I'm not sure how to go about
it but definitely leave some ideas down
below so I can know what should I call
this new segment that has more
affordable products or products that
I've been using that you guys haven't
heard about or anything like that so
feel free to let me know give me some
ideas I'd really appreciate
I'm also interested in doing a question
and answers video so if you guys have
any questions that you'd like to see me
answer I've seen I've seen tons of
questions in the past but I've never
really gotten around to answering all of
them so I'm thinking about having a
dedicated video towards that so if you
want to see some a video like that
definitely feel free to leave some
comments down below on what kind of
questions you want me to answer and I
know I'm asking you guys for a ton of
input here so just bear with me and add
whatever input you want and we'll see
how what we can get going and if there
are any kind of test you guys like to
see or different videos that don't
exactly follow the normal review or
unboxing format be sure to let me know
what kind of videos you want to see as
you guys know I like to do different
tests that don't really go with the flow
of female reviews and unboxings as you
can see I did a couple of different
things the girlfriend test the iPhone
speaker tests all kinds of different
little interesting tests but if you have
any more random little tests or videos
you guys want to see me do be sure to
let me know and I can see if I can work
on that you guys know I like to have fun
with this so throw some input into it
and again I can't waste an opportunity
to say thank you guys for all the
support the subscriptions the comments
all the love really appreciate it I'm
glad and um you know I do giveaways to
give back to you guys for all the
support and we do have a giveaway going
on right now me and hi-fi guy have a
v-moda crossfade m80 video or giveaway
rather that we're doing so I'm sure all
my subscribers are not entered into that
contest so be sure to go and check that
out enter if you have nothing to pay
it's free so why not just go in enter
and get a chance at winning some free
headphone and I don't see why not
I just want to say thanks again guys
really appreciate it and I'm really glad
I have to support it of all of you guys
like I said guys tons of new stuff
coming to the channel lots going on I
try to update Twitter and Facebook as
often as possible give you guys some
insight into the things that I'm doing
so definitely be sure to follow me there
it's really easy to follow me I'm I'm
called your average consumer on like all
social networks
so I'm on Twitter Facebook Instagram
Google+ I'm on everything so just be
sure to follow me there you guys get to
kind of see where I'm going with the
channel what kind of things I have
planned what products are gonna be
coming out and you have some fun you can
tap with me there or even ask me some
questions that I might not see on
YouTube so there you go there's some
social media sites that you can reach me
on so definitely look out for that and
pretty much that wraps it up guys wanted
to do a quick update pull you guys for
some input and things like that
and hopefully you guys respond and give
me some some of the help that I'm
looking for and we can make this channel
suited to what you guys want to see
alright guys I appreciate it to all my
average consumers thanks again and I'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
