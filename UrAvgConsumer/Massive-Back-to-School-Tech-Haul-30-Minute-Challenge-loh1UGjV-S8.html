and we've got Ari again you know what
time it is we're at Best Buy and you
know we got to do another shopping
challenge so this time around Best Buy I
decided to sponsor today's video which
was awesome because now we have a pretty
decent budget $2,000 but we're not going
to spend everything on ourselves when I
give away some of the stuff to you guys
over on Instagram yeah so definitely
make sure you follow us there and we
actually have a theme this time around
we are gonna have students in mind
specifically kids in college and we're
gonna see who can get the better haul
let's do this so right now we've got a
30-minute timer ready to go now here's
the thing guys since I always trounce
Ari in these little competitions I
decided to give myself a handicap I let
her pick one item from store pick up but
actually could use in today's video
three two one boom so I'm thinking
college students dorm rooms we want that
to be fun right so let's let's get some
fun stuff for that we can get like a
good speaker since we have a decent
budget I don't have to cheap out I can
get something like really good okay so
now we're in the speaker section so what
I love my best buys you can actually
like test it right here so let's see
we've got here what this sounds like
okay that sounds better the phone camera
I like to dismiss in college my first
one I had like a janky phone - I
actually sat on my phone and broke it my
first semester of college so let's get
us a nice oh the sprockets this right
here this a gaming PC this should be my
whole budget right here 1,800 bucks
worth it
the wireless logitech g502 I would love
this if I had a gaming laptop in college
whoo I'm gonna get this well well treat
for me well I have to get full let's get
a phone am I really gonna get a
smartphone I think the first time we've
ever gotten a smartphone on one of these
videos all right let's do it
we've got the money one thing that's
underrated and you guys know where I'm
headed is Best Buy's bag selection so
they got some awesome backpacks and some
regular bags you know for anyone who
wants that wonder how Jets do it over
there
two sets of headphones one what truly
wireless pair a speaker this one now I
like this oh look at the handles it's
like it was begging for me to buy it
Oh what about a nice TV and my thumb
what do you think a TV how much is this
guy oh this one's brand new with fire TV
oh no no no I'm I'm getting this dorm
rooms aren't huge so you don't need like
a huge television 43 inches is perfect
250 this is a good buy right here oh
sorry right now whoever wins some of the
stuff that we're giving away here is
gonna be very happy so I think Harry saw
our TV and grabbed her own TV if she has
a TV I swear guys now you know she's a
cheater so I think my haul is good well
it's not plentiful a lot of different
items in here I think something is a
solid haul and I did get my head start
so I can just go ahead and pick up the
laptop that I found online
I guess I'm picking up under the name
Mary Alba thank you
yeah okay I can't get away from the RGB
lights so if you want to be the cold kid
in your dorm it doesn't hurt at least
have like you know a really cool desk or
something so we'll try this out well if
it's too expensive a week over the
budget this will probably be the first
thing to go but let's go with this okay
so I don't have much money left so I
needs to just pick a budget pair of
noise cancelling headphones I'm feeling
pretty confident and time just went up
perfect
no I need more time I do I'm waiting for
someone to come get my thing I'm really
waiting for them I am I can't I can't
help that
I tried lying so here the thing I tried
lying it's fine
and song jet that I'm waiting for social
didn't get my headphones I'm just
waiting for me to go in line so he was
waiting me out I was over there try to
cheat she says she got somebody waiting
to help her out to get one more item but
times they're cheating hold on Jay yo
Malcolm's face gave it all away put that
down let's go I can't believe I had to
do this I can't believe it y'all I'm
over $77 that's a substantial amount I'm
gonna go I'm gonna go do a return oh no
it's okay you can have some of my budget
I have I have leftover is this for you
guys I want you guys to get the most
possible you can use my budget I have
leftover
I don't need your budget I'm gonna
return it I'm returning it so airy just
pretty used the pretty underhanded move
she wants me to keep some of my products
that I went over with just so we can
give them away to you guys it's a dirty
trick but because I love you guys
I'm gonna take the loss of points for
that one alright y'all so shopping has
concluded how you feel I feel like you
guys would be so impressed I picked up
all right how much did you spend it was
1996 68 1990 dang close
all right so I went over its mm $77 okay
so you're we ready for this who's gonna
go first
I got I got it looks like I got more
stuff than you
so I'll start it off so over here we
have the Amazon Fire HD 8 now the idea
behind this is to use the Kindle app
yeah but for e-textbooks so that's the
whole idea
yeah so we'll use that for each text
books I think that kind of makes sense
and it wasn't really expensive only 80
bucks
sprocket you remember that makes sense
that makes things that's cool though
because that's like a tiny printer that
you can use your smart phone to send
images to and you just print that out I
also got these guys right here now this
is a smaller thing right here but it's
just some stylus pens to use with like
tablets so if you want to take notes
maybe you're in class you don't feel
like typing with a keyboard or something
you just want to jot down notes you got
that option also got you know has a good
a mouse mice mice agree but this is the
newest wireless mouse from Logitech this
is a logitech g502 and I was excited to
get my hands on this
I love the wired version of it so
Wireless you know boom why not
the UE mega boom
now I thought back we got to college how
we were always playing some kind of
music and my world we're about on the
grass and everything so and I got to
test it out in Best Buy too so and I
like to help it sounded and it was a
good price I just went ahead and got
this what's also cool about this and has
built-in Amazon Alexa so you can still
have it that's clean figure asking
questions and whatnot and alright
alright I'll give you that
but I got a speaker to let me show you
which one I'm working with so right here
we've got the JBL boombox portable this
is so you in college yeah of course I
used to play music like crazy in college
there was always music going in my room
and this would have been awesome if I
had this alright
me alright you probably got something
killer in there and that's why I believe
you I believe in you that's what was a
little rough guys a little rough last
time all right so of course you guys
know me I was like being prepared so I
found this a travel essentials power by
raft power and inside of here you get a
power bank with 10,000 milliamp hours
wall charger car charger and a car mount
and your car we had your car so I would
have used this mount no problem so I
picked up the it's a Keurig it's K mini
bus now this one there were two hours
choosing between by thought to go with
the mini one because dorm rooms are not
big at all so if you have a little
coffee machine in your dorm room it
should fit anywhere it also stores some
pods so it has built-in storage and I
think this is just perfect for college
students you don't have to go all the
way to the dining hall and pay for
coffee you just have your room you can
make and not to mention it would be
perfect for you know those late night
study sessions I used to pull
all-nighters all the time writing my
papers never telling them
I probably would have broken into this
exactly that's a good move I had a
similar thought in terms of like staying
up late and getting work done so I got
these interesting glasses by ganar so
these are gaming glasses but you see as
you can see like it has like a yellow
coating on the lens so protection from
the blue light got another little thing
but this is a 25-foot Ethernet cable
because when we were in college we had
the Ethernet jack that we could just
plug our laptop into to get better
internet yeah the what the thing is the
wireless connection wasn't as fast as
the ethernet jack so it would've been
nice to have like a 25-foot cable so
right here we have a pair of truly
wireless earbuds these are the JBL free
truly wireless earbuds these only go for
like a hundred bucks so I figured why
not they don't look big at all take a
look at these guys these are really
small to have a nice form factor so I
figured why not oh you you got a TV I
gotta call you out for this one I gotta
call her out for this one
she saw my TV what you couldn't miss my
TV alright let's just
I also didn't know Tosun this ain't
basketball you so so we got this toshiba
fired edition TV fire TV edition 43
inches 4k no because I can't let this
slide I could I and this is only 250
bucks how much did you spend on your 32
inches and it was only a hundred and
twenty and $9.99
oh that's half the price of this one
yeah but 250 is not bad though and I
would have had space for this and my
tiny girl room what you think this is
not that big no it's fine it's fine and
4k for all the people out there who say
like oh I can't afford a 4k TV yes you
can I know I say this every single
challenge but I really did try to go for
quality over quantity and now I'm gonna
prove that with my next night so oh you
got a phone
yes so I thought back to 17 year old
Aaron going into college so we have the
galaxy s 10 and I like this one right
here should give me an automatic win
because it is a beautiful phone with
that Super AMOLED display and I just
like the house shoots you just love
showing this one off okay I definitely
have loved a phone like this in college
you know I mean who wouldn't know has
perfect camera for my selfies and
everything has great battery life Destin
is such a solid choice but yeah so this
was a prism blue and I think it's so so
pretty it's a lot so giveaway friendly
but this eight of my budget guys like
well that's it that's a big moon that's
a big move you got like you got a flag
you got a flag ship so okay all right I
gotta bring out my heavy hitters over
here actually I don't got that much left
alright so over here I'm not gonna go
all guns blazing just yet but I got the
Google Home Hub so I figured you know
having this in your room you want to ask
you some questions ask it to solve a
math problem or something
come on guys
it'll be very useful and you can get
information on the screen this could be
and
a really nice tool for students I also
have this guy I figured you know if you
have maybe something like this on your
desk why not make that desk look really
good I have this life X Z this is one of
those you know light strips why not
the dorm is the cool looking dorm
because it has this I like that idea
don't you yeah so this is my last piece
of course you need a laptop for those 15
20 feet papers you'll be typing so I got
this one by asus or isis and this is the
one that I picked up when Judd gave me
my 20 minute head start this has 8 gigs
of RAM and a solid-state drive with 128
gigs of storage and usually when you
have a good budget laptop like this they
tend to be a little explore a little
clunky but since it has 8 gigs of ram
and a solid-state drive it should be it
should perform pretty well it's leagues
better than the one I had you ever mind
I have that massive gateway yeah a
gateway oh that's my guide in the first
year alright so you definitely went for
quality over quantity with like the
flagship phone I'm not gonna hike you up
too much no I'm not gonna hug you up so
much with the phone and a laptop ok
whatever anyway but my wild card boom
oculus quest yeah the big boy so the
oculus quest is awesome because this is
a virtual reality headset that you don't
need a computer for everything that you
need to play it is right in the box no
hooking it up to some crazy battle
station of any sort this is all you need
and this is this is great for in a dorm
hanging out with your friends playing on
this so yeah I think that this is a
really good pick especially you know
you're gonna be the life of a party with
my stuff you know you got a big speaker
we got this you better stop
but that about wraps it up guys you got
more because he pulled me from whoever
wins the giveaway will win a gift card
all right well you guys let us know
we'll have a poll to see who won the
whole thing I want to know what you guys
think I feel pretty confident I mean I
think this is true do you you went with
a bunch of little items and then a big
item so like he does you know he goes
for the cool
oh wait I'm not done I forgot you gotta
have a backpack how could I forget this
yeah baby a nice little cool backpack so
you got to put all your stuff inside of
here you're going to school you need a
backpack this is a solid one oh I almost
forgot
have more in the tank we'll probably
give away most of this stuff on social
media so be sure to follow us on
Instagram Twitter but again before we
head out we got to give a huge shout out
to the best buy for sponsoring the video
and letting us use their store all the
time you guys know how much we love Best
Buy we did all of our other shopping
challenges in there so guys if you
enjoyed this video be the cool guy or
girl thumbs up and we'll catch you guys
in the next one
so then it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
