consumer and today I've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the street buy 50 on ear
wired headphones now you guys have been
requesting this for quite some time so
finally here to bring it to the channel
and hey let's not waste any time let's
get right into it alright guys here we
have the SMS audio street buy 50 now
this is one of their newer models this
is the on ear wired version and it looks
pretty similar to the older version
well not the headphones itself but the
packaging looks very similar to the
older version so you get to see what it
looks like all around see 50 of course
see that you get the headphones so let's
get straight to it let's unbox it and
since it's got plastic wrap on it I'll
use the handy unboxing knife and we'll
pop it open definitely not necessary for
something like this this plastic isn't
exactly hard to take off but I like
using my unboxing right so I'm gonna use
it now let's get this off and alright
and that's about it for just plastic
throw that over there now we're going to
slide this up and she buy 50 always has
nice packaging too I've seen a couple of
their headphones before and they do have
your packaging pretty much the opposite
of beats with the whole blue and black
so let's open it up so you've got 50
here and open this side as well and okay
so you've got the headphones in here I'm
sure this is the case and inside the box
on this side you'll see you got all your
warranty information your contact info
even some stickers so this is pretty
cool so you got the owner manual I'm
sure this has advertising for other
products of course and inside here we've
got some contact info as well some cool
stickers so that's pretty nice
and it fits in the box pretty well right
here so that's the cool stuff alright so
that's it for the box so moving on we'll
close this or put this over here rather
and one of the things that fell out here
was a microfiber cloth a nice blue one
so that's cool and here we have the
headphones themselves and first things
first this is small these are really
really small smaller than I expected I'm
ISA 250 Street buy 50 headphones that
are like really large so this is very
tiny on this case being as small as it
is means it's gonna be very portable you
can probably take this around anywhere
with you so let's open it up reminds me
of a football open it up and boom here
we have them guys straight by 50 and
let's see pull it out here so you've got
the headphones themselves pretty nice
pretty nice the ear cups feel really
really soft that's really good um you've
got a single cable here and here we have
the cable itself over here we've got a
nice little s on the inline remote we
just have a play and pause button so for
all you Android users out there you
won't be tempted by the volume controls
since those never work on inline remotes
for Android
you just got playing pause and for Apple
devices you've got playing pauses and in
the back here it has SMS audio and of
course this does have a mic on it so
this is the cable so along with the
tangle free cable you get these
headphones
and like I said guys these are really
really small they're very lightweight
much lighter than I expected and
hopefully they're just as durable as the
originals um what's really great about
these is that they can fold up now as
you guys saw when it was in the box or
the case and the old Street by fifties
weren't able to fold so this is a great
great improvement I'm really glad that
they started doing this um yeah first of
all like I said I'm really impressed
with the cushion
the questions feel great so since this
is going to be an on-ear experience this
is not over the ear headphones this is
on ear so it's going to be really great
that they have on soft cushions here so
it should make the experience a lot
better when having these on for a long
period of time but we'll have to see how
that really goes this is just um my
assumption right now but let's give you
guys a quick close-up so you can get a
better idea of what this looks like and
alright guys so here we have it this is
what it looks like um like I said it
looks pretty good you guys can take a
look at the cushion here it's really
soft so that's very very nice up top
you've got SMS audio of course and you
got the foldable joints and of course
they can come out so if you have a
bigger head and unlike me you can use
these with no problem and over here it
says Street by 50 on the inside not sure
if you guys can see that
there you go stood by 50 on the ear so
you guys have that and pretty much
that's all there is to it guys of course
you have your input Jack over here on
the left side so that's that and um yeah
this is it guys so that about wraps up
this video guys is a quick unboxing of
the street buy 50 on ear wired version
and before we close out this video
here's a quick message from our sponsor

security and privacy solution for a lot
of us a verge consumers who wanted to
surf the web and not really worry about
dangerous things like hackers or other
online threats now hotspot Shield does
just through what is called a virtual
private network also known as a VPN and
ha special offers quite a few different
features but one of my favorite things
that they offer is the ability to go on

Wi-Fi networks so if you're at work and
