consumer and today I have review for you
guys of the new Trent power pack plus so
let's not wasting time let's get right
into it and alright guys here we have
the new trend power pack plus now this
is a big big charger this thing offers
13,500 milliamps of battery power so
this is going to be charging your phones
over and over and over again it this is
one of the biggest portable chargers
that I've had as far as capacity goes
and this is just amazing guys with this
you really don't have to worry about
battery power whatsoever when it comes
to your mobile device
now with 13,500 milliamps that means you
can charge your iPhones probably like
eight to nine times before this thing
runs out of energy
and for those of you with like a Samsung
device you can charge it up to five
times and that's great because the
galaxy s4 has a huge battery so you've
got a couple of days of usage just right
here from carrying this thing around now
this is a little larger than some of the
other portable chargers that I've
introduced on my channel but this can
really be used for having it in your
backpack or maybe your briefcase or
something like that maybe not
necessarily in your pocket I wouldn't
walk around with this in my pocket as
it's a little larger but I would
definitely be able to carry this around
in a bag or anything like that so it's
still got the portability with to it
just maybe not pocket-friendly and of
course this charger has two slots so you
can charge two devices at once it's got
a one amp USB slot for cellphones and
other sorts of phone devices or mobile
devices and it's got a two point one for
things like tablets and it actually says
it on the device so there's no confusion
there whatsoever this also has a nice
little LED to indicate when the battery
is low or when it's fully charged so
that's also really nice my only
complaint with this is that the power
button is a little harder to reach you
kind of have to make sure you use like a
nail or so so that's a little hard to
get to sometimes but once you get used
to it it's no big deal but this thing
offers so much battery power that it's
just amazing
I love this thing carrying around with
it when I'm going on a trip or something
like that it's just great because I can
charge my phone or my girlfriend's phone
at the same time over and over without
any issues or I don't really have to
worry about how much battery power does
this thing have left because it's got so
much and you can charge up this device
with a regular microUSB cable so you can
plug it into the wall with your cell
phone charger and let it sit all night
and you've got a fully charged and ready
to go within a couple of hours and
what's also cool is that they offer a
nice little carrying pouch when you
open it up so it has that so you can
build it in your bag without it worrying
about getting scratched up or anything
like that
so overall guys I'm very happy with this
device it's one of my favorite kinds of
gadgets portable chargers are great
since we all know that tablets and
phones and all that stuff they just die
too fast
so this is a great solution to issues
like that that I know all average
consumers come across and that's about
it for this review guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then if your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
