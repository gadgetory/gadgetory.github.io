got my hands on these guys
over here we've got the galaxy s7 and
here we've got the s7 edge but peep this
boom two of them but so you already know
I don't need two of these so you can
assume what's gonna be happening here
I'm not sure where I'm gonna be doing
this giveaway if you didn't assume I'm
doing a giveaway okay I'm not sure what
I'm gonna be doing a giveaway if I might
be doing it on social media so maybe you
should follow me on Instagram and
Twitter or Facebook wherever I'm not
sure where I'm gonna be doing a giveaway
so follow me there and keep an eye out
for that but uh let me put one to the
side and I guess we'll open these up and
get this out my modeller is nice use
this to compensate now this has 3000
milliamp s' of battery while the s7 Edge
has 3600 so that's quite the difference
but uh hopefully the boost in battery
helps because I did not like the battery
life of when the Chinese music down
sorry guys I did not like the battery
life of the s6 and it feels a bit
thicker than the s6 and this is the s7
side-by-side they look almost identical
but this does feel a bit heftier let's
see what else we got probably the
typical headphones and all that good
stuff charger let's see here we've got a
USB connector what's this for
interesting so we've got the USB cable
fast charging a USB wall adapter awesome
new earphones they make it look black
but you can tell us white on the inside
the case is black probably to go with
the color of the phone since I got the
black onyx version so with this guy
you're going to be able to plug in like
a USB Drive into your phone or something
so if you want to you know access
something from a flash drive you could
do this this is pretty cool interesting
that they would include this
when it feels like a random accessory to
me but that's pretty cool let's take a
look at what you get with the s7 edge
let's see this one is the silver
titanium version and like I said yet it
is a bit bigger now really what I want
to accomplish with my videos on these
guys is really seeing if it's much of a
difference from last year's phones you
have the feel is a bit different the
edges are like more similar to the no.5
then they were with the original s6 but
honestly you know those are minor things
this is like an S version upgrade I
kinda find this interesting this doesn't
feel like the old s6 edge this feels a
bit more comfortable the edges aren't as
sharp this feels actually a lot nicer
all right guys so I'm going through the
setup process here and it kind of tells
you in the beginning what the little
adapter is for and this adapter is so
that you can transfer things from your
old device over to the new one I always
sort of bind devices in new ones so I
don't really care for it but I guess
that's why that was the intended purpose
of including this but you do have the
perks of being able to put in like a
flash drive and stuff like that with it
too
look at this guy's all I did was set it
up so if you're going to be buying one
it's over looks like a pretty good
option it'll hide the fingerprints a bit
more so it's this unfamiliar place okay
but yeah so you guys know it takes a
good sponsor to get us in here and today
we have hello fresh so they sent us over
some meals to try out let you guys know
about it so as you can see we've got
three different options here over here
we have like a little envelope that says
some hello fresh perk so I'm guessing
some coupons in there but basically
hello fresh sends us just that open now
recently holla fresh sends out fresh
meals and ingredients for meals off of
people to cook and we're really excited
to try the sponsor because my friend
Becky actually my friend Becky actually
has been using how about her bottom
now and she has been raving over it and
posting a bunch of pictures on Facebook
so we got this sponsor I was super happy
to try this because one I don't cook
often and two she doesn't and she's
loving it and loving how it tastes so I
was nice to see how easy this really is
and it comes with some recipes and
instructions step-by-step instructions
so that you can cook these up with no
problem gives you all the info you need
right here yeah Maggie cooks he's in
under 30 minutes and she loves that it's
like delivered to her door it's
insulated and in kitchen that stays
fresh throughout the whole week she
cooks with every single day this woman
is a Wonder Woman so it must be that
easy I'm really excited to see how this
actually works out so we're just about
done cooking it up but if you guys want
to try it out Hollow fresh of course
have links down below in the description
and if you want to save 35 bucks on your
first order use the coupon code consumer
and boom you got some savings alright so
what are your thoughts pretty quick
right yeah it was pretty quick I really
enjoyed the whole process and right
numbers trying to plate it make it look
really fancy you can compete with Becky
but you guys if you want to try out
hellofresh I of course have links down
below so you try that out 35 bucks off
your order
can't beat that and yeah it's a pretty
simple service you know if you're lazy
like us you don't like to really get in
the kitchen this thing has step-by-step
instructions makes it super simple try
it out yeah now the final step is to try
it if I die guys don't follow fresh
alright guys so right now I am in the a
law headquarters on the boy Bryant
so we are gonna be checking out a ton of
VR stuff they've gotten a lot of VR
going on you guys can see that over here
they've got like the oculus they've got
a ton of different companies here that
they're gonna just be showing off the
different things that you know they're
innovating with in terms of VR how
excited this VR make you Brian
I'm kind of ancient right I was like
what is bargain
this guy is in the web he worship the
web he works for computers Photoshop but
he's terrible with technology how does
that even work
I don't know I remember this guy
remember he was trying to edit a video
on the iPad yeah what's wrong with this
guy so Judd is gonna give his first go
at this virtual reality stuff it's
supposed to be about 360 sound it's not
just about the visuals is also audio
should be pretty understand okay he's
really getting it today now screen looks
like some kind of call of duty black ops
supposedly these guys are like
unscrewing stuff behind his head and you
can hear that so it's causing him to
like look around window it is hearing we
get the right reverberation and of
course this guy had to try it out too
using some virtual reality from
and it was insane I enjoyed it this was
blurry so do you guys come to and
they're like screwing your helmet and it
drops on the floor don't move too much
like it was quite the experience
experience check out this ring I'm
guessing this play 360 video
that's pretty cool
well that's why we're here so we're the
more in our eyes trying to pick out an
outfit my cousin's getting married
tomorrow
so we have to have to go out there
I've to get that car in there so we got
to go to this wedding
yeah sure maybe something black
I knew something great just the most
century
we need to find outfits need to find the
eyebrows my brows but the thing like the
problem there is
we need these outfits she needs to get
her eyebrows done which is probably
going to be going to the makeup store to
happen to me
I'd see my caterpillars done you know I
just had the previous scene and my blade
II wasn't there so I trusted this other
woman showed her a picture what I wanted
foolish me look what she did you came
and see it really because I had to read
by the way but I had to go I had to go
right to mak and get something to fix it
because it was so messed up ladies you
know we don't play with our eyebrows
they frame the face all right I get it
though she tried somebody new this is
why you got a stick this is why you got
to stick with either one eyebrow person
just like guys stick with one barber you
stick with one you know they do well and
that's all you do before he goes here
she messed up the coat so after what
felt like forever and about four or five
dresses purchased dresses later I think
we're done here huh
