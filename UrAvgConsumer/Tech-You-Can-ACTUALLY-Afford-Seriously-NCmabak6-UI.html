what's going on guys it's ravage
consumer and yes I hear you
you'll want more videos about tech you
can actually afford so today we're gonna
be checking out some awesome stuff that
won't kill your pockets now the first
thing we're gonna check out are these
awesome headphones over here and these
are by Tala onyx these are the sound
Serge 60s a pair of bluetooth over ear
headphones with active noise-cancelling
now usually active noise-cancelling
headphones can cost up to 300 or 400
crazy amounts of money and these are
only gonna go for 70 bucks and what's
even crazier is pouch onyx gave me a
coat for you guys to take 40% off until
July 22nd making these headphones around
42 bucks so that is a really good price
for what these are but not only that but
these are just straight-up good
headphones check out these ear cups
they're super plush very very soft now
for me that is one of the most important
factors of a pair of headphones once you
get these things on you can definitely
wear them for hours on end without any
comfort issues and like I mentioned
before these have active
noise-cancelling so if you're on a plane
you're doing your commute you'll want to
block out that noise active
noise-cancelling here is actually pretty
impressive for something in this price
range and when you put on some music
you're completely drowning out
everything now I actually like the sound
on these they've got a nice thumping
bass I'm a big bass guy and if you want
that you're definitely gonna get that
here vocals coming in clear but these
will definitely make my bass lovers I'm
very happy and you'll be happy to hear
that this thing has bluetooth 5.0 and it
also has a quick charge feature it's got
30 hours of battery life and if you
happen to kill that you'll be able to
get another two hours of playback with
just five minutes of charging active
noise-cancelling bluetooth with five
minutes of charging getting you two
hours is a really good deal not to
mention it also comes with a hard shell
carrying case if that holds all the
cables that you need for the price these
are an awesome pair of headphones so if
you guys want to go ahead and say 40%
off use the code.you a CB h 0 6 0 and
you get that 40% savings so you got your
dope headphones
and here we have a 4k television with
HDR all the features you come to expect
on a 43 inch display for under 300 bucks
now I went into Best Buy and I was
looking for something sub 250 with 4k
this one was by LG which really caught
my attention because LG makes amazing
televisions and I figured that this was
gonna be a really good pick up and I can
tell you guys I was not disappointed
Smart TV 43 inches 4k HDR everything you
would expect and it looks really good it
doesn't feel or look like a really cheap
television so if you were ever wondering
how do I get my hands on a 4k TV to play
with my xbox 1 X or my PlayStation 4 pro
this is all you need right here and I
think we paid like 280 for this like I
said I was hoping for something like in
the 250 range but 280 still good price
as long as it hit under 300 bucks so
this is a good bye folks
you need 4k in your life this is
something where you can start so a tree
actually just told me that Best Buy has
one for 50 inches that's 300 exactly oh
okay HDR I'll have that link down below
to it so we got the nice 4k TV but maybe
you need something for your computer
maybe you need a nice display possibly a
gaming display 144 Hertz well this right
here is the Asus VG 248 QZ now this is a
24 inch display and it goes for $1.99
which may seem like a lot but if you're
a gamer you know 144 Hertz refresh rate
is something that you want and it also
has a one millisecond response time not
to mention this monitors also got
built-in speakers so you don't have to
buy those if you don't want I definitely
recommend turning up the volume though
doesn't have too much bass but you can
definitely hear whatever content you
want and it even has an adjustable stand
so you can tilt this thing up or down
depending on your preference you can
even turn it over to the side so if
you're a coder or something you'll be
able to do that with no problem and it's
even got like this
whole red and black look to it or black
and red rather so if you're into themes
and you like that color combo thanks
Marcus
for getting everyone on that you will
enjoy this for sure one thing I will
warn though is that you're going to want
to change the standard setting from the
color menu to take it off of the
standard mode hit something like theater
mode or anything else the colors look
way better when you do that or adjust
them yourself overall this is a really
solid monitor especially for the price
now check out the things around it guys
you see a little bit of a a theme going
on over here we got the green black and
green going on this is like a Green
Lantern ish set up now would you believe
that we got all four of these pieces for
just 87 bucks now typically bundles like
this and usually include a keyboard and
a mouse but with this guy you also get a
gaming headset and you get the mousepad
all for under well under a hundred bucks
which i think is a really good value
you've got a keyboard this is the HP
Pavilion gaming keyboard 500 right Ari
alright so we've got the eight people a
gaming keyboard 500 over here and it's a
mechanical keyboard with red switches so
for those red switch lovers out there
you're gonna be able to get that here
and it's customizable you got those RGB
lights in the back can switch to four
different colors so you can switch it up
a depending on the theme you have it's a
pretty comfortable keyboard I'm loving
the fact that it has the number pad so
of course you get all the functionality
that you need out of a keyboard all in
one you also get this pretty comfortable
Mouse this is the omen by HP Mouse 400
you have these really interesting names
here but this is a pretty lightweight
comfortable Mouse you can of course
change the DPI without jumping into any
settings which is nice depending on the
game maybe you're playing a first-person
it is a nice feature to have and of
course the little logo here is
customizable as well so you can change
that red into pretty much any color
what and you also get that mousepad on
at the bottom this is a pretty large
mousepad so if you like having a big
surface that's included which is
actually a really nice bonus but you
also get a gaming headset this is the HP
Pavilion gaming headset 400 but you do
get that it of course has a mic and
everything that you need so you can go
ahead and chat you can adjust the mic I
like that and it also has the mic
controls down here at the bottom so you
can control your volume right on the
cable as well as mute your mic so I love
this bundle like you get everything you
really need and if you have a monitor
like this you can be pretty much set up
you got yourself a PC and everything
that you need to get started for less
than 300 bucks but I want to know what
you guys think about these products if
you guys are interested in more tech you
can actually afford let me know with a
thumbs up and comments down below but
total next video guys is your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
