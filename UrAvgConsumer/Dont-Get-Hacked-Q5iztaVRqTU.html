consumer and today we've got to talk
about hacking now I feel like we got to
do this every once in a while because
everyone usually feels safe on the
internet until they aren't and actually
a few weeks ago the verge did a video
about hackers accessing your information
your webcams and even your microphones
that went pretty viral and even Airi
stumble across this video and got pretty
freaked out she even went as far as
putting a piece of tape on her webcam
which is a solution not the best one but
it's a start so for today's video we're
gonna talk about the best ways to defend
yourself and huge shout outs a bit
defended for sponsoring today's video
and providing us a bunch of information
on cyber security and if you haven't
heard of them they make some killer
cyber protection software so here are a
few tips I want you guys to take away
from this you can do a quick fix we
throw up some tape on your webcam just
like re or even Mark Zuckerberg when
you're browsing any web site just make
sure it has that HTTPS at the front of
the URL especially if you're going to
put in any secure information and kind
of related to the last one you don't
want to access any websites that contain
your personal information if you're on
an open network so that means no
accessing your bank account or making
any crazy purchases when you're on
Starbucks Wi-Fi or even the airport
Wi-Fi another good step to take is to
change your router name if you're using
something like a linked sis or a net
gear router you might as well change the
name so that you can give any potential
hackers just an extra step don't make it
easy for them by any means and this one
may seem obvious but you'd be surprised
by how many people don't actually do it
and that is to keep your apps and all of
your software updated a lot of times
apps get these security patches to help
them be a bit more secure and people
tend to skip those over but you got to
make sure that everything is covered now
all the things that we mentioned so far
our good starting points but one they're
not 100% foolproof and two you don't
always want to actively think about
doing all of those things whenever
you're shopping or browsing online and
that's where BitDefender comes in you
get great software protection and it
helps to keep you protected without you
actively having to think about it check
this out guys a survey of 1,000
Americans by KRC research company found
that 95% of Americans engaged in risky
behavior within the past year online and
about 35% of them have been a
victim of a cyberattack or know someone
who has and what's crazy is that only 1%
of them we're able to say that they
actually currently invest in some kind
of antivirus software and what's great
is that they offer protection for PCs
Macs and even your phones with total
security 2018 both your PC and your Macs
are protected from webcam attacks so you
don't have to run and pull out that tape
the software actually detects if an app
is trying to access your webcam and if
it is it'll block it and let you know
that it's trying to access it and you
can give it permission if you want and
after downloading myself it was pretty
cool to see it in action I actually
downloaded an app so that I can be able
to YouTube stream from it and it tried
to access my webcam and it didn't work
at first and that was because
BitDefender was protecting me and once I
gave him permission it all went through
just fine
it was actually kind of close to coming
to play because I wasn't even testing it
or trying to make it work but it popped
up on its own and sadly there's growing
popularity and something called
ransomware where hackers will target
your important files like your photos
and videos where they'll pretty much
hold them ransom unless you pay it the
money to get them back and BitDefender
automatically protects against that
using their safe files program this way
your important files are protected from
those trying to use them to exploit you
and the software takes it a bit further
when it comes to those public and open
networks it does an analysis in real
time to let you know whether or not the
network you want to access is secure
whether it's public or private so
whenever you're trying to connect to a
network you'll know just how safe it is
and if you tend to do a ton of online
banking and shopping then you might like
they're safe pay feature which is pretty
much their own secure browser so that
you can access your banking information
shopping information and this is pretty
much what they recommend if you plan on
doing any of that kind of stuff so you
don't risk your financial information
and they also offer some other things
like password managers where it'll store
your passwords credit card information
as well as other personal information so
that you don't ever have to go ahead and
input anything it auto fills it for you
so that it does exactly what you're
looking for whenever you need to put it
in all the while keeping it secure and
one part of the suite that helps me to
feel really comfortable is the advanced
threat defense and this identifies
suspicious activity and actively works
to protect your device against even the
most advanced malware and the last
feature I want to mention is the pair
advisor which i think is pretty good to
have on hand because we all know kids
think this much about security whenever
they're online so it's nice to have
something in place so you don't have to
worry about the kids going into
territory online that you know you don't
want them in but overall guys but defend
they're super easy to use it's won a ton
of awards for its design and security
and honestly I just think it's smart to
have these on your devices if big
companies like Yahoo Equifax and all
those other giant corporations can get
hacked you know we can too so definitely
be sure to click the link down below in
the description if you want to get your
hands on BitDefender 2018 and you can
even save yourself 35% off if you click
the link whether it's on their site or
even on Amazon but that about wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you have any other cool
tips on how to be more secure
whenever you're browsing the Internet be
sure to leave a comment down below share
with the community but I'll catch you
guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
