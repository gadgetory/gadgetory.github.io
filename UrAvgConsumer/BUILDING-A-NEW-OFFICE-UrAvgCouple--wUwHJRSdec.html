Beyonce anyway so right now we're in
IKEA and what we're trying to do today
is actually find some stuff because I
got me a new spot on uhq right yeah well
now we are separating work and Tommy the
simple space for just exciting yep I'm
moving out of the offers that you guys
have gotten used to the officers you've
seen most of my videos moving onto
another spot and it's quite the
undertaking right now so right now what
I'm trying to do is actually find the
items for I guess the tech room the New
York office yeah it's what's great is
that like the living room is coming
together very very well so it's exciting
but now it's time to do his tucker which
is gonna be so so cool so we're looking
to get ideas from here
hahaha oh yeah guys so right now we're
trying to find a nice suitable I guess
desk yeah we're looking at counter tops
does yeah the thing is things aren't
like long enough or deep enough for him
so damn anyway they aren't the right
measurements for usage god you kind of
put us in a weird place we're gonna keep
moving I don't know if you guys have
suggestions by the time this vlog is out
maybe I might not have gotten a desk
that will working that off that room yet
so leave some comments down below if you
have some suggestions
so this IKEA is actually connected to a
mall so I jumped in to gamestop
and you know what I don't know man I buy
some games and I never played them
there's always happy to comes to
gamestop he like basil something because
he just wants to pick up something and
then it doesn't land you know it's the
intention of like oh man schemes gonna
be great
just wonder when do you play there's new
Kirby out I'm really obsessed oh yeah
you really did like it I'm in the middle
of playing tales of zestiria that's like
the ps4 game that I'm playing right now
it's this guy right here now if you guys
have any suggestions on games that I
absolutely must play let me know I want
to do The Witcher 3
I still like its brand new sealed and I
haven't opened it yet so that's another
one on the list after tales let me know
if you have any other suggestions though
so Ari picked up pokemon heartgold old
school but this is probably one of my
favorite ones good choice but all right
so stop for some sushi and man need some
big sushi I never saw such despair
and I got I put those something Japanese
soda single tool they go through a whole
process where you pop the top and you
something falls in and it's a lot it's
interesting them taste please Lisa so
guys this thing here's my review this is
the worst bottle it's fun to look at you
know Stu we can barely get anything out
of it
now that's portion control I know the
Japanese are all about portions god it
is frustrating as an American yeah
super-sized alright guys so we're done
here for now yeah this is kind of a fail
we didn't get many things for the tech
guru but we are going out tomorrow to
look at like TJ Maxx and Marshalls
Wallace has a good stuff and hopefully
hopefully find some good stuff there
main things we're looking for I'm
looking for anyway the desk top I guess
and a couch but maybe some gaming chairs
haven't decided what we want to do yet
but that's the plan alright so now we're
headed to CJ max because we still need
to get some furniture for the living
room a little bit nah slight little
trinkets a little like statue clean just
things that make it like a spice it up a
little bit yeah good okay it's a broken
her she knows her stuff
Oh area just sidetracked at us well I
just put us on a sidetrack she wants to
get a loot some luggage cuz she's going
to New Orleans again I need glossy
luggage like this her glossy look so we
cook its cookie that is not good well
cousin we have sloppy years like cookie
dough hey aster anywho she wants to get
one of these
I'm thinking something nice and decent
like this but not she wants to get a
glossy black like what is this I think
it's really nice what are those you're
just gonna have to fill your own way
then I'm getting my own guys look at
what she's recommending what is this God
really well maybe I could do this it's
better than the other stuff you're
picking out there's one hook up my
studio that's all I know look where I am
Oh fine I need it I'm going orleans in
two days I need it
so he's supposed to be helping me find
stuff for the studio but she keeps
getting distracted I found a couple of
things here I got these little tiny or
skinny vases or bosses whatever you want
to call it and I think that these would
look pretty cool on video just having
some nice color in there wish they had
like a yellow or green but that's good
enough I was distracted by all the
wedding stuff
before like oh yeah sure does that have
pearls in them and I have them really
Wow anyhow on the more we have found
much yeah so we went to Marshall sis now
trying to find like cool little pieces
that we could throw in there no go yeah
and if we I'm happy we didn't find
anything because the line was oh that
line nothing would be worth it
yeah wouldn't be worth it yeah joke and
you saw those little vases that we
picked up these little branches could be
pretty cool for it hopefully it fits
though so right now wearing my clothes
and my idea
we found these little cool letters with
light zone and this could be pretty cool
to spell out you a see now the problem
is they don't have a and I'm that's not
too surprising considering a is a very
popular letter but um we're gonna hunt
one down
we're gonna go some other Michaels and
see if we can get that it's gonna be
pretty cool diving the background keep
your fingers crossed
yeah iris clumsy streak does not fail so
she goes touches this thing and drops
one of these frames luckily this thing
isn't made of glass but these things
work linked like it did how do you feel
about yourself right now how does it
feel to consistently drops off every
time we're in a store go ahead that's
something else please let's show the
vlog
I know
big concern here
I'm not
ah
Haga both is your party so I forgive you
so we are here at the studio and this is
just a quick sneak peek of some stuff in
here it's a mess in here as it should be
since you're getting stuff all together
yeah
working on it working on it so we're
just putting together a couple of nice
things that we picked up over at where
was it Tina Maxx Marshalls of Thomas not
from Ikea so once you get this place all
situated well an official tour to me
guys to see you a see each heist we
should have a ribbon-cutting ceremony as
a desert okay it's much so Ana's finally
graduating from Law School look at this
one over here she's a hot mess
why the hilarious we get your mirror I
wish I only gonna wipe out there I put
our makeup today guys like it makes no
sense I knew this is going to happen buy
stuff no makeup it smell like time to
diminish okay Missy we're greedy because
we're having dinner
be ready
alright guys so right now I am going to
be trying to hook up this cable
management luckily for this setup
there's not gonna be a lot going on let
me turn this down a little I love this
song though anyway so cookie
I just got an itch anyway for this setup
I'm not gonna have a lot of cables
running around probably just the one
from this iPhone dock this hard drive
and my iMac so there's only three cables
so I've got a small little blue lounge
cable box so I'm gonna conceal the
cables and I've got some velcro so that
I can keep the cables together I might
need a little bit of tape to tape them
along the desk the back of the desk so
that you know they're just not visible I
am by knowing a cable management freak
so this is probably the most involved
I'll get in terms of cable management uh
this is just for this area when I get to
the other room I know that's going to be
super hectic because I have a lot plan
yeah so I'm going to work on that and
I've got a couple of things to post up
too like some art so got some art here
that is going to be going up as well so
these are the little things that it you
know goes into making this spot look
nice
look at this dinky monitor that I've got
over here now I'm showing you guys a lot
more than you should be seen I'm showing
but it but it's alright
but right now I've got this little
monitor this is the game's monitor you
guys taught me unboxing big massive
gadget haul till I get a big screen TV
I'm trying to get a 65 inch TV here I'm
trying to get that in here but uh yeah
so far so good and another little thing
that we got here is this guy this is the
Xbox one with Kinect now as you can see
this is a refurbished model and I have
no shame in saying I got a refurbished
one because we're primarily going to be
using it for the Kinect now as you know
me and airy the Kinect has changed the
way we an area watch television and use
our TV so we had to have one in here
because you know we need to say Xbox on
and turn on the whole thing so I had to
get one for here that's going to be set
up in the living room the other room is
going to have my main Kinect but what am
I going to be using at home
another refurbished Xbox go to gallery
yeah but yeah this is our solution for
right now so this is a much cheaper
option than buying it brand new
so let's look this up to this dinky
little monitor well is dinky only
because a real TV should be here I need
to get I need to get these posted and
I've got some cool stuff that I want to
go over this couch over here on this
wall so I've got a lot to work on and I
just really can't wait for the big
reveal what I think I'm gonna do alright
so you guys get to vote I was thinking
about doing a room tour a show just
everything that makes this UAC HQ or I
can show you guys the three different
rooms that I'm going to set up since
that way I can give a little more
attention to each room and things that
are in it and you know you guys can see
like that or do you guys want to see
everything all in one video let me know
I think I think I'm leaning towards
three because I think that you guys
would benefit from seeing you know all
the little things that make Dee that's
going to make this office pretty cool
but in you guys I'm gonna get back to
work I'm going to set this up hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video
re is out at some bridal shower so she's
gone so I'll catch you guys in the next
one next week

to the videos but we are back I've got
some cool stuff coming up I worked on a
lot of cool projects that I have come

see that but till the next one guys
