want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone is your average consumer today
I review for you guys on the PS Vita
portable charger
alright let's not waste any time let's
get right into it alright guys so here
we have the PS Vita portable charger now
this thing is an amazing product and I'm
really surprised that this thing hasn't
been getting more publicity it's um
never been on any of the websites that I
usually look at and look for from
accessories for my PS Vita I never
really ever saw this out or displayed
and it wasn't until I went into a Sony
store that I found this on the shelf so
I picked it up when I saw that this
thing is so small but carries five
thousand milliamp serve um battery juice
I guess and that's that's crazy to me
because this thing is tiny but it holds
so much juice in there now in case you
guys don't know what you know five
thousand milliamp so juice I'm saying of
juice because I'm not sure what else you
would say after that but everybody knows
what battery juice is so this holds five
thousand milliamps of battery juice now
to put into perspective my cell phone
here has some great battery life and
this has 1650 milliamps of battery juice
so this has five thousand that means
this thing can charge my cell phone
three times completely like this can
charge my cell phone to 100% three times
without this look needing another charge
so on a full charge this thing gets
three extra charges and for the PS Vita
itself it gets one and a half extra
charges so that's amazing the fact that
this thing is so tiny and portable it's
just it's just crazy to me and the thing
I love about this is it charges
everything so quickly because this thing
uses a USB any product that you have
that uses a USB cord to charge will work
with it
and it really charges everything so
quickly it's amazing I just really
haven't showed you guys a close-up yet
let me give you a closer look at what
this thing looks like and here you have
the PS Vita portable charger as you can
see this thing is really nice very
simple design very small fits in your
hands with no problems and it comes in
this like nice little square form factor
which makes it really easy to store
somewhere and you give it a look around
you see nothing special hanging out or
anything crazy about it it's very very
simple look down here you see where you
actually charge it and this needs the PS
Vita USB cable to charge right here and
up top is where you plug in your USB to
any device and it'll charge it from
there when you turn this thing on you
will see that it comes up with a little
red light indicating that it's ready to
charge something and when you're
charging it that light turns green so
that it shows you that it's ready to get
up come off the charger alright guys so
now that I've told you a bit about it
and you've seen it up close I don't want
to let you know this is a really great
product if you worried about the battery
life on your PS Vita you no longer have
to with this thing you can play to your
heart's content at full brightness as
long as you want Wi-Fi on anything you
want and not worry about it dying and if
it does die put the bad boy right in and
you're good to go you can charge it
leave it in your backpack or the pocket
whatever you will have it and just let
it charge for a little bit and the fact
that the PS Vita charges so quickly and
the fact that this gives off energy so
fast it's just a win-win you get you'll
be back to playing your games within I'm
sure a few minutes you or you can even
play wow you can even charge it while
you're playing since the USB cable
doesn't obstruct the playing for the PS
Vita as you can see here I can continue
to play all I want if I wanted to and
not have to worry about you know the
portable charger bothering me
so it's definitely really good
investment I believe even if you don't
own a PS Vita I think that this is
something any gadget lover would
definitely just love to have in their
backpack or in their pocket anywhere I
happen to have these small little USB
cables that I can take here plug it up
to my cell phone and then like this I
can just have it right here just like
this and put this in my pocket and let
it charge now this has been great for me
because I can charge it on the go and it
doesn't obstruct anything so definitely
worth the investment guys if you're not
a gamer or anything in your the product
that you have your iPod your cell phone
what's surprising to me is this thing
even charges the iPad the iPad doesn't
get charged when it's plugged into a PC
so that's just really something to me so
this just tells you that this is giving
off a lot of juice all at once and it
has five thousand milliamp some juice so
it's going to be charging a lot of
things all the way to full and then some
so I definitely recommend this guys Vita
or not if you have if you love your
gadgets and you're worried about battery
life for anything definitely worth the
investment it's only fifty bucks now I
don't think fifty bucks is a lot of
money for a couple of charges of your
cell phone as well as on the form factor
that this thing comes in so I definitely
suggest it guys this has been my review
