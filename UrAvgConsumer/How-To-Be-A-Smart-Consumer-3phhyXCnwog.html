consumer and today I have a bit of a
different video is not necessarily a
review or an unboxing but more so some
tips that I have on how to be a smart
consumer as you can tell by the title so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it now the first tip I have for you
guys is to do your research doing your
research is probably one of the most
important aspects of being a smart
consumer and that's probably why some of
you are already subscribed to a channel
like mine or watch videos like it you
guys are watching to see reviews on
products that you intend to purchase or
you want to purchase and you just want
to make sure it's worth your money so
you guys already have a foot in the door
but I highly suggest if you know you're
purchasing something definitely do as
much research as possible read reviews
online from different users watch
reviews from people on YouTube like
myself all kinds of stuff so just make
sure you're really doing that part and
you'll be well aware of what you're
getting yourself into
now the next tip I have for you guys is
think about how you're gonna use that
product daily so you really want to do
this so he can kind of get some insight
into how you're gonna be using this
thing and what exactly you'll be you
looking for on a day to day basis so by
thinking about how you're gonna use it
day 1 day 2 day 3 you're gonna be
thinking about what kind of features
you're looking for to satisfy it those
days so that's really a good tip to keep
in mind how you want to use it daily
because it will narrow down your
features or whatever you're looking for
in that product and you can kind of hone
in on what exactly you're looking for
and also if you're on the fence about a
product if you think about how you're
gonna use it daily you can kind of think
of whether or not it's going to actually
be worth it so if it's something that
you wanted like you see everyone with it
or something
but you trying to think about how you're
gonna use it daily and you just can't
see how you'll be using it like let's
say a tablet so it'll kind of push you
off the fence towards making that
purchase because you'll realize that you
probably really don't need it now my
next tip is to focus on the
when you're reading your reviews or
doing your research now the reason I say
that is because you'll have no surprises
when you get the actual product there
won't be any real shocking values when
you get the product and it starts acting
funny or something like that because
you'll be well aware of that and you'll
know if it's a defect or not also
another thing about cons is if there's
not necessarily a defect or in it's just
a bad aspect of the product in general
maybe it's too slim maybe it's too thick
something like that you can kind of see
whether or not you're willing to deal
with that so definitely pay attention to
the cons cuz just because someone might
think something is a con doesn't mean
you'll find it to be a con so if I think
the iPad Mini is too big you might think
that it's just the right size so if
that's the only bad aspect that I'm
bringing up in a review then that means
that product will probably be really
great for you as there really aren't any
negatives that you won't be able to deal
with now my next tip is a little harder
to do but with some really good thinking
you can probably figure it out knowing
your reviewer and knowing what level of
standards they have if you're looking
for a product and someone who's a
professional says it's terrible
that doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna
be terrible for you so you really want
to find something that you can relate to
or someone that has the same level of
expectations as yourself now if I were
to be looking for a review on a
microwave I just want the microwave to
make my food hot if I'm reading a review
by a chef who's really upset that the
microwave won't heat up the food to 93
degrees Fahrenheit I don't know
something if I see that and I just think
about whoa that's a really bad review it
can't do that I'm not gonna buy it
that'd be pretty foolish because I don't
necessarily need that exact temperature
that a chef is looking for I just want
my food hot so I can eat it so you
really just want to keep in mind who
you're getting your information from and
does it match what your expectations are
from a product now my next little tip on
being a smart kind
isn't necessarily about being a smart
consumer but just something I feel
personally um when you're doing your
research and you're really thinking
about buying a product and you're doing
all this look you're looking into it
very heavily you kind of feel like
invested in that product you kind of
really want it so i really suggest that
if you're not able to afford that
product just yet save up for it I really
don't feel that you should settle for a
lesser product if you not if you don't
really have your heart set on it so I'm
all for saving up your money and really
getting that one product that you really
want of course you can settle for less
and you know pay a little less than what
you're looking for but with that comes
potential buyer's remorse
you don't want to regret that you bought
that item instead of what you really
wanted you might find yourself always
really looking at that product
regardless of the new product that you
got instead so I really say you know
save up your money penny pinch if you
have to and get that product that you
really have your eye on now another
thing you want to keep in mind is when
you're buying a product and if you one
of those people who want to be up with
the latest and greatest definitely be
sure of when newer products in that line
are coming out because that can lead to
some serious buyer's remorse and for
those of you don't know abayas remorse
is this when you feel regretful for
buying a product and you end up you know
just feeling regretful about it so we
want to avoid that at all costs so
definitely make sure you know when a
product is coming out that's something
you got to do your research on as well
know when something new is coming out I
know so for some people like app for
Apple buyers it's really hard since
Apple's like switching up the schedule
nowadays it's kind of hard to tell those
who bought the iPad 3 probably thought
they had a whole year before the iPad 4
came out then Apple kind of blindsided
everyone and dropped the iPad for a
couple of months later so it's things
like that you can't really help but if
you know that something follows a
certain cycle or you're hearing rumors
about a new product coming out soon
you hold a gas on what you're purchasing
you really want to make sure that the
new
thing isn't going to be that much better
or if you really want to what you're
gonna plan on getting now that's fine if
you don't care about what's coming out
in the future that's great go ahead and
purchase it but if you're one of those
people that say oh man I shoulda waited
then really do your research and find
out if anything in that line is coming
out soon because you don't want to have
that feeling now another thing about
being a smart consumer I feel that if
you purchase something and you find that
you don't like it or there's a slight
defect definitely feel free to return
that product as soon as possible as long
as you're in your window of return so
usually it's 14 days 30 days some places
definitely definitely return it at the
slightest thing me personally I feel
that if my product isn't perfect right
out of the box
I'm gonna return it there's no reason
for me to keep a defective product or a
product with a slight defect there's no
reason for I paid a lot of money
I'm going to make sure I get the best
product available for that price and I
highly urge all of you if you feel like
something as a defect return it exchange
it for a new one and go with that
there's no reason for you to spend a lot
of money if you're investing in
something and not getting a perfect
product right out the box
now if the place you're purchasing a
product from has insurance that might be
something to consider me personally I do
like having insurance on my products
just so I can have that cushion of
knowing that if something goes wrong I
can exchange it I'm a big fan of making
sure my products work and that I can
always go back and get something
functional for the money that I paid for
it
now some people I know who think this is
a scam the whole insurance thing is a
scam and try to avoid it out at all
costs but it's definitely something you
might want to look into for things that
have like a low life cycle like
headphones I always make sure I get
insurance on my headphones because
everyone knows that headphone cables
mess up or things happen and you know
you just can't account for everything so
you really want to have that could
and you won't have to worry about
something going wrong and then you've
been stuck with that product so I really
highly suggest it it's worth the
investment on in my opinion but it might
not be for yours and that's okay but I
it's just one of my tips and that pretty
much wraps up my tips on how to be a
smart consumer I know is a lot to
swallow right there but those are some
good things to keep in mind when you're
looking at a product and you're
purchasing it and what to do after you
purchase it things like that now just
because we're average consumers doesn't
necessarily mean that we don't deserve
the best of what we want so I really
hope that these tips help you out in
making a purchasing decision and doing
research to find the product that fits
your needs and what to do with them
afterwards and alright guys this is your
average consumer till the next video
