consumer and today I have a review for
you guys of the beats by dre executives
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it and here we have the Beats
executives right off the bat it's easy
to see that these are the classiest
looking pair of headphones that Beats By
Dre has come out with but before we get
into that let's talk about the case they
come in here we have the hard shell
carrying case of the executives it's got
a pretty simple flat rectangular design
and as we give it a look around we can
see that it has some of the same accents
that the other beats carrying cases have
such as the red lining for the zipper
it's also got a matte finish that looks
and feels pretty nice although it can
get some fingerprints as you can see on
the back there it's a similar case to
the studio's but it has a much flatter
design but I'm pretty sure that's due to
the executive branding and here's a
quick example of why that might matter
beats by dre seems to be targeting the
more adult crowd with these headphones
and the way you carry them seems to be a
factor as well as you can see here these
fit quite nicely into my work bag I can
seamlessly carry it without the excess
bulk some other cases might produce and
here you'll see how bulky the carrying
case of the studios will make my work
bag look bees by dre definitely seem
like they're trying to cater to the
older crowd
aka executives with the design of these
headphones in case when we get a look
inside the case we're greeted by an
awkwardly placed pair of executives I'm
a fan of the overall design and look of
the case but I do have my gripes with it
as well the case doesn't have a pouch
anywhere on it to store your headphone
cables so they're always being pretty
loose inside also because of the flat
design you'll have to place the
headphones in a not so convenient way
luckily there's a little diagram inside
to always remind you of how you need to
place it the hard shell does offer some
good protection though so I can't be too
mad at that and now the star of the show
as I mentioned before the executives are
the classiest pair of headphones that
Beats has released so far
as they're supposed to cater to the
adult crowd you don't find any flashy
red here let's take a closer look at the
right side of these headphones at the
top you'll notice the switch that powers
these bad boys on and I'm sorry to break
it to you guys but without batteries
these headphones will not operate this
is one of my biggest gripes with the
studios and it's unfortunate that they
carry this over to the executives on the
left side you'll find the latch that
opens the door to the battery
compartment and what's pretty cool about
this compartment is that it doesn't have
to twist to be closed or anything it's
usually actually uses magnets which is
pretty cool
on the outside of the ear cups you'll
find a nice leather ish finish around
the B that is typically red but it's
grey in the case of the executives the B
on the left side also works as a mute
button for your music just like the
studio's as you move up the headphones
you'll notice the hinges say executive
which is almost miserable if you're not
looking too closely as we move along to
the band you'll note that it only says
beats at the top instead of the normal
beats by dr. dre the band is very soft
on the outside but as you press onto it
a little you'll find that it's pretty
sturdy inside and this offers some great
comfort for long periods of listening
moving back down to the headphones we'll
get a closer look at the actual ear cups
that will be around your ears these are
over your headphones so the ear cups
will completely circle your ears inside
they're made of the same soft material
as the band so there's great comfort
here for those long listening sessions I
can even imagine this material keeping
your ears warm in the cold the drivers
on these headphones which are pretty
much the speakers for those who aren't
familiar with the term actually have a
portion that protrudes a bit that might
cause some discomfort to some although
it hasn't bothered me at all also
because the headphones are made of an
aluminum material you don't have to
worry about the ear cups clanking
against the actual headphones or
anything like that because of this nice
little material strip that they put
there to kind of stop it from doing that
all in all I'm very happy with the
comfort build quality and overall design
of these headphones but now to talk
about the sound quality the sound
quality is what you would expect from
these headphones as an average
these sounded just great to me they
offer great clarity and some great bass
to go with it although I must say I'm
not pleased with the active
noise-cancelling feature the headphones
give off a loud hissing sound once you
turn them on and unfortunately it can
sometimes carry over into the music this
is quite a bother at times as it can be
a bit distracting I'm used to hearing
the Hispano is canceling headphones
without music but this was a little too
loud with and without music now that
doesn't mean that these headphones have
bad sound quality it simply means that
the active noise cancelling is quite
loud the bass is still very prominent
with these headphones but it's a bit
more reserved compared to the base of
the studios even as a bass head I wasn't
dissatisfied with the amount of bass
that was provided I do believe that this
is more of a conservative sound that
goes with the whole executive theme and
not wanting to have a loud attention
drawing sound to it speaking of
attention drawing these do quite well in
the sound leaking department I had a
colleague of mine let me know she could
hear my music on a train at 50% 75% and
100% volumes and she only slightly heard
it at 100% but of course we were on a
train so be sure to check out my
girlfriend test video if you'd like more
information on sound leakage and sound
isolation overall I'm very satisfied
with the sound quality the DS produced
but it's just unfortunate that the
active noise-cancelling produce such a
loud hiss that bothered me at times so
now I'm going to show you guys what it
looks like around the neck and when I
put it on so this is it around the neck
got a good look at how it looks and here
is when it's on you see her from the
front her hair sides and overall like I
said these are a nice looking pair of
headphones very nice style I do wish
that it came with a black cable though
the red just doesn't really go with the
whole gray aluminum look and it's it
kind of moves away from what they're
trying to do with the whole executive
look so I do wish it came with the black
cable but overall like I said I'm very
pleased with these head
I just kind of wish that the
noise-canceling was it as hissy as it is
but overall that's about it for this
review guys if you enjoyed it please
