consumer and this is a real danger lies
with the iPhone 10 and for those of you
who have never seen one of my real
day-in-the-life videos you're pretty
much gonna be spending a day with me and
the iPhone 10 and we're gonna see how it
is to use it in the real world so we're
gonna be testing out all kinds of things
like the new screen those gestures face
ID the battery life all the stuff you
want to know so let's see how it does
alright guys so it is the start of the
day I've got the iPhone 10 at 100%
battery right now now as you guys can
see I'm using a case because any sane
person would with this phone but so I
can give you guys an authentic review
and idea of what it's like to actually
use the phone I'm gonna go caseless
which is dangerous because of this glass
back but but we're gonna see how it does
but I did wake up to a bunch of email so
I'm gonna show you guys what typing is
like and what it's like to use this big
ol screen for everyday things and Aries
got her iPhone 10 as well so she's gonna
share her thoughts she is taking a
selfie right now good job
so like I said I did have some emails I
took care of them but just to give you
an idea of what typing on here is like
on an app that doesn't have full iPhone
10 support you get these black borders
at the top and bottom so you know typing
is pretty normal I can't even see what
I'm typing cuz I'm looking at my camera
but typing is pretty normal on here but
if you go to an app like my message or
something you can see a full keyboard so
right now you guys can see my GrubHub
thread and this is what a full iPhone 10
supported app looks like
especially when you pull out the
keyboard it's pretty standard like what
you saw with the third-party but now at
the bottom you have this border that
holds the button for multiple keyboards
and the microphone since I have multiple
keyboards on my phone you get that globe
button but Harry
she has just an emoji icon here because
she only has the stock so stock keyboard
and the emojis so it looked like a
dedicated emoji button alright guys
don't mind the mess here
I feel like I say this every time but
don't mind the mess we're about to set
up for another video you'll probably see
that throughout the day but let's talk a
little bit more about the feel in the
hand so I'm coming from an iPhone 8 plus
in terms of what I use typically with an
iPhone so going to this it feels like an
easy transition now you do have to get
used to the longer screen but that's not
a big deal at all just having this for a
few days now touching the plus makes it
feel like a big phone this feels like
quite a larger phone and I just want to
chime in here because I'm coming from
the iPhone 8 and as you guys know that
is a smaller phone in this this is not
that much bigger but once I started
messing around with my 10 I started I
started to really feel the difference so
I took just suggestion I got a pop
socket so for me the pop socket has been
really helpful in terms of swiping from
the top that's it the control center
that was really difficult for me before
but now it's super easy people might
make fun of you for the pop socket but
what's that if it works it works I like
it that's not to say that would have
never adjusted to it because I guess
humans we adapt and I probably would
have adjusted to the size but just this
helped me with the adjustment period so
now it's like about 12 o'clock I've got
to go ahead and jump on an hour long
conference call which is gonna be so
much fun but I'll be talking on the
phone for an hour so I'll let you guys
know what the battery is like if it has
any real impact I'm at ninety percent
right now oh I just shoot that video of
that be there was this be on the car and
it just wouldn't it wouldn't move even
though we were driving so I was shot a
long video waiting for it to fall off
and it never happened so thankfully the
call ended up only being thirty minutes
and I'm at 87% so that's like a three
percent drop well I was at ninety right
yeah so three percent drop not bad we'll
see how long it lasts throughout the
rest of the day though so right now I'm
testing the front-facing camera on the
10
I've got my Z board with me I'm actually
right in front of a McDonald's and the
Sun is actually looking pretty good with
a lot of clouds in front of it I think
this would make for a great HDR shot so
I'm gonna snap a quick picture so we did
get some pretty good HDR shots the
McDonald's was well lit there's a ton of
Sun right now so I figure I think right
now
I'll try taking a portrait mode selfie
okay so I got some pretty good selfies
but now it's time to test out the
optical image stabilization on both the
rear camera lenses
alright guys so it's about 441 right now
and I've got 60% battery left that's
with some camera shots me using the
phone for emailing quite a bit and just
being on it now I know a lot of you are
probably wondering how well did the face
ID actually work and I gotta say for me
it's been working out pretty well but it
isn't perfect honestly I do think touch
ID was pretty perfect every time I tried
to open my phone I opened my phone this
one you pretty much realize you're
opening your phone every time you try to
use face ID might be because it's just a
new process sometimes I do have to hit
that side button again to make a scan my
face and then I can unlock it so it's
those little things that kind of make
you aware that you're actually trying to
get into your phone maybe with time
it'll get better so we'll see how it
pans out with some more time now
something I really like about face ID is
the fact that it gives you increased
privacy so when i unlock my screen like
this if anyone else does it they're just
seeing this they're not gonna see the
content of what my notifications are
until it actually scans my face and then
you can actually see what's inside of
here so I like that a lot and then I can
go in and see whatever is going on now
just so you guys know you don't have to
have the camera all up in your face if
you're trying to unlock your phone you
can actually just come over if it's
laying on a desk or something take a
look at it and then it'll unlock it so
if you need to just quickly glance at
your phone loss on your desk and you've
got notifications or something you can
just do this take a look and then it'll
do that but you have to have a certain
feature on for it so right here we have
a setting called require attention for
face ID and when you have this thing on
you do have to look directly at the
phone so that it'll unlock it making it
way more secure but if you want to be
able to unlock your phone with a glance
you can just turn it off that's kind of
how I have it right now just so that I
can jump into the phone a little bit
quicker I don't want to have to pull the
phone up to my face or anything so I'm
glad that Apple offers this option in
case you don't want to hold the phone up
too high and look directly at it when
you want to unlock it and I for one
who's like really excited for face ID
but I ran into a couple of issues when I
first got it so when I first opened my
phone and started the whole setup
process I have you know it was ready for
bed so I had like my headscarf on my
glasses
leap but I really had a hard time
identifying my face when I didn't have
like my headscarf on or when I had my
glasses on so I just went through the
whole set of process again and it works
it's been working a lot better since
then what I found has been a lot easier
when I go to open my phone if I just
start swiping as I'm looking at my phone
it unlocks faster so let's see if you
guys can see that so I just like lift it
up and swipe and then just unlocks that
way as opposed to like having that pause
where I'm just like let's get up looking
at it and swiping up so if you have the
iPhone time just a little trick there
don't be wrong my way is better but I
will say I really do think it is
learning because after having it for
some time
I noticed I'm able to still wear my
glasses and have my headscarf on it's
not having those same issues that it was
having like the first hour that I had it
alright guys so right now we're in
Walgreens we're here to pick up a
birthday card for Aries dad's whose
birthday just passed but this looks
pretty interesting so I figured why not
take a shot of it take a look at the
back camera look at this guy he's all
slumped over let's make sure we got the
right exposure boom I gotta say this is
a lot of detail here and this is similar
to the iPhone 8 plus an 8 scammer so you
know the quality is gonna be there you
know that you can zoom in and still see
a lot of detail which is nice colors are
gonna be good 10 has a good camera
pretty safe to say and since we do have
little Cookie Monster over here I
figured we might as well take a selfie
take advantage of the moment there's
actually a pretty good selfie is it
working no this is important I should
try portrait mode so look at that a shot
let's just do cookie how about that
cookie ready ready for your close-up
oh that's a good selfie for cookies used
to get picky now in terms of quality I
think it looks pretty good her face came
out nice and clear her background is all
blurred out looks solid
alright guys so right now me and Ari are
headed to an Xbox event which should be
pretty fun we're actually headed to the
Train right now so we'll be there in
about an hour so of course while we're
on the train he has to be watching
something but everyone talks about the
knotch
and honestly guys like I'm the pickiest
person but what a lot of people yeah it
doesn't bother me it really really
doesn't bother me at all
one thing about this whole notch and
video thing that there aren't a lot of
video apps that take advantage of the
entire display a lot of them are gonna
look like this where you're not gonna
see that anyway and it's like using a
basic iPhone right so that kind of sucks
because you buy the phone for the screen
yeah yeah but like that'll come soon in
the meantime is not like bothering me
yeah
but either way with it or without it I'm
not honored by this at all yeah what
what what am I not seeing over here
honestly I'm more entranced by how my
sis all looks with just the thin bezels
and everything I like that way more and
then this bothers me and if it not
bother you then you can always go back
fixed I was honestly fine with the
essential phone having a little camera
in the middle I didn't think that was a
big deal and I don't think it's a big
deal here as oh so Aaron what are your
thoughts on the iPhone 10 so far yes
yeah we're doing this what's going on
how much is Apple paying you so quick
battery update it is 749 right now and
we've got about 25% battery left so
Dave's pretty much over for a lot of
people around this time and I feel like
I've been using it
moderately as I would have me normal day
and that's been doing for you alright
this definitely isn't a mind-blowing
percentage to be at right now but it's a
pretty average the yellow cab City but
alright guys so right now we are in a
taxi in New York but they do have an
Apple pay terminal here so when we pay
for this
I'm going to show you guys the gesture
to actually get Apple pay going and how
it works with like face ID and all that
dark cab face ID Apple pay it's a good
combo here so I'm double tapping the
side button
Apple pay comes up and read my read my
face already
and now I just hold in the other
terminal all done
good to go so with that right there you
guys got to see how fast Apple pay was
all I have to do is double tap the side
button to scan my face and I barely even
had to really get it close to the
terminal and then they paid for it so
that was super fast and super simple so
we made it we are at the Xbox 1x launch
event check this out
there are a bunch of people here we've
got a bunch of Xboxes over here
and the one X right there I heard it
right now would be a pretty good time to
get a low-light camera shot I'm probably
going to try and do it with this
controller over here
I'm gonna grab this for just a second
I'm gonna get you in the shot Harry this
actually looks really good yeah yeah and
there really isn't a lot of light here
all right so just get yourself in with
these guys got Andrew Edwards over here
and mr. bored at work looking at lowlife
stuffy nose
on the dark
so this is a shot we got with the flash
it looks pretty good now I don't take a
lot of pictures with flash of any sort
but in this situation
else all right guys so our day is almost
done well we still got a lot of work to
do right Ari but we're on our way back
you came to see Erica so dark right now
but but we've got about 14% battery left
and it's 1052 at night so this thing is
done well for a regular day full of work
just you know straight up using the
phone and you know even going out and
being social and for the sake of giving
you guys a number here we've got 6 hours
and 20 minutes of usage so take it for
what you will that's not straight up
screen on time I guess but it is a
number of usage so background processes
and you know just using the phone 6
hours and 20 minutes so not bad and that
was pretty much my day now the iPhone 10
is hugely different from previous
iPhones so there's a lot to talk about
and the first thing I want to talk about
is that new OLED display that looks
amazing I personally love it it gets
bright its vibrant colors look great on
it and with that nearly basilis display
this thing's ready to compete with a lot
of the other 2017 flagships now let's
adjust a notch I know a lot of people
keep talking about it some people even
poke fun at it but honestly it is not a
big deal for me it kind of disappears
once you get used to using the phone
just like when I had the essential phone
it had a little notch for its camera
that didn't bother me at all and even
Ari who uses her phone for about 99
percent of her content consumption
wasn't bothered by it at all
now when it comes to gestures and
navigating the phone it might take some
time to remember all of them but you get
used to it pretty quickly I find it
really easy to swipe between apps and
going home I think is pretty intuitive
but I won't say I'm not too crazy about
how you close apps now I feel like they
added a couple of extra steps by having
you hold down the app that you want to
close and then swiping up or maybe even
pressing that little button in the top
left that to me just feels like it just
slows everything down before all you
have to do is open up your app windows
swipe up and you're done but on the
bright side I am getting used to the
control center being at the top right a
lot quicker than I expected once you get
used to it you're pretty much good
overall even though some things take
some getting used to I like having too
that to something new with the iPhone it
helps the experience to feel a bit
different in the past upgrading to a new
iPhone meant little incremental updates
unless there was like a real breakout
feature like touch ID or maybe those
dual cameras but even then those still
felt incremental but now we have what
feels like an entirely new device now as
for the rear camera it's good you can
absolutely plus some really colorful
detail shots which all tend to have a
warm characteristic which is something
that I've seen with the iPhones of 2017
and both lenses now feature optical
image stabilization and on the telephoto
lens it was just okay I don't think
you'll get as good a results as you will
with the wide-angle and the front-facing
camera is just as good as what we saw
with the 8 and 8 plus there is now that
portrait mode feature with the 10 it is
still in beta so there's still some
kinks to work out but I do wish the
edges around the subject of the portrait
selfie were a bit sharper and a lot of
the pictures that I took they looked a
little bit soft or blurred out and that
front-facing camera also gives us access
to those new an emojis and you didn't
really see us use that because it's
honestly not a big part of our day but I
think as more people pick up the iPhone
10 we could see the popularity of that
grow quite a bit and if you've been on
Twitter at all you know that some other
youtubers are like living in emojis
right now so there's some really good
funny stuff out there which I think a
lot of people can enjoy now when it
comes to battery life I think it's
pretty ok it was able to last me
throughout the entire day with moderate
usage but if you're a power user or
someone who's just on their phone
constantly
you might find yourself charging it in
the middle of the day it's not quite as
impressive with the A+ but you do have
access to fast charging as well as
wireless charging if you wanted to be
able to charge it up during the day I
feel like those are some nice really
convenient ways to charge your phone but
so far it's been alright now a lot of
people ask me is it worth the thousand
bucks and I say if you're in the market
and you're even considering spending
that kind of money on this phone if you
buy it you're not gonna be disappointed
it is a great phone but I don't think
anybody should go broke for this phone
or any phone for that matter so if
spending that much money is going to be
a problem don't do it overall though the
iPhone 10 is one of my favorite
flagships of the year because it changes
up how you use the iPhone which is
something I'm definitely here for and
kind of like I said before upgrading is
always fun but it hasn't felt
this excited about upgrading since the
Plus versions of the iPhone came out but
if you're on the fence about picking up
the iPhone I personally say go for it
I like the phone quite a bit and if the
gestures are something you don't want to
get used to you don't like the face ID I
don't know if you don't like something
about it there's still always the 8 and
8 plus which are new flagship so this
year but just with the more traditional
iPhone style but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it and if you did be the cool
guy or girl that goes this video thumbs
up I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
