average consumer and today we're gonna
be going over the brand new Google
camera app and we're going to take a
look at the interface as well as some of
the new features found on it
what are those features being able to
blur out the background of the photos
you take so we're gonna be comparing
that to the HTC One m8 as well just to
see if you really do need dual cameras
in order to have that effect come out
successfully so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it and alright guys
so here I have my Nexus 5 and right down
here you can see the new Google camera
app and this is available in the Google
Play Store you can just type in Google
camera or it's probably a bit easier to
find it by going into another Google app
and then just seeing all the apps that
Google has available and it's probably
at the bottom of the list and that's
because there are tons of camera apps
out there so it's gonna be really pretty
hard to find but it's available to all
Android devices that are running KitKat
so if you have KitKat you can just jump
on and download it even if you have a
Galaxy s5 or HTC One whatever device you
have as long as you've got KitKat you
can download it which is really really
cool so when you actually go into the
app first thing you might notice is this
big block of blacks here and before we
go on I just want to note that all of my
model kits here my Gundam model kits are
here they're gonna be my test subjects
for a couple of camera shots so you guys
are gonna see them in the background as
well and this huge black bar right here
is pretty much a shutter button you can
tap anywhere on it and you'll be able to
take a picture now I don't know why they
made it this large it's really intrusive
most of the screen real estate is taken
up by this so if we actually go through
the video option you can see how much of
the video how much of the picture is
actually taken out here you can still
see it but it's a bit transparent at
least so you can kind of see what's
going on in the back and when you
actually press the button it actually
disappears so you can see the full
screen right here but when you're taking
a picture this is a 4 by 3 resolution so
it says it's pretty close to a square
it's very very limited you probably
won't like that in comparison to the old
camera app now what's interesting about
this app is that when you download it
from the Play Store it's going to erase
the original camera app that's on your
Google Play edition device or your Nexus
device so this is gonna be your new
interface altogether but if you have a
galaxy s5 or an HTC One any other device
that doesn't have the stock camera app
you're actually gonna have access to
both of them so here you can see the
original camera app for the TouchWiz and
the camera app that I just downloaded
from Google so you can use both you can
switch between the two and what this
also means is that you get all the
features that the new camera app has on
pretty much any device so features that
were once limited to Google Play edition
devices and Nexus devices such as
photosphere are now available to anyone
that can run kick-out on their device so
I think that's really really cool that
Google did this and it's really bringing
the stock Android experience to really
all devices that are going to be able to
support them and running you know KitKat
and things of that nature so it's really
cool that Google is doing this you're
pretty much soon gonna be able to have
stock and Android on any device so I'm
really liking that but going back to
this now photosphere I think we're
pretty much familiar with this and for
those who aren't familiar with
photosphere you're gonna be able to take
a picture by pointing this in a bunch of
different angles and it'll capture the
picture and pretty much all the
different angles and create a
photosphere like it's called so you can
actually keep going on and on and get a
really large photo here but that's
pretty standard that's been out for
quite some time now but it's really cool
that now other devices like the HTC One
and the galaxy s5 are gonna be able to
do this and also there's panorama which
I think a ton of devices have now so
that's pretty simple you take a very
wide shot so you can get a lot in one
picture and then you have lens blur
which is the new kid on the block also
before we go into that we also have the
regular camera and video options
well so if you want to take a picture a
normal picture or a normal video you can
switch to one of those but now we have
lens blur and this is the new feature
that when you take a picture is going to
blur out the background and kind of give
you a SLR like quality picture and what
this means is you're gonna get more bulk
at and what book it is is that blurry
background and with the blurry
background people typically think that
that picture is more
professional-looking due to the blurry
background and that's one of the big
features that the HTC One m8 is touting
so it's pretty interesting down that
that any Kit Kat device has actually
access to this so all you have to do to
take a picture is actually press it and
then it'll say slowly raise your device
keep subject centered you don't
typically just want to tilt the device
upward because it's going to say that
the frame is moving too much so the best
way to actually do this is tilt the
device downward so if you can see what I
did there you can move it upward and
tilt it downward so that's the best way
that I found to take the picture but you
definitely want to take your time if
you're going too quickly it'll warn you
and then you won't be able to take the
picture so all you have to do is swipe
to the right and then your images will
be processing once it's done processing
there's going to be a little bar that
will actually allow you to change how
blurry it is so once the picture is
taken you want to hit the little shutter
button in the middle and then actually
you'll be able to focus on whatever part
you want by tapping on the picture
wherever you want there to be focused
and then you actually just slide this up
to get that blurry background effect so
I'm gonna put this over here and as you
guys can see is going to blur out a ton
of the background and give you guys a
quick close up of what I'm seeing so
here you guys can see my focus point is
right here and when you decrease the
line you can see that the blur is
diminished if you take it all the way
down there you have it a lot less blur
and it's all an artificial blur but when
you go all the way up you can see a huge
difference now one thing I must note
it's way way easier to
do this with the HTC one mA than it is
with the new Google camera app simply
because you don't have to you know swipe
it or move it in any kind of direction
you just take the picture and then it'll
go so I'm gonna do now let's take a
picture with the HTC One m8 stock camera
and also with the new Google camera on
the One m8 and then I'm gonna compare
the different focusing features and let
you guys see the differences
you
overall guys this has been my overview
of the new Google camera app and my
comparison to it with the HTC One m8 and
that's about it for this video guys if
you enjoyed it be the cool guy that hits
the thumbs up button and also subscribe
to the channel for more content from me
but till the next video guys - travis
