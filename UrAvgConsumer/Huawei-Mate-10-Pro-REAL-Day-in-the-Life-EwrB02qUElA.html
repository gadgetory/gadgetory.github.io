consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
huawei may 10 Pro now while we actually
decided to sponsor today's video and put
their may 10 Pro through a real day in
the life with me so you guys are gonna
see me test out the performance the new
cameras battery life and we're also
gonna see what kind of quirks this phone
has since this is a real day in the life
but let's see how it does alright guys
so right now we are using the
front-facing camera of the May 10 Pro
I'm walked in with the cookie over here
look you say what's up Vicky say what's
up mama well either way we've got a lot
of stuff to do guys today I'm going to
be shooting a ton different videos
actually I have to go stop by
Marquez's spot mister mkbhd so you guys
might be able to see him but yeah
today's gonna be a pretty packed day but
for now this is a front-facing camera
this is the video quality and audio
quality that you can expect from it and
we'll switch things up throughout the
day ok so right now I am headed to my
cousin spot got the GPS going it's about
a 15 minute drive from my studio and
I've got eight minutes left and we're
about ninety four percent on batteries
so I'll let you guys know how that's
throughout the day
alright guys so we made it and we've got
91 percent left not bad
been using it a little bit throughout
the day just doing social media and
Facebook and you know some emails here
and there so many ones not too bad now
let's go see marques here's the man
himself
what's going on man all right guys so
right now I am in the mkbhd studio he's
shipping out awards right now as we
speak
that is a thing so I stopped by here to
get some tips on shooting with this guy
when you read and Marquez has a bunch of
cool stuff in this studio sup Andrew so
he's got a bunch of cool stuff in here
I'll probably be using the rear camera
to take a couple of shots of some things
so we'll see what that rear cameras
quality is like all right so marques has
this awesome Android figure right here
definitely gonna be taking a picture of
this you know what let's do a portrait
mode shot take him
I'm just got moves portrait motor shop
so this came out pretty decently the
port remote effect it's actually pretty
subtle so it doesn't have a huge amount
of blur it actually comes out pretty
clean looking and this little Android
figure right here it's actually pretty
sharp I actually like this photo a lot
so so far the camera performs pretty
well so we're on the rooftop of
Marquez's studio so I figured why not
get a nice landscape shot see what kind
of quality you get from here all right
that's guy though it's like super blue
it's actually pretty awesome decent
dynamic range that's a pretty colorful
image
yeah I'd say yeah all right does okay
alright well I took a bunch of pictures
I'll show you guys in the wrap up how it
actually performed but so far I'm pretty
impressed but I gotta let this man do
his thing
get out of here go back to the studio
and do some work alright guys I'm back
inside now
I've been in the middle of shooting a
video all morning so you can see I have
my camera here and some stuff all over
but I wanted to take a second to
actually take a look at the design of
this phone this is actually a very clean
nice looking design I really like it
it feels very premium I think they have
multiple colors but this is the best
color that I've seen so far and I
actually just really really like it it
feels very solid but if I'm gonna be
honest with you guys while it feels
solid in the hand it feels great it is
kind of slippery but what I was super
blown away by is in the actual packaging
like you get to charger your cable all
that stuff but they're also included
this little silicone case and this is a
really nice case actually and the fact
that they offer it for free is just
pretty mind-blowing I love that the fact
that it comes right inside of the box is
great I don't know if this is the final
retail packaging that's gonna hit the US
but if it does come with this little
case here
I think that's gonna be awesome it's a
good-looking phone man you trying to
call me out well let me tell you guys
let me tell you guys the performance is
good if performance on this is actually
really solid ooh I've had no issues so
far this game I've seen mess up a few
phones but on the may 10 Pro here it's
actually handling it pretty well it's
got the Karen 970 processor which is
actually really powerful its Huawei's
proprietary chip so they make it
themselves but this thing has great
battery efficiency which you will see
throughout the day and it also has the
ability to access some AI capabilities
so uh I'm not complaining here and just
so you guys know this game is sonic
forces I love sonic games and this is
probably one of the most fun apps that
they've come out with in a while so I've
been really enjoying this whoo you guys
gonna get me killed I can't even really
play and talk to you at the same time
but if you want to pick up a cool game
this is definitely one worth grabbing
hey all right yeah I'm messing me up
though okay okay guys so it is pretty
late it's about 7:30 7 p.m. but what's
insane is that I have 75 percent battery
left I don't know but for right now the
battery just seems unbeatable it feels
kind of crazy in terms of screen on time
I've already got two hours and seven
minutes clocked in now that might not
sound like a lot at this time but I've
been doing a lot of work I still got a
lot more stuff to do with the phone
we're gonna see how long it lasts
throughout the day maybe it'd go into
the next day which would be insane but
75% left at this time night it's insane
okay guys so right now I'm in Walgreens
being a good husband Ares I is killing
her so I'm looking for some navcon drops
it's like 12:30 5:00 in the morning and
guys the phone's at 60% I mean I haven't
been killing this phone I've you know
you saw me drive around I drove around a
little bit more today
and I just it's got 60% in terms of
screen on time let's take a look here so
we're looking at three hours and 18
minutes of screen on time 60% that is
bonkers if this thing really gets to
like 6 hours like seriously
so the phone is finally dead and it's
sitting on the charger now it's been on
the charger for about maybe like 15 or
20 minutes or so but it just gave me an
alert saying your phone is dying it's
going to show off in 30 seconds
so I had to jump in and grab a
screenshot really quick of the screen on
time and we had about six hours and I
think 32 minutes or so I've never ever
with a phone cut in that much screen on
time before I know some people claim oh
I guess 7 hours I get yeah listen I've
never done it so I was super super
impressed here we I've been using the
phone I played a lot of Sonic I must
admit uh-huh but it is sitting on this
charger wow it has a proprietary charger
here with this and it's supposed to get
you 50 percent in about what 30 minutes
so let's see what we're at right now
37 no not yet not yet that's really
impressive so you got all of that
battery life and then you charge it up
for just 30 minutes you get 50% that's
that's where this is what batteries are
supposed to be like today and that
pretty much wraps up our day and I can
actually say day since I wasn't able to
actually kill the phone in a single day
this thing has some insane battery life
it's got four thousand milliamp hours
and this is amongst the best battery
life I've ever seen on a phone and I've
seen some pretty good battery life
lately but I gotta say the mate temp
Road takes the cake
honestly I think four thousand milliamp
hours should be the standard I think
everybody would be happy with that
seriously in terms of performance this
thing handles everything that I do at it
pretty well especially that Sonic game
which is usually a big test for me
nowadays since a lot of phones that I've
seen really bogged down once I play it
for a long time and it actually held up
really well so kudos to them even though
they've got their own proprietary kuren
processor so it's not like regular
snapdragons that you're seeing out there
they got their own chip and it still
functions really well so kudos to them
for having one of the best processors on
the market with their Kirin 970 chip and
I mentioned during the real day in the
life that this phone has AI capabilities
with this chip having a built-in neural
processing you
and this helps the phone to start
learning your habits as you use it more
we should help you to have a smooth and
very power efficient experience with the
phone and where you'll necessarily see
the advantages of built in AI like this
are from apps like the Microsoft
translator app that comes with the phone
to help give some real-time translations
as well as with the camera being able to
detect certain things that are in the
frame to give you the best optimal
shooting settings for whatever it
detects design-wise I think that this is
a classy looking phone I think it looks
great I did find it to be a bit slippery
though but with the included case that
they put in the packaging that fixed all
the issues and it didn't add any real
bulk I felt pretty secure with that case
so it is just awesome that they include
it it's also got a six inch OLED display
that I think looks really good
watching some of my favorite shows look
great on it and surprisingly using it
with one hand wasn't an issue at all
usually I don't like having those really
big screens because it makes it hard to
use with one hand but I didn't have that
issue here and it's also got a screen
protector pre-installed so you got a
case and a screen protector right out of
the box now in terms of the cameras
there are pretty solid performers in the
back you've got dual rear cameras one is
12 megapixels and the other is 20 and
they both have an aperture of 1.6 which
is great for low-light shots but I found
that the exposure could be a bit weird
sometimes sometimes some spots were a
bit overexposed or they were
underexposed with the dark areas so if I
did have any complaints it would be how
the camera sometimes exposes some shots
but you do get a ton of different
settings with this camera so you'll
really mess around with it from a manual
mode if you want to take control of the
camera and do it exactly the way you
want to it's even got a portrait mode
which I found to be pretty good it
wasn't super crazy with the bokeh effect
it actually looked a bit more natural so
I like that and you've also got a ton
more to me to list out in this video so
if you really like your camera you've
got a lot of options here and with the
front facing camera we were able to get
some really nice selfies so overall I do
think the whole camera package is pretty
solid I just wish that the exposure
would be a bit better now this phone
ships with one of the latest versions of
Android Android Oreo and it does come
with the EMU eye skin and I really don't
mind that this thing has a skin honestly
I haven't complained about a skin in
quite some time many
have gotten really good and making sure
the skin doesn't get in the way of using
your phone
I feel like this phone gives off a very
mature clean look to it and honestly
that makes sense since it's usually
targeted towards business users so
people who have businesses or use it for
work that makes sense it has a lot of
productivity features security features
so emui has a lot going for it and even
back when I did a real day in the life
with the huawei p10 I actually really
liked the skin that was on it it kind of
just felt like amateur phone felt really
nice to use some missing features though
no inclusion of the headphone jack which
honestly I think we just gotta start
getting used to I've been saying it for
a while now
and it's still true uh-huh it also has
no wireless charging no expandable
storage it does come with 128 gigs of
storage which is very very nice but no
expandable storage for those of you who
like to use a microSD card but it is
ip67 water resistant so if you spill
water on oh you drop it into pool or
something you're gonna be fine
blow over although guess I think that
this is a really good phone worth taking
a look at it's got that nice big 6 inch
OLED display it's also got a great
looking body and it's got that amazing
amazing all-day battery life that could
potentially go into two days with light
use ah that battery life is a winner if
you're on the market for a new phone
this is definitely one you don't want to
rule out I'll of course have links to it
down below in the description if you
guys want to learn even more about it
and see all the tech specs all that good
stuff I'll have a link down below in the
description but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it and got to see what the main
10 profile Sims like in a real day in
the life if you enjoyed this video be
the cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
