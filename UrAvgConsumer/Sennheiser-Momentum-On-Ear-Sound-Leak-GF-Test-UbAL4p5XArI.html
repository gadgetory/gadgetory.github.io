phone is your average consumer and this
is and today we're gonna be doing a
sound leak and found isolation test it
can either girlfriend test and today
we're doing it with the sennheiser
momentum on-ear headphones so that's not
wasting any time get right into it so
we're gonna start off with the sound
leak test and we're gonna do this at
volumes of 50% 75% and 100% and see how
much the music leaks at those different
volumes so we're gonna make sure that
the headphones are on her ears with no
hair so that's not an issue
and let's start it off with the styling
test at 50% so you ready alright so here
it is at 50%
yeah that's pretty good so I'm 50% I
heard it very slightly very very
slightly not enough to bother anyone
whatsoever
anyone who's even a foot away probably
wouldn't hear a thing so very good at
50% a good job so it's kind of good up
to 75% and see how it does there alright
so here it is a 75% now to hear this
quite a bit so 75% was quite a jump
I did hear pretty clearly I heard a
couple of lyrics and stuff so definitely
a big jump there
so let's crank it up just 100% and see
how it does and I don't recommend you
guys hear music at 100% as it can damage
your hearing but will damage our hearing
for you for this density all right so
here it is at 100% that's really loud
alright so that you clearly heard that I
heard that very clearly you already seem
to know really loud so there is that one
two percent you can hear very clearly 75
percent did we quite a bit but I do
think that it leaks this much because
it's the on ear design so there's
probably a little bit of leakage there
alright so now we're gonna move on to
the girlfriend test Karen I didn't know
about this sure so a girlfriend test is
missing these tests to see if my
annoying sounds my girlfriend like Dave
my nagging can be blocked out by his
headphones for this don't text I'm going
to be doing the cup song challenge you
and it's from the movie pitch perfect
I've been trying to master this
challenge for the longest time playing
the song over and over and over again
and this is my plug I finally have
mastered it and I'm going to see if I
can do it and if his headphones can
block out all the racket that comes with
it the singing the cup everything oh
we're gonna do this of course at 50%
volume 75% and 100% as well and see how
it does it those their bodies alright so
now we're gonna try it out at 50 percent
ready yes
alright alright so I definitely heard
all of that just now heard the singing
heard this singing from the iMac the
song for the iMac and I heard the cup so
a lot of stuff going on there don't you
present know what oh yeah so here does
that 75% crank it up a bit see how it
does they're ready yeah so at 75% I
didn't hear the song I didn't hear her
singing and but I did hear the cup
banging so the cup is pretty loud but I
didn't I did hear that so I sent in five
percent not bad at all
so it's gang up at 100% and see if you
can black out the cup as well as the
singing all that ready yes alright so
crank this up and here we go
yeah all right so I have 100% it
definitely did black out everything so
definitely very good there so very happy
with that
I seventy-five percent it did pretty
good the couples only thing that kind of
got in there so not bad definitely a
pretty decent experience at seventy-five
percent sound leaking was very had a
very drastic change for fifty or seventy
five percent so that's something you
might want to be wary of if you're gonna
be singing something next to someone
close by and that's about it for this
sound leak and girlfriend test guys
