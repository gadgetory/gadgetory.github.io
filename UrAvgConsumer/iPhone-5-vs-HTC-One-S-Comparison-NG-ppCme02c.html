consumer and today I'm going to be doing
a comparison of the iPhone 5 versus the
HTC One S and just in case you're with
t-mobile and you don't know if you
should go get their best one of their
best phones or JumpShip and go to the
iPhone
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the HTC One S and here we have the
iPhone 5 now this video really is for
anyone with t-mobile who isn't sure if
they want to stick with them or head
over to one of the other carriers who
currently have the iPhone 5 which is
pretty much all of them so we're gonna
explore the differences between one of
t-mobile's best phones and of course the
iPhone 5 now to start it off let's talk
about a bit about the design of these
phones the a these are probably the
smallest slimmest phones I've seen to
date and I thought that the I the HTC
One S would hold the crown of the
thinnest phone for quite some time but
then the iPhone came around and as you
can see here when I lay them down on
this surface that the iPhone 5 is
actually a thinner phone but the
difference really isn't that noticeable
until you put them really side-by-side
on a surface like that but it's just a
little scary how thin these phones are
to be honest um I honestly do not feel
comfortable using them without a case
because it the chances of them slipping
out of my hands are just too high and
it's just really not that comfortable
for me and also because I took the cases
off for this video I had to put down
this microfiber cloth and the reason I
did that is because there's been a lot
of reports that people have been getting
this black iphone 5 scratched up quite
easily and some aren't even saying that
it's coming like that out of the box so
I'm a little paranoid with this and
that's my reasoning for having this
microfiber cloth here just to kind of
protect it from anything like that
the 1s has a 4.3 inch qHD display and
the iPhone 5 has a 4
inch Retina display now pretty much they
both look really nice in person I think
the average consumer will be happy with
both of these displays as they both look
very crisp and clear um watching videos
on these and Netflix and such they just
look amazing
it looks like HD right on your phone
can't complain at all something you know
big tech guys will probably complain
that the HTC One S is screen isn't on
the high resolution enough for them but
honestly for the average consumer you're
gonna be just fine they both look
amazing
the next thing we're gonna want to
compare for the two are the cameras the
back cameras are both 8 megapixel
cameras with flash and I'm actually
going to have a video showing the
differences between the two there's um
there's quite a bit of difference
between the two as far as the actual
camera applications that a camera
applications on the 1s is far more
advanced than that of the iPhone the
iPhone 5 has a pretty simple camera and
the all you really get is you know shoot
and record and a few settings not much
but the 1s has a ton of settings here as
you can see that you can just really
change a lot between the different
settings here so the one that has a huge
advantage over the iPhone in that regard
and also they both have front-facing
cameras now this is no contest to be
honest the HTC One S has a VGA camera
which is really low resolution and the
iPhone 5 has a 720p HD camera and if you
guys have checked out my my own camera
test you'll see that the HD camera on
the iPhone 5
it looks amazing it's not even a
comparison to be honest another bonus
that the aquam seems to have over the 1s
beside this little camera is its speaker
the speaker on the iPhone 5 is actually
quite loud
I thought the 1s was one of the best
speakers I've heard but to be honest the
iPhone 5 is a
louder than this is which really caught
me off guard I was really really
surprised to to see that and I also have
a video demonstrating just how loud the
speaker of the iPhone 5 is as well so be
sure to check that out if you're
interested I get the speakers a big deal
for you but on the phone call as far as
phone calls goes the receiver on the HTC
One S was quite a bit louder than that
of the iPhone 5 they both sound great
though in both regards of speakers and
receivers they both sound good
it just so happens that the iPhone has a
louder speaker while the 1 s has a
louder receiver for like phone calls
they both are running with dual-core
processors and pretty much what that
means is that both phones will be very
fast I've had the 1s for a few months
now and I have yet to experience any
slowdowns in in all with it and the
iPhone is still very new so I'm not
expecting any slowdowns from this any
time soon but um they're both very fast
once you get them brand new you'll love
both of them and I'm pretty sure over
time that they'll hold up to it I know
that the 1s has held up very well for me
and I put a ton of apps and all kinds of
stuff on here so I'm very happy that
this has never slowed down for me and
I'm pretty confident that phone will as
well and since we're on the topic of
speed one thing to know is that the data
speeds of LTE are much much faster than
that of HSPA+ which is the 4G that
t-mobile uses right now and here's a
quick example of what I'm talking about
and I must say that this is probably a
low test for the iPhone 512 megabyte
they're about 13 megabytes per second
that's my monks one of the lowest I've
seen if we do it again you'll see here
that it can easily easily get right way
past that as you can see right here
it just hit 20 almost 21 megabytes per
second and that's not even as high as
I've seen it go this is crazy
yeah this right here I don't know how
that happened this is just madness
LT is on a whole nother level 40 almost
40 like this 47 megabytes per second
this is I don't even know what to say to
this now that we spoke about the overall
hardware of the phones
what's up so a little on the software
and this is pretty much Android versus
iOS and I won't take too much into it to
spark any warf read it down in the
comment section but to put it simply for
my average consumers it all depends on
how deep you want to get into your phone
an Android offers a ton of customization
and features that Iowa simply does not
have and it really is a catch-up game
that Apple's playing right now chances
are very high that many of the iPhones
new features will be features that
Android has had for quite some time now
and that's looking at you panorama
although that does not mean that Android
is the better choice for everyone
tech enthusiasts and geeks alike will
probably be better suited for Android
and all of its features but I do believe
that the average consumer might not be
willing to get really deep into their
phone like that which is one of the
reasons why of course
iOS does so well iOS is simple it's
clean it's easy it's perfect for the
average consumer really but I personally
like Android a bit more as it fits my
needs and you know it lets me do
everything I want to with my phone as
far as like widgets and all kinds of fun
stuff that I can use as you can see here
so Android really does work for me
but I do understand that this is about
the average consumer and that's what my
channels based on and I do feel that the
average consumer will have a easier time
using the iOS operating system since it
really does just work it has the apps
lined up for you you just go in and do
what you want on it and it just works
it's pretty simple it doesn't do much
there's not much there to confuse anyone
who might not really be into tech or you
know software now the only problem I had
really have with ILS is that average
consumer or not it will get boring do
you always have these rows of icons
it'll always look the same you can't do
anything about it all you can really do
is change up the wallpaper and that's as
much fun as you can get
whereas Android of course you know you
have all kinds of wallpapers you have
fun wallpapers here you have your
widgets and I think this is where the 1s
really shines it has a bunch of great
widgets that you can use to customize
the phone as you can see here there's
tons of stuff it's just a really nice
experience on Android in my opinion but
it's really not for everyone
and that's understandable and it's
really cool that no matter what you do
with your Android phone it'll never look
the same as someone else's next to you
whereas the iPhone and it's pretty
uniform what you see is what you get
what you see is what everyone gets so
there's not too much difference here
there's a lot of customization options
with the Android operating system but I
do think that diverse from someone will
have an easier time with this even
though it can get a bit stale overall I
think that they're both very solid
phones the 1s is my main phone
personally and I'm extremely happy with
it the iPhone 5 is also a great phone
and it's pretty much the same experience
you'll get on any other iPhone or any
iPhone you've seen in the past so if
you're thinking about leaving t-mobile
for an iPhone or maybe even leaving
the other carriers for the 1s I hope
this video has helped you and making a
bit of a decision and which one might be
better for you
I think average consumers might have an
easy time here while they'll have an
easier time they'll have an easy time
with Android as well but you know I
really think that to get the full
advantage of Android you might want to
just look into a bit more of what you
can do but I do think that they're both
good for after your average consumer
regardless and hopefully this video has
helped you make a decision if you liked
it please hit the thumbs up button and
leave a comment tell me what you think
and hopefully that doesn't mean a rage
war between iOS fanboys and Android
fanboys and that pretty much wraps up my
comparison of the 1s and the iPhone 5 if
you've enjoyed this video please feel
free to hit that thumbs up button leave
a comment and subscribe alright guys as
your average consumer till the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
