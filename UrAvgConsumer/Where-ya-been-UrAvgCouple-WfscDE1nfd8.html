left you oh wow look at that
Oh Oh what is it Oh fire what people
were trying to protect it I think oh my
god whose dog is that
Oh see that's kind of scary
I almost like stopping he's like gunning
wow what is he don't you think he got
lost but who is pulling his I have a tag
on Oh some spring over I'll sees little
brown soft running anymore so all the
cars in front all right I'm gonna leave
on that note
we saved someone sick guys I brought it
in the was just funny so scared open a
camera I did seriously would you guys
have pulled over
we were birthday braiding it too or else
we're super super late so okay so right
now first of all so sorry that we are my
a it's like ever since we got engaged we
really just like shut off the world show
ourselves off from the world
sorry but it is going to be
and like I said before some of you might
be able to see it stream it live and if
you can't catch it live then we'll be
able to find obviously
yeah well while we were gone you did
report some stuff so we did vlog and in
bits and pieces nothing crazy but you
guys to see
what's up guys it's snowing and guess
where this girl wants to go you wouldn't
believe it
coal stone we are about to have to call
stone on this very cold and snowy day my
idea
when she asked me why I was floored
I was like I said really in this cold
get out of here
you want to continue
know what
Connecticut
have you guys heard about the new drink
options it's called if you're reading
this it's too late there's a pretty emo
mixtape title right of course you gotta
you can count on Drake for that but I
can't help but listen to his music cuz I
like his music it's actually decent what
do you guys think of it if you listen to
it if you're a Drake fan I'm curious
what my fellow dairy fans are saying
about this mixtape so far it always
takes me a couple of listens to his
albums and mixtapes to start liking it
so this one is already in the phase
where it's really going on
and of course guys while areas out at
work I'm doing my tech stuff so I've got
my ff7 with me outside as crazy as that
is and then over here I've got the iris
Plus this is a drone that I showed you
guys in the last vlog I haven't really
shown it off or anything but I've been
testing out this bad boy and it is
something else but it's freaking cold
and I still have to meet this video so
it's a pain and I have to try and get it
done my fingers are freezing I've been
out here already for a little bit and I
actually think I'm gonna pack it up but
this guy is so fun actually killed
battery but it's really fun right now
I've got a GoPro attached to it and it's
acting crazy because it's a gimbal and
what this what this does is it's
supposed to make it stay in this
position while it's running but the
battery is dying out on it right now so
I'm gonna pack all this stuff I've got a
ton of things to do today but this is
what most of my day is consisting of out
in the freezing cold for some footage
alright guys once again he has me out in
this cold to record stuff god he needs
to get a team any experienced
photographers out there looking for a
job I can't do this it's cold my hair oh
my gosh so for those who care there were
some girls watching the vlogs back in
the summertime when I first start going
natural I have been natural well not
natural I've been transitioning for a
year now so I've been straightening it
way too much so many times and I'm just
gonna be keeping it out like this
alright guys so how does that work now
and we have a special guest coming and
who would it be
besides Ana so on is actually here she's
staying with us I'm not to go pick her
up right now she was doing an interview
for uh I don't know I think a position
for the summer so I'm on my way to pick
her up and I'm probably gonna try and go
out and get some more footage of that
drone still got a lot more stuff to do
with it so I'll see if I can drag her
along for that alright guys so I'm back
out here again by this nice big looking
Church and look what I've got with me
before before re was my assistant but
now I've got and how do you think the
interview went hopefully hopefully keep
the fingers crossed
