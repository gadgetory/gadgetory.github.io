consumer and we are finally gonna be
talking about v5 must-have accessories
for the Xbox one X now these accessories
will work for the Xbox 1s as well and
probably the Xbox one but it's the Xbox
when I access the most recent so we're
gonna be talking about that and first
thing is this guy over here this is a
portable gaming monitor from G story now
I recently picked this up and I really
wasn't expecting much from it it is $200
so it's a bit pricey but when I put this
guy on I'm telling you guys the quality
is absolutely there now this is an 11.6
inch display it's full HD so you're only
getting 1080p no 4k here but everything
with it being so small looks very very
crispy and surprisingly it has HDR
support as well as you guys can see
right here I haven't really tried any
HDR content on it but everything that I
have tried looks amazing now what's cool
about this display is that the way it's
built they provide some hooks and
everything that you need so that it
stays attached to your Xbox one X so as
you guys can see this is all you need
for your system I think that is really
cool and what it also has going for it
is that it's got two speakers on the
back so if you want to hear your audio
from your game of course you'll be able
to hear it but beyond that you've also
got two headphone jacks so maybe you're
playing with someone right in your bike
you guys can both put in your headphones
and listen to the audio right from the
system and the design of this guy is a
little bit strange I don't know why they
didn't continue this part all the way to
the front so it could be flush with the
system but there is this gap they do
include a cushion that you can just add
to the system and when you want to take
this somewhere with you you can just go
like this and travel with it without any
worries I actually picked up one of
these for the ps4 as well and it doesn't
have this issue but it's just something
to deal with it's not a big deal it's
not a deal-breaker by any means
amen what you actually get here in terms
of the form factor as well as just the
overall quality of the display is
awesome and being able to take your xbox
just about anywhere and play your games
I think is really cool so I am
absolutely all for that is it worth the
two hundred bucks if you're someone
who's gonna want to take your game
somewhere I definitely think it is this
thing is sick now of course you're gonna
need a controller to play your games and
right here we've got the Xbox one elite
controller this is the special edition
this is the white version and man guys
if you haven't played with an Xbox one
elite controller trust me you need to
give it a try this is an extremely
comfortable controller this is a pretty
customizable controller so if you take
your gaming seriously and you're playing
on Xbox one you got to stop wasting time
pick up an elite controller the thing is
the best controller I've ever used but
if you want to switch it up but you guys
need to check out its color we're now in
call the wise website you can customize
a ton of different tech they actually
custom paint all the parts that you pick
let me show you guys an example Malcolm
you mind if I borrow the sticks for a
second my friend so over here we've got
a Xbox one elite controller that I
custom-made myself I chose all of the
colors here and you guys can see this
thing is an absolute beauty and I
knocked off one two pieces and this
controller is one of the first things
that I ever made on Colors website and
it is still my absolute favorite you can
customize Xbox one league controllers
regular controllers had bathing got
PlayStation 4 controller Missy where
where are mine they even had PlayStation
4 controllers Nintendo switch pro
controllers joy cons that you can get
custom made like they got a lot of cool
stuff guys so if you want to check them
out I'll have them linked down below in
the description as well as everything
else mentioned in this video and since
we're talking about the Xbox 1x you know
you need a 4k TV so right here we've
actually got something that's pretty
inexpensive this is a 43 inch 4k TV from
TCL now a lot of you guys always say I
don't pick budget-friendly items while
here you go
this one is not gonna break the bank
you're getting a 4k TV here for just 260
bucks come on guys that's affordable and
I'm not gonna lie to you guys when a TV
is that affordable and it's not Black
Friday
I'm usually a little weary but I think
that this one actually looks pretty
solid now what's great about this TV is
not only do you get access to 4k but you
also have Roku built right into it so
this is a Roku TV and with this you
pretty much get access to all of the
apps that you would with any Smart TV so
you got Netflix Hulu all that kind of
stuff and you have pretty much a Roku
built right in
I kind of like the fact that this
controller has access to those apps
right on the remote so you just tap
Netflix go right into it you don't have
to go messing around with certain menus
now surprise for you guys I'm actually
teaming up with TCL to give away a
couple of TV's now they're not
sponsoring this video or anything
nothing on this video is sponsored but
I've reached out and asked them if
they'd be interested in you know working
on something for you guys and they were
down so if you guys want a chance to get
a TV win a TV follow me over on
Instagram I'll have details down below
in the description on how to enter and
win that giveaway but make sure you
follow me there so you got your 4k TV
covered
you got your awesome customized
controllers now you got to worry about
that audio right so right here we have
the Turtle Beach stealth 600 now this is
actually an awesome headset because it
works directly with the Xbox one X now
what I mean by that is this has the same
pairing button that an Xbox one
controller has to sync up with the Xbox
so you can wirelessly listen to your
audio without having to worry about any
dongles or having to connect it to the
controller it connects directly to the
system and it also gives you access to
Windows sonic surround sound so if
you're playing a game like this and you
want to make sure you hear those around
you oh now come you got to kill okay so
you'll be able to hear that kind of
stuff in surround sound so that's really
cool now what I like about these
especially is the fact that there
expensive when you think of a wireless
gaming headset usually I'll run you a
little bit more but these only go for
about 85 bucks which doesn't break the
bank and it still has good audio quality
now gaming has that as an absolute
must-have is the stealth 600 not really
but I'm trying to keep the budget in
mind here but if you guys have a little
bit more money to spend and you want
something even better quality I'll have
some of my absolute favorites link down
below in the description so you guys can
check those out those I think who kind
of crazy are they expensive now last but
not least is an absolute must-have is
probably not one many people think about
and that's this guy right here this is
an external hard drive you need an
external hard drive if you're playing on
the Xbox trust me guys it actually frees
up resources when you have games stored
on the hard drive itself and then the
Xbox just kind of plays off of that so
not only can you just put a ton of games
on the next general hard drive that has
like terabytes and terabytes dedicated
to just holding the games but it also
frees up the storage on your actual
system and with that of course that
means that the Xbox is using less
resources and it can now dedicate more
of its power to making a better looking
game having that play a lot more
smoothly and you wouldn't believe it but
this is probably the number one
must-have when it comes to the Xbox one
axe it's not as exciting as like that
portable gaming monitor or maybe a 4k TV
but it is the one that has the most
direct impact as well as I guess having
the 4k TV but it is really really
important to have even though it's not
as flashy but that about wraps up this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it I've
been wearing this xbox one X sweater I
think it's pretty dope but if you guys
are interested in picking up one of
these I think Microsoft sells it on
their website so I'll try to have a link
to this as well down below in the
description if I can find it but till
the next video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if there's anything that you
think is a must-have leave a comment
down below let others know about it and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then is your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
