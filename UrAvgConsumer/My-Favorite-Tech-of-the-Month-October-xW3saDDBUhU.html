and today we're gonna be talking about
my favorite tech of the month for the
month of October and for those of you
who have never seen one of my favorite
tech of the month videos I'm pretty much
going to be talking about the tech that
I've been using on a daily basis and
enjoying whether it's old or new and one
thing that I've been really enjoying
lately guys is a game by Nintendo called
your Galia loss check this out
this game is awesome now this is a kind
of game where if you like RPGs you're
going to enjoy this there's like
character development you can level up
characters build castles fighting of
course but let me show you guys a little
bit of what I do in it so right here
I've got my roster of characters or
adventurers and what I like about this
game because I love RPGs I like
developing my characters making them a
lot stronger but not only can you
develop your characters but you can
develop your weapons as well you can get
really cool weapons in this game and
kind of upgrade them and do all kinds of
cool things so I'm a really big fan of
the whole getting stronger idea and you
even get to use dragons and there's all
kinds of cool stuff in here guys so this
is something I've been really enjoying
guys I've been playing it non-stop and I
am losing because I'm busy talking to
you guys so I'm gonna jump out before I
go ahead and make a fool of myself but
juga vilasa is really awesome um like I
said guys if you're a fan of RPGs we're
definitely going to enjoy that it's
free-to-play microtransactions which
kind of sucked but it's free-to-play so
you can jump in with no problem and I'm
not gonna spend too much time on this
because I mentioned it in another
favorite tag of the month video but you
probably noticed the live wallpapers on
my screens here I get a lot of questions
every time you guys see my life
wallpapers on my desktops
it's called a wallpaper engine from
Steam so you guys gotta go check that
out I have it linked down below but if
you like live wallpapers it is
definitely a really cool app and it's
worth putting on your machine because
you get cool effects like this so don't
say I didn't give you nothing but now we
got to talk about this phone right here
this is the Google pixel 3xl this phone
is this got as good and it's got it's
bad I actually did a real day in the
life video that you guys can check out
down below I'll have it link so you can
all of the goods and Bad's but one of
the goods that I just absolutely love is
of course that camera the camera is
absolutely amazing guys it is sharp it
has a lot of detail the HDR mode is
awesome because you can get so much
detail even in an area that's
overexposed or a really low lit you get
a lot of information back and get a
really great picture I am a huge fan of
portrait mode and getting those blurred
out backgrounds and the fact that the
pixel allows you to have a lot of
functionality with it by changing the
depth and all that information it is
really really cool cuz you get some
great shots from it so I've been walking
around with this guy in my pocket since
it got released this camera is
everything I've been using it for a
while and I've definitely been enjoying
it especially when you throw on
something like a moment lens I actually
been walking around with some moment
lenses for a while now and the pixel 3
has a case for it it's actually in this
backpack which is the next thing that
I'm gonna be talking about guys this
right here is a backpack from system G
this is the game plus backpack this is
the 15 inch version and I have a
love-hate relationship with this thing
it is an amazing backpack that can carry
a ton of stuff lots of compartments very
very high quality honestly this thing
can't be beat but here's a problem guys
you see this hardshell it's made to
protect your stuff but it is massive so
when I throw this thing on as you can
see I look like a ninja turtle the black
one so it's just crazy guys there is no
black one I'm the black one so here's my
problem with it guys it's so big they're
like let's say I'm just like shown over
here I'm not really close to the wall
but if I turn around you see that I
can't be too close to a wall because
this thing bumps right into it that's a
problem I can't be in the crowded area
and have this bag go and I'm gonna be
knocking people over that is a problem
to you guys
oh please a train they would kill me but
that's not to say that this isn't an
awesome backpack this thing has so many
awesome compartments just just take a
look at this guys take a look
open this thing up you got access to a
ton of compartments here slots for the
Nintendo switch games pens pencils all
of this stuff is really high quality
these are high quality pockets all the
materials inside and sting a won best
I've ever seen
on a backpack now I'm not gonna go too
crazy into this thing guys it is a
gaming backpack so it has a lot of cool
gaming functionality but I actually have
a video where I talk about this more in
depth and how I feel about and
everything so you guys gotta check that
out I have it linked down below I'm not
sure this one's gonna come which one's
gonna come out first that video or this
one I'll have it linked down below
regardless of which one comes out first
I'll update this one if it is akin here
but there is something else inside of
this bag that I do want to talk about
and that is this guy right in here yeah
look at this I don't see these pockets
that's a nice baby
that's quality but anyway what we're
talking about is this guy right here the
sony MDR 1000 x mark 3 oh no it's not in
the air it's the WH 1000 x mark today
why they change it either way guys these
are Sony's latest and greatest
headphones with active noise-cancelling
great sound quality and a ton of
features now I've been absolutely
enjoying this I think in the last
favorite act of the month video I talked
about how I've been using the boast QC
35 because it was just so lightweight
easy to grab and go and I was using it
instead of the WH 1000 mark twos and a
lot of you were like aha but the mark
threes are out well I these are hard to
get I have to get this at an airport
Amazon is sold out I think you can't
even get them on BET i Best Buy really
hard to get but man when you get your
hands on these you will be happy these
are a very premium pair of headphones
they go for like three hundred and fifty
bucks
but is it worth it absolutely if you
really care about headphones
like I do but the sound quality is great
here is very lightweight I can take this
thing with me anywhere and not feel like
it's a burden so I'm very very happy
with this Sony did some awesome changes
and actually did a full-blown review on
this as well so if you guys want to see
that I'll include a down below in the
description and just so we're clear the
reason why this did take the place of
those bows is because Sony changed up
the materials made these a lot lighter
and a lot more comfortable so now
wearing these I can wear these for hours
with no problem and with excellent sound
quality the best noise cancellation that
you can find on a pair of headphones
this thing is just a really good pickup
now they don't have the base that the
950 and ones have but that's okay that's
a nice headphone that's for guys like me
but this is for like when I want to
listen to pretty much everything this
sounds really really good but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed a quick little
look at my favorite tech of the month
but all the stuff is great I've been
enjoying my time with them I think the
only thing is you're gonna have a hard
time getting your hands on if you're
interested is the backpack this backpack
is not currently available I think there
was like a Kickstarter campaign not
really sure what's going on with that
but this thing is not gonna be the easy
one to get but anyway guys hopefully
enjoyed it if you did beautiful guard
girl I give this video a thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then is your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
