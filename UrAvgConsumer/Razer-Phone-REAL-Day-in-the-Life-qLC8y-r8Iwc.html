lot of people when they announced their
brand-new spec tout smartphone that
they're calling the razor phone and in
today's video you're gonna be spending a
real day in the life with me and this
phone as I check out it's 120 Hertz
display the dual 12 megapixel cameras
and even that 4,000 milliamp hour
battery and we're gonna see how it all
does in the real world and spoiler alert
it's kind of dope alright guys so we're
starting our day this is the front
facing camera so you know the audio and
video quality is what you could expect
from here so we got a few things to do
today I got a couple packages that I
need to send out it's 11 o'clock we're
at 100% battery and we're just going to
see how this thing lasts throughout the
day but first stop ups so what you're
looking at guys are a bunch of giveaway
prizes that I'm finally sending out it
takes a while to get these out sometimes
because we're working on videos and it's
kind of hard to stop to go to the mill
or a post office so finally we're
getting it done now one of the special
things about this phone is that it has
120 Hertz but because I'm not playing a
game right now you can actually see the
benefit when just going through regular
menus so I got to pull up the addresses
for these giveaway prizes and even in
doing that I get to see the benefit of
120 Hertz it makes the screen look
really smooth whenever I'm navigating
through things I know this isn't the
first phone to do it but I love the fact
that there's a fingerprint scanner right
on the power button I feel like this
just makes sense you need to jump into
your phone you just hit the unlock and
boom you're already in this is really
convenient I feel like most phones
should have it right here on the power
button it just makes sense this is where
it should be and I figured we'd take a
quick look at the phone itself and I got
a save in the hand there's no denying it
this is a pretty big phone and even
though this is a pretty big phone I feel
like razor gave some nice attention to
detail here like the fingerprint scanner
on the side which is also the power
button you notice it's kind of low same
thing with the actual volume keys
they're actually low on the screen so I
can access it even though I'm holding
the bottom end of the phone
so if I want to access everything boom
and did you catch those sounds listen to
this it makes those nice little sounds
whenever you turn on and off the phone
some people might not be crazy about
that but I actually like the way it
sounds makes it feel pretty cool now
since this is a really big phone I'm
usually pretty uncomfortable with
leaving it as is I'm always scared of
dropping it be due to it being a bit
unwieldy but this thing has some really
good build quality I actually don't feel
compelled to throw a case on here even
though it's a really big phone I know
the thing has some really big bezels at
the top and bottom
thanks to those speakers but I promise
you guys it is so worth it I'll show you
a bit later but it is so worth to have
those speakers now what's great about
this phone is that it is running stock
Android with like no bloatware the only
things I think that come on the phone
are these little three apps right here
which are just a couple of games to
demonstrate the abilities of the phone
but that aside you get a pretty stock
version of Android it's running Android
7.1.1 so it's going to get updated to
Android audio in the future but you do
get a premium version of Nova Launcher
so for all of you guys who love Nova
Launcher just comes built into the phone
and if you want to keep it super super
stock you can go ahead and download the
Google now launcher if you want but it's
cool that they offer the option of
having a nova launcher since that thing
is super customizable alright guys so
right now we got a little Cookie Monster
over here and we're actually gonna be
headed to a dog park so I'm gonna
actually have to find one because there
isn't one that's close by here so time
to go find one using the GPS to actually
go to the one we find and see how that's
we've got about a 20-minute drive ahead
of us we'll see how much it impacts the
battery what do we say it was at 87
right alright so 86 percent 20 minute
drives and that razor phone is on a
wireless charger right now but
unfortunately it doesn't have wireless
charging built into it so it can't take
advantage of that feature but hey at
least we can continue testing the
battery
without worrying about that all right so
we made it to the dog park cookies ready
to go hang out with some dogs let's see
here we have about 83% left we've got an
hour and 30 minutes of screen on time
very good so guys take a look at this
place
there are a lot of nice colors here and
this is perfect to try it out that rear
camera and see what kind of quality we
can get here I see if we can get a shot
off let's see this is pretty good Octus
big red tree awesome so when you
initially zoom in it looks super blurry
but it gives give it a second and then
it loads up and it looks pretty good
those clouds the color looks awesome it
looks like it's an HDR shot I actually
didn't have HDR on but I'm gonna turn it
on now this looks pretty well let's see
okay yeah that thing is throwing me off
the fact that you have to really wait
for it to load the image clearly but it
looks good actually
actually feel like the first image
without HDR looks better let's try one
more yeah this is not a great shot at
all the trees are completely dark the
clouds look pretty cool and all but
there's something it's overexposed a bit
but you can't see these trees at all
this is that's a bad shot so I'm
noticing a couple of things here as I'm
using the camera the HDR mode doesn't
seem to have great dynamic range if that
makes any sense when I actually turn off
HDR I'm seeing a lot more dynamic range
I'm not sure why or what conditions are
causing that but I'm seeing way better
shots with just a regular camera mode so
we are in Petco where's cookie so
chances are we're gonna be here a while
so I might as well can I sit somewhere I
see chairs
well I'm gonna find a nice wall to post
up on and maybe watch a YouTube video or
something
I said I'd watch a YouTube video but
nothing beats watching some anime so I
got some Dragon Ball super playing over
here and I got to tell you guys the
display looks so good colors are nice
and vibrant and even though everybody's
loving oled displays right now this
screen still looks awesome and those
speakers remember I told you the
speakers are no joke so right now we've
got it at about less than 50% here this
is enough to hear in the store with no
problem if you want to get obnoxious
throw it up to here and that's being
obnoxious but if I throw it up this this
is grounds to to get told to turn down
the volume
this is loud alright guys so as you can
see it's a bit darker right now and
we're back in the studio because we just
have a lot of work to do it never ends
but just to give you guys an update
it is officially 10:53 p.m. I've been
using the phone for regular stuff social
media making calls just checking up on
NBA scores and we are at 27% battery
life the screen on time we are looking
at 4 hours and 48 minutes with 27% left
this is killer battery life guys now I
didn't play any games but one thing I
want to mention is that this is with the
phone running at 120 Hertz for the
screen so it still got that buttery
smooth setting on and I've also got it
at the max resolution so full quad HD
1440p so that's using the max res and
using the 120 Hertz with those options
off I could probably get even more
battery life but with that aside we do
have to get to the most important part
of this phone and that's the gaming
aspect so let's dive into that so this
game right here is
in fall assault this is one of the games
that come pre-loaded onto the razor
phone so with this you know they kind of
want to show off what this phone is
capable of it runs super smoothly
especially at 120 Hertz
everything looks buttery smooth and
there's so much going on at the same
time you know what that new Snapdragon
processor it runs really nicely but when
you do have it on higher quality one
thing that I did notice is that the
phone tends to get a bit warmer it's
actually quite warm right now and you
can bring down the quality of the game
to you know kind of help with that
decrease the temperature as well as
lower the performance a bit but I rather
go all the way that's what the point of
this phone so if it has to get a little
hot that's fine it's not too high it's
not uncomfortable at least not yet but
if you're one of those folks who don't
like their phones to get warm at least
you do have that option to decrease the
quality what's great here though is that
even at 50 percent you're getting some
pretty good quality if you turn that up
and you didn't hear a lot of what's
going on all right guys this right here
is probably my favorite racing game when
it comes to a smartphone or any mobile
device oh there we go get out of the way
you see well I guess that guys this is
my favorite in terms of mobile devices
come on don't oh but on the razor phone
this thing is also really nice because
you got some awesome music that you're
gonna enjoy with this speaker and even
without it it's just really really
smooth on the screen it looks great but
that's not to say that this game is
optimized to work with the razor phone
it's a smooth experience and it looks
great but razors working with a bunch of
different game developers to get their
games optimized to work on the razor
phone the way they wanted to but I don't
think this is one of them now if you're
planning on picking up this phone for
gaming I wouldn't expect any kind of
razor phone exclusives
that you can find on here this is not
like a console but like I said Razer is
working with some game developers to
make sure that those games are optimized
for this phone I told you guys I saw a
Final Fantasy 15 redone which in chibi
form but should be pretty interesting I
can't wait to see that actually hit this
phone so if you're really big into
mobile gaming I think this one's gonna
deliver a pretty good experience the
Google Play Store has a ton a ton of
games that you can take advantage of
this phone with but I am gonna be
keeping an eye out to see what games
Razer plans to make sure our optimized
for this phone so far Final Fantasy 15
that's a good way to start all right
guys so the phone is finally dead
it took all day like seriously all day
and I checked it right before it died
I got about 5 hours and 57 minutes of
screen on time which is the most I've
ever gotten on a phone ever we've we've
done quite a few new usually range in
the for our int mark this one just like
got just about 6 hours which is just
amazing but four thousand milliamp hours
all-day battery life and not only that
this thing also has quick charge 4.0 the
first phone to have this feature right
out of the box it's a lot of juice but
let's see how it does I'll let you guys
know how quickly it charges in the
wrap-up but battery life amazing so you
guys got a peek into what it's like to
use the phone for a day and I gotta say
guys overall I was pleasantly surprised
with this phone I expected a lot because
of that spec sheet but when it comes to
actually using it that's a whole nother
ballgame this thing has a great 5.7 inch
display and even though it isn't OLED
and everybody's loving OLED right now I
found this to be very nice and vibrant
looked really good and it's also got
those awesome speakers accompanying it
and some people might not be crazy about
the bezels but when you actually listen
to this guy in person you'll appreciate
it 100% when I play the Dolby Atmos demo
for area for the first time even she was
blown away and I really didn't even
expect her to appreciate it but she did
and of course gaming on this thing is a
very nice experience because you've got
that 120 Hertz display that makes it all
buttery smooth and even if you're not a
gamer having one
20 Hertz on your screen makes the entire
OS look way more smooth and snappy it's
just an overall great experience just
use the phone and that battery life whoo
best battery life I've ever used hands
down it is an awesome battery 4000
milliamp hours is no joke now even
though you might set your phone to 120
Hertz razor has software built-in so
that it has a variable refresh rate so
that means that if you're not playing a
game or doing anything intensive on the
phone it'll go down to lower lower
refresh rates so that it's not consuming
a lot of your battery so that helps you
to have optimal battery life even if you
want that nice smooth buttery refresh
rate and if you want to go nuts and get
even more battery life you can bring
down the refresh rate to like 60 Hertz
and even bring down the screen
resolution to get a little bit more out
of the phone now while all that stuff is
top notch where I wasn't too crazy about
this phone was with the camera this
thing's got dual 12 megapixel cameras
but they honestly weren't that great you
can get some pretty decent shots out of
it for sure if you have the right
lighting in low-light shots I didn't
feel like you got anything too
spectacular out of it a lot of photos
came out soft
I often dealt with a lot of blurry
photos especially if you have HDR on and
you don't have a great lighting
situation video quality also wasn't
really that great for me so I don't know
camera quality is where this thing takes
a hit a lot of the issues that I found
with the camera seem to be software
based and Razer is working on updating
their camera app so we should see some
improvements in the future but as of
right now it is in the strongest camera
in the game and surprisingly the front
facing camera produced some really good
shots with sunlight but I found that in
low-light shots the pictures did turn
out to be a bit soft but in terms of a
regular during the day selfie Harry gave
her her seal of approval take her word
for it she's the selfie expert not me
and it's a fact that the Razr phone is
missing a few key features but if you
have the gamer in mind I can kind of
understand the logic behind it and one
of those features is wireless charging
but usually a lot of the phones that we
see with wireless charging built-in they
usually have a more frail body while
this has a matte black aluminum finish
which gives it quite a bit more
durability and if you're a gamer and
you're playing with your phone you're
moving it around a lot
you're going crazy with it you might
drop it or something you're gonna want a
little bit more durability than your
standard glass back or something that's
a bit more fragile also the fact that
this thing comes with quick charge 4.0
kind of makes up for that I was able to
get around 50% when charging this for 30
minutes that is a lot of juice back and
you wouldn't be able to get that with
wireless charging so I kind of get it
it's also missing water and dust
resistance but if you had those features
built into it you'd have to sacrifice on
those speakers and with this being a
multimedia device you're not gonna want
to sacrifice on those speakers after
hearing it you will not want to
sacrifice on those speakers but I asked
you guys in my last razor video if you
guys cared more about the speaker or
waterproofing and a lot of you guys
chose the speaker so I think it's a
pretty safe bet that they took and I
think it works out well and the last
thing that's missing here is the
headphone jack at first I couldn't wrap
my head around why they would remove it
especially considering gaming headsets
are a thing and this is a gaming phone
but when you think about the target
audience mobile gamers you got to think
about how they're interacting with the
phone and if you're moving the phone
around you're doing all these kind of
movements you might not want a cable
dangling on the side of the phone
weighing it down or you know just
getting in the way so Bluetooth
headphones are the way to go with this
guy and I guess that makes complete
sense if you put yourself in the shoes
of a mobile gamer now don't get me wrong
I'm not trying to make excuses for this
phone it's still missing those features
but at least I can understand some of
the logic behind it and luckily they
include an adapter that's supposed to
have a 24-bit DAC so that it's giving a
little bit more juice to the headphones
to give better sound quality and I tried
this against another headphone adapter
that I had lying around and I didn't see
a huge difference between the two maybe
slightly but honestly it wasn't big I
had to really listen in to see the
difference but it does give you the
ability to use it and it's in the box so
it can't make any real huge complaints
there but all-in-all guys I think for
what Razer was trying to do with this
phone which was built something that's
great for gaming and consuming media for
their first try I think they hit it out
of the park this is a great phone I
personally love it and considering this
phone retails for about $6.99
feel like you're getting a lot of bang
for your buck when you're getting
performance that's equal to a lot of the
flagships out there you're getting stock
Android and specs and hardware that
leads to tangible results that you can
actually experience in the real world I
think this phone is a good bye guys
razor is not a sponsor I'm not getting
paid to say this but if you are looking
for a good phone I think this is one
that you should definitely have on your
list but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and of
course I'll catch you guys in the next
one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
