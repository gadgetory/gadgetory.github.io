consumer and today I'm going to be
unboxing the Logitech UE boom box so
let's not wasting your time let's get
right into it my my my my ba-bump
ba-bump ba-bump and all right guys here
we have the Logitech UE boom box now you
guys have seen me do portable speakers
before so this is going to be a pretty
interesting one to check out I'm
definitely always surprised by how great
Logitech products are so here we have
the UE boom box if you take a look
around you can kind of see how big it is
and how it's going to be how it's gonna
fit in the hand so you've got an idea
there here shows you a quick little look
at the boom box itself nothing too
surprising this is bluetooth of course
it's wireless so it's going to be a
great wireless speaker hopefully so
enough for my blabbering let's get this
bad boy open here we do have some tape
so we're going to cut this open here
and we've got some over here as well and
let's flip it over put this thing away
and pop off the top oh that's pretty
cool so we have it sitting here right in
the top just pop it over here and I must
say just picking it up it's got some
nice heft to it got some real good heft
to it so put that over here and see what
else we get inside here we have the AC
adapter so we can plug this into the
wall probably charge it up and what else
do we have here then we just have this
little manual so this is the set-up
guide this is warranty information I'm
sure so all that stuff goes away put
this over here and let's take a look at
this bad boy itself so we can put this
so we can put this thing to the side
over here nothing too special and just
take a look at this so the first thing I
want to note is that this has a
texturized bottom so it feels
smooth but it feels grippy so this thing
isn't going to be sliding around
anywhere as you guys can see can't
really move it so that's really good if
you want to take this outside and you
don't know what kind of surface you're
going to come across that's really nice
over here on the side we have the
Bluetooth button as well as the power
switch you have an audio input right
here so your exhilarate able so if you
have a device that isn't Bluetooth you
can just plug this in right here with a
cable and GART start listening and of
course here we have the area where we'll
be charging it so we've got all that
good stuff what's on the other side and
on the other side you can see this big
plus and minus symbol this will actually
control the volume so if you want to
increase it tap it decrease it works
like that very easy to use and I'm not
sure what's inside here but I'm assuming
it's not something you really want to
open up probably where the battery is
and all that good stuff and pretty much
this is it guys this is the Logitech UE
boom box looks pretty good it feels very
durable this feels like it's very well
built good stuff and this retails for
about two forty-nine ninety-five so you
can spend 250 on something like this and
I'm gonna have a review for you guys of
it for sure and we'll see if we have
another outdoor sound test just like the
beats portable and beats pill stuff like
that and before we close out this video
here's a quick message from our sponsor

at school no kids I'm joking but really
you can do it if you want with hotspot

to our sponsors over at hotspot shield
but this was a really quick unboxing
guys there's not much to the packaging
you get the speaker and the adapter
and pretty much that's it so hopefully
