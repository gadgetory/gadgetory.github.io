today we're going to be revisiting the
minimal debt setup I made last year but
I've made some tweaks to take it to the
next level now I wanted to create a desk
set up that didn't need a ton of bells
and whistles but would have everything I
need and still have a clean layout this
is a set up for those of us who use our
laptops for everything but what a nice
space to dock it in when we get home so
the first thing you'll notice that's
different is this Dell XPS 15 hooked up
to this beautiful LG monitor by simply
plugging in one cable this XPS 15 is
ready to be used like a desktop and I
need to emphasize this folks one
Thunderbolt cable makes the whole setup
come alive once we're plugged in you get
access to everything you see on the desk
here and it's a pretty seamless
transformation and I love it so thumbs
up if you're feeling that too now of
course I have to show my pc folks in
love so we've got the Dell XPS 15 here
and this is probably the most beautiful
Dell laptop I've ever seen
it has a sleek aluminum finish with
carbon fiber under the lid the infinity
edge display is stunning since it's a 4k
touchscreen and truly gives that near
bezel look feeling I've even been able
to game on it a little obviously it's
not as powerful as machines designed for
gaming but it's decent enough this XPS
15 is running an Intel Core i7 processor
with 16 gigs of RAM and one terabyte of
solid-state storage
really you can use any laptop list under
both the report to jump into this setup
and even though that XPS is 15 inch
display is beautiful it can be a bit
limiting if you want to do a bit more so
it's nice to have it hooked up to one of
LG's 38 inch ultra wide monitors now our
feature just monitored on the channel
before and I definitely think it fits in
well here it's got thin bezels it's
ultra wide which is perfect for
extending your desktop for spreadsheets
or multiple windows when you're getting
work done but it's also good if you want
to do some gaming and this is why we've
got this Xbox elite controller here on
the side if you don't want to use a
keyboard and mouse to game you have an
Xbox controller ready to go I threw into
the lead controller since it matches the
aesthetics of the setup and cuz it's
elite and since we want to keep things
simple and
here is connected to a wireless adapter
so you're dealing with no cable sounds
coming through these wired bose speakers
which comes with a subwoofer and even a
separate dial to control the volume or
to quickly mute your sound now I've been
using these speakers for a long time and
I think they sound great but even better
they don't have a large footprint which
is perfect for the setup
now the only thing plugged into the
laptop other than that Thunderbolt cable
is the adapter to the Logitech g600
Mouse now this mouse is one of my
absolute favorites and I featured a ton
on the channel and that's because it's
easy to use has a ton of shortcut
buttons to make gaming or even working
easier and best of all it doesn't
require a mouse pad which helps to keep
the things on a desk at a minimum and
what to setup without a decent pair of
headphones and here we have the MDR
1000x an audio technica headphone hanger
but obviously if you make a similar
setup you can just throw on your
favorite pair of headphones and they
should fit on this just fine the hanger
is perfect since this desk is pretty
small and I wanted to keep this as
clutter free as possible so we hanged
here if I ever need it out of the way
but still accessible if you're not
digging the laptop under the monitor
look we can always keep it closed and to
the side and thanks to this Logitech
k3nt we won't miss a beat with this the
setup feels more like a traditional
desktop and since the keyboard is
bluetooth you don't have to worry about
plugging anything in just pull it out
whenever you need it of course you got
to sprinkle a couple of things to make
the setup look good like this lamp and a
plant mostly things that I got from Ikea
but I have everything mentioned in this
video link down below in the description
so be sure to check that out if you want
to pick anything up but that's about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
