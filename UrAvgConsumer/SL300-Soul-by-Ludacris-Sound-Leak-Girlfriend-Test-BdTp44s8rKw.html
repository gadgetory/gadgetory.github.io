want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
your average consumer and here's my
girlfriend again hello and we're gonna
be doing another sound leak sound
isolation test if you're the girlfriend
test and we're gonna be doing this with
the SL 300 sold by Ludacris so that we
see any time let's get right into it
alright guys so first thing about these
headphones is that when you have the
noise canceling feature on it
drastically changes the volume of the
headphones so I'm going to be testing it
between NOLA noise cancelling and noise
cancelling just so you guys can have an
idea of what both settings are like
alright guys so we're gonna be trying
the song out at about 50% with no noise
cancelling and we're gonna see about how
loud that is turn ready yep
you play it okay I guess that answers
our question guys 50% Malloy's canceling
she can't even pick it up she's right
next to me so let's try it out with the
noise cancelling on this time I hear but
it's not very loud at all
so she could slightly hear she's right
next to me so that doesn't that's not
saying too much when you're in the
regular place probably won't affect any
anyone at all so now let's try to crank
it up at 75% no noise canceling as well
so let's see how that works I mean I
hear it it's not it's not like oh really
loud yeah it's not a bother to you I
don't know no she's right like a good
again she's right next to me so that's
pretty good 75% no noise cancelling not
so much leakage now we're gonna try it
without wasting those cancelling on to
see how that effects it it makes a lot
louder this time it'd be more obnoxious
to me I'm sorry yes it's a lot louder
this one I'm gonna be able it probably
matches of someone oh yeah my parents
well there you go there you have it
let's try it out at about 100% and see
how that goes right
yep Yolo you can bet it's really loud
that's not nice canceling it's real bad
I'm sorry that's no noise cancelling and
it's really bad yeah yeah so now we're
gonna try with noise cancelling let's
hope I don't go dad
don't live once right yeah so there you
guys have it at 100% noise-canceling on
or off its going to be very loud it's
going to bother someone of course but I
think at this at the regular volumes
though you're pretty safe with these
they don't seem a 75% which I'm pretty
sure that's the range where most people
would have it I don't love all the Pens
but I'm pretty sure from 75 down you're
completely fine you won't be a bother to
anyone all right so now let's see if the
sound isolation how the sound isolation
works we're like I said this is the
girlfriend test she's going to be saying
something to me we're gonna see if I can
drown that out I'm only going to keeping
the noise canceling feature on for this
part because if you want to cancel out
noise
you're gonna want another cancel a
feature on so we're just gonna try again
you ready yes let's hope it works got
50% yep never mind I'll find someone
like you I wish your name mm-hmm yes so
50% is not going to cut it let's try it
out at about 75% never mind I'll find
someone like you
so I couldn't really hear her hurt a
little bit but it was pretty I couldn't
really hear the racket so it's Annie
okay for a seventy-five percent um I
don't think you'll be hearing too much
she's right next to me and she's on a
pretty loud so I think you'll be fine a
seventy five percent and upward but for
the sake of you know trying out all the
volumes I see you had a hundred percent
adjust how much we can block it out
hopefully shouldn't hundred percent I
can hear anything she says hit me often
so loud so I think you'll be finite a
hundred percent guys I don't think you'd
want to put out it was sound like I said
before that's no good for hearing these
headphones are really strong I don't
think that anything can really bother
you too much on the outside if you have
it that loud however like I said I don't
recommend it but just so that you guys
know and pretty much that's it the
girlfriend test was a sort of a success
I was able to drown out most of that
same thing so I think these are good to
go they don't seem to leak a lot they do
a decent job at noise canceling it
doesn't it does a good job in noise
canceling sorry and I feel that these
are definitely good in both aspects so a
okay for us alright guys so if you like
this video please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and I'll see you
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
