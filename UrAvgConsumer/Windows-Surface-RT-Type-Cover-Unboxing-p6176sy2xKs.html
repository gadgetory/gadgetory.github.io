consumer and today I have another
unboxing for you guys of Windows newest
tablet D surplice and I'm also going to
be unboxing the type cover for it so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it alright guys so here we have the
Microsoft Surface tablet with Windows RT
free installed and this is the 32
gigabyte version and honestly I've never
had any real experience with Windows 8 I
haven't even been using the Windows
Phones that have been out recently so I
have no real experience with these um
with the new Windows interface that
they're going for besides Xbox 360 so
it's gonna be really interesting to see
how how I adapt to this and I'll let you
guys know as average consumer how you
guys mind adapt to it as well so enough
of my blabbering let's get this box
opened and we have a little state on
tape seal here and I still can't find my
unboxing knife so I'm gonna have to make
do with this guy and let's get this
thing open and I think I got it there we
go and don't play with knifes kids but
but let's get this out and as you can
see us at surface here and we've got
some more tape so and we got some more
tape on this side as well so some more
just put your knife action let's get
this sliced and there it goes together
and I think that should pretty much be
it so there might not be any more
butcher knife action there and let's see
and here we have it so here is the
surface tablet let's put this to the
side real quick also included you have
some manuals and stuff of course some
instructions so here are some surface
what
so you've got 1c information all that
how to use the surface tablet
instructions all that good stuff of
course you have your wall adapter to
charge it so let's take this out and
it's got a pretty cool little sticker
here this is a very interesting little
adapter it's very hmm it doesn't feel as
cheap as um a lot of other adapters this
feels pretty nice I actually like this
pretty cool adapter I give you guys a
quick close up of this alright so here
we have the surface charger like I said
this looks pretty nice I actually really
like the quality of it it's got windows
new little logo there and here you can
see the what it looks like a MagSafe
connector that Apple uses it looks like
that but um this is their proprietary
connector and pretty much this is it
this looks like it's gonna be a pretty
long cable as well let's see how long it
is so this is indeed a pretty long cable
I'm not sure if you guys can really tell
but it seems pretty long I would say
like 4 feet or so maybe more so there we
are
alright so now that we've got the
charger out we can move some of these
boxes out of the way put this charge
over here let's unwrap this tablet you
can pull this
and pull this out right off the bat guys
I can tell you this feels pretty nice I
like the the material that's made out of
its like a nice metal material this
feels very solid I'm really happy with
that um let me give you guys a quick
close-up of what I'm seeing all right
guys so here we have the front facing
camera part in the reflection of my
actual recording camera but there's the
front facing camera this is one
megapixel and I believe the rear camera
is also one megapixel so I don't think
we can expect to take any high quality
pictures here I think this just just to
serve the purpose of like video chatting
and stuff like that also at the top
we'll find the power button over here a
USB point or USB port that supports USB
2.0 I think I've seen in other reviews
that it doesn't support 3.0 here we'll
find also on this side we'll find the
micro HDMI out to plug in HDMI cables to
your television or dim display here's
where you find your you plug in the
charger and let's see on the other side
you'll have your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack your volume rockers right
here and I'm not too sure what these are
but I want to say their speakers so I
believe these are speakers and right
here is where you at the bottom is where
you plug in your type cover or touch
cover or whatever one you have and also
in the back is where we have that flap
that kickstand and over here is kind of
where you pull it open on the left side
and this is the kicks in also on the
back of the kickstand is where we can
find a micro SD card slot so we can put
up to 64 gigs of storage right there
and that can significantly increase the
amount of space on this so it's gonna be
pretty cool I'm really interested in
seeing the us the USB port in action
because I heard you can put in a whole
bunch of stuff and connect it to like
external hard drives Mouse keyboards all
kinds of stuff so it's gonna be really
fun to see
what kind of stuff you can plug in here
and also this is where you have your
little home button and pretty much
that's it guys now let's see if we can
power this thing on and all right guys
let's see if this thing has any juice
all right and it does have some juice as
you can see it's a surface on the screen
now and it's loading and it's still
loading so you know what while we're
letting this load let's see if we can
unbox this type cover so I'm going to
put this over here and let it do its
thing
and then let's drag this thing out and
of course we've got some tape here too
so let's bring back the butcher knife
thought it was over and there we are so
let's pull this out and alright here we
have the type cover and I believe we
just what pluck it yep
there we go here we are it's got a nice
little material in the back here it's
very soft so so it would be some nice
protection like cover it should be a
nice cover for the tablet itself so
that's pretty good and I like the type
cover how it feels the keys actually
feel pretty nice I'd much rather have
this than the touch cover and let's see
what else we have here
you can pull this little slot out and I
guess you got some more information some
more stuff on how-to instructions on how
to connect it to the tablet and here we
go alright so that's that pretty simple
part of the unboxing now I believe the
surface is all powered up and good to go
select English go next
cept alright guys so now I'm up to the
whole personalizing it part and I
probably finished this off camera and
I'll let you guys know how it is that's
pretty much it for this unboxing um I
gotta say I'm pretty impressed by the
materials used it seems pretty hefty
it's got some good weight to it it feels
like a solid device I like the metal
materials and all that good stuff and um
oh yeah let me connect this back oh
there you go it snapped right on to it
so that's pretty cool
I see yeah so this it does it very well
um pretty happy with that this is what
it looks like together so not bad I
really like this this makes it really
real it's a really really thin
combination here so very happy with that
I'm gonna go for the setting that up
guys and you know that's about it thanks
