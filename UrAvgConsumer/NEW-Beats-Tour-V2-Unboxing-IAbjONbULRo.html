consumer and today please excuse the
background there's like no setup here
but my little laptop in my desk and
that's because you guys know I am moving
into a new office space or area whatever
you want to call it but everything is
being moved I don't have anything set up
but these guys just came out a brand new
version of the beat stores so I had to
get this unboxing out to you guys even
though I'm not setup whatsoever so hey
let's not wasting any time let's get
right into it and alright guys here we
have the beads tours this is DS by Dre's
newest version I've been hearing some
people complain that when they're trying
to get their old ones switched out for
warranty or whatever they're saying that
they no longer make them and that kind
of makes sense at this point because
here we have a new remodeled version and
the B stores of my favorite in years buy
beats by dre so this is pretty exciting
as you can see in the back it shows you
that it's got the new inline remote as
well as like it's the similar design to
the newer headphone cables so that's
pretty cool and it also has this little
thing to stay in your ear so it's got a
pretty interesting design but enough
blabbering let's open it up
got my little unboxing knife here and
we'll pop the plastic get that open and
pull this off boom and there you go so
corset saying big sound small package
gonna be really interesting to see what
these look like here pop this open same
red box and here you have them so these
are pretty similar to the old ones but
before we get into it let's take a look
at the side right here of course you get
some packaging information that you know
has the warranty stuff some catalogs I'm
sure stickers
so we've got quite a stuff quite a bit
of stuff here warranty information not
sure what this is this is the Quick
Start Guide and I'm sure this is the
catalogue showing all the new stuff yeah
there you go
show us the whole line right here Wayne
gotta yada yada alright so enough of the
paperwork let's get that back inside
here and now to look at these we'll put
this on the side and here you have the
new case which is pretty interesting the
new case now has a red B but I'm not too
fond of this because this looks like it
can peel off or get scratched or
something I'll give you guys a quick
close-up of the material and alright
guys here you can see the material looks
like it's like it looks like a stickers
on top of this before was indented in um
now this has this little sticker look to
it I'm not too fond of this but let's
take a look inside of it see if there's
anything included and nope that's just
your standard case this is what the old
beats ball the beat stores without
monster this is what they come in - this
stickers kind of beyond it and let's see
what else they have and we also get this
little thing that includes a ton of ear
tips inside you get quite a few ear tips
in all of these so that's also included
and you get these these are the new
little pieces that can stick onto the
tours and keep your ears - I'll keep the
tours in place in your ear so this is
like a secure fit kind of thing here -
so pretty cool I was pretty bummed that
the old these tours without monster no
longer included a hook so I'm glad they
did something to kind of remedy that and
now let's try out the tourists
themselves see what they're like and off
first glance these remind me of the
urbeats they have a pretty small cable I
was a big fan of the cable on the
on tours because they were thicker they
made me feel like they would last longer
these have pretty thin cables we're
really reminds me of the Euro beads but
I do like the design of these though
they do look pretty cool
they're definitely different from the
original and let me give you guys a
quick close-up of what these look like
and alright guys here they are these are
the newbies tours and what's pretty cool
about these is that they're actually
kind of see-through over here you guys
not might not be able to tell but you
might be able to see the little red on
the inside of it so it's a little
see-through um you can see the little
red inside that's actually a pretty
pretty nice a little addition to the
design here on and like I said before
this has the inline remote similar to
all the new beats products so it has the
same look the old tours are sporting the
old monster version and of course they
have the little B here and also for the
input Jack you have this and it looks
different this is um smaller now it's a
lot smaller still l-shape um input but
now it has this little red B pretty cool
not bad very small looking these
definitely feel a lot smaller than the
originals but overall with the design
I'm not too I'm pretty pleased not too
fond of this thin cable I liked it when
it was just a little bit wider and now
I'm going to show you guys what it looks
like with these new ear tips I'm not
sure what these are like so let's see
here I guess you kind of just take off
this piece first and you guys can see it
has a little red speaker grille so
that's pretty cool so I think you got a
trick turn it put it on like this
then it kind of just covers everything
as you guys can see here and then put
these on it
and there you go so with all this
material if you guys know what your tips
feels like feel like you'll know that
it's like a it's made to stay in your
ear this thing is made out of the
similar material so I can see this
working a can of Matt I can't imagine it
working in staying in the ear they have
different sizes of course this is a
medium size I'm sure they have larger
small for those with different ears and
pretty much this is it guys this is what
it looks like um I'm pretty impressed
with the design it still has the curve
like the tours have so that's pretty
good but that's about it for this
unboxing guys give you a full review see
if anything's changed how much better it
got if it got any worse I'll compare it
to the old tours and maybe the euro
beads and we'll see what we can find out
about these new earbuds and thanks for
watching guys is your average consumer
until the next video
