consumer and today I'm going to be
reviewing the sole Republic that speaker
so let's not waste any time
scare right into it alright guys here we
have the sole Republic back speaker this
is the first Bluetooth mini speaker made
by Sol Republic and usually retails for
around $200 there are quite a few
Bluetooth mini speakers out there but
let's see if this one's for you here we
have the gunmetal version of the deck
but solar public offers quite the color
varieties such as lemon-lime vivid red
and electro blue the deck has a very
compact design while still packing a ton
of features the size allows the deck to
be pretty travel friendly and if you
plan to travel with it it comes with a
travel pouch that if it's pretty
securely in this should protect it from
scratches and blemishes but it probably
won't do much in terms of impact damage
from Falls or anything of the sort
one thing I do like about the deck is
the texturized material at the bottom it
allows you to place the deck on most
surfaces without worrying about it
slipping or easily being pushed and
knocked over now when we take a look
around the actual device you'll find a
few buttons on the face of the speaker
you'll notice that it has NFC and we'll
get into that in just a second volume up
and volume down controls are on the
sides and a Motorola buttons in the
middle you might not notice it but
there's also a mic when you have the
deck paired with a phone you can use it
to hold conversations if the speaker on
your phone just isn't cutting it and
those have sensitive with said I sounded
pretty clear without having to be too
close to the speaker so I was pretty
impressed the Motorola button is a
multi-function button that allows you to
play in pause music as well as answer
and end calls holding the button will
switch the speaker between outdoor and
indoor mode and outdoor mode basically
gives you a volume boost for those
harder to hear sounds while you're
outside the big Sol Republic logo on the
front also acts as a status light to let
you know when you have an incoming call
when it's searching for or connected to
a device as well as letting you know the
current battery level while charging
speaking of battery that that gives you
about 10 hours of usage and I found that
I didn't have to charge it frequently
which was pretty nice the deck also
comes with a dual port wall adapter
which actually was pretty convenient if
you like
charge the deck as well as the connected
device at once and now to talk about
that NFC NFC stands for near field
communication and on the deck it allows
you to pair it with an NFC capable
Bluetooth device which are usually
Android devices by tapping them together
this causes an instant bluetooth pairing
between the two devices and NFC is
always a welcome feature as it makes
things like pairing that much easier
at the top of the deck you'll find a few
buttons and ports the switch on the Left
allows you to switch between three
different modes the first allows you to
pair the deck with another Bluetooth
enabled device and the second is heist
mode which we'll get to in a second and
the third is single user mode you also
have a 3.5 millimeter line in and out
Jack and these are pretty cool because
you can use the line out to plug the
deck into a bigger speaker and still use
the Bluetooth to control the music from
afar line-in allows users who don't have
Bluetooth devices to still use the deck
with an auxiliary cable and finally the
microUSB port to charge the deck as well
as the power button and now back to this
interesting thing they call heist mode
this allows up to five people to stream
music to the deck and give them a chance
to share or steal the spotlight
that's the name heist mode however when
in high smoke if you want to be the only
one controlling the music you're going
to want to hit that Motorola button to
lock you in place here's a quick
demonstration of how it works
never wrote a song but I know that she's
a star call me crazy
Italy Chicago feels better when you let
it out oh my girl we get it we get over
all the deck has some really great
features but now let's talk about the
sound quality the sound quality is
pretty impressive for a mini speaker and
the deck offers 360 degree full sound
which is supposed to hit you from all
angles and it works pretty well since
the speakers are facing upward the deck
even includes a subwoofer which is quite
surprising considering its size however
the deck doesn't have a ton of bass if
you're looking for that but the bass
performance was much better than things
I've seen like on the beats pill vocals
are pretty clear and I found that it
works well with most onerous the sound
is definitely loud enough to fill a room
and if you're going outdoors there's a
mode for that as well now do I think the
deck is worth $200 that it cost I think
that depends on what you're in the
market for if you're looking for a
feature pack Bluetooth mini speaker I
definitely think this is amongst the
best you'll find out there however if
you don't care about size there are some
other options in the same price range
you might want to consider for sound
although I'm not sure if they'll pack as
many features and I personally like the
deck and I love the tech that it's
packing and that pretty much wraps up my
review guys if you're planning on
picking up the deck which of the four
colors are you looking to get let me
know in the comments down below and big
