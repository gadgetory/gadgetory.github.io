and it's been a while since we took a
look at a pair of beasts on the channel
so let me introduce you to the beats X
the beats X our Apple's newest line of
Bluetooth in the air bud and when you
pick up one of these you'll get a couple
of things in the box
of course the earbuds themselves a
travel case multiple sized ear tips some
wingtips for a secure fit and a
lightning cable and this is actually the
first pair of beats to include a
lightning port instead of a microUSB
port since being purchased by Apple but
taking a look at the actual earbuds
they've got what they're calling a flex
form cable which falls in line with some
of those earbuds with a built in neck
band and I really like this now this
band isn't super rigid but it does a job
at keeping this in place and it allows
for some flexibility when you want to
stuff this into the travel case or maybe
even your pocket the earbuds themselves
are slightly curved so it sits
comfortably in the air with no worries
of them falling out whatsoever now I
personally didn't need the extra
wingtips to have you stay in place which
says a lot because I have terribly
shaped ears and usually with earbuds
they tend to fall out of my ears a lot
so I can't imagine that a lot of people
will complain about comfort but it is
pretty cool that they've included these
in case you're doing some extreme
activities and you need that extra
secure fit now something I really like
about the style of earbuds is that is
great for working out due to that secure
fit from the neck band but unfortunately
unlike the power beats these are a sweat
proof so if you tend to get drenched
when working out you might want to be
careful with these something you'll
notice with these earbuds that have this
neck band is that they have different
styles of cable management some are
retractable something's a clip but the
beats X uses the magnet to keep the two
earbuds together
unlike other earbuds that come in this
form factor though these still have an
inline remote on the earbud cable which
at least makes it easier to reach those
audio controls
they'll also launch with four different
colors you can choose from and if these
get the typical beat treatment I'm sure
you can expect some more colors in the
future now these are packing eight hours
of battery life but the kicker with
these is that there's got this fast fuel
feature that allows you to get two hours
of listening
with five minutes of charging and that
is insane if you have to take these
anywhere and they died on you all you
have to do is plug them in for a few
minutes and you'll be up and running and
if you plug them up for 45 minutes
you'll get a full charge now one of my
favorite things about the beats X is
that it includes Apple's new w1 chip
this makes paying with an iPhone as
simple as pressing the power button for
one second hitting connect on your
iPhone and boom you're all done this is
the best way to pair of bluetooth
headphones that I've seen so far because
it's just so fast
another nice bonus if you're in the
Apple ecosystem is that you're able to
use this with other devices connected to
your iCloud account by just selecting
beats from the menu no having to pair
all over again to a new device just
select it from the menu but if you're
not in the Apple ecosystem no worries
just use the power button to pair it
like any other bluetooth headphones now
let's talk about sound quality honestly
I think these are great I put these
through the ringer with a ton of
different genres and I'm walking away
with no complaint the sound was clear
the bass was definitely punchy but in no
way overpowering and the vocals were
clean now obviously I'm not going to
call this perfect because sound is
subjective but I really can't imagine
what someone would complain about unless
they're looking for something that has a
really flat sound but you're not really
going to find all consumer grade
headphones because these are meant to be
a lot more fun for 150 bucks
I do think these are great Buy and if I
had to nitpick I would probably say that
the sweat proofing I wish that was
included but I do understand that the
power beats do exist so if you're
looking for in earbuds that can handle a
heavy workout they've already got
something to cover that also maybe the
travel case I'm not too crazy about it
it'll definitely protect it here but but
I do wish that there was some way that I
could seal the earbuds in instead of
having that open flap but I do think 150
is a fair price these are really solid
pair of earbuds a lot better than I
expected I thought they were going to be
something on the lower end since they
were a little inexpensive for the beats
line but they actually managed to
surprise me and I think it's safe to say
that since Apple took over beats we've
only seen improvements in the line
and the beats X continues that but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
