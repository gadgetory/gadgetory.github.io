let me stop fooling around what's going
on guys it's ravage consumer and today
we've got a special special product here
this is the Star Wars Jedi challenges
now I don't know about you guys but I'm
a huge Star Wars fan if I didn't prove
it enough in that unboxing video I did a
while back where I completely dressed up
as a Sith while I did the unboxing I
loved that video that's probably my
favorite video of all time anyway I'm a
huge Star Wars fan so huge shout out to
Lenovo for partnering with me and
sending this out so I can have some fun
with it so here we've got the box I
don't know if you guys can see this is
kylo Ren and this is gonna be me I am so
excited to see this lightsaber tape yeah
oh they got me this back now we're ready
to see what's inside I hope it's the
lightsaber first oh it is it is the
light super first oh man this looks
legit and it feels legit so this is
pretty lightweight which makes sense cuz
you're gonna be swinging this thing
around but uh let me put this to the
side for now and see what else we get
inside up the box oh so I've got a
little card here that lets you know
where to go to download the app so this
right here is the tracking beacon and in
this box we've got a few things like
double-a batteries and you've also got a
few different cables USB type-c
lightning micro USB so this is going to
work with multiple devices so depending
on your phone whether it's Android or
iOS it's going to be able to work with
all of those and this is another USB
cord probably for the actual device
itself and you got a booklet and now we
have the last piece and that is the
heads
oh this is nice oh I can see myself in
it
yeah yeah now the main things that you
get inside of the box are your tracking
beacon your augmented reality gaming
headset as well as your lightsaber which
I am in love with so let me see if I can
actually turn this on we're gonna get to
this augmented reality headset in a
second but you gotta give me a moment
with the lightsaber let's see oh I feel
like everyone's done that sound at some
point in their lives and this is just
kind of awesome to actually have it in
hand this is this is dope now the way
you use this all oh hold up I just saw
that I could do this like a tree yeah
like that oh yeah this is hot
all right all right let me stop fooling
around now I know a lot of you are
probably wondering where's the rest of
the lightsaber but that's where this guy
comes in so like I said this is an
augmented reality headset so what you do
with this guy is you open this little
flap on the side and you can throw in
your smartphone you just download the
app throw it in here and then you're all
good to go
and basically what awed mented reality
means is you're going to be able to see
your environment and all of the effects
from the game so your lightsaber your
opponent all of that will be inside of
your room but enough explaining how it
all works I'm ready to jump in all right
so I'm ready I've got my phone in hand
got the headset let me show you guys how
to put it in so you have a little slot
over here you just pull this little tab
open and then you have this tray that
you can pull out and you can insert your
phone inside of here so now I just put
it in here and then I connect the cables
necessary
boom good to go I'm very excited
okay alright guys so I am strapped in
and I can see all the different planets
that I can travel to and just so you
know the idea behind Jedi challenges is
to become a full-blown Jedi so this is
Jedi training just like Rey in the movie
who we got Darth Maul over here and now
when you actually go into these planets
there are a few different things that
you can go to so if you want to do a
lightsaber battle as you can see here
with Darth Maul you can do that but
there's also strategic combat on the
left side as well as hollow chests so
you can jump into these three different
kinds of simulations but I absolutely
want to jump into a lightsaber battle so
let me take on Darth Maul right now and
so let me activate my lightsaber
okay whoo here we go look at this dude
it looks so serious so you can do all
kinds of things are you can guard there
we go oh and it's crazy because it makes
you feel like a legit Jedi because
you're doing all the standard moves that
you see these guys do he's kicking my
butt right now though oh oh
got him oh he's pulling Oh
so he kicked them up but that's because
I didn't take it easy I went on like
this second hardest difficulty that's
what I kind of like though this thing is
actually challenging so this is actually
really cool and I think next we should
jump into some strategic combat all
right so now I'm placing down some
towers
I got a laser tower over here protect my
frontline let's see if I can get some
cool stuff over here it's just an x-wing
Pole
let's get an x-ray right here oh yeah oh
that is awesome
look at it taking them down gotta love
excellence and what we're looking at
right now is hollow chess
so as you can see they've got their four
over there I've got mine so I'm gonna
see if I can send my guys out some
frontline you see what they do
oh man did you really just do that so
that's the thing here guys if you don't
have a strategy going in you're gonna
get beat but I think I can counter this
there you go one of my guys took him out
let's see here
yeah he took that now what I really like
is that as you progress through the game
you can get different color lightsabers
so we've got the standard blue here but
you can also get that Yoda green which
is actually really nice and you can even
go for that purple from mace windu he's
pretty bomb so I might continue with
this guy but you know what let me go to
this planet over here we got mr. kylo
Ren I heard yeah yeah he's no joke I
don't know I'll see if I'm ready I got
my mace windu lightsaber here so we'll
see what we can do another nice thing
that they implemented here our force
abilities so you can actually go in and
select a ton of different Force
abilities that you learn as you progress
throughout the game so as you can see
here there are quite a few skills to
pick up and I'm gonna select some of my
favorites you gotta have the push okay
guys so I've got my favorite force
ability selected and I got my mace windu
Sabre so I should be ready for kylo Ren
I got to get revenge on this guy I'm not
gonna say why no spoilers but I
definitely got to get revenge on him
alright time to activate the lightsaber
okay I could do that too alright let's
go
lock that block that didn't pick up
either huh he wasn't ready for me this
time around
Oh some supers oh he just called a bunch
of stormtroopers on me am i off walking
all their hits though oh I missed once
then call this forest I think I'm gonna
win one yeah I think I'm gonna win one
area
more weight more stormtroopers always
what did you do it's a woman oh he is
ruthless no oh good alright you know
what it's all good
Cara Lauren is up there in terms of
skill so I'm just gonna need to do a
little bit more training so that's fun
now what's great about this being an app
based game is that in the future Lenovo
and Disney can come out with future
updates and I'm pretty excited to see
what they come up with okay so that was
a lot of fun again huge shout out to
Lenovo for letting me experience the
Jedi challenges I think my favorite part
had to be the lightsaber battles it's
pretty amazing being able to experience
all the different things that a Jedi can
do using the lightsaber and the
augmented reality headset from me
bouncing bullets back to pairing with
other lightsabers and even hearing the
famous general zero sound that it makes
whenever you swing it I think it's all
is really really cool it makes a great
experience but for those of you who want

below in the description and for my
folks outside of the US we want to get
