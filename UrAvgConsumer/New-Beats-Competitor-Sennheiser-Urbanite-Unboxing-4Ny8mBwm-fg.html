consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of one of Sennheiser's
newly released headphones these are the
Sennheiser urbanite s-- now these are
made to compete directly with the beats
solo HD solo 2 line so hey let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
and alright guys here we have the
Sennheiser urbanite now these are on-ear
headphones and they retail for $200 so
like I said they're like direct
competitors of things like the beats
solo 2 s beats solo HD is probably even
v-moda XS so things in that category on
ear headphones these are supposed to
compete with it you're supposed to have
lots of bass so I'm looking forward to
that so lots of bass and Sennheiser is
great sound quality that they're known
for so I'm very very interested so let
me just give you guys a quick tour
around the box up front you can actually
see a picture of it I have the black
version and you can see it has a remote
for the iPod iPhone all Apple devices
comes with a two-year warranty you look
to the side it shows you the smart
remote with the mic so this is where you
can use the controls the inline remote
for all the controls and stuff it also
shows you what it gets inside of what
you get inside of the box so that's
listed here and in the back here you can
see the headphones again and gives you
some of some little tidbits about the
headphones loading slow features and to
the side more headphones but ok enough
box tour let me got let me open this
thing up it looks like we've got some
tape on the back so I'm going to use my
unboxing knife here and we're going to
pop this open so one quick slice there
and there we go for another one so I can
put this away now let's open this thing
up I'm actually really excited about
this you guys know me I love bass so
bass coming from Sennheiser I'm
interested so let's see what we got so
when you open it up you can see it's
protected by this foam so the foam has a
direct cutout
for the actual headphones so you guys
can I don't know if you guys can see
here because it's all dark but direct
cut out with foam and let's see what
we've got
so here first thing we're greeted with
is a pouch so this is the travel pouch
that you're going to be able to throw
these into I'm not going to offer much
protection but probably protect it from
scratches stuff like that put that to
the side
we of course have some paperwork and
this is their urbanite and seems like
we've got some warranty information for
the urbanite an urbanite excel stay
tuned for that
so urbanite XL and stuff let's see what
else we've got we've got a inline remote
now this is a flat cable so it's a flat
tangle free cable it has a pretty big
remote this is actually really
surprising how big this is so I guess
it's going to make it easier to just
grab it and you know hit the controls
but yeah that's the remote here has a
mic in the back of course playing pause
volume up and down controls so it's got
some decent length to it nothing too too
large of course this is made for
portable use it's going to be used with
your iPod iPhone stuff like that that's
where it's targeting so it's not going
to be an extremely long cable I'm a fan
of cables this size nothing not too much
dangling when I have to you know my
phone in my pocket and I'm listening to
my headphones
all right enough jabbering let's see the
actual headphones themselves here we
have it so we can actually just kind of
put this box to the side here so now
that we've got here sort of cleaned up
let's take a look okay actually guys
this feels very I like this I like this
a lot
it feels durable very durable taking a
look at the top it feels like this is
made out of the same material bookbags
are made out of so it's got that tough
feel but under it where the actual
padding is feels really soft very smooth
there's not a lot of padding in here but
it doesn't feel like it's going to be an
issue it is a very soft and smooth
padding right here even though it's not
really padded now feeling the actual
hinges itself and the parts that the ear
cups are actually holding on to it feels
like it's made out of some kind of metal
it feels extremely solid definitely
really good stuff so to tough material
up top metal on the sides this feels
like it's going to be a
a durable pair of headphones taking a
look at the inside of the hinges you've
got this little band here that connects
to the actual ear cups so that looks
pretty interesting as well so far guys
I'm actually really impressed the air
cut padding's feel pretty soft it feels
like it's made of some kind of suede
material does feel really nice in the
hands turning a quick look at the bottom
you can see on the left ear cup is where
you'll put in your cable so you can just
plug this in right here and boom this is
the look of the headphones so this is it
I can't wait to try these out the ear
cuffs feel pretty soft I don't think
that's going to be an issue it seems
like you can rotate a bit so it can
conform to your ear shapes so definitely
not bad and pretty much guys that's it
for this unboxing and first look
hopefully you enjoyed it I'm definitely
going to have a review up so stay tuned
for that I'm gonna try to see if I can
get a girlfriend test out of my
girlfriend and yeah so till the next
video hopefully you enjoyed this let me

think of what you see so far and yeah if
