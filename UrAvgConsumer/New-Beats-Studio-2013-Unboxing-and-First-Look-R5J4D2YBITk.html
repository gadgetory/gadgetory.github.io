and as you guys can see I am finally in
my new place as you can see I have my
new setup here um if you want to see a
room tour anything like that be sure to
give this video a thumbs up but that
step aside I've got an exciting video
today I went to the beat store and got
this little bad boy before it is
officially released and boom it is the
new Beats Studio the 2013 version and
I've gotten unboxing for you guys of it
today so hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it and alright guys
here we have the new beat studios now
this is the 2013 version they completely
remodeled it um has a completely new
design new features so it's pretty good
stuff as you guys can take a look around
the box you can see what it looks like
here
of course I as you can see I have it in
black I wanted the white ones but they
didn't have it in the store as you know
this is pre-release official release so
they had a limited stock so some of the
stuff that they have now is on you know
apparently better noise cancellation
rechargeable batteries and it's up to 20
hours of music play and it also has a
battery guard so you know exactly where
your battery is right before it dies you
can charge it up also it has an
automatic on an off feature so lots of
cool features here really good stuff
let's get to unboxing it and of course
I've got my little unboxing knife so
we're just going to pop this open here
and it got a little wet because I was in
the rain when this came out at rain
today so a little wet see if we got the
rest of the stuff off
and some plastics out of the way here we
have it alright so first thing we're
going to do is slide the top up so now
that that's gone we'll set that right
here and I see pretty much the same kind
of box now you can flip it up rather
than um pull a tab open from the side so
we can leave that there and the original
remastered so we have a little tab here
open up and then of course this is the
case and looks like a little sticker in
the back there let's see if there's
anything else in here
pretty heavy box okay so up here in the
back here there's a little tab
kind of makes this pop out and we can
rob this throw that over there and we've
got a couple of things here we've got
some packaging here we got a microfiber
cloth even down here that seems to be a
little something whoa alright so let's
see here lots of little things so the
first thing we're going to look at is a
new charger so this is a new beats
charger and you've got some cables so
we've got three cables here we've got a
USB and the
cables to actually plug into the
headphones one has an inline remote and
one is a straight cable and this is the
USB so we can put these to the side here
and since this is a new USB charger I'm
going to show you guys what it looks
like up close and here we have it inside
it has like a little red USB thing in
the back got this so it's a pretty
simple charger but it is new nonetheless
it's got the beats logo on it and you
know what I'll show you guys what the
cables look like as well here you've got
the USB cable that is pretty similar to
the beats pill and the beats Wireless so
nothing too surprising here and of
course here we've got
straight cable and this has the same
jack as the new beats tours so this
might be new to some of you but this is
what it looks like and of course this
goes into the headphone and I do like
when it's the raised version because it
works with mobile devices better so
that's cool and this is the one with the
inline remote the inline remote is
pretty standard here is what you come to
expect with the new beats designs and as
you see here it features the new input
and all that good stuff so yeah there
you go
oh and last but not least here we have
the little clip that it comes with so I
guess you can throw this on your case
and snap it onto your bookbag or
whatever you want to snap it onto and as
we have this little paper packaging here
we'll open this this will most likely
getting a bunch of warranty information
marketing materials a bead sticker of
course so here we've got the warranty
stuff back here um a QuickStart guide so
this is where it indicates you know some
of the new features that the studio's
have and of course this is where they
show you the whole product line so
that's that yeah so let's get some of
the stuff cleared up and alright so here
we have new studios this is a smaller
looking case than the old version so
it'll take up less space which is always
good so um hey let's not waste any time
want to see this thing already opening
it up and boom here we have it and this
time all this has a beats of course it
has a glossy finish and it's got a nice
feel to it this reminds me of the beats
executive ear cups for sure so that's a
good thing because a beast executive had
some great ear cups very soft these are
really really soft so this is nice um
let's see what stickers they have here
Auto turn on and off plug into to turn
on unplug to turn off once you plug in
your cable it'll automatically turn on
and when you unplug it it'll turn off
I'm not sure if this has any juice so I
can demonstrate for you guys but that's
what this feature does
going to peel the sticker off and let's
see what this says charge me up before
you turn me on so there you go we got to
charge it up so we're going to UM peel
that um and let's see this is it guys
time to give you guys a close-up and
here you have it guys these are the new
beats studios now one thing I can tell
you the black version is definitely a
fingerprint magnet I've barely touched
this thing and there are fingerprints
all over as you guys might be able to
tell all over here
tons of fingerprints so this is a
fingerprint magnet I really wish I did
get the light ones but this still looks
really good and this looks a lot smaller
than the original studio is the original
studios were a little big in my opinion
and this looks like a really condensed
version this looks really nice I'm
really happy with the size it looks good
and um yeah overall I really do like
this this feels like a more streamlined
version not as bulky looks really good
um let's see what we have here and right
here we have the power indicator and you
might be able to see these little ridges
right here these are where the LED
lights are so it'll tell you exactly how
much battery power you have left and it
seems to have five notches so that'll
give you a pretty good idea of how much
battery you've got so there will be no
guesswork you'll know when you need to
charge these bad boys up and below your
battery indicator you have your micro
USB port so this is where you charge it
up and right here is where you plug in
your cable so that's pretty much it guys
these are the new beats studios the
cushion feels pretty good um I see here
feels pretty nice I'm a fan of it I like
the way it looks this looks pretty good
guys I can't wait to hear how it sounds
so you guys know you have to stay tuned
for the review the girlfriend tests all
that good stuff and um yeah this is it
hopefully you guys like this video and
you like seeing this first look at the
new beats studios feel free to rate
comment and subscribe

soon on these guys so then is your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
