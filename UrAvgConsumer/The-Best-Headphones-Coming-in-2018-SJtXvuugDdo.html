consumer and like every year I spent a
lot of time to CES looking for the best
headphones coming out in the new year
and here's what I found
so first up you know I had to pop by the
Sony booth to see what new stuff they've
got coming out and actually found
something pretty interesting in a new
pair of completely wireless earbuds now
everybody's making their own version of
these nowadays but Sony seems to be a
little bit different these are designed
for people who are really active as
there's a big focus on comfort fit and
sweat proofing they even come with wing
tips to ensure a secure fit things like
air pods don't fit my ears so I was
pretty happy when I tested these out and
they did not budge now I didn't get a
chance to extensively test out the sound
or base of these earbuds but Sony's
supposed to be integrating their extra
base features onto these so that's got
me pretty excited and these are also
gonna include noise cancelling and an
ambient sound mode that we've usually
seen on some of the higher price
headphones like b1000 X so it's gonna be
pretty cool to see them here and that's
gonna bring some nice versatility with
these with active noise canceling or of
course drowning out everything around
you but with the ambient sound mode if
you're being active you're maybe jogging
or doing something like that you'll be
able to hear your surroundings better
even though these are in earbuds and you
can also hear somebody who's along with
you so if you're talking you can hear
that so that's gonna be a pretty nice
offering that you don't typically see on
any ear buds and we're getting about
three hours of battery life with active
noise-cancelling and I believe it's
supposed to double if you don't use it
and you also get the carrying case that
you typically see with truly wireless
earbuds that can recharge it and give it
an additional nine hours and these
earbuds are also gonna be able to work
with Google assistant I believe that's
supposed to be coming in a future update
with these but little assistant features
are always going to be a nice thing
these fit well they look pretty good and
they're gonna come in a bunch of
different color options so I'm pretty
excited for these to come out I have
links to these and the other headphones
that I've talked about down below in the
description if you guys want to check
them out and now we've got another pair
of headphones from of course another
reputable brand audio technica these are
the 88 ANC 700 BT I really have no idea
where they get these names from these
are another pair of active
noise-cancelling bluetooth headphones
and they may not look like much on the
exterior but I'm actually appreciating
headphones that aren't too flashy
nowadays
I'm getting old you pretty much have the
logo on the ear cups a few buttons and
that's about it and the reason why
they're able to keep these so minimalist
is because they now have integrated
touch panels on the left ear cup for you
to control your music it's a three
section touch panel that works pretty
similarly to any inline remote that you
find on a typical pair of earbuds or
headphones but you can use some swiping
gestures if you want to change the track
that you're listening to now I didn't
get a few minutes to play around with
these and I did find them to be pretty
comfortable from what I could tell so
far the sound was pretty good but I of
course need more time with them but what
really impressed me was the active
noise-cancelling and the fact that I was
able to completely tune out everyone on
the show floor and if you've ever seen
the crowds on the show floor you know
that's a big deal
and what I also really like is the price
these gonna be going for about 200 bucks
which I honestly think is a pretty good
deal when you compare them to other
headphones that are similar to these
from brands like Sony Bose or even
Sennheiser these come in black and grey
and I supposed to have a 25 hour battery
life when you have bluetooth and active
noise-cancelling on honestly I really
want to get my hands on these because
they look like a really good option in
terms of value and performance and last
but not least you know I had to talk
about the Sennheiser HD 8 20s these have
been getting a ton of attention lately
these are the clothes back cousins of
the HD 800 which are a pair of bomb
open-back audiophile grade headphones
now even though these are a pair of
closed back headphones they've got these
gorilla glass plates on the sides that
helps it bring down the reverb so that
they can sound similar to a pair of
open-back headphones and even though
these guys look pretty massive they're
actually light and very comfortable to
wear they also have a companion
amplifier that's called the HD v 820
which gives the headphones the juice it
needs to get the full range of sound out
of them now it's gonna cost you a pretty
penny if you plan to get your hands on
these especially if you get them
together but if you love audio and you
love the HD 800 these are probably gonna
be worth looking into now I personally
hope I can get my hands on these but I'm
not holding my breath and that's about
it guys I know this is a pretty short
list but there wasn't much that I saw
out there if I didn't miss anything
though you guys need to let me know with
a comment down below but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully enjoyed it if you did be the
cool guy
that gives if you have thumbs up I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
