announced a while back well I've been
testing it for about a week and I know
some people are probably wondering what
Google's trying to accomplish with the
slate and I think I have the answer this
is Google's answer to the iPad pro but
for Android well we've got right here is
first and foremost a tablet running
Google's Chrome OS and the actual
hardware feels really good in the hands
thanks to the rounded edges around the
body as well as the overall solid build
quality it's also got this nice high-res
twelve point three inch display and it's
a pretty nice nice to have when it comes
to media consumption watching movies
playing games and of course like web
browsing now I really like to watch my
favorite shows on large tablets so for
me the experience here is a good one
especially with those nice Slav
front-facing speakers I've been using
that twelve point nine inch iPad pro for
eight a long time now so this size feels
right at home for me but if you think
that is too large you got to remember
once you attach a keyboard to this guy
it goes into the laptop mode and that's
when you appreciate the size a bit more
now let's talk about that laptop
experience a bit I think Chrome OS does
a pretty good job at blending the world
between a laptop and a regular Android
tablet it does a really good job at
incorporating both since you can use all
the Android apps that you get from the
Google Play Store with this but when it
comes to the actual laptop experience
you still have your file explorer you
also get a full google chrome web
browsing experience with all the plugins
and everything that you would expect
from google chrome on a regular desktop
you're gonna be getting that here as
well so from a software side I do think
Chrome OS is evolving into something
that is a viable option for laptop users
who also want all access to Android apps
but when it kind of falls apart from me
is the actual hardware that's available
for the slate and I'm pointing fingers
at the pixel slate keyboard now this is
the Google made keyboard that's supposed
to go alongside the pixel slate as one
of the options if you're looking for a
keyboard but to me this keyboard is just
I don't think it's a good buy first off
it cost 200 bucks and it doesn't provide
the best user experience now while I do
think it's made out of good materials it
has a backlit keyboard the keyboard even
has circular keys that you either love
or hate I personally had no problem with
it I type pretty fun
but the overall feel of it just feels
very flimsy it definitely doesn't
provide a good laptop situation
especially when using it on your lap the
flap that kind of keeps it all together
and helps it to be a folio case feels
very very flimsy it moves around quite a
bit
for me I think Microsoft solution to
this was including a magnet where the
keyboard can actually rest on the tablet
you can't really do that with this so
you have to put it on a flat surface and
when using that on your lap it just it
feels all kinds of wobbly and what's
weird about it is when you're using it
on a wobbly surface like your legs you
get this weird
click whenever you rest your forearm on
the side of the keyboard the trackpad
actually clicks which is a huge problem
because if you're moving the mouse
around it's gonna lead to a lot of
unintentional clicks I don't know how
many times I've dragged things around by
mistake by simply leaning on the
keyboard and it's honestly something
I've never experienced before so right
here we have the surface pro keyboard
no matter the Flex you don't hear any
clicks the trackpad is not being clicked
in by mistake I even have the eve
laptop's keyboard same deal here with
the pixel slave keyboard we're just a
little bit of flex you can hear that
click and I don't know if mine is
defective but if it isn't that's
definitely a design flaw and my other
issue with this flap being so flimsy is
that when you go to hold it in your
hands maybe you're just carrying it
around like this you've noticed the
cover moves a lot this is just not ideal
I'm not a fan of this by any means
doesn't happen with the surface type
cover or the e laptop's cover and not
even the iPad pro although this does
wiggle just a smidge it's nothing like
this guy right here this thing just
moves all over the place not a good look
so for me the sleek keyboard isn't
really a good option but I do like the
fact that you can prop it up in almost
any angle that you want there's a lot of
flexibility there but I honestly have a
hard time recommending to slake keyboard
at its price
with all the flaws that it currently has
but it isn't all just doom and gloom if
you want to use the slate as a laptop
there are some other options out there
like the bridge keyboard which is
actually a Bluetooth keyboard that
matches perfectly with the slate it has
the same finish it allows it to feel a
lot more sturdy and honestly this looks
as good as a first-party keyboard and it
even cost $50 less now the hinge design
is a little bit funky with this one it
uses these rubber grips to kind of hold
the slate in place and it does a pretty
good job it allows it to move around
pretty easily when attached but
something I've noticed from my
experience is that those rubber pads can
be moved which will expose the metal
part which could potentially scratch
your slate if you just shove it in there
without paying close attention but I
honestly do think that this is the
better option between the two although
it doesn't have a backlit keyboard but
there are some other cool features and
accessories like the pixel pen which
allows you to do all the artsy stuff
that you'd come to expect as well as use
it for google assistant to highlight
certain things on the screen and that
will automatically make google assistant
pop it up and thus they can even
transcribe your handwriting to text so
if you're not feeling like typing and
you just want to use your pen you can do
that as well speaking of Google
assistant you have dedicated keys on the
keyboard or you can even shout out hey
Google and that'll get it working and I
also really like the fact that Google
implemented a fingerprint scanner right
into the power button I think that is
the place that all fingerprint scanners
should go and it's nice to see it here
on a tablet and the pistol slate also
has a front-facing camera as well as a
rear-facing camera by the end of the day
their cameras on a tablet which probably
won't get that much used but it is nice
to have the cameras if you ever need
them they do include portrait mode but I
just wouldn't expect the same quality
that you get from the pixel 3 I will say
though I am happy you opted for 2 USB
type-c ports so when you're using this
thing like a laptop you don't have to
worry about what side you got to charge
it on you can charge it from either side
you can even use the other side for
accessories which is a nice bonus and
beyond being able to plug in extra
accessories with that of the USB C port
you can also use an external display so
that you can project whatever you have
on your screen onto a bigger display
which you can even enhance the
experience of by adding a Bluetooth
keyboard and bluetooth mouse and we've
seen this kind of feature with Samsung X
kind of nice to have it here so that if
you're working on a project you can
actually use this little tablet to do a
lot more on a
bigger monitor but one thing that I am
not happy about is the fact that this
thing has no headphone jack that to me
is just mind-boggling it does come with
an adapter which is OK by smartphone
standards I guess these days but for a
full-blown tablet I really have a hard
time understanding why they couldn't
just fit a headphone jack in here now
let's talk a little bit about the
performance and this really can vary
depending on the configuration that you
go for my configurations got Intel's
eighth generation Core i5 processor as
well as eight gigs of ram and 120 gigs
of storage but for my experience the
performance was a bit hit or miss doing
things like web browsing was just fine
opening up a few apps was just fine
watching content not gonna be an issue
but when I started to see some problems
was with just trying to play some games
if you guys are familiar with the
channel you know I like to play sonic
forces that's my little benchmark as a
game that I've been addicted to for a
long time but it is my benchmark to see
if the device can hold up to playing a
pretty intensive game that's online lots
of things going on really quickly and
honestly the slate couldn't really keep
up with it I experienced a lot more leg
than I've ever experienced with a
smartphone and not only in the races
would that I have that issue but just
browsing the regular menu it just felt
like the slate couldn't keep up and it
was honestly the same experience with
some of my favorite mobile games and not
being able to play game smoothly has me
a bit fearful for more intensive apps
that require just a bit more horsepower
I've also had a glitch out on me a few
times you guys can see but a piece of
b-roll here but this thing was kind of
just freaking out on its own moving tabs
around doing all kinds of weird stuff
but I'm hoping that that may be because
I have an early review unit and that a
software update may be able to fix that
in the future and that's been my
experience coming from the second
highest configuration option available
so anything below that has me a little
bit worried I almost feel like I
couldn't even recommend anything under
the i5 so from a performance perspective
I feel like you gotta go I 5 or i7 the
lower ones you can use for just regular
web browsing but I honestly wouldn't
expect to do anything too crazy on them
and while this thing can run an android
app from the Google Play Store which
aren't all optimised for Chrome OS and
they can all work with any
device that you may already own it is
clear that bools targeting pics will
owners by even including some special
features if you already hate pixel owner
some of those features being smart
unlocked where you can unlock the slate
with your phone
also there's instant tethering which is
pretty cool because you don't need Wi-Fi
in order to get on the internet with a
slate if you have your pixel and it has
service it can get the data from there
and function like it's running on Wi-Fi
with the data that you're getting from
your pixel you also get access to your
messages so you can respond to texts
right from the slate which is kind of
nice kind of reminds me of iMessage a
bit so as a companion device to a pixel
phone or maybe another Android phone I
think it works just fine if you want to
just do everyday things but if you're a
student or maybe professional this might
not be the best option for you yes
you'll be able to do all the typical
things like use a full web browser
access Microsoft Word you can do those
kind of things but if you need
specialized programs that's kind of
where you run into limitations
I just find those basic things don't
weren't the pricetag that you're gonna
have to pay for this there are better
options out there that cost a lot less
and pretty much do the same thing like I
said if you're really big on Android you
want to have access to Android apps on
your tablet and get a full web browsing
experience this will definitely do that
but you won't be able to do some of the
crazier things unless you maybe go for
the i7 model
I feel like Google still trying to get
its footing when it comes to the pixel
book pixel slate those kind of things
Google still trying to figure it out but
based on the operating system alone I do
think that from that perspective it's
moving in the right direction the
physical Hardware of the slate itself I
think is really good specs could use
some work and that folio keyboard
definitely needs some redoing but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it I know this was
a bit of a long one but let me know what
you think of the pixel slate down below
until the next video guys it's your
average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
