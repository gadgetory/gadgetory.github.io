time with a list of tech for $25 or less
now jump-starting this list we've got a
very cool item that's finally gonna
replace the rocket fish headsets then
that I showcased in the very first year
average budget video and this is the
audio technica headphone hanger now even
though this isn't a stand is still a
cool way of storing and displaying your
headphones without it taking a much
shelf or desk space an audio Technica's
design is pretty clever here since all
you have to do is simply rotate the
clamp until it has a secure grip on your
desk or shelf and boom you're done and
if you have a thick desk that's not a
problem since you can simply change the
level of the clamp my kid desktop tends
to be a bit on the thicker side but it
still works perfectly it also has a 360
degree swivel which allows you to move
it around without changing the grip now
what I like about these aside from that
price is that it has included padding so
that it protects your beloved headphones
so don't need to worry about scratches
or dents in your cushion with daily use
overall this is a solid option for those
of you looking for a new way to have
quick but still stylish access to your
headphones
now next is something you really want to
pay attention to the mpow Bluetooth
earbuds
now you guys know how much I love
bluetooth so I had to include this on
the list they come in a variety of
colors and even include some silicone
ear tips so you can have the perfect fit
in your ears taking a look around the
air buds you'll see a volume rocker a
USB port for charging and an EM power
button you use this button to power on
the earbuds and to connect them to a
Bluetooth device at only 20 bucks I was
really apprehensive about trying these
out but I was really surprised with
their sound quality so if you want
access to Bluetooth earbuds but don't
want to pay some of those crazy high
prices this is a pretty good deal now to
full disclosure I picked up two of these
guys and one of them I experienced a bit
of lag which isn't a big deal if you're
listening to music but if you're
watching videos or playing a game it
could get pretty annoying honestly I
don't think it's a big deal at all but
if you do experience that a simple
exchange can fix your problem I'm
telling you guys at 20 bucks this
is a steal sometimes you don't even
realize you needed something until you
have it and that was the case with this
guy
the glorious extended gaming mouse man
what a name if you're a PC gamer or just
want a sleek and spacious mouse pad for
your desk setup then this is a great
option for you what I like about this
mouse mat is that it's long enough to
rest both your keyboard and gaming mouse
on keeping everything neat and off the
actual desk
it also has stitching around the
perimeter which should help preserve its
life so if you're a heavy gamer you just
spend a lot of time online you should be
good I've been using large mouse pads
for a while now and I love having the
extra space I also like the look of it
against a larger size desk they have
other color options and sizes available
and I'll have links to these as well as
everything else listed in this video
down below in the description but man I
really wish I had something like this
back when I had an addiction to Final
Fantasy 11 next up we've got the Aki
quick charge 2.0 car charger there have
been plenty of times where my phone was
on its last leg and I had to go out but
luckily I had this guy since this thing
supports quick charge 2.0 it charges
your phones really quickly if they
support it Aki claims discharge is 75%
faster than your typical card charges
and I got to say I believe it I've been
surprised by how much of a boost I get
after a quick 20-minute car ride and
there's no need to fight with your
passenger about who'll get to charge
their phone during the car ride since it
includes two ports for simultaneous
charging this Aki car charger is super
inexpensive at just 12 bucks and it's
completely worth the buy now you may
have seen me pick this up in my massive
gadget haul video and it's awesome this
is the gritty organizer
it's a rubberized pad with a ton of
straps to hold things like cables
devices and really anything else you
could think of on the back there's a
small pouch with a zipper to hold
additional accessories or even some
paperwork it's one of the newest
additions to my gadget backpack and is
definitely coming handy when it comes to
organizing all the things that you guys
know I carry what's great is that it
literally holds anything that can fit
under its straps here are a couple of
ways I've used it and a few examples of
ways you could use it as well and as you
can see this doesn't have to be used
exclusively for tech you can use it for
school or anything else
can think of since it's so customizable
now that about wraps it up for this list
but I want to give a huge shout out to
audio blocks for sponsoring today's
video and being the source of the dope
background music you guys heard here if
you've never heard of audio blocks is an
affordable subscription-based stock
media site that gives you unlimited
access to premium stock music you'll get
