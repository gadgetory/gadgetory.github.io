and I don't know if you know but
Nintendo just released its first trailer
of this new system the Nintendo switch
so here are five things we've learned
from the new trailer so first thing that
we learned just like the rumors the
Nintendo switch is a console / portable
system so you can take this on the go
and it's pretty interesting it has a
dock that's connected to the TV and
we're not sure how much the dock does
besides charge the device as well as
connected to the television it looks
pretty big and it has a couple of ports
on the side but it looks like you'll be
able to play both as a system and as a
portable console one thing that I like
that we're seeing here is that the
screen / portable side of it actually
holds the cartridge for the game that
you're going to be playing so that means
you're not gonna be streaming from your
home or you don't need any internet
connection to actually take this and go
somewhere else with it
it seems pretty seamless all you do is
pick up the switch and it should go from
your TV straight to the handheld really
quickly and it seems like the switch is
gonna be packing an nvidia tegra
processor which used to be found on the
Nvidia shield tablet and that was meant
to bring some console light performance
to a portable system so I'm pretty
excited to see him video playing apart
here in second which I'm really excited
about is this thing has a ton of
different playstyles that's the name
switch like I mentioned you can play
this like a console by docking it up and
connecting it to a TV and you can also
play it as a portable system which is
kind of like this but it seems like an
improved version I don't know if the
ergonomics are gonna be the same because
it's a lot flatter but it should look a
lot better than this screen and
definitely more portable and the switch
also kind of changes the way you play
this on the go obviously you can use it
like a handheld system but you can
actually take off the side controllers
and use the screen by itself and use the
controllers in hand and you know kind of
treat it like a TV which is something
we've never seen on the handheld system
so if you're not going solo and you want
to play against a friend it looks like
you can do some split-screen action we
saw on the trailer that you can do this
with Mario Kart and the way you're able
to do this is with the two controllers
on the side it seems like you can just
slide off pieces of the controllers so
you hand one over to your friend and you
can both play it with those
two different controllers it's very
interesting but it looks like it can be
done and if you go this route it seems
like each Muni controller has like a
joystick and the four buttons you need
to play and another way to play against
your friend is if you both have switch
systems so you can play against each
other wherever you are probably with an
ad-hoc network and third on the list are
the controllers those side controllers
we've been talking about those are
actually called joy Khan's now with the
joy Khan you can play them in a couple
of different ways as I mentioned you can
use them by having the screen by itself
and having each one in hand so it's kind
of like having two wiimotes in your hand
but they're much much smaller and it
looks like you can attach the joy Khan's
to a base and they're calling that base
the joy grip now the joy grip should
make it a bit easier to use to joy
Khan's when you're using the switch as a
console but I'm not sure what kind of
functionality it'll add besides giving
it the shape of the actual controller
there do seem to be some lights on the
joy grip so maybe when you attach the
joy Khan controllers it'll charge it so
that you can use them wirelessly when
you're on the go now the joy Khan's or
the joy grip aren't up your alley you
can always get a pro controller which
should seem a lot more familiar and the
fourth thing that we learned are six of
the games that are coming to the switch
they of course showed the new Legend of
Zelda game coming out
there's also Mario Kart 8 as you guys
saw with the split-screen there's also
gonna be another Mario game so it might
be a new Mario adventure there's gonna
be splatoon for those of you who love
that a new NBA game which is going to be
probably NBA 2k 17 and if even got the
Elder Scrolls Skyrim I love that game
and it's gonna be really crazy to play
that portably now and last but not least
and this wasn't mentioned in the trailer
at all but things that I've seen online
are that it's gonna be coming out in
March of 2017 and it should be retailing
for about 300 bucks but what do you guys
think of the switch do you see yourself
picking one up do you think that
portable / console hybrid is gonna make
sense let me know with the comment down
below and be the cool guy that give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
