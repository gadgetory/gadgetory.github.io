and today we've got another episode of
dope or nope
this time featuring the bose qc25 but
first I want to let you guys know that
I'm teaming up with the movie Inferno
starring Tom Hanks you gotta check out
this awesome experience called journey
through Hell where you work through
challenges in each of the nine circles
of hell this week it's violence fraud
and treachery man that's dark
there's tons of cash prizes and a chance
to win a trip to Italy the puzzles are
live now so click here to see if you can
handle it and don't forget to go and
check out Inferno in theaters next
Friday October 28th but now it's time
for this doper nope and these are the
bose qc25
this is the latest in the Bose
QuietComfort line and retails for 350
dollars now that's a lot of money but
these are meant to be premium noise
cancelling headphones they've got the
standard Bose headphones look that we've
seen with older models and pretty much
look exactly the same as the bose qc25
in terms of colors you're looking at
black or silver as your options these
are a pretty clean looking pair of
headphones they feel super lightweight
and I really got to give it up to Bose
for nailing the ergonomics of their
headphones the ear cups have this nice
oval shape and since these are over the
ear headphones this leads to two things
first being awesome comfort especially
when combined with the plush ear
cushions and the padded headband and
second they provide a great seal that
leads to some very nice passive noise
isolation long-term comfort and blocking
our sounds are pretty much what these
headphones are made for thus the name
quiet comfort the padded headband is
also pretty nice but heads up it is
covered with this fabric material and if
you get the silver version like I have
here you're gonna want to be careful
with it since it can definitely get
dirty but like I said you will be able
to wear these for long periods of time
which is great for travelers especially
those with very long flights another
thing I appreciate about the design of
the QC 35 is its flexibility the ear
cups can rotate to be laid completely
flat and they're even foldable if you
need them to take up less space while
these are relatively thin they still
feel pretty sturdy and
surprisingly I wouldn't worry about
these at all in the durability
Department the QC 35 also come in a hard
shell carrying case which comes in a
nice rectangular shape so it fits nicely
in bags it also comes with a micro USB
cable to charge it an airline adapter
for the travelers out there and a 3.5
millimeter audio cable now I'm not crazy
about this cable because the end that
goes into the headphones is actually 2.5
millimeters which means you can't just
replace the cable with one you may like
more or with a cable that you already
have lying around it also doesn't have
any inline controls which is a bit of a
bummer luckily these are bluetooth
headphones and you do get access to
audio controls on the right ear cup so
when you're using these wirelessly you
can go through all your music and answer
calls without having to grab your phone
unlike when you're using the cable you
can also pair these with two devices at
once which is really nice if you want to
pair these with your phone or another
device like a laptop or tablet the QC 35
s also feature NFC so if your device
supports it you can easily pair them by
just tapping them together but of course
the biggest feature of the QC 35 is that
active noise-cancelling both pretty much
dominates the active noise-cancelling
headphone market and with these it's
pretty easy to see why it's amazing if
you're looking to hear nothing but the
audio from your device or even if you
don't want to listen to anything but you
just want to block everyone out the
active noise-cancelling is so effective
when you take these off it's like the
sound from the outside world floods back
into your ears there are microphones
packed all around the headphones so it
can take in all the outside noises and
sounds and cancel them out I have to
admit though when I first tried these
out the noise cancelling was pretty
uncomfortable my ears felt the same
sensation they do when you first take
off on a plane so it felt like they
needed to pop but since this was coming
from the active noise-cancelling there
was pretty much nothing I could do but I
stuck with it and eventually got used to
it but I can guarantee this is
definitely not for everyone with active
noise cancelling and bluetooth you'll
get about 20 hours of battery life which
is very solid and means you won't be
looking to charts as frequently and if
you choose to use this with a wired
connection you'll get about 40 hours of
active no
canceling which is also pretty awesome
and when you first turn these on you'll
hear a little voice that lets you know
the remaining battery percentage which
is a nice added touch now when it comes
to sound quality don't expect to be
blown away I honestly don't think that's
the real reason why people pick up those
headphones they sound pretty decent and
they're a lot better than my last
experience with Bose which came from the
QC 15s so it is kind of nice to see that
Bose is improving their sound quality as
they come out with new stuff I think you
get a pretty decent overall package here
you get a decent amount of bass both
will come in clearly and the clarity is
where I'd want it to be for any of my
headphones
the most surprising thing here is that
it still sounded pretty good when off
and using a wired connection usually you
see a very big difference when listening
this way so it's pretty good to see that
Bose is closing the gap now are these a
doper no I think for the average person
who's just looking for a solid pair of
headphones I'd have to give this a note
for that price point but when you want
to think about what these are meant to
do and who they're targeted towards I
definitely think they're dope they've
got a nice lightweight build quality
which is extremely comfortable for long
listening sessions and the active
noise-cancelling cannot be beat
especially when you're traveling so for
who it's meant to be and who is targeted
for you're gonna get what you're
expecting but if you're looking for just
a solid pair of headphones you don't
want to pay this kind of money I'll be
sure to include some other options down
