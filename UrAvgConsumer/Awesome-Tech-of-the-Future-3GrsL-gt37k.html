and today we're looking at some tech of
the future sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T I'm
currently in Las Vegas checking out CTIA
and the tech of the future is everywhere
here first up we're looking at the Lego
super bike this bike has a built in 4
inch display running Android and it's
connected using a tMT's network it gives
you access to a ton of things like ride
details navigation music playback and a
bunch more
they've even tricked out the handlebars
by giving them these heart rate sensors
for health tracking indicators so people
can know when you're turning volume
controls for your music and even an
interesting walkie talkie feature I
think one of my favorite things about
this bike was the built in headlight and
taillight but what's special about that
taillight is that it creates its own
bike lane by firing off these lasers
which is awesome so that drivers can
give you some space when you're riding
in the street I was seriously impressed
when I heard all these features I didn't
even mention all of them if this is the
future of bikes I like where it's going
I also got to see some cool new features
DirecTV will be implementing like being
able to watch almost any show anywhere
with your phone or tablet the app even
lets you access your DVR and when you're
on the same network you can download
some of your DVR shows onto your device
so you can watch offline or even if
you're away from home and another pretty
sweet thing I learned is if you happen
to be an AT&amp;amp;T customer you can stream
all the DirecTV that you want onto your
mobile device without accounting against
your data that's a nice bonus and it's
pretty crazy to see how much further the
tech in our everyday things can actually
go we're getting much smarter cars
packing LTE connections which is great
for those riding with you using a mobile
device like a tablet maybe even got
connected sheet lamps with smart dimming
and monitoring capabilities that can
lead to way less energy consumption and
guys they're even checking out fire
hydrants all this is part of a bigger
theme about having a smart and connected
city which is going to be amazing to
witness when this stuff rolls out with
so many things getting connected and way
smarter with some smart tech that you
guys want to see in the future let me
know what to comment down
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
Phil then is your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
