consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the same blood pulse a smart
LED bulb with a built-in Bluetooth
speaker pretty interesting right but hey
let's not waste any time get right into
it but all right guys here we have the
singlet pulse now I just love coming
across products like these that are just
out of the box and have some pretty cool
functionality as I mentioned this is a
smart LED light bulb with a built-in 13
watt Bluetooth speaker and at first you
might be surprised at the combination
until you realize all the possibilities
there are with something like this but
before we get into that let's talk a bit
about what you're getting if you pick
this up I got my hands on the starter
pack which comes with a master and
satellite unit the master is your
receiver that speaks to the Bluetooth
device that you connect it to and the
master bulb sends that information over
to the satellite bulbs or bulbs if you
have multiple what's awesome is that the
master unit can support up to seven
satellite bulbs which means you can have
music firing from eight different
speakers these are packed with JBL
multi-channel stereo speakers and
they're actually pretty good but I'll
get into that in a second the pulse come
in a couple of color options such as
pewter and candy-apple and as you can
see I've got the candy-apple version in
hand installation is super simple as
these fit in a standard lightbulb socket
but keep in mind that these have a
larger body than your standard bulbs
when you're planning on where to place
yours I found my living room to be the
perfect spot for something like this and
so far I'm really impressed since these
are using your lamp as a power source
they don't require any extra cables or
attachments which is definitely
convenient now since this is a Bluetooth
smart bulb as you would guess it's
controlled by your smartphone or tablet
you can download this Anglet app from
the App Store on both iOS and Android
and the app gives you full control of
the bulbs giving you access to an on and
off switch brightness dimming control
speaker volume and even individual
dimming controls on each bulb you can
even name the bulbs in case you have
them spread out and you want to know
exactly which one you're controlling you
can also add more bolts in case you want
to deck out an entire area and get some
crazy surround sound if you do go for
that crazy surround sound or even stick
with the two that come in the starter
pack
you can control the stereo effect within
the app as well but let's talk a little
bit about performance you probably
noticed this in the video already that
these have a warm hue to them since
they're rated 2700 on the Kelvin scale
and they've worked very nicely for me so
far
and I'm also very happy with how
responsive the bulbs are to the
companion app and of course to talk
about the sound quality I wasn't sure
what to expect since these are speakers
inside of a light bulb but I gotta say I
was pretty surprised the audio quality
is actually pretty good you won't get
booming bass but there's definitely
enough to enjoy songs that need it and I
do believe that singlet is working on a
wireless adapter that should work with
just about any subwoofer in case you
want to add that to your system you can
also get pretty loud and considering
that I only have two I could only
imagine what it'd be like if you added
more to the system now if you haven't
considered all the possibilities that
are with something like this I could see
tons of different ways that this could
be useful if you're the type of person
who needs white noise to go to bed this
is perfect being able to control those
sounds and your lights from your phone
could be pretty awesome or maybe even
use it in a baby's room to have it
playing some lullabies I was so
impressed with these I had to show them
to airy and check out her reaction ari
come here for a second yeah check this
out
but in all seriousness I do think that
this is an impressive product and I
think it'd be a great addition to anyone
working towards gearing up a smart home
or anyone who just wants to get the most
out of their room you can pick up a
starter pack like the one that I have
for 160 $9.99 and additional satellite
bulbs for $79.99 each and if you guys
want to check it out I'll definitely
have links down below in the description
but what are your thoughts on the same
Glade pulse do you guys think it's as
cool as I do let me know with a comment
down below and if you enjoyed this video
definitely be the cool guy that gives it
a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
