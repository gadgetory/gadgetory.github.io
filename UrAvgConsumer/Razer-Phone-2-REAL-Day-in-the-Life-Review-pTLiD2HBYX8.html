and today we're gonna be spending a real
day in the life with a razor phone too
now if you've never seen one of my real
day-in-the-life videos you're pretty
much gonna be spending the day with me
and the phone as we test out things like
the performance gaming those new cameras
and of course the battery life but
spoiler alert the battery life that
you'll see throughout this day doesn't
tell the whole story so be sure to stay
tuned for the wrap-up at the end to get
a better picture but let's see how it
did in the real world all right guys
it's real day in the life time we are
starting off of course at 100% and this
time is 925 folks pretty early today for
me anyway we're having a pretty early
start but this is the audio and video
quality that you can come to expect one
thing I can see those that is a bit
overexposed but it's doing the correct
thing it's just I'm I'm black so it's
kind of hard but we got a lot of stuff
to do today guys so let's get started
all right guys so now I am in the studio
just to give you guys a battery update
it's 1033 and we're at 87 percent
battery now I was using the phone for a
bit answering some emails I played a
couple of games in my uber and just to
let you guys know where we stand with
screen on time it's not gonna be super
accurate today because for some reason
the phone randomly rebooted twice on me
so that kind of reset the whole screen
on time but before it rebooted I was I'm
sure it was probably like about 10
minutes of usage so I'd say about 34
minutes of usage now there are some
things that we have to factor in here I
am using the logo so it is breathing
actually it's not breathing I think it's
cycling through the different colors and
we also have it at 120 Hertz I feel like
for the reason for them - you're gonna
want those settings on so that's what
we're dealing with today
we're gonna see how much that impacts
the battery okay guys so we actually
shot a massive tech unboxing just now
but I had to jump on the phone really
quickly because we released a video
while I was doing it so now it has to
respond to some comments and I've been
typing up emails since earlier this
morning I gotta say the feel in the hand
not bad and typing on it with one hand
even though it is
bigger phones this is fine that is also
because it does have a smaller display
this is a 5.7 inch display compared to
all of these six inch displays that
we're seeing nowadays this one just
feels very comfortable to type on since
it's a smaller display but it still
looks very good we'll talk about the
display more later but I'm going to
finish up what I'm doing here in terms
of responding to some comments and then
it's gonna be some gaming guys I've got
to do some more gaming on this thing so
right now I am in an uber headed to the
city I got a meeting to go to so it was
the perfect time to pull this out play a
couple of games and see how it does and
in case you guys were wondering what
games I've been playing lately
Regalia lost has all of my attention
right now and what's nice is that this
thing is optimized for a 120 Hertz
refresh rate so it actually looks really
really smooth when playing on this phone
but this is a really fun game guys it
has a great soundtrack it's updated to
work with this phone so is I've been
really enjoying it so we're actually in
the tunnel right now so now's the
perfect time to show you guys what this
game looks like and I don't think it
translates well over video but man that
120 Hertz refresh rate
it looks so good okay guys so I got
where I needed to go and I will say
after playing on this for a little while
it does get a little bit warm that you
know new system that they've got to cool
their phones if you're expecting that to
completely eliminate the heat that's not
gonna happen
and definitely still some heat but it
isn't hot or anything definitely still
fine
to hold in the hand with no problem and
I didn't see any slowdowns in terms of
my gaming so so far it's not an issue
but we got a lot more gaming to do all
right guys so I finished my meeting now
we're gonna head over to be an H but we
got to give you guys a quick battery
update and it is currently 251 and we've
got 68% left and give you guys an idea
screen on time so an hour and 21 minutes
now any other phone I would really get
on them about this kind of battery life
but I've been playing a lot of games and
there are in New York but there are a
couple of factors to keep into
consideration like this logo the 120
Hertz display of course I think in my
wrap-up I'll let you guys know just how
much these little touches add in terms
of battery drainage but as of today
we're going all out and it's having a
severe hit and guys this wouldn't be a
real day in the life if I did not play
some sonic forces try to get my race on
dang I'm just all every time I play this
game it makes me look at that oh yeah
guys I do wish that this thing took
advantage of the 120 Hertz display
because it looks so good when you're
playing games with that refresh rate
honestly that's like I'm so spoiled by
agile Galia lost right now
I won the race that means this phone is
the best phone in the world you just got
to go buy it
all jokes aside though this phone is
like super comfortable to play games on
now I would be freaking out if I were
using another phone because of this
glass back being outdoors where there's
concrete
possibility of dropping it that all
freaks me out with no case but like I
said the foam is actually pretty
comfortable to use in the hand I think
because of these hard edges it's just
easy to grasp so that's something that
gives me a little bit more confidence
when I'm outside I didn't really have to
worry about it slipping out my hand and
falling even though this glass bag is
very slippery like if we had this thing
just laying on a table it would probably
slide around because it is kind of
slippery in the back but these edges
didn't make a big difference
all right guys so playing someone could
all Pokemon go my boy Malcolm over here
you know he's been playing on the iPhone
for a while and I have you you haven't
seen one 120 Hertz gaming have it
actually so I want you to all Piplup try
and catch mine and see the difference oh
[Laughter]
it's different so the difference between
a 120 Hertz display versus the regular
display to everyone else uses its
massive guys you notice it as soon you
gotta like spin it really fast and you
let the world know you can't play this
game well okay you caught it so that
that works that works night and day man
it's night and day
and we're in B and H guys this place is
just amazing being surrounded by all
kinds of tech you got laptops you got
all other tech over here you got cameras
it just never ends guys so we are in the
photography section got my boy Malcolm
over here we are going to try and get a
picture of him over here so let's see
I'm gonna just do a regular shot looks
very green I mean this is definitely
usable a little soft portrait mode is a
tighter shot this is kind of bad to be
honest yeah look how soft this is in
comparison looks like everything is just
kind of blurry but when you go over here
you get a lot more detail with a regular
photo maybe we'll try that one outside
all right guys so we left B&amp;amp;H I got my
man Damon over here he stopped mean
watches the videos so I figured why not
try out the front-facing camera take a
selfie with him so we kind of get an
idea of what that quality is like let's
see what we got now this is a properly
exposed photo some parts are a little
bright but for us brothers it came out
pretty clear yeah so it's not so bad
yeah can't complain about the quality
looks pretty good so now that was
some sunlight we're gonna continue
taking some pictures we got some flowers
up there put a little street signs some
got some colors going on let's take a
picture of this one and I'm also gonna
do HDR so the normal shot actually looks
pretty good you see down here at the
lower ends a little dark but I can still
see detail I'll see the HDR oh snap now
Ichiro looks way better here you see way
more detail in the plant and then you
can't over here it's a lot darker now
this isn't a bad camera or anything I
definitely think it gets the job done
but when you start comparing it to other
flagships especially just coming off the
pixel 3xl you do see some imperfections
HDR no HDR oh you're boring alright so
we just took a couple of pictures of
Malcolm - I did HDR and regular regular
shot looks ok the harsh sun is on his
face so got to be a little forgiving for
that but when it comes to the actual HDR
shot I don't know they just really
really brightened his face I prefer the
regular shot over the HDR shot to be
honest HDR definitely seems to be one of
those settings that you don't want on
all the time if a situation calls for it
like the flowers that I took a picture
of right there sure but it's not a
setting that you just leave on alright
guys I think I've been gaming way too
much we have 22% battery left Malcolm
has came and made me play pokemon go all
day kill the battery light so let's see
if we can give you guys a screen on time
update so we got 22% lap and we've been
using the phone for two hours and I say
about 45 minutes so almost three hours
and the phone's almost dead of course we
were gaming on it all day so in terms of
performance with gaming it's been able
to hold up even though the phone did get
a little bit warm I didn't see any drop
frames or if slowed down at all so no
lag or anything like that so that means
the cooling must be working but now
we've got
okay guys so I just have like the
scariest experience ever you guys know
the gadget backpack I have it right here
as you can see I'm alone now I actually
headed back to Jersey with my guys but I
forgot my backpack at the restaurant so
I had to run back to the city and grab
my backpack in the restaurant thankfully
it was still there but by now the razor
phone has lost a substantial amount of
battery and is at 8% but it is 8:42 p.m.
so it did last the whole day so I can't
really complain about that and I did a
lot of gaming but I'm not gonna lie to
you guys I'm actually still impressed
that it is still up and running so let's
see what I actually got so I got three
hours three straight-up hours of screen
on time and I put this thing through its
paces today I did a ton a ton of gaming
use GPS to even get to the actual
restaurant you guys saw it a lot of
stuff alright guys so I'm finally back
home I had about 6% when I put this on
the charger and I had it on here for
about 30 minutes and I have exactly 56%
so even with a four thousand milliamp
hour battery 30 minutes was able to get
two thousand milliamp hours worth of
juice in here so yeah pretty good faster
charging so you guys can get a little
idea of the speakers i got some thor
ragnarok over here check this out my
stereo speakers and honestly it just
sounds so so good so you guys can hear
for yourself
this thing is so loud and it honestly
performs as well as you'd want it to of
course with these giant grills we
definitely want this to sound good Harry
actually made some complaints over on
Twitter about these speakers but they
they do a really good job and that was
pretty much our day now we did end up
with three hours of screen on time but I
will say that is with the highest
consumption with the chroma logo in the
back and of course the phone being at
20 Hertz at all times now I did some
more testing of course and when I
brought the settings down
I saw a drastic difference in battery
life bringing the display to a 90 Hertz
refresh rate and the medium setting for
the chroma logo got me 6 hours of
battery life which is double what we saw
during that day now this is where Razer
offers something really cool with the
core-tex app not only can you find games
that are tailored to work well with the
Razer phone but you also have access to
your entire library so you can jump into
your games right from the app but what
makes this app special is the game
booster section and what's great about
the game booster section is that even
though I had the phone running at like
medium settings I could go inside and
fine-tune how I want the phone to run
with each and every game that I had so
if there's a game that could take
advantage of the 120 Hertz refresh rate
I can set it to that and the game didn't
support it I can bring down that setting
I could even fine-tune the clock speed
of the processor as well as the
resolution so you get a lot of control
here for each and every game and I
really like that because you can have
some games running full throttle and if
a game didn't require all that maybe
something like candy crush you can bring
down the settings so that it's not using
up too much energy now we talk about
performance and gaming and this thing
definitely excels at that but we're also
is really strong is of course with
regular media consumption it's got a
great looking screen with powerful
speakers so watching content is a joy
although I will say I wish the display
where brighter it is a bit on the dim
side so I do wish it had a little bit
more brightness to it just so that we
could enjoy quite a bit more now I think
I walked away feeling like the razor
phone felt pretty nice in the hand
texting on it was not a problem doing
whatever I needed to do wasn't an issue
it's not a very big screen as 5.7 inches
I think that's a pretty decent sized
screen but one thing I will say some
people will have some discomfort with
the back because it is a glass back but
at least with that glass back you do get
wireless charging a razor actually
introduced a Croma wireless charger the
thing is awesome I like the way it looks
I love the chroma effects I'm a big RGB
fan so this thing looks great to me I
know not everybody is but I'm glad they
made it now when it comes to the camera
there's definitely improvements compared
to last year still not a top-ranking
camera for me but it does have better
dynamic range than last year and it also
lacked a bit of sharpness in my opinion
portrait mode is not some
I would suggest using it just honestly
didn't look that good to me
but overall the camera is improved and I
noticed in my original RAZR phone wheel
day-in-the-life a lot of people said
they didn't care about the camera so if
you gamer phone lovers are still with
that sentiment then this is not gonna be
a big deal only an improvement so
there's that but overall guys if you're
big on mobile gaming and content
consumption this is the right phone for
you under the chroma logo in the back I
think looks awesome I love the fact that
you can customize it and change the
colors kind of match what you're wearing
I like having that flexibility I think
it adds a really nice touch to this
phone how many of you out there are
mobile gamers who take their gaming
seriously I personally like what I saw
with the gaming on it and I was very
happy with my experience but at $800 let
me know what you guys think I think if
you're a big gamer is definitely worth
looking into but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy or
girl that gives us video thumbs up I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
