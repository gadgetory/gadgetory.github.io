consumer this is my girlfriend hi and
today we've got another sound leak and
sound isolation test aka the girlfriend
test and today we're gonna be doing this
with the SOL Republic master tracks so
one thing I want to note is that we are
not in the same location of course you
guys know we're moving so we don't have
a real setup right right now since we're
in the process but we still wanted to
get this video out to you guys so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it
so first we're gonna start with the
sounding test with volumes of 50% 75%
and then 100% to see how them how much
the music leaks from those different
volumes from the headphones so first one
I started off at 50% alright 50%
I hear nothing at all so if the percent
is really really good all right not bad
two percent the other thing I scraped
over 75 percent I do hear it a bit a
slight bit I do hear it a bit more it's
probably wouldn't bother anyone unless
you're really really close to them so I
think this is definitely a pass oh good
job that 75 percent as well Wow
I think you can all clearly hear that so
this probably would bother someone maybe
not outdoors but indoors definitely so
that's about it pretty good job with the
sound leak test 15 and 75% were really
good 100 percent is what we would expect
and now for the girlfriend test okay
well today we're doing something a
little different we're not doing a
girlfriend test we're doing the
boyfriend tez easier and he is going to
be equities on the phone and talking
about the most recent NBA playoff
championship and this is a real-life
scenario I had to deal with this last
week so we're gonna see if these
gorgeous headphones can block out his
sound this conversation all right so of
course we're gonna start this at 50%
volume starting five percent and then
100 percent and we'll start up and we'll
start off a 50% here ready yeah hey man
what's going on
yo did you see the game last week crazy
LeBron did his thing man of course they
wanted to remind ya alright so if you
already have 50% so now we're gonna try
to add 75% and if that does a little
better right yeah that's a 5% rate one
more there you go yeah man I'm 94
surprised you see Game six
did you see what Ray Allen did crazy
there's no change right after that
dagger three I knew it was over
he had yeah I hear muffled here like
exact worst like small muffles but could
barely hear you
okay so that's for the missing out for
thank you okay so that's pretty good
can't complain there so now we're gonna
see it out a hundred percent and of
course guys don't listen to music got a
hundred percent a kid damage your
hearing but she's a trooper alright stay
ready yeah man it was crazy I'm not even
surprised like I said LeBron Dwyane Wade
Chris Bosh sort of did something I hit
like zero points but it wasn't too bad
yeah I don't hear a thing
alright and overall guys the solar
public master tracks did very well
the soundly test it did pretty well at
50% and 75% and for the sound isolation
50% wasn't so great but at 75% it was a
lot better
so overall good stuff and that's about
it for this sound leak and sound
isolation test guys sorry for the dull
background yeah but we'll be in a new
place soon and we'll catch you guys in
