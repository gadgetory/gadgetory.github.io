consumer so I got my hands on some
alleged iPad pro cases of course by the
hands of the greatest Apple leaker of
all time
Sonny Dixon and today we're gonna be
taking a closer look at it and comparing
it to the current model so let's not
waste any time get right into it and
alright guys here we have the iPad pro
case now first impressions this thing is
huge
no matter how I hold it it's just I feel
like this is going to be a very very
large device now there have been rumors
about this iPad pro for years now
different websites and blogs have been
talking about it
there have been mock-ups all kinds of
stuff where people just felt like this
was going to be coming out and this is
the first time that we're actually
seeing some kind of tangible proof that
it might actually be in the works
rumors have stated that things like Mac
OS 10 was gonna be able to run on it and
be able to run multiple apps at once
where there'll be true multitasking for
iOS all kinds of crazy stuff but rumors
aside let's actually take a look at this
case and try to get an idea of what a
possible iPad pro could look like now
we're down the street is that this is
going to be a 12 inch display closer to
13 inches and I believe the number
that's floating around right now is 12
point 9 inches to put that in
perspective that's larger than the 12
inch retina macbook that just got
released and quite a bit larger than the
nine point seven inches that you'll find
on the current iPad air 2 now let's
actually compare the size of the iPad
air 2 to this case and as you can see
it's quite a bit larger this thing
pretty much swallows it up I think that
even the screen size is going to be much
larger than the entire iPad display so
you guys can see a good look here this
is going to be a huge freaking tablet
but now let's actually put the iPad air
2 inside of this case unless they got
this piece of paper that's supposed to
represent
patro itself and let's try it here now
just looking at this I ball in it the
iPad air this doesn't fit inside the
case that well so the iPad air is
probably going to be a bit thinner than
the Perl model so this is so much larger
guys I can't imagine how this is going
to be that comfortable now let's also
take a look since we do have the 12 inch
retina macbook let's take a look at this
it's even larger than that so even with
a 12 inch Retina MacBook I guess because
of the large bezels on the iPad it can
even fit inside of here of course this
is much thicker but as far as the actual
length and width this is actually going
to be able to fit inside of that and
that's saying something this is going to
be a very very large device now let's
take a look at some of the cutouts that
you'll find on this case so using this
paper model we'll have an idea of what
kind of orientation the case is in so at
the top you'll have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack cutout as well as some
cutouts for the speaker grille and
you've got a little power button here
all the way on the right side of the top
to the right of that we have a little
cutout for the microphone as well as
your volume button so the volume up
volume down and behind that in the same
little section we have our cutout for
the camera as well as some flash going
down to the other side at the bottom you
find another two cutouts for speaker
grilles which is very interesting to me
so that tells us we'll have stereo
speakers for speaker grilles that's
gonna be actually really impressive if
that's what happens here and we also
have a little cutout for the Lightning
connector of course now on the left side
you do have another cutout and this can
mean up to three different things
this could be a cutout for another
lightning port which i think is kind of
unlikely since there's one down here
also we could see a USB C port which
wouldn't really have quite a few
different options now this could just be
a mistake and there's no reason for it
cut out here whatsoever there might not
be a port there I believe there was a
leaked picture that came out today of
the iPad pro what it might look like and
it didn't feature another port down here
at the bottom but on leaks the leaker of
that picture did say that it was a bit
dated so things might have changed since
then but I think the least the most
likely here is going to be a USB C port
now think of it like this if this thing
does end up running Mac OS 10 which I
think would make this thing extremely
expensive but if it does end up running
Mac OS 10 we could see more use for all
those USB C adapters that Apple has
introduced with the new retina MacBook
now this will give us access to flash
drives hard drives all kinds of
peripherals with the iPad pro and that's
actually pretty awesome if you think
about it now another thing that comes to
mind is that with just being in a
landscape mode there's potential here to
plug in a keyboard so think surface pro
3 you can have an attachable keyboard
dock this into it and boom you've got a
pretty much a functional laptop so this
could be Apple's way of combating the
surface not that it needs to but this
could be Apple's better take on what the
surface should be or how the surface
should run and that could lead to a lot
of potential but like I said that would
make this cost a lot of money I could
imagine and iPad pro with that kind of
functionality costing a ton of money
from Apple but it would be very
interesting than the less to see those
kinds of possibilities but pretty much
that's it guys what are your thoughts on
this iPad pro case the whole idea of an
iPad pro in general the idea of Apple
making something that will run both iOS
and Mac OS 10 I think there's a lot of
potential here but I'm really worried
about what the price point would be for
something like this but either way if
there is going to be such an item we're
going to find out probably later on in
the year if this does come into
existence would you guys pick it up does
it sound like an interesting concept to
you do you feel like you need a bigger
iPad let me know in the comments down
below hopefully you enjoyed this and
definitely a thumbs up to Sonny Dixon
for providing this case so that we can
actually talk about this and get an idea
of what
pad Pro is going to look like but
hopefully enjoy the guys total next
video is for average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
