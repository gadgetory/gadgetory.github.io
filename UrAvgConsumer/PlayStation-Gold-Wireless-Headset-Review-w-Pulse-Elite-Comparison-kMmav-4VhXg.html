Squarespace what's going on everyone at
your average consumer and today I've got
a review for you guys of the PlayStation
Gold wireless stereo headset that's a
long name but let's not waste any time
let's get right into it alright guys
here we have the gold wireless headset
and yes you heard right gold why is it
called gold only Sony knows as there
isn't the slightest hint of gold
anywhere near this headset - the little
trophy on the box but let's not dwell on
the name this is the gold wireless
headset and you should think of this as
a direct upgrade to the original
PlayStation wireless headset now let's
take a look at the actual headset it has
a very round look going for it
considering the shape of the headband as
well as the very round ear cups it's
primarily made of plastic and some
synthetic leather under the headband and
the ear cups and let me tell you this
headband is probably the most
comfortable I've ever felt the
cushioning is perfect for long gaming
sessions at first the ear cuts look like
they're packing the same kind of
cushioning but it's less padded than it
looks although still comfortable the
headset is as spacious as it looks when
you have it on since the ear cups have a
ton of space inside for ears of all
sizes the headset size is also
adjustable by pulling down the ear cups
for those of you who need just a bit
more room in the headband area you know
you are and although it's made of
plastic I wouldn't be too concerned with
durability unless you're one of those
raging gamers who like to throw things
now let's talk about some of the
features and buttons you'll see around
the actual headset all the goodies are
on the Left ear cup and the first thing
you want to take notice of is the on and
off switch that comes with an off
one-and-two label when on one
it'll give you a pretty flat sound with
no real emphasis on anything think of
this as basic mode - is a customizable
mode through the use of the headset
companion app on the ps3 and ps4 with
the app you can customize the sound
quality by changing the bass mids and
trouble you also use game developer
presets that might be perfect for the
game you're playing or at least what the
developer thinks is perfect anyway when
it isn't customized the to switch gives
you a slightly base your sound that is
much better than one almost all the time
moving on we have the
found in chat buttons these help you
toggle between the sounds of the game
audio and someone you're chatting with
in your party I love this feature on
these wireless headsets but I really
wish they kept the slider for this the
original wireless headset as well as the
pulse elites have a slider and it makes
it much easier to tell where you stand
between the two with buttons and no
indication of how far you are on one
side you can be left hunting for the
right balance quite a bit and based on
what people have told me in my party
they can hear it when you're clicking
the buttons and this is probably because
of how close the internal mic is to
these buttons and I'm sure it's not a
huge deal but it can probably annoy some
people and speaking of the mic people at
my party told me I sound pretty clear
but when switching between the gold and
the pulse they also noted that the pulse
sounded better and also provided a more
accurate representation of my voice one
person said that my voice sounded a bit
more digitalized but probably wouldn't
have noticed if I wasn't switching
between headsets some other buttons
you'll find are your mute volume up and
down and virtual surround sound buttons
on the left ear cup mute and volume
buttons are self-explanatory but the
virtual surround sound is something you
may not be familiar with this feature
can only be used with the ps3 and ps4 so
don't expect to take advantage of it on
your computer or mobile device that you
plan to hook this up to the surround
sound works pretty well to make you feel
like you're immersed in the world you're
playing in and you get a good idea of
where sounds are coming from while
you're playing so if you're big on
first-person shooters this might save
your life from that guy trying to knife
you from behind maybe also on the ear
cup is the internal mic which is pretty
much invisible unless you pull the left
ear cup all the way down and last but
not least is the headphone jack to plug
in the audio cable so you can use this
as a regular pair of headphones you also
have a micro USB plug that I'm happy to
see considering the older headsets used
a mini USB cable to charge and this now
brings me to everything you can expect
to find when you purchase this inside
the box you'll get of course the headset
a micro USB cable an auxilary cable a
USB dongle and a carrying pouch the USB
cable will be used to charge the headset
but it's quite unfortunate that they
supplied such a short cable this can
make it a bit difficult to charge
considering the size of the headset and
where you might have your PlayStation
place
even if you use the wall adapter this
means that your headset will most likely
be on the floor as it's charging luckily
you can use a much longer USB cable that
you probably have lying around somewhere
I should also mention that you do get
about eight hours of battery life when
using this give or take an hour the
auxiliary cable allows compatibility
with the PS Vita and pretty much any
other device with a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the new USB dongle now
has a smaller footprint than the
previous versions so you can plug this
into your Playstations or computers to
use it wirelessly and lastly we have the
travel pouch that doesn't offer up a ton
of protection due to the materials it's
made of but it does allow you to pack up
the headset and all of its accessories
when you plan to travel with it another
notable thing about this headset is its
ability to change face plates you can
slide down the face place on the side of
the headphones and you're able to swap
them out for one of your choosing
I haven't seen any face plates hit the
market just yet but I'm pretty sure that
game developers as well as third parties
won't waste much time on that now let's
finally talk about the sound experience
it does pretty well delivering all the
game sounds you've come to expect and I
found it to be very clear I wish certain
in-game sounds had a bit more punch to
it like shooting explosions and such but
I don't think it's a deal breaker unless
you want a really immersive experience
rather than just being able to hear your
game audio luckily you can adjust the
sound a bit using the companion app but
overall the sound quality doesn't fall
short of what I'd expect from a $99
gaming headset when using this as a
regular pair of headphones you can
expect the exact same performance it's
not bad and definitely passable if you
choose to use it for that much like with
its gaming performance you get a pretty
flat sound but it does offer some pretty
decent clarity and when using these as
headphones the one and two switch won't
change the sound quality so it's better
to just keep the headset off overall I
think this is a decent headset coming in
at $99 and I definitely think it'll do
the trick if you're looking for a nice
wireless headset and don't want to spend
a ton of money on it
I do wish this was an upgrade for the
pulse elites rather than an upgrade for
the original wireless headset but I
think Sony was trying to go for a more
budget-friendly option but considering
the pulse are only 15 dollars more in
Amazon I would probably just go for
those instead
considering some of the awesome features
it has over the gold some of those
features being based impact slider
controls and the ability to make any
device Wireless for example but I will
say that the gold are probably more
comfortable lighter and more portable
than the elites considering these are
called a gold wireless headset and how
random of a name that is I do see room
for a platinum version that could
possibly take over the pulse I have my
fingers crossed for that anyway
either way this isn't a very expensive
gaming headset coming in at $99 so you
don't have to get beat up to get some
black and blue in your life now I have
to show you guys what these look like on

these are a gaming headset but the fact
that you can use them as regular
headphones maybe you want to take them
outdoors who knows so I'm going to show
you guys what they look like on so here
you have it it's pretty pretty big it's
got a big headband from really big ear
cups like I said this is a gaming
headset so if you plan on taking these
outdoors just be mindful of how big they
are and here it is around the neck you
guys can get an idea of just how big you
won't really be able to move your head
at all with these just hanging here so
definitely keep that in mind and that's
