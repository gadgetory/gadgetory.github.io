and today we're gonna be taking a look
at the essential phone and deciding if
it's dope or no and the first thing
we're gonna talk about is the design now
this thing is packin a 5.7 inch quad HD
display and it's actually on a pretty
small compact body which i think is the
perfect combination it makes it really
easy to reach the entire screen
navigating the phone is super simple I
can do it one-handed I really really
like that especially coming off a phone
like the note 8 now what kind of sets
this phone apart from all the other
phones out there right now are those
incredible bezels or lack thereof now
there are a ton of phones out there
right now that are decreasing the size
of the bezels but this phone itself
doesn't even have any top bezels it
actually has a little cutout for the
front facing camera aside from that
you're pretty much all screen now it
does have a little bezel at the bottom
but that just makes it a lot easier to
hold and even though it has that front
facing camera up there you think it
sticks out like a sore thumb but it does
not you get used to it really quickly
and that all apps bleed into the top of
the screen they actually have something
to have some borders so you might not
even notice it sometimes but I do have
to say I am a bit spoiled by some of the
phones that I've been messing with
recently that have OLED displays like
the LG v 30 the Galaxy Note 8 this has
an LCD display and honestly it just
isn't as vibrant as some of the phones
that I've been messing around with and
it also doesn't get as bright I don't
know it just feels a bit faded if I
wasn't using this one that probably
wouldn't notice anything and think it's
just a fine display but just the fact
that there are other phones on the
market right now that have those other
displays and that's where it seems the
smartphone world is going I kind of wish
I had it here now something that's a bit
special about this phone is the fact
that it has a titanium frame which
should make it quite a bit more durable
if you drop it you there's a big concern
that that big screen right there might
get shattered but that titanium frame
was supposed to help it absorb some
impact and be a lot more durable than
aluminium and honestly I really do like
the feel of the titanium it's a bit
heftier
but I actually like this it feels way
more solid and premium than a lot of the
phones that are used to right now I
actually don't mind a bit of half and
this feels very comfortable to hold in
one hand so definitely get some points
there and taking a look at the back of
the phone you think that is made out of
Gorilla Glass
but it's actually polished ceramic which
actually helps to look really really
nice even doubles as a mirror if you
ever need it but one thing about it is
that it is a fingerprint magnet and you
guys know that drives me absolutely
insane you got to keep a microfiber
cloth on this thing at all times if you
wanted to look in pristine condition so
if you don't want to deal with that I
highly suggest getting a skin on it
obviously you guys know me I love the
Dragons Kandy brand has there are a ton
of skins to choose from you can switch
up the style of the phone I'll have the
links down below in the description for
you guys to check it out but for this
phone or any phone that's a fingerprint
magnet you definitely want something
like this and it actually even helps
with the grip of the phone too but for
all I got in it this is a good-looking
phone it's very solid feels very premium
so shout out to essential for actually
getting it right on their first try
design-wise now this is called the
essential phone and you think with a
name like that it has all of the
essential features that somebody would
want in a smart phone but not so much
you do get things like a fingerprint
scanner USB type-c even stock Android
but they decided to go against having a
headphone jack which blows it blows my
mind guys for me as a headphone
enthusiast that is an essential feature
all headphones are not bluetooth yet
there are tons of good headphones I
still need a headphone jack so that is
one essential feature that's missing
it's also missing water resistance
that's a feature we're seeing on a ton
of phones nowadays so the fact that's
missing as well kind of mind-boggling
and while it does come with 128 gigs of
storage
there's no micro SD card slot so some of
those things that we kind of come to
expect nowadays in 2017 this guy doesn't
have the essential phone is missing some
essential features go figure
it's also missing wireless charging
which based on its design is kind of
surprising as a $700 Android phone in
2017 it's missing quite a few features I
don't know if they're trying to follow
the Apple route but Apple plays by their
own rules and if you're gonna be an
Android phone at that price range you
expect a bit more now this is running a
practically stock version of Android
with the Android 7 dot
that one and that is always a bonus you
get stalked Android that means it's
gonna be super quick very smooth no skin
gotta love that quick updates as well
and with a snapdragon 835 processor as
well as four gigs of ram performance is
not gonna be an issue this thing is
buttery smooth I've had no performance
issues with it whatsoever but where
performance can be a bit hit or miss has
to be with the camera up front we've got
an 8 megapixel front facing camera which
honestly I was able to get some pretty
decent selfies out of it can record in
4k which I don't know if you want to use
that for it but you actually have a
somewhat decent camera up front but in
the back you've got 2 13 megapixel
cameras one is actually a standard lens
the other is a mono lens so it's in
black and white and together it's
supposed to improve the image quality I
don't know how much impact it actually
has because the shots that I got were
pretty hit or miss I tend to see a lot
of noise with some of my shots which I
wasn't too crazy about you definitely
don't want to zoom in on some of these
shots which just kind of sucks
especially at this price tag and it's
decent if you're looking to take black
and white shots I rarely ever do so
outside of testing it I probably
wouldn't ever go for it but it's there I
know there have been complaints about
the UI and it being very slow to go into
different modes and access different
settings but unless you really need to
capture a moment super quickly in a
specific fashion it probably won't have
much of an impact on you but still this
is a pretty mediocre camera at a $700
price range or in flagship territory so
you definitely want your camera to stand
out and offer something that the other
competition does not and I don't think
that this does that so definitely loses
some points there and this is actually a
modular phone so to the right of the
rear cameras and the microphone you have
an area where you can add on modular
accessories they're held together by
magnets right now there's like a 360
camera out there right now I heard is
not so good I don't have my hands on it
so I can't say for sure but it is kind
of cool that you're able to add on
things to your phone I don't know how
well supported its gonna be and how many
things are gonna come out with but
that's a nice little feature but
probably not one that's gonna make you
go and buy the
phone now something I like about this
phone is that it includes some pretty
high quality accessories you had a high
quality branded USB type-c cable you
even get a headphone jack adapter which
I would have preferred to see in the
actual phone but they do give you that
and you also get the wall adapter which
actually has no branding on it
whatsoever just like the phone so that's
actually kind of nice too
now I think we painted a pretty good
picture of what the essential phone is
and what is capable of so the question
is if it's dope or no and honestly I
gotta say nope it's just missing way too
many things especially at that price
range 700 bucks you can go out and grab
a Galaxy s8 now you get access to us SD
card awesome camera a really good design
waterproof there's just way too much
competition out there at this price
range I've had this been a bit cheaper
it would have been maybe a dope because
it is an awesome phone great design
feels very premium but it's just missing
too much as of right now hopefully in
the next iteration we'll be able to see
things that we come to expect on a
flagship on the essential phone too so
hopefully that happens but as of right
now I gotta stick with the nope but this
is a good first tried by essential phone
I really like what they did with the
looks of the phone but they gotta just
hit include those essential features but
that about wraps it up guys hopefully
you enjoyed this video if you did be the
cool guy girl that gives us video thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one
till then is your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
