consumer and today we have got a very
very special video this right here is
the one plus six inside this special
reviewers box first off we've got our
reviewers guide they provide all of the
awesome cases one plus actually made
some really great cases so I am always
glad to get these all looks like this
one's a new texture I've never seen
before what are they calling it this is
the nylon bumper case okay nylon that's
new now I did get to hear quite a bit
about this phone before I actually got
the box and if everything pans out as
oneplus says this phone has a lot of
potential all right so let's meet the
new one plus six and here we have it
right here we have oh so right here
we've got the mirror black version which
looks clean I also have the midnight
black which I'll show you guys in a
second but this is looking awesome right
now but let's see what else we've got
inside of this box and of course you got
your - charger and I really like -
charger not only is this thing insanely
fast but it also keeps the device pool
when it's doing it so if you're one of
those people who happen to use your
phone while charging you don't have to
worry about it getting super hot and
being freaked out and this phone
actually has a 3300 milliamp hour
battery which on paper sounds a bit
disappointing
I'd like to hear 4000 the holidays but
my one plus 5t real day in the life has
shown that the number isn't everything I
got something with the best battery life
out of the five t so I'm expecting the
same here so inside of the box oh oh so
it looks like everybody is going to be
getting this case inside the box and you
do get some paperwork and a sim ejector
tool but you also have this little case
here to protect your phone so that's
nice everybody gets that you don't have
to run out and buy one so we've got
mirror-black over here but I decided to
go ahead and check out that midnight
black and let's see what that looks like
okay so this is the more standard one
plus color this feels like a nice matte
black but this mirror black looks dull
this is
an awesome color I have never seen this
before from oneplus so this is an
awesome edition and they also have silk
white which I don't have here but that
one looks pretty good as well and I
gotta say guys I just really like the
way this thing looks in the front and
you have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 as well
as in the back which i think is a first
for oneplus I don't think they've done
the whole glass back thing before so
this is a pretty nice addition but we're
gonna have to see how slippery it is in
actual use all right so now some power
this guy on so we've got our power
button right here on the right side
volume rockers on the left we'll see if
this thing has any juice there we go
now I don't know what kind of rumors you
guys might have heard but this guy
actually has BAM the knotch now it's not
just sitting here on a 6.2 inch display
and actually this is a really big screen
and it feels nice in the hand the notch
isn't that big so unlike the iPhone
which has a much wider notch this one is
very small in comparison which I like
now this isn't emulate display with a
resolution of 28 80 by 1080 so you're
gonna get a nice crisp image here
oneplus doesn't typically go over the
top of screen resolutions which is why
you get a great battery life from these
and just so you guys could be a little
familiar with the phone on the left side
you've got your volume controls right is
that power button and you also have that
mute switch on top of the power button
and when we take a look below we've got
our bottom facing speaker a USB C port
as well as a headphone jack oneplus
thank you for not killing it off yet and
when taking a quick look at the back
we've got our fingerprint scanner which
is interesting because now it's a bit
wider than normal and holy smokes those
fingerprints are there's a ton of
fingerprints but uh yeah that's just one
of the things you'll have to deal with
and on the back we have our dual camera
lenses which are actually now vertical
and the main one is 16 megapixels with
an aperture of f11 and it also has
optical image stabilization and the one
below it is 20 megapixels without
optical image stabilization now based on
what I've been told these cameras are
gonna be better performers in low-light
the main camera actually has a bigger
sensor 19 percent bigger to be exact so
that is going to definitely help bring
more light
to your shots and hopefully get some
better results speaking of better
results there's a feature called smart
capture which is supposed to analyze
your environment when you're taking a
photo and give you the best settings to
match that so you can come out with the
optimal picture and it's not here just
yet but coming in a future update is
going to be a portrait mode feature so
that you can take portrait mode shots
with the front-facing camera as well as
the rear camera and that's great because
that's pretty much what every flagship
is doing nowadays that is like a
must-have feature and another thing
we're gonna be seeing with this camera
is slow motion now you're gonna be able
to get HD all the way up to 480 frames
per second not quite 960 but that should
definitely do if you're looking for some
really slow shots now and all you spec
heads out there are wondering what kind
of specs does this thing even have well
it's rocking the snapdragon 845
processor which is the latest one so
you're gonna get the fastest speeds that
you can get and you're also gonna be
getting sixty eight gigs of ram
depending on your location as well as
128 gigabytes of storage
now unfortunately we're not seeing any
expandable storage here but there is
some slight water resistance this
reviewer guide actually says it's
supposed to be able to handle rain and
accidental drops in a puddle
there's no actual rating here so if
you're worried about accident this will
have you covered but you're not gonna
jump in the pool with this guy and sadly
even though we've got a glass back don't
expect any wireless charging but
thankfully you do have that - charging
which I think makes up for it now there
are a lot of cool features here that
we're gonna have to focus on in a future
video like the gaming mode which allows
you to focus completely on your game by
allowing the film's resources to focus
on your game so background tasks won't
interfere with your gameplay and you
won't get notifications there's also
that face online which we saw in the 1 +
5 T which is stupid fast so I'm
expecting that to be the same here and
there's gonna be quite a few gestures
out of here so navigating the 1 + 6 it's
gonna be a bit different than older
models so if you want to get rid of the
navigation bar you can actually use
gestures to navigate through the phone
so right now you see no navigation bar
on my screen and if I want to go home
all you got to do is swipe up from the
bottom and if you want to see your most
recent apps you go ahead and you swipe
up and hold it and boom you have your
window of apps and if you want to go
back all you have to do is swipe up
through the left or right side boom just
like that so if you really want to take
advantage of all the screen real estate
that you get with the oneplus 6 you'll
be able to do that even more without the
navigation bar I'm
to be honest with you guys seeing the
knots here doesn't bother me as much so
I guess maybe I'm getting kind of used
to it like I said I hate the idea of it
but it's not killing me right now but
we'll see how that all pans out in the
full review during the real day in the
life hopefully you guys enjoyed this
quick look at the one plus six like I
said this phone seems like it has a ton
of potential so I can't wait to go ahead
and put it through its paces now if you
plan on getting the oneplus 6 let me
know as a comment down below if not let
me know reasons why but I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer piece and hit that like
button man just do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
