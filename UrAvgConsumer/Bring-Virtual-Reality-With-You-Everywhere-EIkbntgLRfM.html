we're taking a look at an interesting
piece attack Lenovo's mirage solo with
daydream and just taking a quick look at
it you can tell that it's a VR headset
but this isn't just any VR headset this
is one of the first stand-alone headsets
and what that means is this won't need a
fancy computer or smart phone to make it
work everything that you need to get it
going is built inside I gotta say guys
it is really cool to be able to be in VR
while like outside
I have not connected to a computer or a
smartphone being put inside of here just
straight up headset and I'm able to be
in virtual reality
it also has Google's role since
technology built right inside so that
means you're gonna be able to move
around explore dodge Crouch all the kind
of movements you'd want to do in a game
it'll be able to pick up and the reason
why that special is because you don't
need any extra cameras or sensors put
around your room to detect those
movements which is pretty common with
most VR headsets and on the software
side of things this thing is using
daydream which is Google's virtual
reality ecosystem and if you're familiar
with Android you'll be right at home
here and you can access a ton of VR
content in the Play Store and even watch
YouTube VR for really immersive content
and of course that means you're gonna be
able to watch 360 degree as well as 180
degree videos and you can even watch
regular 2d content as well and to be
honest I'm pretty excited by this
because I'm heading home soon for the
holidays and I get to see my family
having a good time playing the game
simulators and of course some demos
seeing their reactions everything's
gonna be pretty fun and I've already
tried it with a couple of friends so far
and it is absolutely a good time and
with the holidays coming up and families
getting together I could imagine people
having a ton of fun with this and the
fact that you can play games on this
headset or watch YouTube or Netflix
without being tethered to a computer or
smartphone I think that's pretty cool
especially with the fact that you can
take this thing pretty much anywhere you
want and what are the most about not
being connected to anything is this if
you want someone to experience VR with
you all you need to do is bring this
headset so there's no longer waiting for
someone to come over to your house to
come be on your computer and experience
VR you can actually just take it to them
with
it was really cool or like needing a
really powerful computer to write yeah
there's that too know needing super
crazy specs everything you need is built
right into this one headset oh cool but
not only that there's also the Lenovo
Mirage camera with daydream and this
little guy is a 180 degree camera that
allows you to record and share your own
content using Google's VR 180 format so
if you're creator and you want to make
immersive content for someone else to
experience this is definitely the thing
to do it and this thing is a 4k camera
so you get that nice detail and
sharpness which is important for
immersive content this in would have
been really cool for that empty house
story I did not so long ago but I'm sure
I can come up with something else to do
with it I feel like once more creative
people get their hands on cameras like
this we're gonna be seeing some amazing
content in the future so overall I think
it's very cool that VR is developing
into something standalone so people no
longer need to sell a ton of money on a
high spec PC just so they can have
access to VR but of course guys if you
want to learn more about the Mirage Sola
and the Mirage camera I'll have links
down below in the description as well as
other youtubers who have created some
content on the Mirage Solo but I want to
know what you guys think do you like the
idea of a standalone headset where you
don't need a special computer to use it
let me know with a comment down below in
the comment section and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
