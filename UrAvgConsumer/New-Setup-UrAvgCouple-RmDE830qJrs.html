stay what sauce although I thought this
get a burger
yeah we were driving yourself insane and
we just started them off writings for
Western usually the easy to guys say to
a restaurant boom remember her
restaurant alright guys so we did finish
eating but I made sure to leave some so
that I can have some for tomorrow for
left with leftovers and it is to the
point where
oh listen it's pretty damn good
so we just finished up with dinner okay
she surprised me with the Broadway show
for tomorrow a movie the background
story so Shannon of the Opera and I've
wanted to go to this show since I was
like 11 years old
no sorry 12 years old when I saw a
preview of it up in middle school wants
to see a Broadway show at 12 years old
boy sees for the longest time and like
out of nowhere he got it for me and I
was so so so so happy so that's my
Valentine's Day surprise for tomorrow
and I'm so excited so you'll see us gets
dressed up to go on Broadway we have
August receipts guys for a fancy hey
guys so you're about to admission ed
opening up his engagement gift that I
got him I figured he gives me he gave me
this really beautiful ring so I just
want to get them something also I don't
know to kind of like I know which is
nice so I got home tech he's not a big
jewelry person so yeah I figure I might
as well get something he likes more
engagement
yes I think I give you a nice engagement
gift to and took me and took me a while
to figure out what I really wanted to
get you so yes opening here because it's
the cars don't judge he's opening it he
likes it guys now it's Valentine's Day
hope you guys are having a good
Valentine's Day we know this like
holiday isn't for everyone but for those
of you who just celebrated hopefully
you're having a really nice Valentine's
Day we are on our way out the door and
oh and more important news check out my
monitor guys thing is sexy oh I love
this thing I got it for him as an
engagement gift you guys know that
because you just saw the clip that I'm
not
so yes yeah so she got it from you as a
gift and this thing is freaking awesome
right now this is my ps4 that's on it
I'm playing of course Final Fantasy if
you guys know me you know I'm addicted
to this game right now but yeah this is
it let me see if I can actually switch
this for you I just want to show them
really quickly what it looks like as far
as like the whole thing come on there we
go oh this thing is a beauty part of me
really wants a another one on the other
side but let this look rock for a bit
alright told me gotta go bye well sorry
bye cuz vision I gotta go the next scene
it's gonna have us on the train snowing
outside
it's very well saying I only smell I
didn't I didn't know we are not prepared
I got box on i did√∂ come here do you
guys know me I keep my heels in my bag
woman you guys have to think about
exactly comfortable in the city
we are an hour early but you know I love
somehow rather be early we're all mostly
I'm you're freaking out we were even
like 10 minutes early it's more crazy
guys to be honest she's just going crazy
she's excited I guess
which is going crazy something I could
prospect to be links will be there we're
an hour earlier I wish there was
something we could do before I guess
risky doing anything before yeah for our
international viewers who always say
they want to see more of the kind of
places that we go in America this is
Times Square for you guys lots of lights
even simple things that way it's like a
seizure story everything has lights
we got a bank over there you wouldn't
have guessed it but that that is a bank
and this is pretty much the heart of it
all guys
can you imagine how much electricity is
being used here alive
crowds guys so I'm like the only really
awkward right now my head down walking
back
so we're walking down Broadway and we
noticed that the feeders like all the
shows have their own little theaters
this is the Matilda one
Mamma Mia Phantom of the Opera is over
there
yeah she's excited and that's where
we're going so I didn't know that I
thought it was all in one big theater
but apparently each show has their own
theater the more you know
all right guys yeah we're here and it
looks just like dinner box seats up
there whatnot looks pretty cool so we're
really close we have Orchestra seat I
think we're really close to the show you
gotta find
so now it's an intermission are you
smiling she's really she's really really
little this thing is
and you guys already know she wishes she
could sing
she definitely liked it it was pretty
good
I was very impressed by the backgrounds
and the props how quickly they move
scenes and whatnot so of course but it
was very good guys so I highly recommend
it me too
so now what are we gonna get into I
expected it to be a bit longer so that's
a good thing so now we're in the city
babe what do we do we're going home to
finish our leftovers we got a couple we
are well look first for us Dean towards
Russell something I want to see a band
in new 3d yeah alright guys so we're in
Joyce or us
and it's huge I just got hit with some
nostalgia here with this Power Rangers
the sword from this was the white
Rangers this is crazy this is I don't
I'm really shocked to see this is
actually cool this is this is my
childhood right here white ranger and
things nuts look at that what bugs so
some more nostalgia here yo-yos with the
brains you don't look exactly like oh
yeah no this doesn't look like them
remember these are the brains
yeah yeah this thing makes you feel like
a yo-yo champion really boy did all the
work for you pretty much
all you got to do is make sure you drop
it right
like a giant kid now if I could just
find the game section I'd be pretty
happy I know I was dying right now that
she's in the game section of the store
so let's just go home right and of
course now it's snowing so I want her to
go to the Apple store to get a new
Mophie iPhone but
I gotta admit though it is pretty all
this snow alright guys so Valentine's
Day is over but uh no back to work I go
yeah everyone to work today four-day
weekends yeah she enjoyed that I'm
carrying his backpack that she asked for
he's like the carries on things I'm
carrying for him yeah right she asked me
for it this is my gadget backpack and
Harry has not be Morse the most
coordinated person so her having that
freaks me out
she freaks me out whenever she has any
of my things because I just feel like
it's going to get destroyed so luckily
it's not my newest gadget backpack but
it's still my guys back so we're back
home and I showed you guys the monitor
already but I just want you guys to take
a look like overall look at the whole
new setup but I've got going on over
here don't mind this this is the food
that we just bought I'm gonna be eating
that in just a bit but I didn't want to
show you guys the new look of the room
and whatnot and this is pretty much it
the music in the background some old
anime intro music that I still like to
listen to but yeah this is it
it looks freaking great this is a great
monitor for editing this is a curved
display and I've wanted a 21 by 9 aspect
ratio display for quite some time now
and this is just perfect like you guys
saw how to surprise me with it love this
thing it's just I feel like it looks a
lot cooler lot nicer set up but yeah I
take a look at the last review that I've
been working on I'm working on this wa7
Firefly's amp flash dock DAC unit this
thing is pretty freakin cool but I'm
working on that that's probably going to
be
next video that you see and I've also
got a couple of other things that I'm
working on right now you guys can get a
quick sneak peek I'm not gonna go into
any real detail but this is it

be pretty exciting I'm gonna have a
video on that as well so these are but
