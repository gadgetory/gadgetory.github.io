consumer and today I've got another
video for you guys and this time is
going to be my top 5 favorite paid
Android live wallpapers for your Android
tablet or Android phone so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
then alright guys here we have the
plasma dist live wallpaper this is my
number five choice and this retails for
$0.99 and it's actually a pretty cool
live wallpaper you might just think that
this is just some bolt it's not too fun
but what's really cool is that you can
actually touch it and you can have the
bolts show up at different points so
it's really cool and you can get like
all ten fingers on there and have that
work but it's actually really really
cool and fun to play with and you can do
the same on the phone of course but
what's really cool there's some other
options that you have here you can do
some fun stuff with it for instance you
can turn on this thing called dance mode
and you can play some music
don't mind the live don't mind the album
art there but when you put on dance mode
check out what happens on the phone
kappa snappa feet no filling necessary
and close that was speaking up so that's
pretty cool I think and even picks up
your voice and the slow dancing with
your voice so I really like that little
feature and what's also cool is that you
can actually change the bulk color so
you can make it a blue bowl have it do
all kinds of blue stuff it's actually
pretty cool
and you can change the background color
to be one of your choice let's say you
want it to be red this is terrible on
the eyes but you can do that you can
change it up to look any kind of way
that you wanted to this one you can't
really even tell but like I said it's
really cool live wallpaper I really
enjoy it I think it's fun you can see
your fingers go moving all around really
cool stuff next on the list is this
galaxy pack live wallpaper now
has a ton of different live wallpapers
built into this one live wallpaper app
and it's really cool this retails for
195 so it's $2.00 but you get it you get
a ton of different live wallpapers for
the amount that you pay so I think it's
definitely worth it what's cool about
these is that you can interact with it
and as you guys can see and there are
subtle movements to the live wallpaper
itself but with them you can move around
the galaxy and it's really nice you see
as you can see a shift here so there you
go looks pretty cool and it does the
same for the phone although if you have
a ton of widgets you probably won't see
it but you can move it around a ton with
the phone as well and there are a bunch
of different options check them out and
as you guys can see here there are a
bunch of other options as well and you
can interact with these just as well as
you can interact with the other ones so
this is all really cool you can switch
it up to look exactly how you want to
and with these you get a ton of
different options to go into you can do
a bunch of different stuff you can use
the accelerometer as you can see here
you can move it around by simply moving
around the phone or your tablet so
that's pretty cool too you get a ton of
different options so this is really a
cool live wallpaper
I really suggest it even though it's $2
you get a ton of ton of options for what
you pay for and a ton of different
wallpapers so if you like the galaxy
themes this is the one for you next up
is the fresh leaves live wallpaper and
this retails for $0.99 and I've got to
say this is a gorgeous live wallpaper it
looks super crisp super clean it's full
it looks like it's full HD I love this
live wallpaper I think it's just
beautiful and what's really cool this
also has an accelerometer so you can
move around move around your device and
have this move with it and you can move
it up or down you can do all kinds of
stuff with it so this is really cool I
love this live wallpaper I highly
suggest it especially for only 99 cents
this is great great stuff guys and you
can also change up the way that the
weather looks with this live wallpaper
so let's take a look at that and all
right guys I just switched around this
one is like Sakura days or something so
you can see the little Sakura leaves in
the background
and this one's like a starry night so
you can see the night theme it looks
really cool this is great stuff guys and
you can also make the theme go with the
time of day so if it's nighttime it'll
get darker if it's daytime it'll get
lighter
really cool stuff guys I highly
recommend this is a beautiful live
wallpaper it's just great to look at and
it looks HD definitely recommend it next
up on the list is the planet scapes live
wallpaper now this is one of my
favorites as well because this one just
looks really cool I think it's got a
nice little look going for it and as you
move it around you can see the little
things move around with it so that's
really cool I'm a big fan of this a
friend told me about this and I really
do like it
and what's cool is you can also change
up the theme so you can have a different
kind of wallpaper in there altogether
this comes with about three of them so
let me see if I can show you guys here
this is the first one and there's this
one and let's see this one alright so
now here are the other themes this is my
personal favorite right here this one is
absolutely beautiful to look at this one
I don't use so much but it's pretty cool
too if you like that little snowy theme
that looks cool but this one is just
great this one looks beautiful in my
opinion I really like this look this is
a great live wallpaper and this one
retails for 149 but it's definitely
worth it it looks age deal it'll look
good on any screen so that's a great
live wallpaper definitely check it out
and last but not least is my number one
favorite live wallpaper this one is
called jump gate and this is a really
cool live wallpaper I love it because it
has like the Google colors you can use
that there and when you tap the little
screen twice blue android says hello and
you can actually change the character
here you can change it to like a little
spaceship let me see if I can get that
up for you guys you can change it to
like a little spaceship or you can have
no character if you don't like the
little Android guy and you can change
all kinds of stuff you can trade change
the Android - droid frequency you see
the little asteroids that are flying by
here you can actually change that around
here you can have the spaceship take a
look at that so you've got a cool little
spaceship here or you can have
none whatsoever and have that and what's
also cool about this is that you can
change the color to be a single color
instead of multiple so let's do
monochrome and as you can see you can
have one stat color this is what I
typically go for eyes my background for
my android devices and I'm sure in a lot
of my old videos you can see this
divided them this wallpaper now what's
cool about off all of these wallpapers
is that there are free versions to some
of them I believe there's a free version
to the fresh leaves there's a free
version to Jumpgate there's a free
version to the galaxy pack you can get a
couple of preset galaxies in there and
I'm not sure yeah there's also a free
version for plasma disc so there's a
couple of free versions out there of
course there's not going to be as many
options as I showed you for some of
these but definitely worthy of checking
them out and testing them seeing if it's
worth your money but that's about it
guys those are my top 5 favorite android
live wallpaper apps that are paid and
they're all relatively cheap $1.00
summer - but that's about it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video and
snot found some you liked and I'll catch
you guys in the next video till then
it's your average consumer peace
