want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
everyone that's your average consumer
and of course this is my girlfriend
hello and today we have another sound
leak and sound isolation test aka the
girlfriend test so and today we're going
to be doing this with the beats by dre
the wireless so a lot of people have
been asking me about these so I figured
let's put it through its paces alright
so now we're gonna start off with the
beats headphones ad we're gonna start
with the sound test with the beats
headphones at 50% 75% then 100% to see
how much it leaks when someone's pretty
close to you and then after that we're
going to do the girlfriend test and see
how well it isolates sounds from the
outside alright so you're ready to start
off that 50 yeah all right so since it's
wireless I get to control the phone as
you can just listen so this is at 50%
all right so I hear it very slightly but
that's because I know it's playing and
she's right next to me so definitely
nothing at seven at fifty percent so
it's got a okay at fifty all right so
now let's pump up the volume to about
seventy five and let's see how it goes
then yeah I can hear it a bit more
not that it would be a bother yeah yeah
it wouldn't be a bother
I still do here with those and I can
kind of I can hear what song she's
listening to but it's not it's not
obnoxious or anything like that so not
bad good yeah I say good I say fast and
let's try it out in 100% again I
recommend don't do this because it's not
good for your hearing but here we are
let's see this
yeah yeah I hear pretty clearly yeah
even though it's not a hundred percent
it's not as loud as I've other
headphones we've heard I'm sorry I kept
that up a hundred percent on you know it
doesn't matter at all like I'm fine oh
well there you go um at a hundred
percent I could clearly hear it but it
wasn't like a really loud sound where it
was like a bother I could just I can
just hear it so not bad
I guess depending on the music you
listening to it might offend someone or
something but that seems okay for me and
now we're trying to go for any test my
favorite what's it has there's a door
today um I guess I'll be using these now
yeah and we're going to see how well I'm
gonna explain a girlfriend test no no no
so the girlfriend testing know how like
girlfriends always have something to say
and sometimes they're nagging or
something so today I'm going to be doing
something that's probably gonna be
nagging you're bothering him and he's
gonna see if he can block out my sound
using my headphones that's the point of
a girlfriend test alright so there you
have it now let's try it out I'm going
to bring these back down to about 50%
and we're going to see how it works from
75 and $100 all right so here goes wish
me luck guys
okay you know I feel like we need to
talk like you haven't been yourself
lately and you just don't open up to me
the way you used to you're sensitive and
just I hope you love me anymore
all right so I heard her muffled it was
all muffled I think you percent have
fifty percent so that's really great so
she's right next to me I didn't really I
didn't make out any words that she said
so it does a really good job so far
isolating I think that's pretty good
considering you don't like noise
cancelling or anything like that
so let's pump at the bottom of
seventy-five percent and see how it
works then you ready yeah all right
and you just seem so closed off and like
just been ignoring me lately and I just
I just I feel like like you just don't
love me anymore and it's just it just
made making me feel really isolated all
right so obviously I 100% yeah
silent but just for the sake of
consistency will do it out how to
present anyway okay but Wow surprisingly
75% nothing from this one that must make
you happy
all right all right let's see how it
goes so I was looking at like couples
therapy stuff so I really think that
maybe a therapist might be able to help
us out a little better because just
looking connect better with each other
you know that's like our connection not
chemistry has really been off it's
concerning me a lot all right all right
so so a really good job at isolating
sounds the girlfriend sighs this passed
with flying colors even at 50% it did
very well I just making her sound like a
muffled so girls now you know what beats
not to buy a favored boyfriend guys if
you can get him trying so if as I say
the Soundlink it didn't leak a little
bit but it wasn't terrible even had a
hundred percent it wasn't as bad as I
would have expected so I can I say these
pass on both count both counts high-five
all right beats wireless all right guys

this has been the sound week sound
