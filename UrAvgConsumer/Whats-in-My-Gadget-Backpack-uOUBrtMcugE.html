want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
the average consumer a couple of you
guys requested seeing my gadget bag so
I'm just going to show you what I carry
around in my backpack when I run
traveling or going out somewhere and
this is a sony vaio laptop bag it's just
a little big but it definitely gets the
job done carries all the stuff I like to
carry around all right so let's not
wasting time let's get right into this
bin alright guys so here we have the
sony vaio laptop bag this was pretty
nice I went to the Sony store and got it
for about 40 bucks which wasn't bad at
all it definitely looks nice to me has a
lot of compartments um a lot of nice
padding in the back here so it
definitely takes some pressure off when
I'm carrying a lot of stuff on me and it
just really looks great and as all the
compartments I wanted so I'm definitely
happy about that it's only 40 bucks not
bad and let me show you guys what's
inside the first was my one you might
know this is the beats carrying case
that I have here and these of course
carry my beats Wireless you guys you
guys watch my videos you know that the
beats Wireless are my favorite pairs of
beats so I definitely always carry that
around and of course I carry around the
UM the remote the of course I carry
around the inline remote um table just
in case the batteries die out on me and
I want to or I don't want to use a
bluetooth feature for whatever reason I
always have this option definitely
really nice hat and let's see here I
guess I'll show you guys from the from
the front working our way to back in the
front compartment I have a
point-and-shoot
it's a sony DSC tx9 it's a pretty old
camera by now but it does record in
1080p and all that and it's like 12
megapixels and very flat really nice
easy to you
so definitely my carry around camera
when I don't want to travel with my DSLR
so definitely good to have that and
that's about it for this load front
pouch and the insides have a really nice
little coating really like kind of fuzzy
so makes me feel like my fingers are
secure um let's see maybe back and this
front flap right here there's a zipper
and behind this just goes to show you
how many compartments this has behind
that first flap I got a couple of things
here let's see I got some Nintendo 3ds
games I got a little case full of them
some Pokemon included don't judge me and
I have a 3d s cleaning cloth some SD
cards some more cases for my 3ds games
and a little Pokemon thing that came
with one of the Pokemon games and I
sleep well so god that's the front flap
here I carry my ipod I do a lot of my
listening from my HTC One S now so my
ipod usually gets a seat somewhere
inside of here so this goes off to the
side as well and I have a small little
travel case eyes tripod for my sony TX
TX 9 just in case I want to take a still
or something and I don't want to hold it
for whatever reason I got a little
travel-size um
tripod I have my little square add-on
for my cell phone or iPod whenever for
whatever reason I want someone to make a
credit card transaction to myself or
have someone make one to me carry this
thing around to add a 32 gigabyte flash
drive that's really small this is a sand
disc it's tiny 32 gigabytes and it was
on sale at Best Buy fear I don't even
remember how much it was really cheap so
definitely had to grab that and listen
do I have anything else here and of
course this is a book bag so I gotta
have a pen now what's special about this
pen to me is that when you screw off the
it is actually a 1 gigabyte flash drive
so that's definitely really cool so I
can always count on having storage space
around me even in my pen makes me feel
like James Bond a bit so that's pretty
much it for the front sides I also have
this load to it um this headphone jack
adapter that allows you to put two
headphones into one on one on a device
so two people can listen to something at
once really nice and handy to have
around for whatever reason that pretty
much sums up crime um let me jump to the
sides now let's see on this side of
course I have my PS Vita portable
charger this thing is great definitely
fits this backpack since I go places
with it so I can charge my phone PS Vita
whatever uses them USB to charge I can
just throw this that one on it and let
it stay inside here in charge and of
course I'm going to have a ton of cables
to charge all my devices this is for my
three years here's for my PS Vita and um
this is for my kids Vita this is for
micro USB charger
I'm USB so that I can charge my cell
phone and such and this also charges the
PS Vita portable charger so this is all
you need to get this thing going pretty
nice and let's see that's about it for
this power your side on the other one
let's see I have a charger for my own
smell
I'm sorry for the D on the tx9 and of
course gotta have an iPod charger let's
see this is my beats wireless charger I
love the red cord on this ring so I
definitely take this around really nice
looking USB charger
and here's a little USB plug so I can
use these to plug in and charge my phone
this is HTC came with my 1s this place
is gonna look like a mess by the time
I'm done and let's see now we can go to
the second pouch up here show you guys
what's up here
first things first we've got the PS Vita
travel pouch and of course we've got the
PS Vita in here I also have my beats
tourist inside this pouch as well and a
microfiber cloth just in case I want to
clean up the Vita if I'm on the go and
let's see what else we got of course got
a Nintendo 3ds we've got a little travel
pouch for this too and here we have the
3d s Wayne Kid Icarus Uprising
you guys haven't played that game
definitely get your hands on it and then
let's see I have another game here tales
of the abyss sitting inside the pouch
that's cool and I think that's it for
this one Oh actually those are so many
things guys I got some stylus for the
VDS
we've got a cool little transform one
this is supposed to be bumblebee really
nice and I've got a bunch of other like
three other tiles here as well as the
one that comes inside and that's it for
this patch
on to the last rally well actually no
tonight in the last one goes but here we
have some solution from this big
microfiber cloth that I have here I got
this huge monster microfiber cloth to
wipe down any of my screens have a bunch
of screens that I'm working with here
wipe these down
this definitely excessive that was the
girlfriend
don't mind her I can be a bit obsessive
when it comes to this I really can thus
me carrying something like this this is
like my second microfiber cloth I got
this big one here so this solution
definitely makes all things for my brand
new love it I got it from my best buy
for like 20 bucks might seem like a lot
you can get online eBay for like 5 or
something but it was a spare moment kind
of thing
I got an ultra dusters those air dusters
that you just kind of spray and then it
shoots all the dust off like your
keyboard and stuff it's crazy what I'm
carrying around I know definitely like
to keep my stuff clean of course here's
a under for my macbook I'll be getting
to and let's uber us oh this also has a
couple more pouches it has like these
pouches here they had some up front that
carry that held my own my PS Vita and my
3d s these are up here I'm not sure how
well you guys are seeing this but my PS
Vita and stuff go up here in these two
pouches and there's another pair of
pouches I handed back see if I have
anything inside of here some kind of
outlet plug thing it looks like it works
for the ps2
i'ma like higher that way just in case
I love categories because you never know
when it could come in handy I have a
small set that broke of these tiny
screwdrivers so if something gets loose
like one of the screws gets loose
I can definitely fix it
so like having that around let's see I
think I'm almost done guys here we of
course have the Nexus 7
I like this that is more portable I can
grab this and go anywhere the iPad I
tend to leave at home so this is what I
use when I'm like on-the-go definitely
like this new nice new addition to the
family
and that's about it for this pouch and
the last and final pouch has the MacBook
Air so this used to carry around my
macbook pro the old last year's model
that was 15 inches so it could get used
to get a little heavy but now that I got
this definitely makes things a lot
lighter a lot easier to travel around
with and like I said it has that nice
little fuzzy inside that makes it really
nice too I can use I can put my macbook
in here without wearing a body getting
bends it up or scratched and I really
like that so I've definitely confident
in just bad and pretty much that's about
it guys
it looks like a lot of stuff but I don't
know it doesn't feel like that much to
me um that's it for this bag this is a
great bag I don't even use all the
compartments to be honest but you know
