and it's time for another awesome tech
under fifty bucks just in time for the
holidays
starting off our list is the naughty
smart mood light now don't let the name
fool you this is more than just the land
while you can simply use it as a
decorative piece and change the color to
fit your needs
the Noddy also has a multitude of uses
it functions as an alarm by slowly
brightening up your room at whatever
time you set and can pulse various
colors to the beat of your music and
alert you when you've received
notifications and to be honest this is
the main way I use this device it's
perfect if you're working and your phone
isn't near you since it lights up a
color you designate for various apps - a
blue one I get a facebook notification
yellow for snap and green for Instagram
it'll also flash if you're getting calls
or text I really like this as a
decorative and functional piece to my
setup next up is this awesome awesome
razor Firefly mousepad it's a nice sized
gaming mouse pad that fits well into any
setup you can get a cloth or hard
version but personally I really like the
cloth one the only thing is that the
cloth one can get dirty pretty quickly
so if you need something low maintenance
then you want to go with the hard
version but the best thing about this
mousepad is the RGB light lining the
perimeter it has a soft and subtle glow
so it adds a little flair to the setup
but it isn't overwhelming at all this is
one of my favorite purchases for my set
up and it complements any theme very
well
and speaking of RGB lights which happens
to be a staple for just about every tech
youtuber set up here are some of my
favorites if you look on Amazon you'll
see a bunch by a ton of different
companies but they all pretty much
function the same a lot of these retail
for way under 50 bucks which makes them
really easy to implement compared to
some of the more expensive more popular
versions these can easily spruce up any
setup and they're pretty easy to install
since they make a version for just about
any lamp you may already own they even
have versions with LED strips if you
want to add some unique lighting to
places that you might not usually
but be sure to keep the included remote
handy because that's what you're going
to use to change the light settings
there are a bunch of different settings
so you can be as creative as you want
but let's be clear they're not the same
quality as something like the Philips
hue but if you want to save money and
still get an awesome look these work
really well and to be honest even I was
able to save a few bucks by using them
in my game room and that leads us pretty
nicely into a cool little device I
recently added to my office the valve
steam link this little guy lets you
stream games from your PC to your
television but those of us who want a
game on a bigger screen or maybe away
from the desk you can do this wired or
wirelessly but I prefer wired since you
get better video quality when using this
a game you can use a steam gaming
controller or your wireless keyboard and
mouse in fact most Bluetooth hardware is
compatible with it which is a huge bonus
so if you don't want to use your
keyboard and mouse you can even use an
Xbox one or ps4 controller all this is
perfect for something you've wet those
crazy home theaters or maybe you just
want to step away from your desk and you
want to still play your crazy gaming PC
right from your couch and last up we've
got this Aki thirty thousand milliamp
portable charger now this guy packs a
lot of juice and even though it's bigger
than a typical portable charger is not
super bulky and I pretty much carry it
around wherever I go it features quick
charge 2.0 so if you're rocking
something like the Google pixel or maybe
the LGV 20 you can charge that up super
quickly it can charge multiple devices
at once so no need to worry if you and a
friend both need it and it can charge
USB type-c devices as well which is
awesome for some of you who are using
the newer Android devices you get a lot
of juice for under 50 bucks and honestly
this is about all you need in a portable
charger and it's also got a neat little
flashlight but hopefully you guys
enjoyed it links will be down below for
all the things listed in this video and
I'll catch you in the next one till then
is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
