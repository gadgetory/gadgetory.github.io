Shield what's going on everyone it's
your average consumer and today I've got
an unboxing for you guys of the
Sennheiser momentum over ear headphones
now Sennheiser is usually associated
with like professional-grade headphones
but they've come out with some really
nice consumer grade headphones here and
that's what we're gonna check out today
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it and alright guys here we
have the sennheiser momentum these are
the over year version i have this in
black so it's got black and you can see
some red stitching here on the box but
as we take a look around because he has
a pretty nice box has a little flap a
little tag here a little thing you could
cut open so it looks pretty cool shows
you and i gives you an idea of what the
headphones will look like on your head
shows you the two cables that it comes
with tells you a little bit about the
headphones in different languages here
and down here we have the specs and i'll
show you guys a pic up close picture of
that because i know some of you like to
take a look at the specs so you have
that there and of course this also shows
you what Pat what's inside the packaging
there's a little close-up of the actual
um inline remote on the headphone cable
so alright enough of the box let's open
it up and see what we get inside so
we've got some tape here so we'll peel
this off and we've got some more down
here you know what to make this easier
get the unboxing knife so we'll take
this slice it open there we go so put
this away and we'll open it up and here
we have it and this is pretty cool you
guys probably been in see it but when
you open the box let's see if you're
gonna pull it open here you open the box
and it has this little ribbon at the
bottom that kind of stops it from going
any further this is really amazing
packaging really but let's see we can
pull this open here I don't even know I
don't even think this comes out so you
just pop that down
and you got all your information here
this is really cool this is this is some
really nice packaging hats off to
Sennheiser for there's some real nice
packaging together so you've got all
that warranty stuff over there
we'll close this back up and we'll pull
out the headphone case this is it pretty
solid and you don't get much else inside
this box it's got a nice foam material
so it's kept the headphone safe really
really really nice packaging definitely
wowed me there so this is it this is a
nice hard shell case um and you've got
these little things here to zip it open
which is pretty cool let's open this up
and here we have them so what's this
this is a little add-on piece I guess
these are the headphones they're a lot
smaller than I imagined but they're very
nice so we'll put this on the side for a
second see what else we get you got a
quarter inch adapter here as well as a
straight cable this is a cable it has no
inline remote or anything on it just a
straight regular cable seems pretty thin
but um it looks pretty good nice red
color I love black on red um let's see
this thing can attach somewhere I don't
know what the point is but you can
attach it somewhere here oh I guess if
you want to cover up this part so that
your cable doesn't fall out or anything
like that there you go so that's what
this is for but enough of this case it's
a really nice case like the black and
red stitching let's take a close look at
the headphones themselves so they've got
a bit of plastic on it we can pull this
off and boom there you have it and like
I said guys these are a lot smaller than
I expected so if you guys can see like
my hand I don't have huge hands but you
can see where my hand how about my hand
compares to it I can kind of Palm it so
this is really interesting so I'm gonna
give you guys a quick close up of the
headphones themselves and all right guys
so first thing you'll see on the ear cup
you'll see the Sennheiser logo
and you can see that this can be
adjusted the size can be adjusted so you
can make it you know hit fit your head
shape no problem it's really cool it's a
nice sturdy kind of feel to it so the
headband is really flat really really
flat as you guys can see but it looks
pretty good
yeah Sennheiser over here as well
black and red stitching the ear cups
look pretty good now these are over ear
models but they look kind of small so
I'm not sure how the ears will fit
inside of here but we'll see um and it's
got some pretty soft cushioning this is
made out of genuine leather so it feels
pretty good feel very soft on the
headband is made out of leather as well
so you got some premium stuff going here
and of course this is a premium product
so it costs a premium price it retails
for about 350 but you can find it on
Amazon I've seen for between 260 and 275
so you can get it much cheaper but this
is really nice and um yeah and we'll
take a close look at the inline remote
here when you pull this apart you can
see it has special feature on the inline
remote one it has a special feature on
this cable itself actually so here will
peel off this on the inline remote so
here it is this will work with Apple
devices no problem as it says on the box
I'm not sure how to work with Android
devices most likely it'll just work with
the play and pause button but um yeah
this is the inline remote taking a quick
look at the actual input which is really
cool in my opinion
it can actually Bend so you can make it
a 90 degree cable or you can make it a
straight cable so you've got some
versatility here to work with mobile
devices your laptop whatever equipment
you're using this thing has some
versatility to it and I'm really really
liking this look and before we wrap up
this video I just want to give you guys
a quick message from our sponsor hotspot
Shield is the free internet security and
privacy solution for a lot of his
average consumers who wanted to surf the
web and not really worry
about dangerous things like hackers or
other online threats now ha special does
just through what is called a virtual
private network also known as a VPN and
ha special offers quite a few different
features but one of my favorite things
that they offer is the ability to go on
YouTube and Facebook and other web sites
that are usually blocked on certain
Wi-Fi networks so if you're at work and
you want to go on youtube and watch my
channel use hotspot shield then you'll
definitely be able to get on if they
have YouTube blocked so hotspot Shield
offers a lot of nice things as far as
security access to websites that you
normally wouldn't be able to access on
certain Wi-Fi networks so if you're
interested in checking out hotspots
you'll look in the link down in the
description below and definitely sign up
download it it's free to download and
you'll get running in a few minutes and
just want to say thanks again to our
sponsors over a hotspot shield so that's
about it for this unboxing guys this is
a really nice pair of looking headphones
I'm really really liking the design um
I'm really a fan of Sennheiser going
down the route of a consumer-grade
product because my gripe with
professional headphones is that
sometimes they don't look good and for
the average consumer looks definitely
plays a part if you're not trying to be
an audiophile you just want good
sounding headphones and you want to walk
outside with them looks definitely play
a part and this is definitely catering
to that demographic that wants the good
looking headphones as well as go
sounding headphones so really happy to
see this here I'm gonna have a full
review for you guys girlfriend tests all
that good stuff that usually comes with
these videos and I'll catch you guys in
the next one
if you enjoyed this video please feel
free to rate comment and subscribe and
I'll catch you guys in the next one well
then is your average consumer
