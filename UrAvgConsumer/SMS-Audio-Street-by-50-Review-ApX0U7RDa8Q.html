want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
the guys at your average consumer and
today I'm gonna be reviewing the street
by 50 cent alright it's not wasting time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the street by a 50 and the
first thing I want to say about these
headphones is that the build quality on
them are is excellent it's a very solid
pair of headphones it feels like a
premium set it's very durable as you can
see here I can twist it up any way and I
don't even have to worry about these
snapping in half or anything like that
now I wouldn't even that would in dare
you to try that with the beats by dre or
even the sold by Ludacris so I think
they did a really good job in making
these durable and I built strong and I
think that's like 50 Cent's kind of
thing like he wants it to be built
strong like he is or something like that
but they do a good job in making these a
really durable pair the quality of the
materials feels great you definitely
feel like you have a premium set of
headphones when you wear these and it's
got some really nice blue on black gum
coloring and the stitching on the top is
really nice as well it's a very
comfortable to wear I have no complaints
as far as the how comfortable these
headphones are my ears fit right into
these big ear cups and it just felt
great to wear um my only issues with the
as far as the build quality goes is just
how big these are in comparison to some
other headphones that are in competition
with as far as size goes the beat
studios are actually a bit smaller than
the street by 50 as you can see here the
street by 50 actually kind of dwarfs the
studios and I've always considered the
studios to be too big for my liking and
that just gives you a sense of feeling
like how big this street by 50 are so
when you have these around your neck
they're very it's just really bulky and
that's usually where I keep my
headphones and the problem with that is
that you can't put those you can't put
the street by 50 away in a shell case or
anything like that because they're not
bendable they're not foldable they can
only stay in this position and the only
thing you can carry then is this little
pouch that they provide in the box now
you're not gonna want to put it in the
pouch and then like in a book bag or
anything all the time or whatever you're
carrying around so it's most likely that
you're gonna be having these on your
like hanging around your neck for the
majority of time you're using them and
they're just a little too clunky for me
in that aspect is just it's just I
didn't really feel comfortable walking
outside with them on because I just felt
like it just drew a little too much
attention to me and I just really
couldn't go with these as far as you
know a pair of headphones that looks
nice outside but that's the only thing I
had with it it wouldn't be too much of
an issue if it can fold up inside of
case and I can store the case somewhere
but unfortunately it's not bendable so
these are like pretty much this is all
you get you can't really do much with it
they're really standard as far as
features but you know that's my only
complaint as far as the build call it
like I said it's very durable the
materials great and you know just not
being both just not being bendable and
it being a little too large for me are
the only setbacks as far as the build
quality of these and the form factor now
another thing about these headphones is
that the sound quality on them is really
nice I can't say that I was I was like
wild or shocked or anything like that I
do feel like they were pretty standard I
have seen online that some reviewers
think that it sounds really great maybe
it might be better for someone who's an
audiophile who can pick up on the little
cues that maybe your regular average
consumer can
as I use these item really pick up
anything special about them the base
wasn't as heavy as the beats that I'm
used to even though it promotes that it
has some superior base I'm not sure what
they called it but they do mention that
they it has some like really good base I
got the base out of it when I had at
high volumes but that can be said about
a lot of headphones so it was just a
little lacking on the base but like I
said before a lot of your viewers felt
that these are some good headphones and
the base didn't overpower songs so if
you're not if you're looking for a good
pair of headphones that the base isn't
overpowering but still there then these
are definitely the way to go but like I
said before I didn't worry there weren't
too many things about the sound quality
that I could pick up that made it
different from you know other headphones
really so that's something to keep in
mind if you're really good at picking up
little little things that maybe regular
person can't you might find a better
experience with these than I have but as
your average consumer I really didn't
pick up anything that wowed me in that
regard so you know it has the good sound
quality if you're looking for a good
pair of headphones that have you know
decent bass nothing that'll overpower
the music then this is the way to go
because you know you can't really go
wrong with the sound quality that have
experienced anyway besides the bass also
because of the size D of these
headphones although it doesn't have
active noise-cancelling like a switch or
anything like that
it has passive noise cancelling due to
the sheer size of the ear cups and how
much they cover your ears so these can
isolate some noises from the outside if
that's a good job at you know sealing
your ears in and you know preventing
noise from leaking inside so that's
pretty nice
you know passive noise canceling and
that means no having to use a switch or
anything like that to use that feature
so which is really nice these go for
about 2 49.99 honestly it's a little
overpriced for me in my particular case
because I didn't
find anything special about them as far
as the sound quality goes so maybe a
little overpriced for me because I can't
pick up on the things that maybe these
headphones do offer as you can see here
these are you see how big it is around
my neck so this is just a little bit a
while this is just a little of what I
was talking about earlier where I don't
really like how large it looks it's you
know a little clunky to me on me the
sound didn't really stand up stand up
against the crowd of headphones that
I've tried out so you know there's some
things to keep in mind like I said the
best thing about these headphones is the
durability and it's the fact that it's
so bendable like this is just nuts I
don't know a headphone that can do this
besides these so that's just something
to keep in mind if you want something
that seems like it's gonna be really
durable lasts for a while I think these
are the way to go so pretty much that's
it for my review guys if you're
interested in the headphones go out and
get them they're they're pretty nice you
can find them at RadioShack for two
$49.99 K+ might possibly have them at
Best Buy Apple store I'm not too sure
but I got my parrot RadioShack and yeah
hopefully you like if you get them let
me know how you like them and this has
been your average consumer if you like
