average consumer and today I have an
unboxing or in bagging of the Pico dolly
and this is very useful if you know
cameras phones stuff like that so let's
not wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the Pico
Dali
now you might be familiar with this from
unbox therapy channel Lulu actually did
an unboxing of this and that's where I
start for the first time so I definitely
um was pretty interested so I picked it
up and hopefully I just wanted to try
and give my videos a little more depth
give some new angles and shots to my
videos keep you guys interested and
we'll see how that turns out and this
doesn't really come with a box so it
only came with those shipping you know
materials that Amazon sensitive so this
is pretty much the box here so we're
gonna unbag or on a box whatever you
want to call it I don't let's see what's
inside so when you open it up you know a
little pops up here in the case a pretty
nice case pretty sturdy let's see what
we get inside I believe this is the arm
so this is a little swivel arm that
you'll be using to place your camera and
giving all kinds of funky angles that's
pretty interesting
this little ball controls all these
little joints here okay so this is the
arm I'm not sure what comes inside this
little box this is the little clip on
piece that you can use to like hold
different cameras cellphones stuff like
that that's pretty cool
so far we've got the arm a little clip
in here and this looks like it's the
dolly itself so it's very simple that's
all you get inside the bag nice little
traveling case to take this around with
you and let's see here we have the dolly
covered in a bunch of bubble wrap there
we go
and pretty nice exactly as I expected it
wheels are a little dirty but that's
okay if we just wipe it off um pretty
cool exactly what I expected most pretty
smoothly let me see if I can oh yeah
this is gonna be very very interesting
to use of course let me give you guys a
close-up so you can know what I'm seeing
close alright guys so here you have that
little arm mechanism and you're gonna be
getting your camera's on this all feels
like pretty tough material feels all
pretty sturdy got a bunch of different
little joints here this is the main the
main vault that you use to be able to
move these around and as you can see
here you can do all kinds of crazy stuff
with it
so that's pretty cool this is um
I believe this is ready to act it onto
the Pico dolly let's see here you can't
you can untwist a whole bunch of these
things so I guess this is where you
latch it on I'm not sure what this is
for but I think you can probably take
this apart too I don't know
but it's gonna be interesting to find
out all of this stuff and here we have
the little clip this thing can hold your
cam like you're a point-and-shoot
cameras your cell phones all kinds of
stuff with cameras it's a little hard to
grab with the UM you know with one hand
to get it open so you probably want to
use two hands to kind of hold it for you
and then as you can see here this is
where you can screw it into onto the arm
and kind of get it to hold the camera at
a funky position and of course the dolly
itself
pretty nice like I said the wheels look
a little long except the wheels look a
little dirty but you can kind of just
wipe it off here with your hands that's
fine
and then it'll look like brand-new so
that's pretty cool so I'm overall I'm
pretty impressed by this it feels like
solid material um I definitely can't
wait to see what I can do with this
thing as far as my videos are concerned
it's gonna be really interesting it's
gonna change the dynamic of all my
videos now and I actually have a mic
that I'm going to unbox see if I can do
some voiceovers see if how my production
level can evolve as far as on my youtube
videos so definitely interested in using
these really happy with the field this
all feels solid I'm very impressed
alright guys so that pretty much wraps
up this unboxing if you're interested in
seeing a review please feel free to let
me know I'll probably get one out to you

it
