average consumer and today I've got
another top five video for you guys and
this time we're going over the top five
features of the brand new HTC One m8
now the HTC One m8 is one of the hottest
smartphones out right now
so we've got to go over the features
that make it so great now if you guys
didn't know I'm having a giveaway of
this phone or the galaxy s5 on my
channel and I'll leave a link down below
to the video where you can enter that
giveaway but hey let's not waste any
time
let's get right into it and starting at
number 5 we have bling feed now bling
feeders are basically a hub of all your
social networks and pretty much any
website that you subscribe to which is a
quick swipe to the left you have access
to all your social media posts as well
as articles that you maybe find
interesting now what's nice about bling
feed it has a pretty straightforward
design it has all these little tiles
that you can just kind of go through and
find different posts so if your friend
tweets or posts a picture or maybe your
website releases an article you can find
those all in order with the newest
coming to the top at first it can seem a
little hectic because you have a bunch
of different tiles from a bunch of
different sources but once you start
tailoring the app to know exactly what
you want to show up you kind of get the
gist of it it takes a little has a
slight learning curve just so you can
get used to get your eyes used to what
is on the page but once you get past
that it's really really simple and it's
actually really nice to digest
information it's really great because
you don't have to go searching for like
the Facebook app or your Twitter app or
anything like that unless you want some
really specific features but if you just
want to digest some information it's a
really great app and it's actually
pretty easy to customize so for number
five we have bloom feed and four number
four on the list we have motion lines
now the HTC one is a pretty big phone
it's a pretty tall phone so getting
access to the home button may not be the
easiest thing for quite a few people out
there so easy has implemented a bunch of
different ways to turn on the phone and
get access to different parts of the
phone
depending on how you turn it on and it
basically works for when you first pick
up the phone so if you leave the phone
on the table for quite some time and you
try to access these features you won't
be able to do it
and a couple of those features being if
you just pick up the phone and you
double tap it you wake up the phone so
you'll get to your lock screen or if you
lock screens go straight to your home
screen if you pick up the phone and you
swipe to your left it'll take you to the
home screen if you pick it up and swipe
to the right it'll take you to blinkfeed
if you pick it up and swipe it down
it'll take you to voice dialing where
it'll ask you to save the name of the
person you'd like to reach out to and
then you just say it and then it dials
them right away now if you pick it up
and swipe upward it'll take you to the
last thing you looked at when you
actually had your phone on so it'll be
like a quick access to right where you
were and that's great because it won't
take you to like the home screen or
playing theater or anything like that if
that's not where you want to be also if
you pick it up in landscape mode and you
press the volume button you'll get
access to the camera app and then you'll
be able to take pictures right away the
HTC One has a crazy fast camera so you
can get to snapping really quickly now
this I feel like you need to get used to
using in order for it to be really
convenient but once you start getting
used to those gestures they're gonna be
a time-saver because you don't have to
like look for the power button at the
top which can be a bit of a hassle
because of how tall of the phone it is
but I do think this is really convenient
once you get the hang of it and so
that's why we have motion launched at
number four and for number three on this
list we have expandable storage now
expandable storage is a feature that's
been missing on a lot of smartphones
lately and usually you won't find it on
phones that are as premium as the HTC
One m8 or the Apple iPhone 5 usually
those phones with that unibody design
you really just don't see that
expandable storage options and other
phones like the Nexus devices never
really carry that so I think that's a
deal-breaker for quite a few people out
there and I think HTC has actually taken
that in and implemented it into the HTC
One m8
so the HTC One m8 can support up to 128
gigabytes of storage so you can take
your pick at how big of a memory card
you want and stick it right in there and
be good to go for quite some time so I
don't think storage is going to be a
problem for anyone considering the HTC
One m8 so that's why we have it at
number three and for number two on the
list we have the HTC duo camera now the
dual camera is something we don't see
typically on smartphones nowadays and
HTC is trying to be innovative with this
and allow you to take pictures with more
information when you take the picture
and what I mean by that is these other
sensor takes in more depth of field
information so you can access different
effects that the camera has so one of
those being being able to provide more
bokeh in your
and adjusting the focus whenever you
want to so you can focus on the subject
and kind of blur out the background to
make it look like a DSLR quality shot
now those pictures don't always come out
the great as they sometimes come out
pretty badly but once you get some more
practice in with the shots you can
actually get some really really cool
effects so it's really cool about this
is that you can actually take a picture
and if your subject wasn't in focus
during the shot you can actually go back
and actually retouch it so that the
subject is in focus and everything else
is blurred out now this doesn't work
100% of the time but it is a really cool
option to have and it doesn't take any
extra work at all all you have to do is
hit the shutter button things like the
Google camera app requires movement
which can be a hassle so HCC's dual
camera system is pretty convenient
considering all you need to do is hit
the shutter button and you get other
cool effects like a 3d effect or you
know the seasonal effects are all kinds
of different stuff that is pretty
gimmicky but it's really nice to see it
on the HTC one and it's nice to show
your friends like you know hey look what
my phone can do kind of just a WoW thing
but other than that I do think it's
great that you can fix a shot after
you've taken it if you didn't quite nail
it or add these cool different effects
now I do think it requires a bit of
skill getting used to the camera and
knowing exactly how to position it to
get the right kind of effects and shots
but I think it really can lead to some
great great photos after you've gotten
used to it and that's why we have the
dual camera at number two on the list
and from number one on the list which
will not come as a surprise to a lot of
my subscribers out there is the HTC
boomsound now I'm a huge audio guy so I
can really really appreciate what HTC
has done with the boomsound speakers now
the boom sound speakers are speakers 2
speakers mind you you can find them at
the top and the bottom of the screen and
when you hold it in landscape mode it's
at the left and right so you've got dual
stereo speakers here and it's just great
that this is implemented no other phone
is doing this which I still don't
understand this is the perfect way to be
listening to audio from a phone coming
towards you rather than behind the phone
where you might accidentally put your
finger over it or you know from the side
of the phone where you can actually
block it depending on how you
so coming toward directly towards you is
the way it should be Apple Samsung
everybody please take note this is how
you do it on the phone now it doesn't
lead to a taller phone but the
experience is worth it definitely worked
it with did bloom sound speakers
it makes the HTC One a perfect media
consumption device so if you're watching
videos you've got a great great display
on the HTC One m8 and you've got the
dual stereo speakers which just makes
for a great experience when watching
like videos movies anything really even
listening to music is pretty decent with
that I've actually used it quite a bit
just to listen to music and I've been
very impressed now one thing I'm
noticing that a lot of people are
talking about boom sound but they're not
I'm talking about the software side now
when you plug in ear buds or headphones
you're actually able to get a boom sound
feature that you can turn on or off and
with the boom sound feature you can
actually increase the sound quality that
you're getting from the phone this is
pretty much like the Beats Audio that
they used to carry before now HTC has
cut their ties with Beats so there's no
Beats Audio anywhere I'm sure a ton of
people are gonna be happy about that
but there's no beats branding on their
HTC One m8 and what's really nice is
that they still kept that equaliser
boost that makes sound quality sound so
much better on the phone so when you
plug in your headphones even if you have
a pair of muddy headphones headphones
that don't provide the greatest clarity
I found that boom sound actually
increases the vocal so it sounds pretty
clear so this is actually really really
nice feature I tried it out with some of
the money as headphones that I could
find and I found that they actually
sound very very good and usually earbuds
that come with a phone they don't
usually have the best sound quality but
I found that the HTC one boom sound made
it sound very very pleasant to listen to
and I think this is a great companion
for bass heavy headphones so if you
really want a lot of bass on your music
and you want to still hear the vocals
there's a perfect combination I think it
works really really well but if you
don't like it you can always turn off
the boom sound when using those earbuds
or headphones and get the regular sound
quality that she's come to expect but
pretty much guys those are the top 5
features I think you can find on the HTC
One m8 and let me know if there's
another feature that you guys like more
or should be on the list and we'll
