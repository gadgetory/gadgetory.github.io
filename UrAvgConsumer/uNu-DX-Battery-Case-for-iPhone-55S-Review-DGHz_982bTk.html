consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the uno DX protective
battery case for the iPhone 5 and 5s so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
Bob Bob hi Bob all right guys here we
have Uno's DX protective battery case
for the iPhone 5 and 5s will call the DX
5 for short if you find your iPhone
struggles to make it through a day on a
single charge or that you're constantly
looking for a charger this is definitely
the case for you as the name suggests
this is the case for the iPhone that's
going to let you get quite a bit of
extra battery life and if you guys know
me you know I love portable chargers
but this case takes it a step above that
now let's take a look at the design of
the DX 5 although it isn't very large it
does add a little thickness and length
to the phone although that's to be
expected since its housing another
battery inside and the size does help to
protect the phone and even though it
adds a little bit to the phone it still
has a very thin profile and won't give
you any trouble to throw in your pocket
purse or anywhere that you want to store
your iPhone it has a nice soft touch due
to the matte black finish and it gives
an overall nice feeling when holding it
the DX 5 has various cutouts for the
power button mute switch volume buttons
camera and headphone jack another subtle
cutout comes right below the front of
the phone which allows you to use the
mic and speaker without issues the
cutouts for the volume and power buttons
do take a little getting used to however
the headphone jack cutout is pretty deep
and won't work with all audio cables so
a headphone jack extender is also
included with the case to remedy that to
get the case on or off your phone you
simply slide off the top portion slip
your iPhone in or out the case and slide
the top back on to close it taking a
look at the inside of the case you'll
notice a lightning connector that plugs
directly into the iPhone 5 or 5s but one
of the great things about this case is
that it doesn't need a lightning
connector in order to charge it used the
ever so common microUSB and this is a
huge benefit because microUSB camp
aren't hard to find at all and if worse
comes to worse and you don't happen to
have one nearby you can ask someone to
borrow a microUSB cable to charge your
phone through the case or a lightning
cable to charge your phone directly
I love having options to actually power
the dx-5 you hold little button in the
back and it'll start charging right away
the DX pipe also has an LED indicator to
let you know how much battery the case
has left when full it'll light up green
and when you're 1/3 of the way through
it'll turn blue and red when you're
almost out of charge now let's talk a
bit about these batteries the dx-5
itself has a 2300 milliamp battery
built-in while the iPhone 5 has a
fourteen hundred and forty million
battery and the iPhone 5s has a fifteen
hundred and sixty this means you can
more than double the battery life of the
iPhone with this case on a full charge I
can go through a full day's work and
still come home with a phone at 100%
which is unheard of with the knife owned
the DX five will give you an additional
10 hours of talktime or eight hours of
web browsing you really wouldn't believe
how much of a difference it makes to be
able to jump on the phone and play games
without worrying about your battery
dying or having to look for your charger
or watching videos with no problem it
does really help to make the experience
a lot better when you know you have
battery to spare as someone who loves
portable chargers it doesn't get more
portable than this and I'm quite a fan
of the DX file the DX 5 retails for
$79.99 and I think it's worth every
penny you're getting protection for your
phone increased battery life and the
ability to charge your phone with a
micro USB the only drawbacks I'd say
this case has are the cutouts for the
volume and power buttons as well as the
charge time for the case itself you
still get the fast charging speeds the
iPhone has but charging the DX 5's
battery takes quite a bit longer than
charging the iphone itself but that
makes sense considering it has a larger
battery but what's great is that it
prioritizes charging the iPhone before
charges itself so I think it's worth
your money
definitely it'll change the way you view
your iPhone since you won't constantly
have to worry about the battery die
on you and if you're interested in
picking this up I'll have links down
below in the description with full
pricing and availability and that about
