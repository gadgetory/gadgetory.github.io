consumer and it has been a very long
time since we've checked out a pair of
new beats and I used to cover beats on
the channel like crazy back in the day I
covered almost every pair but either way
guys the beats Pro are the newest in the
line these guys actually dug into the
box before I got a chance to so this is
gonna be like my first impressions here
Malcolm hit me in this good job okay so
this is the actual travel case or a
charging case and I will save this is
it's a thick boy right there this is a
lot bigger than a pair of air pods can
we actually can we actually get some air
pods whoo okay guys so check the
difference here this is a much much
bigger option if you're trying to pick
between the two so this is a pretty big
case but let's actually see what it
looks like okay got your fingerprints on
it already but these are these are nice
they're a lot smaller than I expected
these are actually 23% smaller and I
think like 17% lighter so then the beats
then the power beats 3 boom so yeah
these are actually a lot smaller than I
expected which is nice but of course
let's talk about what you get inside for
the box now when you open it up you of
course get your powerbeats probe inside
of their charging case and beyond that
you also get a lightning cable and this
is a bit of a longer black lightning
cable and you also get air tips for
those of you who need to switch up the
size and get the right fit of course
some paperwork and stickers that you
probably won't use and parenting is
actually really simple since it features
Apple's new h1 chip which is the
successor to their w1 chip so all I have
to do to get it all paired up is open
the case
hit connect BAM we're done and just like
that we're all set up what I like about
the power beats is that it has this in
ear design but it also has the hooks
these are geared towards athletes but of
course regular people can use them too
oh that is snug that is very snug which
I think let me know what a comment down
below I like this though this is this is
nice alright guys so these are beats
notorious forgetting hated on when it
comes to the sound quality so we are
about to test that out right now see if
after so many years they made some
improvements let's try this out right
now let's see so some Justin Bieber
Justin Bieber has some hits don't front
vocals are legit bass dumps a bit here
we go the beat drop right here here we
go okay well these are definitely gonna
blow air pods out of the water that's
for sure this sounds sounds pretty good
now the thing is this compared to a pair
of air pots this cost 250 bucks
beats price you know it it's a little
bit more expensive I wish this was like
$200 for a better pair of air pods
it would have been nice that it was at
least closer but let's continue let me
hear a couple more songs all that you
guys know
just like a movie okay not bad for right
now I'm pretty happy with the sound this
sounds really good of course you got it
I got to put it through the wringer with
all kinds of music let them burn in a
little bit you know get the full sound
quality out of them but first
impressions these are solid now let's
talk a little bit about the features
with these having the h1 chip you guys
saw how easy it was to pair and it also
has the ability to call out to Siri just
by saying and then you guys will see
it'll activate it and these are only the
second pair of earbuds or headphones
that can do that thanks to Apple owning
beats now if you're running an Android
device you're not going to be able to
just open up the case and pair it you
won't get those kind of cool features
but the charging case does have a pair
button that you can use down here and
with this you'll be able to pair it up
like you would any pair of bluetooth
headphones both earbuds also have volume
rockers so if you want to control your
volume you can just press up or down
using these of course playing pause
works the same with this little logo
button you press it play and if you want
to skip to the next song your double tap
and then boom and pretty much everything
works on each ear but they pretty much
function in the exact same way usually
with earbuds you have one side that has
like all of your controls but this has
them on each side so though each logo
can work as your way to answer calls
skip music playing music all that kind
of stuff so basically if you wanted to
use just one at a time you could do that
with no problem I think they're supposed
to get you 9 hours of playback on a
single charge and if that claim is true
that would be amazing because there are
no other earbuds that provide this much
battery life and when you factor in the
case you get up to 24 hours combined so
that is a ton of battery life on a
single charge what's also cool is that
they've got fast charging as well so
five minutes of being inside of the case
will allow you to use it for an hour and
a half and if you put it for 15 minutes
you get four and a half hours of usage
and that'll definitely cover a trip to
the gym or any other little activity as
long as you're not using this all day
that up to 15 minutes of charging can
actually do a lot now it's also kind of
cool is as soon as you take these guys
out of the case
they power on and let's say you're not
using them for a while you put them down
you have accelerometers inside of these
so it'll be able to detect when you
aren't wearing them and they're just
sitting idle they'll actually go into a
sleep mode to preserve battery life but
I wish all Bluetooth earbuds had this
because there have been so many times
where I take off my earbuds leave them
on the table and I come back in they're
dead so it is great to see that they've
added that here now an important part of
any bluetooth earbud is of course the
mic quality and beats has done some work
to improve that here so they've added
some accelerometers some speech
detecting accelerometers so that the ear
but to know exactly when you're speaking
and using the mics that are on the
bottom I don't know if you guys can
actually see it here but they've got
some down firing mics so that it can
detect your speech and it's supposed to
be able to cancel out outside an ambient
noise so things like wind and all that
should create a clear sound for
whoever's on the other side of the phone
and we're gonna put that to the test
Malcolm let's bring that fan over here
boom ready to jump on the phone Malcolm
yo what's going on man you can hear me
very clear like that it's great now we
are going to try it out with some some
wind sounds let's see how this goes okay
so this is like directly on me
so how's this sound to you can you hear
me clearly or are we hearing like a ton
of wind even perfectly fine do you hear
the wind or are you don't hear the wind
at all
really uh-huh are you serious
so Malcolm says even when I'm not
talking it sounds completely silent that
that's crazy because I'm here this thing
is like right under me
I'm sure the mic is actually picking up
the wind quite a bit
okay well we'll test that out some more
but that's a pretty good first
impression right there I for sure
thought he was gonna at least pick up
some of that that's really impressive
but alright those are like the main key
features we tested out a few sound is
pretty decent I like the overall build
quality and comfort so not bad I'm
really liking these so far I do wish the
price was a bit lower but I will say the
beats X started off at 150 dropped down
to 100 bucks so maybe we'll see some
price drops in the future as of right
now
I do wish it was a bit cheaper though
but for now that about wraps it up for
this video guys just want to do a quick
little unboxing and give you guys a
first look at the new power beats pro I
don't you guys see how some of these new
features performs will of course do a
lot more testing for the full review if
you have any questions you want answered
in that review definitely leave them
down below in the description but till
the next one guys ravage consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
