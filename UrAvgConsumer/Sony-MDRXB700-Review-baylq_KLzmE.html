want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone it's your average consumer
today I've got a review for you guys on
the sony MDR xb 700 so let's not wasting
time let's get right into it alright
guys so here we have the sony xba-4 700
is a really nice pair of headphones I've
been really pleased with my experience
with them so far on the only thing I can
complain about which isn't really a real
complaint it's just the fact that
they're so large that did not really
leave the house friendly cuz but the
thing is you know what you're getting
when you purchase them cuz they're see
this the packaging is see-through so you
know how big these ear cups are and if
you feel like if you think you can walk
around outside with them then you'd be
pretty wrong just to give you guys an
idea of how huge these ear cups are I've
got my beats Wireless here and here the
bees violets are pretty you know have
pretty big ear cups and here you can see
this thing like completely trumps it I'm
going to show you guys a close-up
alright here you guys can see that the
beats Wireless is completely almost
swallowed in by VM xB 700th um inside
the part where you can put your ear the
whole almost the entire ear cut for the
beats Wireless cannot get in there which
is kind of crazy that just goes to show
you how large these are and the beaze
Wireless aren't aren't small headphones
at all so that's just something to note
that these are very large but that's my
only gripe I'm sure some people can
complain about the UM the headband being
too thin but these are so comfortable
that that would be so a very nitpicky
kind of complaint because you barely
feel that these are on your head when
wearing them these ear cups are like
marshmallows on your
on your head they're very soft and
cushiony as you can see here you can
squish them together and they really
take the shape of your head easily
because of this so this makes them
really comfortable and one thing about
these that I really like is that I can
wear these in bed and not feeling kind
of way about breaking them or anything
and I can even lay on my side and the
ear cups will just squish down and
conform to how my head is all in the bed
so that's really nice I haven't been
able to do that with my beats or
anything like that
I've only been able to do that with
things like in-ear headphones and you
know it's really nice to have a pair of
over to over the head headphones that I
can own actually do that with so I
really like that definitely a plus and
the sound quality on these is great um
it's definitely comparable to the beats
line I'd say is way better than the solo
HDS it was actual isn't very hard to see
if it compared to the beats wireless um
it was really tough but because I like
the form factor on the beats Wireless I
like on here's more than over here's I
would side with that but for people who
like over ears you're viewed this would
be your you know a safe bet to UM and
you know I really like the bass on these
and what I really do like about these is
that you can have a lot of bass with
these and still hear the vocals very
well so I really think that's a plus so
that means you're not missing out on
anything which is really good and
considering the price I think these are
go for about you know 120 in the Sony
stores or something like that that's
around what you'll pay and on Amazon you
can get these for maybe like 80 bucks so
these are really a budget-friendly pair
of headphones which are really good
quality and I know that X b5 hundreds
are really popular people like to go
with those I don't think that these are
that may be that much better so if you
want to go for a smaller version of
these that XP 500 would be the way to go
um and I definitely think that you know
if you're on a budget then you know
you're interested in a bass heavy
headphone these are definitely an option
that you might want to look into they
also come with a travel pouch here now I
wouldn't really say that this is made
for regular travel like you know walking
to work or anything like that but as far
as you know being on going or taking
these on a plane or a bus ride or
something like that
these are that the child possible pouch
will come in handy as you can use them
there without looking crazy so that's
definitely a little nice thing that
they've added and pretty much that's it
guys
this thing has great sound quality it
seemed pretty durable to me um I haven't
had any complaints as far as using these
like I said the cushions are very nice
you can sleep not sleep with these but
you can lay in bed with these which is
definitely a plus the sound quality is
definitely comparable or better to be
it's depending on which one we're
talking about and it's in a price range
that's really really great so I
definitely would recommend these if
you're interested in them alright guys
so this has been my review of the sony
MDR XB 700th um be on the lookout for
the girlfriend tests that I have of
these which shows if they how much they
leak and how much they isolate sound and
pretty much that's it you guys if you
