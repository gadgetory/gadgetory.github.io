want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at ravage consumer and I want
to thank you guys for leaving all your
comments and requests in the what do you
want video because it definitely helped
me out and knowing what you guys want to
see on this channel so I definitely
listen to you guys and I went out and
got the beats box portable and today I'm
going to be doing an unboxing so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it alright guys so here we have the
beatbox portable and the front of the
box will give you a nice little idea of
what the beatbox looks like and as you
can see on the box as well down here
that it still has monsters branding on
it so I'm not sure if there's going to
be a different version than that um I
just ordered this from Amazon and this
is what I got from them so I'm assuming
the newest ones are still monster
included and this is also a bluetooth
little speaker so you can listen to your
things wirelessly you can listen to your
iPod wirelessly or you know connect it
up top or you can connect your phone to
it anything that uses bluetooth really
seemed to be able to use this so that's
going to be pretty nice um a quick look
around the box this just shows you the
back um tells you more a little bit more
about the bluetooth tells you what's
inside it includes seven dock connectors
four different little iPods you might
have or iPhones it comes with a remote a
power plug and an adapter for the power
plug and it also shows it's not included
but it uses up to six batteries I'm not
sure what kinds probably like D or C one
of the bigger ones but it's nice not
included but it tells you that it can
take that alright so let's pop this open
pull it back and let's see here so the
first this is how it looks when you
first open it up um so you can open up
the sides here looks like we got a
little tear um alright so the first
thing we're greeted by looks like it's
going to be some user guide
and probably some more marketing for the
products standard beach stuff let me put
that aside and also with some food it up
top are let's see we have the remote
you've gotten a little close-up of what
this remote looks like so here you guys
can see the remote of the beatbox
and it's pretty very this very simple
volume controls track controls play and
pause button you can change the input
you can mute it and this is the power
button up top here so these are really
simple to press nothing special about
this very flat and I'm pretty small as
you can see compared to my hand it's
very small so it won't get in the way
pretty simple controls not bad also
inside you get the little docks for the
different iPods and iPhones so I'll rip
this open show you guys so you can see
the little dots that are included now
there's seven of these because since
there are so many different versions of
the iPod and iPhone and such so you get
a couple different ones to match
whatever I product you have you guys
have more of those little docks for your
iPhone iPod you have your outlet cable
your power plug and your adapter so
that's what the top two portions have
let's get these out of the way and as we
get closer and closer you can see inside
here is where they have the beatbox
let me grab this out of here
and since there's nothing else inside of
the box I'm just I'm just going to put
it to the side since it's taking up a
lot of room anyway
all right and they definitely wrap this
thing like a baby so let's see if we get
this thing open nice little material
here to protect it from scratches and
such and here we are now I must say guys
this looks really nice
this definitely looks really really nice
so I'm pretty happy about that very
small it's pretty light this definitely
is portable so I'm very impressed there
um let's see all right let me give you
guys a close-up so you can see what I'm
seeing for the first time all right guys
so this is the beatbox portable and this
is a really nice little look nice feel
to it I don't know if you guys can see
it here but the the grill here has a bit
of a lift to it on the black portions
and red parts are deep inside so it kind
of has like a rigid feeling so I think
that's really cool really like the look
of that the handlebars are really nice
as well makes it really easy for
carrying you can see that your fingers
can slide in really easily
definitely a good um a good grip here
and let's see on the top you can see it
says beats by dre you also include some
instructions you've got the power button
that also works as the bluetooth button
so when you hold this button down I
guess these are buttons will flash up
and you can kind of pair this to your
device that you want to use bluetooth
with and of course is your volume up and
downs and this is where you plug in your
iPhone or iPod and just to give you guys
a look of what a doc
one of the little doc pieces look like
inside there you are so it gives it a
little bit of a complete feeling there
as you go towards the back you can see
that it says beatbox you can't really
see it here but there's portable cuz
is portable but it's black-on-black so
nobody can really see that this is where
you'll be plugging in your your wall
charger or your AC adapter whatever you
want to call it I'm not sure what this
is this might be a headphone jack I
could be wrong here I'll put an
annotation if anything but this is
something you plug in there and it'd be
a very awkward spot for headphones I
don't even know why you would include
headphones here let's see what else we
got here I'm guessing okay so right here
you have a nice little grip so that when
this is on the surface it's not going to
be moving around a lot so that's really
nice it feels great all right so let's
try and turn these for the first time
okay
and it's very easy to turn it's not like
a screw that you got to keep screwing or
anything
one little flick and then open up it
opens up um see we pull this out a bit
and here you have it guys and this is
the inside part where you will have to
plug in I think these are C or D
batteries I'm really not sure I'll let
you guys know for sure in the annotation
but this is pretty much what you put in
your batteries if you guys want to take
this on the go or go somewhere maybe the
beach or I don't know a friend's house
so that's pretty cool and it's very
simple to just close and open and pretty
much guys this is it this is the beats
box portable very nice handles very nice
feel really good can't wait to try it
out and pretty much that's it guys can't
wait to try this on let you guys know
how it sounds
if it's worth the 350 dollar price tag
that it comes with and see if it's
really something as average consumers
need in our lives so I'll catch you guys
in the next video if you like this video
please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe look out for the review and
I'll see you next time till then peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
