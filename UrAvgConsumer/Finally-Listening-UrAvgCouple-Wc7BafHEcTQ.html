spot yes it is delicious we have found
it's like it's like a Colombian
restaurant it's a little Clemmy
restaurant around our way and the food
is delicious so we have just placed an
order two orders of our favorite dish
there they were so awkward because I
don't speak Spanish very well and they
only speak Spanish so I was like trying
to fumble with my words to get it I got
those organized a mistake a la criolla
kono Serie A betray us be more than the
mother knows for those of us who don't
speak a lick of Spanish that sounded
like she was flawed she was amazing
right those who speak Spanish like oh
she sounds like know what she's saying
right now putting on the woman was just
like okay okay yeah well just get like
chicken and french fries will show you
guys something what's he getting
you know we always have to show you oh
we cooked this morning oh yeah you guys
keep saying we don't cook we don't cook
for ourselves because what this morning
we had Romaniacs it was hammered and
some waffles come on now look I mean I
ghosts ourselves put their own syrup on
ourselves we were fancy so we cooked
guys it was quite the event I wish we've
logged in all right so here's what we
have of course you know we have to have
planten's my doodles plantains how
people have a bunch different name for
these but we've this foam we plant we
love super intense we love them and this
is the mystique
I like seola cannot be troilus which is
just like what is the beef with rice and
beans and has all these like vegetables
on it it's yellow rice and that's his
this is mine I picked out all my
vegetables I know guys I'm ready eating
poorly I'm not even eating the
vegetables all right guys so we are
eating your advice and we're actually
going to start trying to cook at least
take a look at our occurred
ah you see that is he that we have beef
yeah ha ha ha and we have rice and beans
so so instead of buying like the $20
meet people that we get from the Harlow
restaurant we're gonna start to try to
mimic the dish itself so we're just luck
hopefully we do well but we are trying
to not take her advice and save some
money and be a little healthier and this
is what Jed is doing right now he's
sending pictures of beef his mom to see
if it's the right time of beef that
we're buying mama knows best
yes and she's a really good cook like
she can throw it down I mean we should
hire her as a chef we'd have enough
money to pay her
this cute little toy sub trial probably
left here guys don't mind a bandaid on
my finger
cuticle problems how cute is this look
at this oh go ahead go your daddy okay

what it's looking like our part is
jam-packed tons and tons of food
ready to cook what's that happened uh

okay she seems very comfortable if
that's the case I best I guess I better
get going
Oh what you look like you were getting
comfortable

cords yeah what's going on guys hello
hello it is Father's Day yeah Father's
Day so you're probably wondering wait a
minute today's Father's Day
they're recording on Father's Day why
didn't they put up the vlog from the
fire
you know why are they waiting so long
well you know I real has some even you
believe it I mean I had some hair
mishaps guys I'm going natural for the
woman girls out there who watch it if
you want some more information on like
what I'm doing I'm on that sprout right
now but like I'm going natural right now
so am i trying to like fumble through a
bunch of different hairstyles and I am
failing terribly and what she means by
going natural is that her hair is going
to be curly all the time yeah so like
right now my hair is like text like so
like still had a little curl pattern in
it when it's wet but I wouldn't be free
of all chemical so I'm going the natural
roots which means a lot of big puffy
hair guys he's ready for it okay so to
sum that all up guys it means a lot
about heritage it's gonna mean a lot of
recording list that won't make it to the
blog because she's gonna say
yes this will happen but this lines like
we went we didn't like it too much
though we went to get food like like my
hair and it had at me that we recorded a
bunch of clips and we appreciate your
understanding thanks in advance so if I
blog just doesn't happen one week you
know would blame so that's what's
happening so right now in order to make
this a lengthier Wow
we are going home we're recording right
now we'll definitely try to have this
table but first of course remember their
need something from Walmart because New
York does not have any Walmart's and
Jersey does and she has a whole list of
because my takeover
but yeah my mom has a whole is for me so
he'll just go home or I pick up all the
crops to be sitting out and then we'll
Jack
under
and
this is taking forever so we were on the
bridge and I was asking Mary but she
thinks you could climb one of those and
one of those anyway but yeah I was
asking I should climb one of those hey
guys I have no upper body strength
whatsoever like this all here this is
flap that's flap
I can't climb yes she's actually not
lying to you guys
she's always lying to guys but this time
is the truth
she cannot pick up a pencil to save her
life she is that weak I could definitely
a lotta health how thick those I think
they're tables I'm pretty sure they're
like really large cables heading up the
bridge whatever but um like steel cables
anyone I don't know how BIG's alright
but if I could get my hands around them
I thought I used to be really good at
rope climbing when I was younger I don't
think so I'm really good I was really
good clothes back I was really good at
row fighting for some reason and when
these two have these contests at school
and I win it every time like always I'm
pretty athletic
you know the guys might not know this is
to run track this would be really good
at any physical activity sanitary
lifestyle
and all right guys so we're exhausted
yeah we're back home Father's Day went
well yeah we have a good time but now we
just have like tons of work to catch up
on because we spent the whole entire day
in New York yes and I didn't even sleep
last night I pulled an all-nighter
so I'm exhausted and he lost so well I
don't I don't think it's over yet but
there's no chance
this is no chance see so that if he lost
guys if they lost you can jinx him I
mean you could say he jinx them I can't
speak and I just poked myself in the eye
