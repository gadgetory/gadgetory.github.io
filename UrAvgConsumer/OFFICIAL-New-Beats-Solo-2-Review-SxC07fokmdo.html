consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the brand new beats solo2 x'
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it
all right guys here we have the new
beats solo2 this is the newest entry
into the beats headphone line and this
is currently the replacement for the
beats solo HDS beats claims these have
updated and improve acoustics but let's
see if it's worth your $200 first let's
talk about the design and the build
quality it sports an almost identical
look to the new Beats Studio while of
course retaining the solo HD smaller
footprint it is slightly larger than the
solo HDS however and like most of the
beats they come in quite a few colors
you have black red white blue pink and
silver and it should be noted that the
black is the only color that features
the red accents it shares many of the
same design cues from the larger studio
such as a more curved look a high-gloss
finish which is quite the fingerprint
magnet mind you larger and more padded
ear cups and not to mention the overall
design of the ear cups with a nice red
accents much like the new Beats Studio
it offers improved build quality and
mini C build quality as beats weakest
point but that shouldn't be a concern
with the new design the curved headband
won't allow for snapping as easily as
the original flat version I'm honestly
not too confident in the quality of the
hinges found on beats however as I've
noticed over time they usually become
pretty loose I'm afraid that this may be
an issue here as not much has changed
with the hinges but it's still far too
early to determine whether or not that
will happen next let's talk about
comfort the solo tools have everything
needed to be comfortable headphones the
curved and adjustable headband should be
a good fit for anyone with a
normal-sized head and even those with a
Jimmy Neutron thing going on the ear
cups offer a great amount of padding for
the ear and actually has a really great
seal around the ear even though these
are considered on the ear headphones
although all of this sounds great I
found these to be pretty tight on my
ears while this definitely helps the
headphone to feel secure and with sound
isolation
after a while it became a bit unbearable
especially since these ear cups are
pressing down on them just about all of
your ear it's a similar discomfort to
that of the mixers but these have much
better ear cups included with the solo
tools is a single cable with remote talk
controls volume controls as well as the
plane pause feature work with most Apple
products and just play and pause for
Android the cable features an l-shaped
input which is great as it won't bend in
your pocket and it's high enough to work
with mobile device cases and speaking of
cases this comes with a dumbed-down
version of the solo HDS travel pouch
there's no longer a handle on the case
to hold it by the case itself does offer
some decent protection but you still
have to be weary of impact damage and
putting too much pressure on it
I also wish they didn't remove the
inside pouch so cables would have a spot
inside of the case beats definitely took
a step backwards with the accessories as
they only include one cable a dumbed
down version of the travel pouch and not
even a microfiber cloth but with all
that aside let's get to what you're
actually here for the sound quality now
I know you're wondering did they really
improve the sound absolutely beats like
a similar approach to what they did with
the new studios and focus a bit more on
clarity bass is more controlled and
doesn't cause the music to sound muddy
or drowned out the sound is definitely
more polished without sacrificing too
much bass and it doesn't offer the
clarity to the levels of the new beat
studios or the v-moda XS I'll go more in
depth with that in their comparison
videos I think these are great for
genres like rap hip hop dubstep pretty
much anything Basie but I do wish vocals
had a bit more presence but these still
sound good nonetheless
overall beats is definitely headed in
the right direction with these tweaks
and upgrades and I'll definitely take
overall better sound quality with a
slight hit to the bass any day but don't
misunderstand just because they've
controlled the bass a bit more doesn't
mean you won't feel it as mentioned by
my girlfriend it's still very present oh
my gosh you have to feel these they have
like a it might even like the Skullcandy
where it has like the basic a lot of
babies oh my gosh you could feel it like
in the ear cups Oh tons of bass there
have it now do I recommend you picking
up a pair it depends if you have
sensitive ears I
definitely try out a display unit first
and see if you're okay with the feel
with that aside I think as a package it
is worth it you're getting good build
and sound quality and a very
nice-looking headphone I don't think
it's for everyone but I think the
average music listeners should
definitely enjoy these and they're worth
the try but of course it's time to show
you guys what they look like on so
heritage we'll start off with a front
view so here you have it
and of course from the sides and up top
and for when you're not using it put on
your neck here it is and that's about it
so guys like I said I really like the
direction these are going with the new
headphones they started off with the new
Beats Studio really upgrading the sound
quality and they definitely do something
somewhere here so good stuff buy beats
definitely trying to change their image
as far as sound quality goes so that's
about it for this review guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy that hits the thumbs up button and
subscribe to the channel for more
content for me I'm going to have some
comparison videos of this guy so
definitely stay tuned for that and I'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then is your average consumer please
