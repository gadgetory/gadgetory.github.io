consumer and today I'm going to be
reviewing the Logitech UE 9000
so let's not wasting your time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the Logitech UE 9000 s now these are
some special headphones to me because
I'm a bluetooth headphone lover I love
wireless headphones and the UE 9000 s
did not disappoint and the first thing
we're going to do here is take a look at
the case that it comes with taking a
look at the case you'll see that it has
a hard shell design it's all black with
a blue zipper lining and it's pretty
durable I don't think you'll have any
worries tossing your headphones around
inside of this case offers some pretty
good protection inside of the case
actually has two little flaps that you
can store your headphone cables as well
as your USB charger since this is a
Bluetooth device you will want to charge
it so you're able to carry both those
cables with you with no issues they
don't take up too much space it's not
make doesn't make the case any more
bulky really good stuff and we
headphones just sit very nicely on the
inside of the case and you don't have to
worry about it moving around or anything
like that they're very safe and secure
inside this case and what's really nice
about this case is that it is pretty
flat so you're able to carry this around
with you if you want to throw it in your
backpack or anything like that you'll be
just fine with that
so the portability here is pretty nice
even though these are some slightly
larger headphones the UE nine thousands
come with a blue tangle free cable and
of course this has an inline remote that
works with all Apple devices play/pause
volume up/down rewind fast-forward all
kinds of good stuff but it doesn't work
with Android you can only use the play
and pause feature and that's pretty
typical with almost all headphones I
haven't really encountered too many
headphones that actually have all the
other features as far as volume controls
for Android so that's okay now of course
we're going to take a look at the actual
headphones themselves
I love Logitech's designs for these the
ultimate ear series has some really
really great-looking headphones the UE
six thousands were very impressive and
I'm also very impressed by the UE 9000 I
think that they've got some really good
quality very durable this feels like a
very
premium headphone it feels very sturdy
it's got a bit of heft to it so it's not
the lightest pair of headphones around
it does have some heft it has some
pretty big ear cups and it does have
like a very sturdy headband so you can't
expect to have some heft to it but it is
high-quality it should be at $400 but it
definitely is and I'm not disappointed
whatsoever by the quality of these
headphones as far as the design the
durability and the actual just feel of
the headphones I really like to design
one of my favorite parts is the little
blue accents that it has around it it's
got a nice hint of blue inside the ear
cups and around the ear cups and also
the actual ear cups themselves are like
a sparkly blue and black it looks black
from afar but if you take a close look
and under some light you'll see that it
has like these little blue sparkles you
can't really notice it but it's a nice
touch
definitely some good stuff and certain
pieces of it feels like it's a aluminium
so it definitely has that overall nice
feel and look to it another thing I like
about this design is the really deep ear
cups they can let your ears go all the
way inside so it's an over ear
experience and one thing I really like
about them is that it's got a nice soft
cushion so it's really really
comfortable
although might be a bit heavy it's still
very very comfortable and very nice on
the ears of course we talked about the
looks the design the hardware but now
how sound quality the sound quality is
great I love it there are two different
kinds of sound quality here while you're
using bluetooth and not using bluetooth
these headphones don't need to have
active noise-cancelling on so when you
don't have an active noise-cancelling
you get a more subdued sound quality
from it and I think some people tend to
like this part because it's not bass
heavy it sounds just really clear and
clear and I agree this sounds a lot more
calm down it's not that thumping sound
that you um get when listening to
certain genres of music that you don't
really want that
so it's definitely some good stuff here
when active noise-cancelling is off and
as you guys guess when the active
noise-cancelling is on you get this bass
boost and you kind of just hear a lot
more bass than normal and i as a bass
head love it but i can understand if
some people
don't like that too much and prefer to
go with the wired version of listening
because it's more subdued but I think
this is great because it has the best of
both worlds and that's amazing that's
perfect and at the $400 price point it's
great that it can kind of work well for
everyone
bass lover or not so definitely some
good stuff as far as the sound quality
goes and these are bluetooth headphones
guys so when you're using bluetooth the
active noise-cancelling has to be on and
of course that means you're going to get
that stronger base than normal um in
order to have the more subdued bass
you'll want to have it with the wires
but with active noise canceling on you
will get that extra bass now what's
great about these headphones is even if
the battery does die on you you can just
plug in the wire and keep listening with
no problem it'll just keep on playing
like nothing happened so that's really
great and if you want to have the active
noise canceling on you don't need to
have the Bluetooth feature enabled you
can just plug in the wire and still turn
on the active noise-cancelling so you've
got your options to mix it up there the
battery does last some good amount of
time I would say a couple of hours I
haven't really counted exactly but I've
been able to listen to them for hours on
end and not really worry about it um
overall I'm very happy with this the
only complaint that I would have about
these headphones is that it might be a
little big to some people it is a bit
heavy so for those of you who prefer
light headphones these probably aren't
the way to go they are a bit on the
heavier side and the only other con I
would say what these headphones is that
they are not foldable so they have to
stay in this position but they can get
pretty flat by folding the ear cup
sideways so you can lay this down and
you know take them somewhere but though
it's not being foldable that that
definitely is the only other thing that
I don't like about these and of course I
have to show you guys what it looks like
on so here it is around the neck so when
you're not listening and you just want
to hang it on your neck here it is still
a little big so for some it might be big
good or bad who knows I think it's
actually okay and of course on the head
you guys see it
turn to the side and there you go
so overall guys these are some great
headphones I love them
these have definitely knocked out the
beats Wireless has my favorite bluetooth
headphones but these are a bit more
pricey these are $400 compared to like
the 300 that the Wireless cost these are
pretty expensive but if you are looking
into these you know the price already
you're not surprised that it's 400 you
just want to know if it's good or not
definitely they are they sound great
feel great look great so they definitely
have a go in my book I would highly
recommend these to anyone who is
interested in purchasing them
these they're a total package in my
opinion so they definitely have my go
and that's about it guys
