consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the audio technica ath m50x
now a ton of you guys love the m50 s
but let's see if the m50x is worth your
upgrade or your first-time purchase so
let's not waste any time get right into
it
Wow yup all right guys here we have some
headphones that need no introduction the
audio technica ath m50 now with an X
these are the updated version of the
ever-so-popular
88 M 50s and they look almost exactly
like the originals but have a few subtle
changes that make them a worthy
successor of the infamous and 50s first
let's go over the design and the build
quality as I mentioned before this is
pretty much the exact same headphone but
you'll notice that there is now a port
on the left ear cup for use with a
detachable cable that we'll get into in
just a second second is the model number
embedded into the hinge of the ear cups
and that's about it for the changes as
far as aesthetics go Audio Technica
definitely didn't want to stray away
from what was already working for them
thus so few changes the overall look is
a bit on the large side but it doesn't
give that feeling of being too big they
aren't my first choice to take with me
outdoors because of the size but I no
longer think I'd completely rule them
out like I did with the originals and
that's partially due to having a more
portable cable although they may be a
little large that doesn't impact their
portability at all
these fold up very well and make it
quite easy to store or travel with as
far as build quality goes this thing is
tough I've never been concerned with
durability of the originals and the same
goes for these they can definitely
withstand the beating and don't need any
babying it isn't made of any crazy
material but in hand you can feel how
sturdy it is now let's talk a bit about
comfort this is an area you'll find a
subtle but very helpful change the
material used for the ear cups have
changed to a much softer pleather
material and I'm not sure what the ear
cups of the originals were made of but
in comparison to the m50x you'd think
that it were made out of a tough paper
material now I've never even had the
slightest issue with comfort with the EM
50s but then
if the ex has a much nicer feel when
being worn the headband is also very
well cushioned and can be adjusted to
fit those with a larger-than-life head
size the m50x also come with a few
accessories that give it a lot more
flexibility when you purchase a pair
you'll receive a quarter inch adapter a
1.2 meter straight cable a three meter
straight cable a 1.2 to 3 meter coiled
cable and a travel pouch although pretty
small the travelpod Encounter the m50x
and a couple of the cables with no
problem
the original m50 came with a coiled
cable and if you wanted something
different you had the m50 s that
featured a 3 meter straight cable with
the m50x you can pick and choose which
lengths works best for you I'm very glad
they included a 1.2 meter straight cable
option because it makes the headphone
quite a bit more portable you no longer
have to think about where you're putting
the rest of your cable or worry about it
dangling out of your pocket and it was
definitely made with mobile use in mind
and even the shape of the 3.5 milimeter
input is made to work with mobile
devices and mobile device cases whereas
the original had a pretty flat base
around the input that didn't play well
with mobile devices or their cases the
coiled and straight cable still feature
the same design however but they clearly
aren't meant for mobile use you can line
up the input that goes into the air cups
and lock it into place which is great
for those accidental Yanks however that
input is also smaller than the other so
you can't just insert any side this also
means that other detachable cables won't
work with the m50x if you have any extra
lying around this is probably the only
real flaw to the m50x
the proprietary cables and possibly the
lack of a remote control for your mobile
device if that's important to you but
now let's finally talk about the sound
quality if you're familiar with the
sound quality of the originals not much
has changed here and that's a good thing
you get a very well balanced sound with
some great clarity and if you're coming
from a pair of muddy sounding headphones
these are definitely going to be an
eye-opener for you they offer a great
and balanced sound as they were made for
monitoring and mixing I love to use
these when editing my videos and for
casual music listening they don't have a
ton of bays which is something I'm into
so they are my preferred cans for
something like hip-hop or
step but I can still listen to those
genres without any issue I'm pretty
confident in the sound experience you'll
get in just about any genre outside of
the ones that are really bass heavy but
don't get me wrong this does have plenty
of bass but it just isn't head rattling
which isn't really a con to a lot of
people as it won't bleed into the other
sounds from the music that you're
listening to vocals come in very well
and even the smallest details are
ever-present which is something that you
want from monitor headphones overall
you'll get a very clean and full sound
from the m50x and if you're familiar
with using your equalizer settings you
can easily tune these to sound just the
way you want them I highly recommend
picking up a pair of the m50x if you
don't own a pair already but I don't
think your offers enough to warrant
upgrading from your originals at least
not based on sound alone but if you do
value having a shorter cable and having
more comfortable ear pads these just
might be worth it I know those two
reasons along with the gray sound
quality has caused the m50x to move
higher up my list of favorite headphones
the m50x retail for about 169 on Amazon
which is $50 more than the original
currently but if you don't already own a
pair I honestly think it's the better of
the two to pick up
I love options and the m50x provides
just that but of course now I have to
show you guys what they look like on and
try to show you what they look like on
so here it is from the front you guys
get a good look here it is from the side
and of course top you
and when you're not using it you want to
put on your neck for a second is it like
I said it's a little on the large side
but it's up to you whether or not you
care it and pretty much that's about it
for this review guys I definitely do
recommend this
I love these a lot more than I did the
originals and it's just the subtle
changes that really really help so this
is an a-plus in my book definitely
recommend this and that's about it for
this review guys hopefully you enjoyed
it if you did be the cool guy that hit
the thumbs up button and subscribe to
the channel for more content from me and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
until then it's your average consumer
