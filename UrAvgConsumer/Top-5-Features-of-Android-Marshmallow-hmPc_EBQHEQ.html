consumer and today we're going to be
talking about the top five features from
Android M that was just announced at
Google i/o now this list is in no
particular order but we're gonna start
this off with Android pay now let's
address the elephant in the room this is
Android pay and there's Apple pay now
I'm not gonna say Google copied Apple
because Google Wallet has been around
way before Apple pay but they did buy it
on Apple with the pay part of it and I
think that's because Apple actually made
it popular Google Wallet never really
took off and they had some trouble
getting some traction Apple pay blew up
and people know what Apple pay is so
they're going to go ahead and copy the
marketing a bit with Android pay and
just as you'd expect this is tapped to
pay so all you have to do is take your
device put it on the reader and boom you
should be able to pay for whatever item
you're purchasing now google says they
already have 700,000 merchants who are
ready to take Android pay and you can
actually also use it to pay for in-app
purchases and for phones that are able
to support it you can use your
fingerprint to unlock Apple pay and
start using it now one thing I like
about these pay services is that they're
actually more secure than using your own
card for android pay Google will make an
account number for whatever card you're
using and that's what's going to be used
when dealing with merchants instead of
your card number and that makes it way
more secure than using your actual card
and I'm a huge fan of that the next up
we have Google now Google Mail has
always been awesome on Android and now
google announced some crazy improvements
in Android M now we'll be able to
proactively answer and make suggestions
based on what's on your screen they drew
the word context around a lot and that's
because it takes information from what's
on your screen and tailors it to
responses based around it a cool example
they showed was receiving an email from
a friend about a movie and then having
Google now send you a card giving you
all the details about it I thought this
was pretty dope because you can kind of
skip the whole process of asking what's
the movie about who's in it and get all
that information right from google now
it'll even be able to give you more
information about businesses and I'm not
just talking about locations and reviews
you'll be able to see when their busiest
what time they open and close
and even what you might need before
getting there I think that's pretty
awesome another new addition to Android
M is USB type-c support we'll probably
see this first with new Nexus devices
and hopefully other manufacturers pick
up that as well USB type-c will allow it
to three to four times faster charging
speeds and it'll provide a flippable
design now this is great because you
want the fumble or sterka ports to make
sure you're plugging it in right and
this might not seem like a big deal but
I welcome anything that makes my life a
little bit easier and this definitely
does and with USB type-c you'll be able
to use your device to charge another
device which in theory sounds really
cool but I'd probably never use this
with my phone as we all know phone
battery life is very precious but I
probably use it if I had an Android M
tablet and I needed to charge something
else in an emergency now another new and
very welcome future is better app
permissions when you first install an
app you get a list of permissions that
the app will be accessing after you've
installed it but google has done away
with this and now apps will be able to
request permission when trying to access
those parts of your device we no longer
have to deal with you all or nothing
approach now we can select which
permissions the app gets to use when it
actually needs it and last but not least
there's doze Android M is looking to
make your device smarter at managing
power with a new doze mode this mode
will put your phone or tablet into a
deep sleep if it hasn't been picked up
or used for an extended period of time
during those you won't have a ton of
background activity from your apps
allowing your device to go into a deeper
sleep state and will only sync with high
priority apps with this you should be
able to get twice as much standby time I
can't wait to see this come to the
galaxy s6 since I'm not too crazy about
it standby time but normal activity does
resume once you pick up or move your
device you got to keep in mind though
that this is for standby time and this
will not give you extra battery time
once you're actually using the device
that pretty much wraps it up for my top
5 features that I see coming to Android
M now I think we should all take away
that Android M isn't going to be a huge
update for android is going to be one of
those
a base that just makes a few things
better but hopefully you enjoyed this
guy's if you saw a feature that I didn't
mention here today and you think it's
better leave a comment down below in the
description and I'll catch you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
