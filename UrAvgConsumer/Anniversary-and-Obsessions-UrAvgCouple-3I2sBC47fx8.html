when I have this phone I like to keep it
right here I'm when I have a phone I
keep it on my lap while I'm driving
don't touch me but um this AC will see
one is so slippery that it keeps falling
onto the floor of the car I'm gonna get
into a car accident I swear to god one
because one because I shouldn't have the
phone on my lap anyway
but two because when it falls it's over
there you're gonna run and try to get it
so this is good look around yeah well
they need to see to make sure you
remember that your life is more
important than the phone value it where
I keep this phone yeah that sounds like
a smarter thing to do
yeah but this phone is so we're on our
way to Sally's because I think what a
phone slipping off your lap because I
can't do with my hair like this so I'm
gonna try and do my hair myself I
usually watch the salon to get it
