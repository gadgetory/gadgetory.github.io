and today we're looking at some of the
best accessories for the new MacBook Pro
for 2016 now this is a 2016 model
without the touch bar that's going to be
coming out soon but all of the
accessories mentioned in this video will
work for both versions with touch bar
first off we're going to address the
biggest issue to new MacBooks and that's
the lack of ports so I've got this guy
right here and this is the Satechi smart
hub so with this you're able to use the
USB type-c port that's on the macbook
and get a ton of i/o and basically that
means you're going to get a lot of ports
you've got two USB 3.0 ports an SD card
slot which is surprisingly missing from
the new MacBooks
even a micro SD card slot and of course
another USB type-c so if you're using
this you can still charge it and have no
issues and it even comes in different
colors to match your macbook so if
you've got Space Gray you've got this
one to go with it now one of my favorite
things about this hub is that it doesn't
have a cable attached to it so it's not
going to be dangling from your computer
all you have to do is plug it right in
and it's actually attached to the
macbook so it fits in seamlessly doesn't
take up a lot of space and it just works
so if you're picking up the new macbook
you're definitely going to want this
especially if the SD card slot means
anything to you and it only cost around
forty five bucks so it's not going to
break the bank and it brings back some
serious functionality to something
that's surprisingly missing here now
since the new MacBooks used Thunderbolt
3 ports they can also use USB type-c
which gives you access to these these
are tiny little flash drives that you
can use with a USB type-c connector as
well as a regular USB end so you can
plug it into other regular computers as
well as your new MacBook now this is a
64 gigabyte version by Kingston it only
goes for about 20 bucks which is a steal
and they also have 128 gigabyte options
which comes in the same compact body and
I'll have links to that down below as
well so if you're looking to have some
storage that doesn't take up a lot of
space easy to walk around with this is a
very solid option now if you're looking
for something a little more heavy-duty
and on the professional side this is the
Samsung t3 with the Samsung t3 you're
getting much faster data speeds in a
compact body which is also very durable
and you get way more storage than you
would with a flash
five you can go from 250 gigs all the
way up to 2 terabytes so if you happen
to be a professional who has a lot of
videos 2 terabytes is going to be
awesome in a compact body but if you
happen to be a regular user who just
wants to have all their libraries with
them like your music videos other kinds
of documents you can definitely go with
the smaller options with the 250 gigs
that has no compatibility issues with
the MacBook and it actually kind of
matches pretty well so it actually looks
good has functionality and durability
and that's a plus for me
now obviously the MacBook has these new
ports so what does that mean for iPhone
users with a regular lightning cable you
can't plug it in without a dongle right
and that is annoying so right here I've
got a USB type-c cable to lightning
cable so that will make all those issues
go away now with this you've got your
USB type-c and as well as your lightning
end so you can plug it up to your
computer with no problem and it has a
braided cable so this is going to have
some more durability than your standard
lightning cable which is always nice and
it just makes it a lot easier than
having to use a dongle so you can just
plug this in pop that in and then you're
good to go
but this is the kind of cable you need
if you're an iPhone user who's picking
up the new MacBook unless you want to
use the dongle now next up on this list
as you can see this MacBook has been
sitting pretty on this little stand here
and this is actually also by Satechi so
this is a nice little stand it's very
flat convenient and all you got to do is
pull it out and you can sit it no
problem it has these rubber stops so
that the MacBook doesn't slide around
slide off and it actually is a really
really nice addition if you want to
change the way that you use your MacBook
and one thing that I do like is that
with the actual hinge you've got this
little cutout so that you can actually
put in some USB ports if you have a ton
of them hooked up to your MacBook you
can use this here so if you've got that
set up that they showed during the event
where you've got the two monitors you
can have those cables routed right
through this little cutout and make it a
much cleaner setup and last up on the
list we've got these carrying cases now
you've got your new MacBook you want to
travel in style
here are some nice felt cases this one's
actually from amazonbasics
so straight from Amazon and it's
actually very very nice it's got a nice
little color this one's also I gotta
find this on but this is a darker
version this is more so for the 15-inch
MacBook sout there but distance from
initech and it comes with an extra
little pouch so if you want to bring
some of those accessories around like
the Samsung t3 the USB hub pack it can
even hold a portable charger so if you
want to bring anything else around you
can do that with that but it's just kind
of cool to have these because it'll
protect your investment
when you're throwing this in your
backpack you don't want the metal
scraping against anything that you might
have inside of there and it just feels
kind of cool looks good nice clean look
I think this one from amazonbasics was
around twelve bucks and this one was
about seventeen you can also get the
initech version and discolor if you want
but these are really solid options good
for protecting the macbook and they're
stylish so I definitely think that is
worth picking up but that's about it for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
these have been some of the best
accessories that I found for the new
MacBook and I'm pretty excited to try
them out but if there's any takeaway
guys get the Satechi one it's a must
they're not a sponsored nobody's a
sponsor here but if you're gonna get a
new MacBook you gotta get this but until
next one guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
