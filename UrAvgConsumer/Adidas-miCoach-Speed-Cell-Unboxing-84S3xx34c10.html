consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the adidas miCoach speed
cell so for all you runners and athletes
out there this might be something you
want to pay attention to so let's not
wasting your time let's get right into
it
and alright guys so here we have the
adidas miCoach speed cell now this is a
performance tracker for all those
athletes out there or maybe not even
athlete but those who are really active
and they're trying to track their speed
their max speed how far they're going
all kinds of stuff so this is going to
help you track all of that information
now just taking a quick look around the
box you can see a little picture of it
there's not much to it
in the back it does give you some
information on what you can expect so
you can capture your performance data
for any sport it records movement in
every direction so that's pretty cool
it measures speed distance detail
training and in-game stats so like I
said lots of information is tracking
here and you can track different things
for different sports like football
basketball tennis running all kinds of
stuff where there's a lot of running
involved so you can track different
metrics with that so now let's actually
open it up you can open it up from the
side and boom here you have it this is
it's a very tiny device now this is
actually going to go on your shoe so
you're going to be putting this on your
shoe and I think adidas has some shoes
that you can actually clip this right
into so it has like a special spot for
it and if it doesn't have a spot for it
you can actually use the clip that's
included inside so you can actually
track all of this information on the
adidas website or you can actually get
the app that you can find in the Play
Store or in the App Store so you can
check those out now let's actually get
to opening this let's see there's a
little tab up front so we can pull that
out and yeah so there doesn't seem to be
much paperwork it's this pretty small
box you of course got your warranty card
and I'm sure these are like QuickStart
guides so you have a QuickStart guide
here and what's this something else okay
so we're going to put this all over here
and yeah let's actually leave the
QuickStart guide out
so pop this over here and let's actually
get this thing out so he can just pop it
right through and this thing is tiny
guys it's really really small so this is
it so what you guys see here this
actually doesn't need a included clip
this thing actually is a clip so the
whole design is one whole clip so you
can actually get these on your shoelaces
or something like that so you don't have
to worry about this needing any special
shoes or anything like that if you do
have the shoes that go with it that's a
bonus but you don't need anything
special you can just put these on your
shoes first uh guys this tracks your
speed your max speed the distance you're
running and it also tracks your stride
rate so for all those runners out there
this is going to be an essential tool
lets you know how you're performing so
this does use bluetooth so if you want
to connect it to your smartphone you can
just use it through that you can also
connect it to your laptop or computer by
using bluetooth and you can actually
download the my coach manager so you can
go and download that and sync all your
information through that if you don't
want to use like a smart phone or
something you can always use that so the
setup process is simply downloading the
apps for whatever operating system you
want to use it with and you'd be good to
go
of course you want to go and set up a my
coach account and put in all your
information and you know set up so that
you can know which sport you're going to
be playing with it and boom so this is a
pretty simple device there's not much to
it but I'm going to be reviewing this
and I'm going to let you know how
accurate it is
I actually unbox team I coach Smart Run
which is the SmartWatch that adidas has
come out with that tracks a lot of
performance stuff as well and I'm going
to try and see how accurate the
performance data is between the two of
them I believe the data says that the
accuracy is about 97% so that's actually
pretty really good actually so I'm gonna
see how good it is and just a quick note
this doesn't have a rechargeable battery
you have to replace the battery it's um
one of those batteries that fits in a
watch it's got a weird number but I'll
leave that information down below in the
description you can actually find links
to this and the SmartWatch in the
description down below so be sure to
check that out and pretty much that's it
for this unboxing guys there's really
not much to it it's really simple all
you have to do is get the app put this
on your shoe and you're out the door
good to go so that's it for this
unboxing imma let you guys know in a for
review how well it performs and I guess
I'll check you guys out in the next
video if you enjoyed this one be the
cool guy that has the thumbs up button
and subscribe to the channel for more
content from me and I'll catch you guys
in the next video till then is your
average consumer case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
