consumer and today I'm going to be
showing you my ultimate living room set
up and all right guys let's start this
off by talking about the center of the
living room the TV what I've got here is
Samsung 55 inch curved 4k Smart TV and
I'll have links to the exact model as
well as everything else shown in this
video in the description if you want to
keep up with the times you've got to
have 4k and as someone who shoots in 4k
it'd be pretty blasphemous to still rock
a 1080p screen I mean I have used
Samsung televisions in the past and
we've been really happy with the picture
quality so we went with them again this
time around and we weren't disappointed
the picture quality is great and when
watching 4k content you'd be amazed at
how much detail there is and since this
is also a smart TV you get access to the
Smart Hub and a ton of apps from Hulu
Plus to Netflix and tons more this thing
is quite a few more features like access
to PlayStation now being able to use
your remote as a pointer so you don't
have to hit a ton of buttons to access
certain menus a multi view screen option
so you can view two sources at once and
a bunch more but I can't fit them all
into this video but I gotta say I'm
super happy with this TV now we've got a
really nice TV but let's talk about the
things I used to get the most out of it
there are quite a few different set top
box options to choose from nowadays but
what really caught my eye and earned one
of my HDMI spots is the Nvidia shield
the shield is running Google's Android
TV software with some nice bonuses of
course from Nvidia now the first thing
that separates this from the others for
me is being able to stream 4k content to
my 4k television surprisingly enough you
can find 4k content on Netflix and of
course here on YouTube since it is
running Android TV you get access to all
Google Play services and you also get
voice integration through the built-in
mic on the controller and remotes this
is awesome for searching and pulling up
info it's also great to command the
shield when you want to
apps and access other features and being
made by Nvidia you know gaming is
involved this thing is packing the
NVIDIA Tegra x1 processor so it can
handle some pretty hardcore stuff like
war thunder doom 3 and even half-life 2
one of the features I was really
surprised and happy to see was the
ability to use the shield hub to stream
games from the cloud you can imagine my
excitement when I was able to stream
games like Devil May Cry 4 right to my
TV gaming on this is pretty comfortable
with their wireless controller and if
you played console games before you'll
feel right at home here and this thing
features Google cast so if you're
looking to stream media from your phone
or tablet straight to your TV you can do
it with just a press of a button since
you guys know I'm pretty big on gaming I
had to include all the current gen
consoles from the ps4 to the Wii U and
of course the Xbox one you're not
finding any fanboys here so no matter
what your cup of tea is I've got options
I love options now I'm a pretty huge
Sony fan and I love my ps4 but I have to
admit the Xbox one Kinect is a massive
part of this setup it's such a big deal
I have to set it up on this tiny tripod
made for the Kinect right under the TV
but it does have a ps4 camera on top
whether we want to turn on or off the TV
watch a particular channel since we do
still own a cable box open up apps play
and pause whatever we're watching
control volume you get the drift area
and I find it so much easier and faster
to use our voice then to look for a
remote or wait for the Xbox one
controller to wake up I know people are
scared of the Kinect or think it's
useless but I think Microsoft was really
onto something with this thing and it
absolutely changed the way we use our
television now that you've got a solid
rundown of my TV and how I use it it'd
be nothing well not nothing but it
wouldn't be as impressive without some
amazing sound to go with it so I've got
a pretty solid home theater system set
up to give me some exquisite surround
sound I went with full Sonos gear
including the play bar for frontal audio
as well as two solos play ones on each
side of my couch and the sono sub for
some deep bass I've had surround sound
speakers hooked up to my eye
Mack for a few years but I've got to say
using this is quite a different
experience you get some crazy rich audio
with some thunderous bass and it really
is called a home theater system for a
reason in since I use play music as my
streaming service of choice
I can use my Nvidia shield to jam out
whenever I want if you're looking to
make a serious investment into your
sound game I would definitely look into
these now this makes up most of the
entertainment side of things but I did
check out my living room so you'll find
little things in a lot of places you
wouldn't expect all of my lamps are
filled with philips hue bulbs so I can
change the mood or the look of the room
whenever I want and under my TV I've got
a Philips hue strip to add a little
flair to the area I also picked up a
logitech harmony universal remote so it
can control most of the things you find
here you can access and control to
Phillip Hughes lights my sono system and
obviously the TV you can even configure
activities to create a certain setting
at the push of a button depending on
what you want to set the room up for
under my coffee table you'll find the
MacBook Bear so anyone sitting on the
sofa can access a laptop whenever they
need it you can also find a pair of
v-moda m100 headphones with their boom
mic under my lamp in case you want to
talk in a party chat while playing one
of the systems or simply use it to
listen to TV audio without disrupting
anyone else I make I use those all the
time when I'm recording and while it may
not be tech per se we also have a little
fun section that holds our nerf guns and
a secret chest with tons of Pokemon
cards and decks yes people we are adults
but that about wraps it up for my
ultimate living room setup guys any
setup I have will always be a work in
progress so I definitely plan to add
more text to this area as time goes on
and when it's ready I'll have a 2.0
video for you guys if you guys have any
awesome recommendations to further tech
out this living room definitely leave me
a comment down below and while you're
down there be the cool guy that gives
this video a thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next video till then
it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
