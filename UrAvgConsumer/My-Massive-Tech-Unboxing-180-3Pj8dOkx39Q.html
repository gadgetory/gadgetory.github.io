consumer and today we have got another
massive tech unboxing this is number 18
we're getting close to 20 L but you know
the deal grab your snacks grab your
drinks let's chill cuz we got em ed
boxes today IRAs gone as always so Jay
my man pick something this guy right
here okay this is from the peel box so
let's see what we got
alright so this looks like a pair of
truly wireless earbuds okay so these
aren't just truly wireless earbuds these
are actually meant to boost your hearing
I actually did a video on a similar
product not too long ago actually a few
years ago actually on the very first
massive tech unboxing ever I think I
covered them these are supposed to be
able to boost your hearing you're
supposed to be able to control what you
hear around you so I guess maybe it
because this could be useful for those
who may be hard of hearing and it of
course still plays music and all that
stuff so that's kind of cool so here we
have them right here this is the left
and here we have the right these are the
new Hera like new era new era so that's
kind of cool
boost your hearing listen to music I
have them linked down below and it came
with a bottle I'll take it all right
Malcolm you want to pick one man
you know what's in here let's see this
is from Gamestop what is in here oh I
think I know what this is uh oh yeah
okay we got the pokeball plus if not the
let's go easy or let's go Pikachu but
it's a pokeball plus yeah so we actually
already got these but I guess I ordered
an extra my mistake you already know I
know what this is this box it's very
familiar Xbox another controller to add
to the collection let's see Oh see this
is for pub G oho this is a nice looking
controller oh that's clean
ding yo guys this is nice
ok Xbox I see you again okay we got some
earbuds some Bluetooth earbuds this is
from Optima this is the Beast or or B
life or B life - okay this is not an
easy box to open so it's just gonna get
messed up that is a clean earbud hold up
I love the color scheme this is really
really nice-looking the gold and the
blue so these are supposed to go around
your neck and your ears like this nice
so we got to see how these sound of
course but in the looks department not
bad it's a pretty big remote though ah
micro USB alright but it also comes with
a travel case so that's cool and it
comes with other ear tips and I'm
guessing maybe some wing tips alright so
I'll have them all linked down below in
the description so if you guys want to
learn a bit more about them I'll have it
down below
whole and Xbox one next you say ding a
whole new Xbox 1x
oh no what's this fallout 76 ain't mad
at that we got some Xbox branded fallout
76 shorts and there's more folks
oh not guys what's that say you read
that yeah we can super baby alright so
there's another one though is this one
for no it's your average consumer I just
got two old one and we got more shorts
are these arm sleeves
yeah I'm not supposed to go play ball
with these we got a Jersey over here
again the average consumer seventy six
more shorts yeah the whole team the
whole team can have it so it's like what
two on two no matter no matter what
though the average consumer wins and we
got some more on arm sleeves so I guess
one arm sleeve for each person that's
cool and we got a little flashlight okay
I guess this thing was on the whole time
though cuz it seems like half dead oh so
this is to celebrate the collaboration
between fallout 76 Xbox and the
Philadelphia 76ers thus the basketball
gear oh there's a controller we're at oh
good I now come you guys see this
can I just say again that Xbox has the
best packages ever look at this
it's a parcel guys Cho it's more
clothing I've got so much clothes to
wear in the house and is this a hoodie
all right all right I got a swap the
hoodie yo Pete the veggie toto
so here we have it y'all then you hoodie
this is nice I cannot complain where's
the controller though so we just had a
Eureka moment the control is probably in
the box with the Xbox that makes sense
it says your average consumer 76 over
here that was the first clue oho nice
check that out guys and of course the
76ers logo Philly stand up I went to
college in Philly in Drexel University
go dragons this is hot I wonder if the
Xbox looks any different though oh it
does Jane they went all out to fall out
look at this Scott and this is your
average Prince that's nice that's real
nice
oh man okay this wow wow Xbox come on
you spoiling me man
this is nice oh wow okay whoo okay
that's a lot of Fallout right there
man that is that is epic
oh-ho yes for that smash though have to
have the GameCube controller now I used
to play smash when it first came out on
the n64 and you you you know you just
follow smash wherever it goes you get
whatever console it comes out on and so
many of us played it on the Gamecube I'm
very happy that they brought it back for
smash ultimate ah all right I got two of
them I'm ready folks
yo when smash
I'm taking on all challengers psyche now
I'm not that great Oh Malcolm is brave
so take on the whole the whole internet
wear the jersey while you do this with
the peel box I'm guessing this is from
the peel box this is the dive loom so
there's a smart pixel our Bluetooth
speaker interesting oh this is this is
this is cute this is cute this is a
little TV like an old-school TV other
power buttons in the back check this out
so now I wants me to pair it up I
actually really like this look at all
the different things that it can do on
screen with this little dial right here
you can just turn it and it does all
kinds of stuff
it doesn't feel cheap either I wonder
how much this costs I'll throw the judge
says I'll find the link to this and then
we'll find out how much it cost but it
is a Bluetooth speaker with some pixel
art in the front all right so I'm
personally excited for this guy right
here this is for like work stuff but I'm
excited nonetheless I hit you with that
did I okay okay no workers comp over
here and I just messed I'll just mess it
so this guy is the sony fs7 the camera i
already shoot with but i am in love with
that camera and we needed another one we
have some videographers on the team now
and we need multiple people to shoot at
the same time so we had to get another
one
all right I'm not gonna do a full on and
a boxing of this because I know a lot of
you don't care but if you want to see a
brand new fs7 this is not the series to
is the first one who here it is nice and
clean I didn't get the second one cause
it's $2,000 more and it's just a couple
of body upgrades not worth it to me so
this guy right here
oh I am happy to
yeah nah welcome to the team haha ho-ho
and Xbox one s with a 2k nineteen
bundled yo so this is a is this a
special Xbox one s now it's a standard
one but it has NBA 2k the full game
bundles inside and this is a one
terabyte version I don't need all these
X boxes so I'm gonna give this one away
to one of you guys so whoever wants to
get their hands on Xbox one s or get a
chance at getting one head on over to my
Instagram page I'm gonna have a post on
this guy I'm gonna be giving it away
Microsoft thank you for hooking me up
with this and potentially someone else
to k-19 yeah it feels like early
Christmas I'm not gonna lie one more for
the peel box interesting so this is one
of those keypads that you have like one
hand resting on and you have your mouse
so that you can you know play your games
mouth looks cool pretty standard Mouse
two buttons on the sides click you up
front and this guy so here it is this is
basically like half a keyboard then you
know that I guess that makes sense you
only really use half of the keyboard
when you're gaming since you've got the
other half on your mouse and I believe
it comes with a wrist rest as well oh
that's nice you can adjust it exactly
how you want cool and then you are then
you're off it has a dongle so you can
plug this into the computer and it also
has a USB for the mouse so I'm reading
the card that came with the guys and
this keyboard and mouse set allows you
to use this with any console
so that's PlayStation 4 Xbox even the
Nintendo switches says then their thing
is perfect for anything from call of
duty to fortnight
I'm gonna have to test that out with the
switch now my interest is piqued I
definitely want to try that out thumbs
up if you want to see me test that with
a switch the c64 mini oh so now look at
this they got pop rocks there's supposed
to be something old-school huh
this is definitely old-school Wow 64
games included games from where oh these
are like really old school check this
out look at the back guys
so just plugs into your TV with HDMI and
you're able to play with this little
joystick over here but this is crazy the
world's best-selling home computer
reborn the c64 was that a home computer
I guess I'm too young but that's
interesting
I'm gonna take these pop rocks though
let's see this is from B&amp;amp;H I ordered a
couple of things from being here I think
this is I think I know this is yes my
new lens actually bought this lens
before and then I unfortunately broke it
when I dropped the camera the other day
shame on me so I had to replace it this
is the sony 10 to 18 really wide angle
alright last but not least guys we have
this big old box over here I have no
idea what this is
Oh from one-plus not a bad thing to end
off with and I have a feeling I know
what this is but this backpack hold on
oh no no I love me a good backpack this
looks nice but the main attraction here
you guys I know that not everybody's
crazy about backpacks like I am the main
attraction here guys is this alright
here we go let's unbox this bad boy and
let me introduce you guys to the oneplus
60 in thunder purple check that out get
these stickers off for you that's nice
kind of reminds me of the Apple find X
just a little bit but not not too much
this is definitely different but it
looks nice guys this is really nice it's
a really good phone and it is nice to
see them come out with new colors all
the time so shout out to one plus four
sending this over shout out to every
company who sent something to be
featured in this video big shots of Xbox
for sending over so many things and that
Xbox one s that we're going to be giving
away to one of you guys and I'm gonna
catch you guys in the next one so then
it's your average consumer piece alright
everybody
