what's going on guys to Travers consumer
and today we're gonna be taking a look
at my favorite tech of the month for the
month of May and for my favorite tech of
the month videos I pretty much go over
the tech that I've been personally using
for the past month whether it's old or
new but Before we jump into the list we
got to give a shout out to today's
sponsor very desk so check this out guys
this is something that's gonna help
those of you out there who spend a ton
of time sitting at a desk now I'm sure
you've heard of a standing desk before
and the very desk brings that kind of
functionality to you without having to
get a new desk entirely it's super
simple to take it from a sitting
position to a standing one without one
ounce of assembly it comes ready to go
right out of the box so there's
literally no work involved in getting
this guy going beyond getting it on your
desk
this thing's super smooth and it comes
in a variety of options if you want to
match your desk and it also has
accessories to make the overall
experience
better than your standard desk if you
guys want to learn more about it of
course have links down below in the
description for you to check out
but again huge shout out to varied us
for sponsoring today's video but now on
to the tech that I've been enjoying and
the first one we've got right here is
the Astro c40 a Playstation 4 and PC
controller now this guy right here is
one of the newest things that I've
gotten my hands on and I love everything
that it represents this is pretty much a
high-end PlayStation 4 controller that's
also customizable so when you pick this
up you actually get an accessory kit and
inside of this case you have access to a
couple of tools so that you can switch
up the feel of the controller so inside
the case you get this pretty much like a
hex key where you can unscrew the little
bolts that they have over here and once
you do that you can pretty much take off
this faceplate and switch up the feel of
your controller so you can take out the
joysticks over here the d-pad even and
place them pretty much wherever you'd
like so you can get some crazy
combinations and I actually found this
to be a really really useful feature now
as some of you may know this is the
standard layout for a Playstation 4 but
I've been playing a ton of Apex legends
on my xbox so I've gotten really used to
the layout of the Xbox one controller
and with this guy right here I can jump
on apex
the ps4 and not skip a beat I can get
this to fit the exact Xbox layout that
I've been using just by switching them
out one thing I will mention though guys
the feel in the hand is a bit different
from your standard ps4 controller
because if you just look at this ps4
controllers a lot slimmer than this guy
so it will take some getting used to but
if you happen to be used to bigger
controllers like an Xbox one you'll be
just fine
not a huge learning curve or anything
but it is different you also have these
extra buttons here in the back so you of
course have your standard triggers up
here but you get some extra ones back
here and this is actually pretty useful
if you want to map certain buttons to
these two buttons at the back here now
one of the reasons why I love these back
controller buttons is because instead of
having to access the d-pad I can just
hit a button and get my menus open and
this is really great because now I don't
have to get off of my analog stick I can
just keep moving and open my menus
without skipping a beat you also get
user profiles so if I'm not playing apex
legends anymore and I want to switch it
out to something else so that I'm not
accidentally hitting any buttons I don't
want to just a little switch like that
and I'm ready to play but overall I am
liking this thing it is gonna take a
little getting used to having a bigger
controller for the ps4 but so far
Astro really knocked this one out of the
park now if you guys know me even though
I was gonna have this one on the list
right here we've got the power beats Pro
isn't that like I'm proposing these are
great options for people who can't use
air pods like myself these have an
in-ear design so they can go over the
ear with the hook and with the little
piece right here they go inside of the
ear and boom right here you have earbuds
that will stay in place and they sound
good but they've also got some cool
features these have the Apple h1 chip
and pretty what that means is you're
gonna have a really easy and simple
pairing process when you want to hook
these up to your iPhone or any other iOS
device and it'll work with other devices
as well but you'll have to pair it like
a normal pair of bluetooth headphones
the h1 chip also allows for you to
activate Siri by just calling out to it
and not having to hold down any buttons
now I can just say things like set
volume to 50% and then you guys can see
right here it automatically sets the
volume after I gave it the command and I
can also tell it to play music so play
some Drake some more life you know so
those are the kind of things that really
change up the game not having to touch
your phone at all but still give it
commands that is awesome now what I also
like about these is that these have
amazing battery life so you get about
nine hours on a single charge and with
the charging case you get an additional
15 hours now of course the most
important part is the sound quality now
I love the sound that you get out of
these they've got a little bit of bass
to them
nothing super crazy but definitely a lot
more dynamic than something like the air
pods even the galaxy buds which I really
liked the sound a lot better than them
they sound great they're pretty good in
terms of the comfort they stay on your
ears you do get some ear fatigue after
using them for a long period of time so
there's my warning there for me I can
listen to these for about an hour before
I start feeling like I need a bit of a
break from them so that's something to
keep in mind but these are definitely a
step up
they're 250 bucks so they're very pricey
but you do get what you pay for and I
think these are really high quality so
next up guys we've got a bit of a wild
card we've got the side by side power
Packer so this is actually something
that was sent to me through a massive
tech unboxing got it from my peel box so
I had no idea this existed until I got
it in that video but this thing has been
surprisingly clutch and I've been
carrying it around ever since I got my
hands on it so pretty much what this is
it's a tech accessory and cable
organizer it's called the power Packer
because you of course would want to put
like things like chargers inside of here
and that's what really sold me I usually
carry around a bunch of chargers in my
backpack they take up a lot of space but
now I can have them inside of here and
not have them take up a bunch of room
inside of my back
I can actually keep all of this stuff
inside of here and if you have a bunch
of cables in your backpack
you know the feeling it's nice to have
them put all in one spot but what's cool
about this is that it's not limited to
just holding cables you can actually
hold other things like USB dongles you
can even throw in some SD cards you can
put in whatever it will fit and this
thing actually has a pretty stretchy
exterior so even if something is a
little bit on the larger side this thing
offers a lot of give so that it could
accommodate that it goes for about 40
bucks you find it on Amazon for like 30
something I'll have it linked down below
in the description but this is
definitely worth it and easily made its
way inside of my gadget backpack and
last but not least guys we've got the 1
plus 7 Pro now I have fallen in love
with this phone thanks to its form
factor this thing's got I practically
bezel this display running at 90 Hertz
and basically what that means is it's a
very very smooth experience so swiping
through different apps and just using
the menu everything it's just buttery
smooth now might not be as smooth as
with a 120 Hertz we've seen on other
phones but 90 Hertz is definitely a
step-up compared to other smartphones
out there and there's just something
about being able to play a game and have
it take up the full face of the phone
that's just an experience that you don't
really get anywhere else we're all used
to seeing notches nowadays and this is a
really nice change of pace and
especially when game can take advantage
of that 90 Hertz everything just looks a
lot smoother and of course watching
content changes the game but not only
that this phone has other cool features
so of course the front-facing camera is
a pop-out camera so I can just do this
and you guys can see it say what's up
Jay okay so you got that front facing
camera that pops out I like using that
for unlocking my device even though some
people are worried about the mechanism
giving out there's no way if you have
this phone you want to use this thing
but the reason is to get this phone
doesn't just stop at having a nice
display and pretty decent cameras but
also the fact that this thing just
overall
forms very well this is a very very fast
phone so I think s 600 and what is a 70
or 80 bucks this is a really really good
value even though it's a bit higher
compared to what they usually charge but
the one plus seven pro man this is just
a really fun phone to use but that about
wraps up for this video guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy or girl that gives it a thumbs up
I'm gonna catch you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
