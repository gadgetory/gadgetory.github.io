consumer and today I'm gonna be doing an
unboxing for you guys of the Nexus 10 so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it alright guys here we have the
Nexus 10 I am very excited to finally
have my hands on this thing it's the
talk of the Android world right now as
well as the Nexus 4 but this is a big
deal because it's got a monstrous
resolution and what that means is that
the screen should look really clear in
hi-def it should have some really sharp
images so it should look really really
crisp and clear so we're gonna really
looking forward to testing it out the
box is pretty standard if you see in the
Nexus 7 box this is just like it it's
pretty plain and yeah I'm not talking
let's get right into the unboxing flip
this thing off first and put this to the
side now I believe there's some tape on
the two sides so I'm gonna be using my
unboxing knife alright so now let's pop
this open and thankfully this isn't as
bad as the Nexus 7 to open up got a
little debris up here so we get that
cleaned off of course we have the Nexus
10 alright pretty nice but let's put
this to the side and see what else we
get in the box so we open this little
flap and of course you're gonna have
your USB cable and just uses a micro USB
so that's what we have here and got two
little pamphlets warranty information
and a Quick Start Guide and
course you've got your adapter can give
you guys a quick close-up of the adapter
alright guys and here's the adapter for
the nexus 10 and of course it's a
Samsung one and this is a Samsung device
and here you have the what's cool with
this adapter is that it has this little
part so that you can switch it up if you
live in a different country you can get
the right input in here and pretty much
this is it alright so now that we've got
these two things out of the way now like
Google very minimalist not too much to
get into way getting to your device so
this side now let's unravel this plastic
here and let's see is pretty simple to
get off this is a bit dirty I must say
but take off this little screen
protector and there we have it this is
the Nexus 10 and I must say this is a
very grippy feel in the back here I
don't see the slipping out of anyone's
hands too easily and um it's very nice I
actually really like this I'm gonna give
you guys a quick close-up what I'm
seeing here and all right guys here we
have the Nexus 10 up front here we have
a 1.9 megapixel front facing camera of
course the screen is 10 inches on the
sides we have the 2 stereo speaker
grilles and taking a closer look on the
sides and here you'll see the micro USB
port the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
at the top you'll find the power switch
as well as your volume rocker and here's
where you have your mini HDMI out so you
can connect the mini HDMI cable there to
plug it to your TV and here you have
your I guess this is where that you
would put your dock or I don't know what
assessories that Google plans to come
out with for this so this is where that
would be and also here on the back
you'll find the 5 mega pick
rear camera as well as LED flash and you
can kind of get a sense of what this
some back is field and feels like as you
can see here it's like a little
rubberized if some very smooth kind of
reminds me of the Nexus 7 over here is
where it really looks feels like the
Nexus 7 but it's got that smooth back
and um yeah that's it for this close-up
let's power it on hit that power switch
over here and of course it says google
the nexus symbol alright that was a
pretty quick boot of course it wants me
to do English so I'll hit start connect
to my Wi-Fi and what was pretty cool
just now you guys didn't see that but it
automatically signed me in because I hit
that option when ordering it so it
already synced my Google account to here
so it kind of prompted me to just throw
in my password and I was able to do that
which is really cool you can select that
option when purchasing it and for the
purpose of this video I'm going to just
keep this tablet backed up and move
forward oh my Google knowing where I am
and all right so here we have my Google
Play library swiping through this is
pretty fast so that's nice and I'm let
me get a close look
the resolution really does look great
you can get a closer look here yeah guys
this this resolution and the screen is
topknot so I'm very impressed so far um
let's see if I can get this to be a
little brighter there we go
but that's about it for this unboxing
guys just wanted to show you real quick
what you get in the box how it looks up
close and how it feels overall I'm
pretty impressed on this can't wait to
give this a real go and see what it's
capable of doing and alright guys that
pretty much wraps up this unboxing if
you enjoyed this video please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then see I was consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
