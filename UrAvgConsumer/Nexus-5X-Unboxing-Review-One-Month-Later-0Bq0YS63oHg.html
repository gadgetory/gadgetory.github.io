much that Google had to go and make
another one this is the Nexus 5x so
first let's unbox this thing and see
what you get when you pick this guy up
first thing you're greeted with is a
card that shows you everything you get
inside and what to do with it
move past that and you'll find all your
typical accessories however this time
around we've got a USB type-c cable and
this cable is awesome because it's
completely reversible gives you faster
data transfer speeds and most
importantly allows you to charge your
phone faster and with that we've got a
wall adapter which you'll notice is
sporting the USB type-c port you
definitely want to make sure you don't
lose these we've also got a small packet
that houses the sim removal tool as well
as the paperwork that you know you won't
read but onto the main attraction the
Nexus 5x
after removing the rapid came in the
first thing I noticed was how light this
thing is the feel in the hand is very
similar to that of the original Nexus 5
it has a soft touch back which feels
pretty good but just like the original
Nexus 5 the soft touch back will show
where over time as you can see here if
this is something that bothers you I
definitely suggest getting a case or
skin to go with it and even though this
thing has a 5.2 inch display it doesn't
feel large at all and that's great for
everyday things like storing it away in
your pocket using it to talk on the
phone texting and whatever else you plan
to do with it and speaking of the
display we're working with a 1080p
screen and unlike the Nexus 6p which has
an AMOLED display the 5x is rocking LCD
now this translates to a slightly less
vibrant display but honestly with
day-to-day use it'll be just fine and
I've been able to watch movies with no
problem but if you go ahead and compare
it side-by-side to an AMOLED display
you'll most likely see the difference
now taking a look around the rest of the
device shows us that we've got a few
buttons on the right side on top you'll
find the power button and below it the
volume controls below the phone you'll
find a headphone jack and the USB type-c
port and up front we've got a five
megapixel front facing camera and what
looks like stereo speakers but there's
actually only one at the bottom
I gotta admit I'm a bit disappointed
considering it looks like there are
stereo speakers and I think every
smartphone today should have
front-facing stereo speakers and sadly
this doesn't moving on to the back we've
got that nice big Nexus logo and a 12
megapixel camera as well as that
fingerprint scanner the fingerprint
scanner was actually really easy to set
up and I'm a fan of its placement on the
back of the phone you won't be able to
use it when it's resting down on the
surface but that's not a big deal to me
it's very quick and I love that I can
turn the phone on and unlock it without
even having to hit any buttons and after
a while it becomes instinctive to just
go and reach for the back of the phone
and I found myself doing that to other
phones that didn't even have the feature
now we've covered the hardware but what
about the software these guys running
Android 6.0 marshmallow and as a Nexus
device this thing is running stock
Android so we're getting the cleanest
experience Google has to offer and of
course since this is a Nexus device it's
one of Google's flagship phones you're
going to get access to all the updates
as soon as they're available it's a
solid performer in the $400 price range
and the lack of useless add-ons from
carriers and manufacturers helps to keep
it clean and running smoothly Google did
introduce a few notable features with
marshmallows such as now on tap which
scans your screen and pulls up
information based on texts available
this kind of feature is great if someone
mentions something you're unfamiliar
with and you quickly want to look it up
and while it's definitely a cool feature
it's kind of hit or miss but when it
does work it's pretty awesome because
you can pull up actors artists
restaurants and of course more and it'll
spit things back like a normal Google
search Twitter Facebook or Instagram
accounts news and tons of other options
this is definitely going to be a really
solid feature once it grows a bit more
and the second notable feature is those
now the Nexus 5 has decent battery life
it'll probably get you through the day
depending on how heavy of the user you
are but that's probably because of the
extra help you're getting from the doze
feature now what those does is it
actually uses the sensors within the
phone and when you put it down it'll
actually recognize that you're not using
it it'll turn the phone into like a
hibernation state which will decrease
the amount of refreshes that
applications will go through and with
that you're able to
actually save on some battery life and
when you go to pick it up or use it it's
actually gonna take off those and you're
gonna have everything running as normal
definitely an awesome feature for those
who aren't power users people who just
casually take the phone and use it every
once in a while this is going to be
awesome because you're going to get that
awesome standby time now of course we've
got to talk about the camera quality the
5x is actually sporting the same exact
camera as the Nexus 6p which actually
turned out to be a pretty decent shooter
and cameras have always been a spot that
the Nexus phones have struggled with so
it's good to see some improvements here
the quality has been pretty on point and
I found that in low-light the shots tend
to be a big on the grainy side but when
you throw an HDR plus it is like night
and day or night and better night but
either way it's a better version with
HDR plus I definitely saw a huge
difference when using that so overall
it's a pretty solid performer I wouldn't
expect to see galaxy note5 kind of
quality or LG g4 but with this you're
gonna get some decent shots and
considering this is a $400 phone you
can't be upset
I feel like that's the overall theme of
the Nexus 5x it's not a crazy powerhouse
like the Galaxy Note 5 but you're
getting a way more budget-friendly
option that starts at 379 and
considering it's a Nexus device you've
got a smooth very fluid experience and
while the battery life and the camera
may not be top-notch
it's still very good for its price range
I can't imagine anybody being upset with
it unless they come from one of those
powerhouse phones but that's about it
for this review guys hopefully enjoyed
it the Nexus 5x gets my recommendation
if you're looking for something that's
budget-friendly and just works well but
hopefully I'll catch you guys in the
next video till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
