a lot of questions about whether it's
worth it or not to pick up a gaming
headset if you already own a pair of
regular headphones and while I feel like
I kind of know the answer to this I
figured it'd be a pretty cool idea to
get the opinions of a few more people so
we're going to see what five different
people have to say and some of them you
might know oh god oh why are you doing
this
this is not a very easy game oh man not
like any of these oh just kidding we'll
have to go holy meme oh yeah so here's
what they did they each played a
different game first with a general pair
of headphones I decided we use the
v-moda m100
not only because they have awesome sound
quality but because they also sell a
boom mic for gamers which would be
perfect for this test so then we switch
throughout the m-104 the a 50s and went
back to the em 100 after using it and
their reactions to trying out the 850
for the first time it's pretty telling
first of all interesting oh wow I didn't
hear that before let me have the menu
the car running that's interesting oh I
hear her dying I didn't hear that before
like in I'm looking to be here going
like ah I didn't hear that you there's
like a heartbeat sound when you're
inside this capsule
I didn't notice that's the first time
they can instantly tell the difference
and there's actually a pretty common
theme well uh stepping is not weak
clearance to me no but I hear a little
more tinny voices with the be announced
just talking which actually makes them a
little clearer and you do to hear I hear
more sounds clearer to me like I hear
the I definitely heard the crowd better
and the impact better and I hear the
water droplets here I didn't hear no
before look at that yeah I will do that
though I can hear the snow falling more
heavily than I do before it definitely
sounds like really really clean
so things like everyone was able to pick
up on the smaller sound effects and the
details of their environment with the a
50s like snowfall raindrops on thumbs
and footsteps they also felt like they
had a more immersive experience ah thank
you I mean it was like super easy like
honestly no no oh my god she's like
they're actually shooting angry Joe stop
I definitely feel like I'm there more
than I did with the other pair
headphones oh just because of the way it
sounds um like you it feels more really
as it's rating actually says I got in
the game it just felt way more realistic
and just make symptoms a lot of gaming
headsets nowadays are designed to make
sure you get locked in the sauce of
everything we feature is like virtual
surround sound 3d audio it's easier to
feel like you're a part of the game and
kind of know what's going on around you
harsh like a whistle in I hear huh you
know you can like tell how far away the
people on your team are because you can
you can tell they're like running up to
the side of you and I think it's these
kind of features that enhance the
overall gaming experience compared to a
regular pair of headphones since they
don't have these features as they
weren't built for gaming bad shows that
was actually in the game like when I
died in this I just died but when I was
in the a shows area
hey but the general consensus around the
players who didn't have as much gaming
experience was that they couldn't tell
that much of a difference um it's not
that much that much of a difference to
me I could hear the sounds like the
engine is clearer I heard like so slight
like effects of the rain drops and stuff
and in the crowd at the side but it's
not that big of a difference I don't
really hear much of a difference to be
honest if I weren't listening for I
wouldn't notice this could be because
they have less gaming experience and
aren't looking for sounds that can
possibly give them an advantage or it
could be a coincidence
I will say that in 2k the main
difference you're hearing between these
two headphones is just in the different
drivers different sound quality I have a
feeling that in a more immersive game
like a driving game a shooter something
where there's things to the left and
right of you and behind you you can
actually take advantage of something
like surround sound you're hearing more
things with these these are a little bit
flatter a little closer to music
listening and that's basically it I
thought they were very good husbands but
see other ones the blue ones I had on
we're slightly louder like the little
effects of different jobs I would hear
better in the gaming headset with games
like this we're getting to the point
where graphics aren't getting that much
better they're just at such a peak level
so now the way to really bring you into
a game is the sound to feel like it and
when a game has a great sound like this
it it really makes a big difference okay
so I make a point if I were to game
definitely want to use the gaming
headset because I'm sure if I really the
game I'd want to hear all those the
speaks masters you go out and buy a
gaming headset I think if you're a
hardcore gamer or someone who wants an
all-in experience absolutely but like
with most things in the tech world if
you don't know there's a higher quality
version out there you're probably going
to get along just fine with what you
have
so like I said the gaming headset is a
nice bonus offer some really cool
features depending on which one you get
not to mention most headphones don't
come with that boom mic options like the
V motive but they do have like usually
those inline remotes with the mic
included pretty good for answering calls
and having a phone conversation but
might not be up to snuff for an actual
gamer but I think that about wraps it up
guys hopefully you enjoyed this video
huge shout out to everyone who
participated in this little test and
I'll catch you guys in the next one if
you enjoyed it be the cool guy girl like
this video thumbs up I'll see you then
peace I'm hearing the announces almost
behind me that's loud
the crowd is loud you want to know that
yeah so let's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
