consumer and as some of you may know I
recently purchased the house that little
by little I've been checking out to make
it the ultimate smart home and some of
the first things I decided to add to the
house besides our internet and routers
of course is some entertainment you guys
might have seen that I set up my
basement not so long ago so
entertainment is definitely my priority
right now and one cool piece of tech
that I added to the house recently was
the Sony HT z 9f Dolby Atmos sound bar
and here you'll see I went all-in with
the Sony 65 inch X 900 ft v to go with
the sound bar so when Sony reached out
to sponsor a video I'm not gonna lie
guys I was pretty high you guys know
I've been a huge fan of Sony audio for
the years that I've been covering them
on the channel bit of a fanboy it was
great about the sound bar is that it'll
work no matter how big or small your
living space is and that's tanks or a
vertical surround engine inside of this
guy basically the vertical surround
engine lets you experience Dolby Atmos
and DTS X without having to have those
top speakers that we usually see in
Dolby Atmos sound bars like some of the
ones that I've talked about on the
channel before and for my folks out
there who aren't familiar with Dolby
Atmos surround sound
what it is is pretty much you get a
surround sound set up or you get great
audio in front of you and of course some
audio in the back while also being able
to hear audio above you so you get that
full surround sound feeling so that you
can feel really immersed into whatever
you're watching
so with this sound bar in particular
you've got three speakers up front which
can intelligently reproduce vertical
sound allowing for a virtual surround
sound that fills the room and seemingly
comes from all different directions
around you and pretty mind-boggling that
three speakers in front of you facing
you can make you sound like things are
going above you but where there's
advantages in this kind of technology is
that one it brings down some of the cost
because you don't have those extra
speakers and it also helps to slim down
the profile of the sound bar that you're
listening to now sony also sent over
some wireless rear speakers which i
placed on the side tables and you don't
need to accompany the sound bar with
these but it does allow for a complete
5.1 surround sound experience if you
want to use the sound bar setup in like
a family room or a mancave you can
discreetly hide the rear speakers on the
wall
you can always mount them if you don't
want them to be in
way now these little speakers are
optional but if you plan on picking up
the soundbar I highly highly recommend
picking these up as well they really
just complete the whole experience along
with the subwoofer these four pieces can
create some amazing sound that sub is
actually really powerful I know I'm
gonna get a ton of complaints from Airy
the more I listen to this thing but
yellow now I think one of the best
experiences that I had with the sound
bar was actually just setting it up
honestly I just plugged everything in
and it's somehow connected without me
having to jump into any settings it all
works automatically which is something I
can definitely appreciate setting up
sound bars and external speakers and
subwoofers it can get cumbersome and
really annoying but being able to do it
wirelessly without having to touch
anything
amazing now everything having a nice
form factor and being easy to set up is
great and all but what really matters is
how it sounds I'm telling you guys this
sound bar sounds amazing
and don't just take my word for it I had
some of the guys come over and try out
themselves so that they can experience
what it sounds like and these were their
reactions
needless to say they were impressed the
sound quality is just there guys but not
only does it have a good sound it also
has a couple of smart features as well
it has a built-in chromecast so if you
want to cast anything from your phone
you can just send it over straight to
the TV and not only that it has
connections to Spotify it also is a
Bluetooth speaker so you can always send
your music straight to it so we can use
this as a listening device so it has a
lot of functionality beyond being just a
standard regular TV sound bar it also
has a couple of other special features
like designated sound profiles so if
you're watching a movie listening to
music or gaming maybe even watching the
news or a sports game you guys can enjoy
all those different sound profiles as
they are finely tuned to whatever it is
that you're doing but all-in-all guys if
you're looking for a Dolby Atmos
surround sound experience at a good
value where you're not having a ton of
speakers all over your room this is
definitely something you're gonna want
to look into this would make a great
gift for anybody who loves watching
content on a big screen because you get
to have that big great sound to go with
it and I think I can pretty confidently
say that Sony's headphones have always
done right by me in terms of audio
quality and their sound bar seems to be
doing the same but that about wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you're looking for a good
sound bar definitely check this one out
but if you enjoyed the video be the cool
guy girl that gives this video a thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one so then it's your average consumer
