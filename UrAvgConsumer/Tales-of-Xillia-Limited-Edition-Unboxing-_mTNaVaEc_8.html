consumer and I know right now the ps4 is
all the rage but there are still some
games on the ps3 that are worth
mentioning and today I'm going to be
doing an unboxing of tales of Xillia the
special edition or a limited edition and
I want to pick this up because I'm a
huge RPG fan and I know a couple of you
guys are RPG fans as well and my
ultimate room tour a ton of you wanted
me to get into more gaming so I decided
I'll do that and I'm not sure if I'm
going to branch off into another channel
or maybe just have a segment here on the
your average consumer channel but for
today I'm gonna be doing unboxing of
this I'm definitely a huge RPG fan so
you guys will probably see a lot of RPGs
coming from me as well as some other
games and hey let's not wasting any time
let's get right into it alright guys
here we have tales of Xillia these are
from the same guys who have made Tales
of Symphonia tales of Grey's tales of
Vesperia tons of Tales games out there
I'm a huge RPG fan and I do like this
series um if they're if it's not final
fantasy for me it's this
so really glad I picked this up this is
the limited edition and I believe it
comes with a soundtrack so that's what's
special about this one so it's got the
music CD it's got some DLC vouchers
character book the game so that's what's
inside here and I believe I paid 60
bucks for this but I've seen it in
Walmart for 40 now so they must have had
a price drop so you can pick this up for
40 bucks
pretty cool stuff and I've heard some
pretty good things about this but enough
of that let's open this thing up let's
see here I can just pop this open and
you know I'm gonna just use my hand
boxing knife just to make it easier hate
having to like grab a small piece of
these little plastics on the games and
try and rip them open so the unboxing
knife helps now I don't do like I don't
really do like limited editions often or
ever really but I really do like this
series I'm I'm a big fan of it so I
forget why not and it was the same price
as a regular game so let me show you
guys what we get inside so you pop it
open and let's see here we've got a
couple of stuff here nothing else in the
box so you can put that over here so
here we have the music CD up top so
tales of Xillia music CD I don't know
what the soundtrack is like on this but
it seems like it has twenty twelve songs
so that's pretty cool so put that here
and we have a character book so there
was that and I think this has some
pretty cool looking character so can't
wait to try it all out and of course we
have the game itself so let's see what
we have inside again with the plastic so
pop that here and there we have it so
this is the game of course you got some
only get one little coat here and I'm
guessing that this is all you get
because you have this character booklet
this large character booklet so I'm
guessing that's why there's nothing else
inside well I don't think there'd be
much to this video if I didn't show you
guys a little gameplay footage so here
we go the tale series is very much a
JRPG but it doesn't come with your
typical turn-based combat system the
action here is more real-time and
although I love turn-based battle this
is a nice way to shake things up tales
games typically have a great and long
story so for those of you who enjoy a
long adventure with beautiful scenery
this is definitely for you these games
are always filled with vibrant colors
and typically provide that feel-good
feeling and I'm not sure the ins and
outs of Xillia yet but if it's anything
like its predecessors I know I'm in for
a long and pretty good adventure but I
did want to show you guys this kind of
game because I'm really a huge fan of
the series tales of Xillia is one of the
latest in the series the Tales games are
really really nice so if you're into
RPGs definitely try this
I just finished beating tales of grace
so that was a really nice one as well so
lots of good stuff here guys just wanted
to show you this quick unboxing is the
15th anniversary so this is
cool stuff but before we end out this
