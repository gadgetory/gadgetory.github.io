consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the bear dynamic custom one
pros now you guys have been asking for
this one for it quite some time now so I
finally got my hands on them and here
they are for the review so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
all right guys here we have the bear
dynamic custom one Pro and the custom
part is no joke these are a pair of
headphones that let you customize just
about everything on them beer dynamic
has a pretty good rep when it comes to
audio but let's see if this is worth
your money first let's talk about the
overall design these come in a black or
white variant and as you can see here
they also have some nice red accents it
features an over ear design so it has
fairly large ear cups at first I was a
little surprised and unsure about the
size but I got used to it pretty quickly
while there are nice to look at right
out of the box what I really like about
the custom one pros are its ability to
change its looks many of its parts are
designed to be changed depending on the
look you're going for this is where that
custom part in the name comes in the
plates on the aircraft are changeable by
using the included L key you find in the
box when you purchase a pair you simply
remove the ring holder which are also
customizable and you change the plate to
one of your choice
also changeable are the ear cup cushions
you can simply pull them off and replace
them and the same goes for the headband
the headband cushion uses velcro to stay
straps at a metal band underneath and by
simply pulling it apart you can
customize this as well by the time you
are done you can completely change the
look of your headphones from the
original design to one of your own
creation as you can see here I went from
a mostly white design tool white and
gray if you know me you know I love
having options and the custom one pros
definitely provide that as far as build
quality goes these don't disappoint
they're solidly built with some plastic
parts and a metal frame holding it all
together and it actually comes out to be
pretty lightweight the metal band is
durable so you don't have to worry about
any accidental bends or twists and one
might think such easily replaceable
materials might feel cheap or
quality but it's actually quite the
opposite the materials feel good in the
hand and when worn and the headphones
and ear cup cushions are very soft and
combined with the light weight and over
ear design I find that you can wear
these for hours on end without any
comfort issues they're actually barely
noticeable went on aside from having a
completely customizable design another
awesome feature is the customizable
sound and yes I said customizable sound
the custom one pros feature custom sound
sliders on each ear cup and this allows
you to change the bass response on each
side
there are four levels of bass so
depending on your sound preference or
the song you're listening to you can
switch those around so jumping from
classical to hip-hop is completely
feasible here the custom ones are able
to accomplish this by having adjustable
vents within the housing and another
perk of these vents aside from base
adjustment is being able to isolate more
ambient noise the more closed they are
the custom ones come with a standard
tangle free a detachable cable and they
also have an option with a boom mic for
those of you who want to use it for
gaming or voice chat now of course let's
talk about the sound quality I found the
sound to be very rich and full of detail
when using the base lighter the sound
changes are pretty apparent from level 1
to 4 at level 1 you get little to no
base but as you increase it you get some
very clean and heavy bass even at level
4 on the sound slider the bass doesn't
drown out everything else
clarity remains consistent no matter
what level you place the slider because
of this and my love for bass
I found myself never really moving from
level 4 to say the least I'm extremely
happy with the sound quality on the
custom one pros and I think the average
listener would definitely enjoy
listening to these clean rich sound with
the option to adjust how much bass you
want to hear seems like a winner to me
overall I'm very happy with the custom
one pros they're very solid pair of
headphones with a ton of options nice
build quality and great sound quality my
only real gripe should be that they're a
bit on the larger side and the non
foldable design these headphones can be
found in the $200 range and I'll be sure
to include some links down below so you
can check them out
I think it's well worth the price and
you definitely have my recommendation if
you want to pick it up but of course
before we close out this video let me
show you guys what it looks like on and
all right guys time to show you what
these look like on so here we have it
from the front and of course the sides
and here's the top for you and when you
just want to put it around your neck
here you have it but like I said guys
these do have bigger ear cups but you
got great great sound quality coming
from them and of course they have the
adjustable bass control here so it's got
a lot going on with these ear cups so
definitely good stuff but let me know
what you guys think do you plan on
picking one of these up or do you have a
pair what do you think of them and let
me know in the comments down below and
if you enjoyed this video be the cool
guy that hit the thumbs up button and
subscribe to the channel for more
content from me but I'll be catching you
guys in the next video till then it's
your average consumer
