going on guys drivers consumer and let's
take a look at some awesome tech now
whether you're super late on a holiday
gift or maybe you've got some holiday
money you want to spend these are gonna
be some good options to take a look at
and the first thing we're gonna check
out our a pair of completely wireless
earbuds and these are the Samsung gear
icon X now I personally really like
these because one they're super
comfortable and they even come with a
few accessories so that you can get an
even better fit if you want which is
actually pretty important in case these
fall out of your ear they don't have a
cable to save them so having the right
fit is super important and one cool
thing about these earbuds even though
they're really small and compact is that
you can still control your music or
whatever audio you're listening to with
the touch panels on the sides so all of
the functionality that you will
typically find on an inline remote can
be found with different gestures on the
touch panels and of course if you're
rocking a galaxy device you get to take
advantage of some extra features since
they have dedicated apps for it some of
those features being a fitness coach an
activity tracker that tracks your
calories time working out distance
traveled all kinds of cool stuff and you
even get the ability to find your
earbuds in case you lose them but most
importantly these sounds good they don't
have a ton of bass I wouldn't expect
that but for overall listening I think
these do a really good job and next up
we've got the nest indoor security cam
now if you guys have seen any of my room
or office tours you know that I got
these things outfitted throughout my
entire studio and I actually just
personally liked them because I find
them easy to set up and they offer a
pretty good features this thing is
working with a 1080p camera so if you're
looking at your footage you're gonna be
able to see everything very clearly and
you're even able to zoom in quite a bit
if you want to focus on one particular
part of the room and that app actually
has a very easy-to-use interface where
you can see all the cameras at a glance
right from the homepage and you can
easily jump into the camera you want to
take a look at and even go back a couple
of hours to see what you might have
missed and even if you don't have access
to your app you can jump in on any web
browser and just type in your login
information and you still get access to
all of your cameras they even include
things like two-way communication so if
you see your kid touching something that
they shouldn't be you can go ahead and
talk into the mic and just tell them to
stop or maybe tell a burglar that you're
calling the police
so I think there's some nice
functionality here there's a newer
version of this camera out right now but
that thing is like crazy expensive right
now so I think that this is a really
solid option I actually give a few of
these to my father-in-law and he loves
it too so if you're looking for
something to give dad this is a solid
option and now we're gonna take a look
at this awesome Bluetooth speaker this
is the Logitech UE mega boom and I'm
tellin you guys it deserves its name
this thing is a very powerful speaker
with a somewhat compact body it's got
the cylinder look to it and it actually
helps us to provide 360 degrees sound
which is very very impressive this thing
is also waterproof so if you want to
take this to the shower or maybe the
pool you can do that with no worries
and this is actually a pretty smart
speaker it's got Siri and Google now
voice integration so if you want to
access those you can do that right from
the speaker and they even kicked it up a
notch with an update which allows it to
actually use Amazon Alexa now it doesn't
quite function like the Amazon echo
where it's always listening you actually
have to hit a button and speak to Alexa
it's even got this party up feature
where you can pair multiple of these if
you want I think you can even go up to
150 of them which is absolutely insane
but I think two would be fine one is
more than enough
it sounds great by itself but if you
want to get some really crazy sound
going you can pair multiple honestly if
you're just looking for a very powerful
rugged Bluetooth speaker this is
definitely one to take a look at it has
a hundred foot range so if you want to
go outdoors with it that's not a problem
and it's also got 20 hours of battery
life but this thing is a tank and it
sounds great so if you're looking for a
nice Bluetooth speaker this is
definitely one to put on your list and
if you guys are interested in picking up
any of the tech that I mentioned in this
video I'll of course have a link down
below in the description but you can
head on over to AT&amp;amp;T comm slash deals
and they've got a ton of different tech
available there so I'll have that link
down below for you guys to check it out
and last but not least we've got
something a bit different
this is DirecTV now if you've ever
wondered watch TV on the go or right
from your computer this is what you've
been looking for you get access to a ton
of live channels right from the app or
even a web browser I've actually been
able to watch a few basketball games
right from my computer since my studio
doesn't have any case
and even if you're not trying to watch
live TV and maybe you want to just watch
specific shows from your favorite
network you're gonna be able to do that
here they've got a ton of different
episodes from a ton of different shows
so TV on your phone or your computer
