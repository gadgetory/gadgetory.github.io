this is my fiance Harry and today we
have an awesome video for you guys we
have a haul but it's not a beauty haul
it is a massive gadget haul and inside
this massive box we have some pretty
cool tech to show you guys so in this
series I plan on showing you guys some
cool tech that I get my hands on either
for myself or maybe something I'm gonna
feature in a video or maybe a company
sends it to me yeah and what's nice
about this is it gives you a little bit
of insight on the kind of things he
picks up in between videos because
sometimes these things might not make it
to the channel right but I guess we
should get started right yeah let's get
into she's gonna be my little assistant
here she's gonna be handing me the
devices out of this giant box so let's
get started
alright assistant hit me with the first
product okay and speaking of being
company sent to us oh yeah alright so
over here we've got here so I'm gonna
grab my unboxing knife and you know give
this thing a little quick unboxing I'll
do some unboxings on here why not right
so here I actually showed you guys this
sometime last year here actually started
with a Kickstarter campaign and I
believe in June of 2015 now this is
actually a pretty innovative product and
I know that sounds like a marketing term
but no really it is the first of its
kind that I have ever heard of myself so
you can use these to turn down the
volume of certain frequencies things
that you're hearing or turn it up so if
I want to use this in a girlfriend test
when she's nagging me Oh that'll be a
test right let's see first of all we've
got to hear this is it in a case and
it's a special case to now typically I'm
not crazy bubble twits
but since this is a product that I don't
think anyone is really familiar with
might be worth looking at and we've got
some earbud tips right here large small
medium on it of course so we'll put this
to the side get the box out of here so
we've got the paperwork you can look
through it let you know how to charge
them what to do with the ear tips how to
get them in all that good stuff now when
you open this up let's see oh it's got
lights and whatnot now this is a really
cool case because not only does it
protect it but it houses the earbud and
it charges it as well now even though
these are earbuds don't get them
confused with like Bluetooth earbuds
they're nothing like that you can't
listen to music on these you can't make
calls with these these are simply for
augmenting your hearing but what you can
do with this guy with the included app
on your phone you can actually use these
and control your EQ your real-life
equalizer and let's say you're on
something like a train and you know
you've got babies crying or something
annoying you don't like hearing the
train buzz you can actually tune out the
frequency so you can make a much
pleasant a much more pleasant ride when
you're on
train so that's pretty cool now if
you're interested in winning your own
pair of earbuds you get that if you're
interested in winning a pair I have a
link down below in the description so be
sure to check that out if you want to be
one of the first people who can
completely control their hearing chemi
with the next product baby shows my age
oh yeah yeah y'all know about this that
Street Fighter 5 just came out and I got
the collector's edition because it's got
this badass for you now there's no way
this guy is replacing my Gundam but it's
gonna be nice to have nonetheless and if
you actually pre-ordered this with
Amazon Game Stop or the PlayStation
Store wherever you got it from you got a
special DLC costume then I actually got
this from Amazon so I got the bison
costume Amazon actually had a pre-order
special where you can save some money if
you're a Prime member gotta have the
Prime membership sponsored not sponsored
so let me pop this guy open all right
let's see what we've got and volume
I'm good at so this is half a ryu and
what else do we have here we've got some
cards we've got that bison and we've got
some awesome coats I'm that DLC code or
whatever we've got an art book so I
guess like concept art stuff like that
so that's pretty cool that's pretty dope
put that to the side let's see how these
pieces legs and boom this is reused legs
yeah this looks weird this looks really
weird let's put this together alright
here he is he looks boss
buzzy I like it
all right why not why not throw this
over here and uh oh yeah there's a game
- hey there's a game you see he's got
his pose and whatnot
boom very menacing real good job next
product maybe um alright so this guy is
a Microsoft Surface pro 3 sleeve case so
this is for the 4:3 and it's supposed to
look like leather this can't be real -
crowd and spend a lot of money on it um
but this looks good
hi this is it magnet okay yeah yeah yes
what else you got whatever all right so
this is it feels good it's got a little
sleeve of a compartment in the back I
has a thing for our business cards this
is not really professional I like it
alright next she can take credit for
that I was popping in to Best Buy I was
popping in to Best Buy's over here and
there to try and see if I could get my
hands on this never happened but uh re
went on Walmart and found it she hunted
it down it's not in stock so if you're
looking for one
check it out in Walmart comm they might
haven't stopped it's not a sponsor
alright so I mean everyone knows what
this is all about right you got an Xbox
one you've probably heard about the
elite controller this is supposed to be
an awesome controller I'm gonna unbox it
real quick for myself
and I'm just show you guys real quick
and let's see this control I've never
even seen it so alright oh this is nice
um let me tell you what's nice about it
it's got a little extra buttons in the
back you can map these two different
actions in the game yeah you can
completely customize it yeah so you can
customize it and you can put different
things different places you can put the
d-pad with this or you use the circular
one so you got different things you can
do with it different kind of joysticks I
have to use it if you guys wants to
review or something or this is probably
too old to go Olivia at this point but
cool nonetheless double-a batteries in
there and let's move on to the next
product
okay why not
bundle we got a couple of games here uh
you guys know I've been playing my food
yes a lot
I wish Sony would come out with some
games for the Vita but they don't so I'm
buying three DS games and I've got Fire
Emblem birthright cuz I read that this
is the one to start with and I got the
other conquest digital copy as a digital
copy oh yeah if you're into strategy RPG
games this is definitely something we
should look into the Fire Emblem series
is awesome Ares tuning out right now
because this is nerd stuff to her okay
this is Final Fantasy explorers this is
kind of like Monster Hunter if you're
familiar you know I like month on I had
some crazy days back to the day with my
Sonya but this is supposed to be the
final fantasy version I'm a final
fantasy fan so I have to jump on that
and because of me being an anime lover
and the longtime Naruto watcher I had to
get the latest naruto ultimate ninja
storm 4 if you try to see me on some ps4
naruto ultimate ninja storm sacred fire
50 holler at so pass me another one baby
see looks like a UFO oh I like it
all right so this one here we've got the
music angel in black this is a Bluetooth
a levitating Bluetooth speaker
everybody's doing it so I said I gotta
get one is it in black person white
no this isn't black its marked off so
everybody's doing it I decided hey why
not went on Amazon grabbed one that I
saw look one this one looked like it had
some pretty good ratings so uh I want to
see it thing this is just like an
unboxing yeah seriously let's see you
open this up and I mean it's not plugged
in or anything but you don't oh okay so
anyway you would throw it on here think
kind of crazy so I guess I would have to
plug it in try it out
you know what insert b-roll of this guy
on plugged in working if you guys want
to hear how it sounds
let me know in the comments down below
but this bureau right now she gave you
an idea what it looks like oh yeah I
throw it up on some social media why not
alright babe how much more do we got two
more how many of us suspected to be in
addition to the already very full get
okay I know what this is so here we have
gritted now I think one of you commented
get a grid it for your gadget backpack
because I was using some Ziploc bags
which you know that's my little trick I
love doing that but they say kind of
grid it I was like you know what I'll
listen to you guys why not my sons have
some good advice I'll listen to him and
I got this guy so
now what you can do with this is it's
like a board with a bunch of straps and
you use these straps to you know throw
on some cables some headphones phones
whatever you want you can place it right
in there if you want to carry around Ryu
let's see we can do it it's not around
that I'm not a savage here but you can
you know put your products in here now
it's good for stuffs like a lot of
usually a lot of cables phones anything
that's pretty flat that you just don't
want lying around inside your bag so
boom you got this I'm gonna test it out
see if it's worthy oh it also comes with
a little zipper here so you can put some
more stuff in there this could be useful
so definitely make it to the guide your
backpack alright last product I can
already see it yeah this thing is
massive I might need some help here but
I was playing for a century woman I got
this here we go good job oh yeah this is
a little expensive okay so this is from
games they actually sent this to me this
is the games monitor is the m240 now
this I wanted to get my hands on for a
while first I saw I was like this is
pretty dope I showed you guys the games
Vanguard and I love that thing it's
super awesome it was in my top 5 awesome
tech so you guys saw that anyway let's
open this up cuz I got to stand for this
one alright
less if I take my microphone bang check
this out
so this thing is huge it is a 24 inch
monitor
hence the m240 so let's say I get this
out
oh so I'm going to lay this down bring
this out now this is supposed to be a
portable monitor okay let me show you
guys what else it comes with so we've
got this as the motor
oh my assistant helping me out and let's
see we've got the power adapter you're
gonna need that we've got eight and
eight CMI cable now this is short
because they're supposed to have like
whatever you're using right nearby so
we've got a short one let's actually
consider it um and we've got a remote
there we go we've got the game's remote
and it's not too bad not heavy I'm able
to hold it here and talk to you guys and
we've got this is this same a travel
case or a mat of some sort okay so this
is like a protective travel uh a child
protector so that you can do it in front
and then you can wrap it around it so
that's pretty cool so an area is
happened in the box okay that's
happening
anywho so here it is got a little dust
on it but it's all good clean that up
and this is it so what we've got here is
a 24 inch monitor and it's got this
little kickstand in the back we've also
got all your adapters or IO
so you've got 2 inputs 4 HDMI actually
and you have 2 inputs 4 HDMI and you got
an HDMI output as well as some 3.0 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
you got a sub out and this is for the
power adapter right here so that's
pretty cool uh what's it does anything
go here no so this is a 1080p screen you
know games is all about gaming so you
can expect this to work well with a
gaming console that's definitely what
I'm going to be trying it with man I
like the way this looks a lot but yeah I
think this is it wait we're having over
you okay oh here he goes all right I
think that's about it
you want to get out the box now it might
be a good time to get out the box all
right well I think that's about it
let me see let's line up everything here
huh and I think this is it guys this has
been my haul things that I'm probably
just going to be enjoying on my own

a video and things that were sent to me

immediately so this is it hopefully you
guys enjoyed it if you'd like to see
