consumer and we've got another massive
tech unboxing this is number 20 and with
the 20th one it's a special one
we got area in the house yeah
welcome back but guys we have a ton of
packages this time around
so grab your snacks grab your drinks you
might need to upgrade the snacks to a
plate of food cuz we got a lot of stuff
to check out now before we let re go
ahead and pick the very first one our
sponsor gets to go first so today so
here we got the Adaro a small box
amongst all of these but let's check out
what's inside of it alright so for those
of you who don't know the Adaro is an
intelligent organization system for
things like backpacks things you carry
around with you I'm personally really
excited because down low me and my
backpacks okay guys so what I have right
here is the standard kit so inside of
the standard kit you get three smart
tags and you get three tablets now for
every smart tag you can attach three
tablets so you got some extra ones
inside of here so if you want to upgrade
your system you can and also you get
these adhesive plates for your smart tag
so if you want to stick this on - maybe
a suitcase some luggage you can do that
and not have it hang off of the keyring
that's inside of here okay so you got
the smart charger and you just pretty
much attach the smart tag right on top
of it and it charges and the last thing
inside of here are some lanyards so
that's what you can attach these to so
basically the way you'd use this system
is you'd attach the smart tag to
something like your backpack that's how
I would use it and then you take the
three tablets and attach them to things
as well so you can have like your laptop
your eyeglasses case and even your
notebook and then you can go inside of
the app and of course name each of the
tablets so that you know exactly which
items you're keeping track of so if you
happen to leave your laptop behind you
grab your backpack and you start to head
out the house the smart tag will
actually send a notification to your
phone letting you know hey you left your
laptop behind and then you be able to go
back and grab it and the main goal for
having a system like this is to be able
to leave the house and not feel stressed
out
that you forgot something or worried
that you might have forgotten something
if you don't get that notification you
know you're all good like I said guys
this is the standard kit that I have
right here and this goes for about a
hundred and twenty bucks but you can
also go for the starter kit what pretty
much has everything you see here but it
only has one smart tag what pretty much
has everything you need to get started
and if you guys want to save 20% on
these or any other Adira products use
the discount code Adira fam and I'll of
course have everything linked down below
in the description so that was cool but
Ari
it is finally your turn pick something
this one I know what this is this is
actually pretty cool
you actually tape this up real good yeah
check this out guys I've got my own
amiibo so guys this is a custom-made
amiibo character to look like yours
truly but this is made by ganda Chris
I'll have her link down below she
creates some awesome stuff I know she's
made this for a few other folks and man
she fills it you are on the back so good
good job battery you picked right you
pick absolutely right so I am going I am
really excited to actually put this into
Smash Bros and see how that goes dang
this looks so good she is talented from
the folks over at Apple got the iPhone
10 X 10 s max smart battery case so if
you guys haven't heard apple has come
out with a battery case for the iPhone
10s 10s Max and iPhone 10 R so if you
need a little extra juice you got a
first-party case that kind of gives you
that alright so I'm gonna just peel that
back
easy installation yeah you want one
you're jealous
okay so the feel in the hand this is
definitely it's bigger look feel that oh
I please you think I'm gonna complain
I'm very very happy about this 130 bucks
though not cheap not cheap at all but
you know how badly do you want some
extra juice I've shown you guys the
august smart lock before but they have a
new version this is I think their third
generation so it's got like a new design
still the same smart lock features but
this will probably look a lot better in
the home oh there's so much smaller nice
so this is a new smart lock the August
let's just get it out so instead of that
big knob that we used to have now it's
just this it's probably locked right now
but this is uh huh alright I guess good
job now we're getting some tech in the
crib this is passed the test so we got a
heavy box right here it's small the
heavy so guys right here we got
something from Omni charge they got the
best portable charger ever with the Omni
charge 20 I think that's what I love but
this right here is a crazier version
dang this thing is huge so the one that
I have is about twenty thousand milliamp
hours I think maybe like nineteen and
change but this guy
forty thousand milliamp hours holy mess
this is the kind of thing you keep in
your car like you just play there and
forget about it I thought this was gonna
go in my backpack
and it's got like this rubberized
silicone casing on it so you know kind
of makes it a lot more durable so with
the omni charger you can charge a ton of
different things in a ton of different
ways right here we've got a regular like
wall outlet which is actually really
convenient
when you're taking this thing on the go
and on the other side you've got USB
type-c
and two USB ports and I've got no idea
what this guy is right here but I'll
throw up a judge says so that you guys
can know so another thing with Omni
charger all this thing is dead but it's
got this screen over here right in the
middle so it can give you all kinds of
information on how much juice you've got
left how fast is charging how long it'll
take to finish charging lots and lots of
cool features on this guy and I honestly
still can't believe how big and beefy
this thing is so this is from the peel
box a USB charging hub check this out so
Scot is this a us oh this is an actual
USB hub so you get 10 USB 3.0 ports and
three fast charging ports I actually
really really like this thanks for
sending this over a couple things in
here Oh a modern strap for the gold pipe
a Palazzo I'm gonna say iPhone watch o
re this is right up your alley that is
actually really nice interesting rugged
case for air pods look at this guys so I
guess you throw your regular air pod
case inside of here and you broke boys
got air pods on you know - minor at home
alright alright so this is something you
put your case inside of and you put this
on top of it if you want it to have that
leather feel it's a rugged case so it
can protect your okay so that's a case
for your case nice alright we got a lot
of big boxes here alright pick a pick
another one pick a big box
dang really dang it's really a lot more
trouble than it's okay you picked the
right baby girl you see that guys you
see this right here you see this Gundam
planet game over
all right I don't even want to I don't
want to cut on them I can't mess it back
on the planet logo I know what this is
Oh
double-oh-seven sword perfect great
nobody cares book me and I'm okay with
that
oh I know exactly what's gonna happen
into this guy my boy curio Ventura is
going to put his hands on this and make
it amazing if you guys don't know cure
open tour he made a ton of Awesome
Gundam stuff for me he actually has a
channel and he's probably going to be
making videos on the process of making
this so you guys are gonna want to check
him out if you love Gundams Gunpla i'll
have them linked down below in the
description you've got to follow him
that man is a beast I always get a lot
of questions about what Gundam show I
you guys should watch when you want to
watch it for the first time double O
Gundam do yourself a favor
I don't listen you don't have to watch
the rest just watch double O Gundam
trust me
alright so forgive my nerd moment right
there let's get back to the unboxings oh
this is for the crib got some nest
thermostats spoiler alert we're putting
this smart thermostats in the house
because what we got right now is it is
not cutting it now this is nothing new I
don't got to go over all of this but you
know it's nice to have Smart Home Tour
video coming soon at some point it's
happening dresses alright
DHL package
oh are you telling me about this right
the bit boy nice okay Oh like a
old-school King boy all right so let's
switch this thing on oh it's got like a
colored screen respectable how do I get
started
bit boy oh it has a micro SD card so has
a micro SD card slot right at the top
and I'm assuming this is gonna be a
micro SD card with some games or
something I assumed correctly
okay wario land 3 it's a play Wario back
in the day oh they got Pokemon silver
no way that is like my favorite Pokemon
game yep no way this that hits me right
here
and this thing is crazy crazy loud I
want to find out volume okay guys hold
up come on check this out
so you can actually press this little R
button and I think you can save the
state of the game so I can just jump in
wherever kind of like you know an
emulator where you don't need to use the
phone safe function of the actual game
itself oh okay so you can connect this
to the TV so maybe you can play oh I
think you can play like NES games as
well so it's not just Gameboy and
there's a lot of games on here we've
seen it for what 35 50 so it's not very
expensive at all this nostalgia purposes
this is amazing we got some backpacks
you know me I love me some backpacks but
these are of course like those backpacks
that have like USB ports and everything
this one's a little different it has
like a headphone jack too but I'm gonna
do some testing I'm planning on coming
out with another backpack video that
kind of has a ton of different good ones
that you guys can check out so that
would be like the second one that I do
this actually even looks not so bad I
thought I was gonna look worse but I
gave it a shot and I'm not disappointed
so that's some backpacks to check out
I'm very excited for this stay tuned for
that video where I talk about some good
backpack choices all right what else we
have in here oh nice
so right here guys I have a key fob
holder for the Tesla that I just got now
I don't know if you guys know this but
the remote for the Tesla actually looks
like this so it looks like a car so here
we have it this is the new Tesla keyring
so now I can throw this onto my keys
instead of leaving it loose in my pocket
I like this a lot this is nice
oh yes so check this out guys here we
have a portable gaming monitor for the
ps4 pro so basically you can attach this
to your ps4 Pro not need a TV or
anything and game to your heart's
content feels cheap I'm not gonna lie
okay so there's some tech behind here
that I guess sorta justifies the price
with HDR free sync support it's not bad
so you have up to two headphone jacks so
that you can play with others and you
also have two HDMI port and of course a
power port this thing also has built-in
speakers so when you're playing your
game you'll be able to actually hear it
from this display and over here laughs
in that box we got this smart scale so
it's a pretty inexpensive smart scale
and it can connect with a bunch of
different apps so like apple health
google fit all that kind of stuff you
can actually get your data synced up to
it so something inexpensive for the crib
oh I'm very happy about this - all right
next up let's see what we've got
boom Amazon giftcard that's what we got
somebody just got that 50 bucks easy
if you got it let me know - comment down
below alright guys so check this out
this right here we've got the Nano leaf
canvas so you guys might have seen the
nataly's that I have in the back of my
voiceover set it's those little
triangles I made that little funky
design you guys have been seeing that
for a long time but they've come out
with a new shape this is the square it's
been out for a little bit now I think
they even announced a hexagon shape at
CES but this guy I'm actually thinking
about putting in the man cave at my
house I'm not gonna go crazy with the
RGB zan colors but I got something very
interesting in mind I am curious about
the size dough so let's open this up
okay so these are they're not huge but
each of these have like four quadrants I
think this is gonna be really nice
actually I'm very excited for these
designing the basement man
I'm gonna blow your minds all of you so
we got these big boxes over here let's
actually open this up these are actually
really tall so these are actually from
Philips hue and they're like pretty much
standing lights or stand a standing lamp
plugging this into a coffee table it's
crazy
mmm-hmm
you like that yeah I like that but
what's nice about this is that you can
actually change the colors so this could
be nice for some really nice ambient
effects and we actually got two of them
but what's actually really nice those
are floor lamps but they have a smaller
one as well so that's this guy right
here I think these are called the
Philips thing or something like that but
basically this is the same thing as
those but in a much more compact body
smaller can go on a desk and create some
ambient lights let's check out this one
look how many battery warnings this
thing has on it guys okay so we got a
big old clock over here re check this
out
I'm guessing something fast happens here
so we got a USB oh so this is a USB see
two lightning cable we got some wrist
bands okay keep the sweat off so we got
a giant stopwatch this is like Jolla
this is like a legitimate legitimate
stopwatch where the batteries I'm
guessing the skin comes up these are a
lot smaller than I anticipated what's
the capacity on these okay so we got a
ten thousand fifty milliamp hour battery
over here and a 6700 milliamp hour
that's actually not bad for something so
tiny and they both have USBC PD
basically what that means is if you got
an iPhone you're gonna be able to get a
fifty percent charge in 30 minutes
Jay big box small box big box I like the
way you think
so what we got right here guys is a
smart I guess coffee table or just side
table so check this out guys so it's got
USB ports inside of it so you can charge
your phone it's also got Bluetooth
controls because it's also a built-in
speaker has a built-in speaker and you
can choose between different finishes
there's like a dark oak and I guess
that's lighter one I believe I want for
the dark oak but this is looking pretty
light how this is the light version oh
and it has wireless charging so this is
a side table you just throw this down
phone charges wirelessly that's really
cool having a smart side table plays
music charges your phones wirelessly
charges your phones and you have a bunch
of Bluetooth controlled I think that's
really awesome yo Jake you saw that
Amazon gift card that's crazy
this is from the peel box alright so
this thing says forty thousand milliamp
hours we just got forty thousand what
and it's a portable power outlet so I'm
guessing it has similar features this
looks a lot more compact not gonna hide
dang competition right in the same video
so you have your wall outlet right here
another two USB ports and a USB C port
and you have a power button here with a
little display that tells you how much
juice you've got left all right we got
eighty thousand milliamp hours in two
portable chargers that is absolutely
insane but alright guys I think that
wraps it up for today's video
huge shout out to all of the companies
who sent something over but I'll catch
you guys in the next video hopefully you
enjoyed it be the cool guy or girl that
gives the video a thumbs up if you did
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
