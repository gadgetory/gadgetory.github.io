and today we're gonna be taking a look
at the new Beats Studio wireless three
and seeing if it's dope or no now
there's been multiple iterations of the
Beats studios but there's only been
about two different designs the very
first one that came out years and years
ago
and from the 2.0 and up the beat studio
and the Beats Studio wireless pretty
much shared the exact same design and
I'm not mad at this because I actually
really like the look of the current
studios I think it looks good it's got a
nice form factor it is an over ear
design so it completely covers your ears
it is also foldable so if you want to
tuck this away into a backpack or
something you have that option
apparently app will change that the
stitching of the studio's ear cushions
is supposed to be a bit softer but
honestly it's always been really
comfortable so I can't say I noticed
much of a change there what did change
though is that they came out with a
bunch of new colors you've got your
matte black white blue red as well as
some special edition colors called
porcelain rose and shadow gray and let
me tell you guys when I saw that shadow
gray I thought that was gonna be the one
but I got my hands on the red one and it
actually surprised me I expected it to
be this bright vibrant red but it's
actually like a dark cherry red which
actually comes off really nicely and as
you can see based on these colors it
looks like pieces going for a more
sophisticated look rather than those
bright red B logos that we all know
beats is famous for and since this is
the newest version I know you're
wondering what's different what's been
added and the biggest change that you're
gonna be seeing here is the inclusion of
apples w1 chip and there are a lot of
bonuses that come with that chip the
first time probably my favorite is
proximity pairing that allows you to
pair the headphones to a device that's
running iOS 10 or later by simply
turning it on and having it next to the
device this makes for a super simple
pairing process and honestly you get it
done with just the press of a button
which is awesome and once you've got it
paired to your device you can actually
use it with all of the other Apple
devices that you have as long as you're
connected with your iCloud account you
can jump from having an iPhone connected
to it to your MacBook Pro to your iPad
you can jump between all those different
devices without even having to
separately pair them all and another
bonus with that w1 chip is that you get
increased battery life now you get
22 hours with the pure adaptive
noise-canceling which we're gonna touch
on in a second and without it you get 40
hours which is really good on a pair of
bluetooth headphones and it features
fast charging so if this thing dies on
you you charge it for 10 minutes and
you're getting 3 hours of playback and
it's also supposed to help with
Bluetooth connectivity so you're getting
less dropouts and extended range and
I've been using this thing without even
touching my phone all over my studio so
I can vouch for it it's really good and
for those of you who aren't familiar
with the current design of the studio's
there's not a lot of buttons here even
though these are a pair of bluetooth
headphones there's actually just a power
button which also works for the noise
cancellation and on the left ear cup you
also have your play and pause button
which is the actual bead logo and above
that you have your volume up and below
it the volume down so if you want to
control your music double tap to skip
triple tap to go back and press once to
play and pause or even answer calls and
how could I forget a long press if you
want to access Siri right from your
headphones now when you pick this guy up
you will get a few accessories in the
box you get a hardshell travel case
which is gonna be good to protect your
headphones you get a carabiner clip if
you want to attach it to a backpack or
something like that you also get a 3.5
millimeter audio cable with an inline
remote so if you want to control your
music you can do that right from the
cable but my biggest issue here is the
fact that you cannot use the headphones
powered completely off with the audio
cable and that's honestly one of my
biggest pet peeves when it comes to
bluetooth headphones I feel like they
should all work without power in case
you just want to use them as regular
headphones maybe you don't have access
to an outlet and your headphones are
dead you should have the option to be
able to still use them even without
juice thankfully there is fast charging
and you do get a solid three hours from
just ten minutes of charging even if
you're not near an outlet you probably
have a portable charger if you tend to
listen to my advice but I honestly would
have preferred to just have the ability
to listen without any power whatsoever
and speaking of charging this thing
comes with a micro USB cable which I
don't really understand the beats ex
that came out before this charges with a
lightning cable which makes complete
sense but micro USB cable I just don't
understand that I would have understood
if this came out last year
you know they're still trying to cater
to all the Android devices out there
that use the microUSB but everybody's on
USB type C or the lightning cable so I
feel like it should charge with one of
those two so I definitely don't like the
microUSB and the W one chip also allows
for a new form of noise canceling that
Apple is calling pure adaptive noise
canceling and for those of you who
aren't familiar with how noise canceling
headphones work typically the headphones
are outfitted with microphones that are
able to listen in to the environment and
create a frequency that cancels out that
noise but the studio wireless degree
actually takes that and kicks it up a
notch by doing a continuous scan of the
environment and it does that up to about
50,000 times per second
that's insane but not only is it
continuously calibrating based on your
environment but it's also taking into
consideration the fit on your actual
head so things like hair glasses it's
actually taking all that into
consideration as well as what you're
listening to so the mix of those three
are supposed to give you the best
combination of sound quality and noise
cancellation and I of course have to
test this with some of the kings in the
game like the Bose QC 35 as well as the
sony MDR 1000x which is the current
champion and when I tested this out
while listening to music I was very
impressed with the studios because it
actually kept up with both the QC 35 and
even the MDR 1000x and with those two
being the cream of the crop when it
comes to noise canceling headphones
that's really impressive but when it
came to noise cancelling without any
music the QC 35 s and the 1000x still
held their ground that's the top to the
studios didn't do too bad but they're
not dethroning those - in that regard
I'm not really sure how many people used
in noise cancelling without any music on
but I do know some people tend to use it
for commutes so I just wanted to share
that now of course the biggest most
important thing about these headphones
is the sound quality now I'm not gonna
sit here and make a blanket statement
like these sound like a pair of Beats
because honestly the Beats sound has
changed quite a bit over the years in
the beginning there used to be this huge
focus on bass but they've actually
dialed that down quite a bit with the
most recent products and the same goes
for the studio wireless threes now since
these are the studios I was listening
closely to see how big of a role the
bass would play but I was actually
surprised to see things like the vocals
really standing out
instrument separation was really really
apparent and the bass was there present
but it wasn't crazy
it wasn't muddy it sounded really clean
very clear and I actually really enjoyed
the sound and something that's pretty
interesting about the studios is that
whether you have the pure adaptive noise
cancelling on or off you get the exact
same sound quality and as I was testing
it against other noise cancelling
headphones like the QC 35 and the 1000x
I found that the sound quality sounded
way better than the QC 35 s everything
sounded a lot more present a lot more
vibrant the QC 35 sounded really low in
comparison and it was comparable to the
1000 X which is a huge compliment to the
studios I'm curious to see if the studio
sounds gonna be comparable to the newest
version of the 1000 X but as of right
now these sound really really good so
the question is are these dope or no and
honestly guys I'm gonna go with dope
these are great sounding headphones that
also look good and they feature apples
w1 chip that give it crazy long battery
life it has really impressive noise
cancelling and it also works for have a
ton of Apple devices without having to
go and pair to each one I actually just
really love the convenience that it
offers especially since I make use of
Apple's ecosystem now where I will not
this is that microUSB cable I wish it
didn't come with that and also the fact
that you can't use this without any
juice but it's saving grace is the fact
that it has that fast charging and that
extremely long battery life but overall
it's a very solid pair of headphones I
think that anybody who picks it up will
definitely enjoy it but that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it and if you did be the cool
guy girl that gives this video a thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one till then it's your average consumer
