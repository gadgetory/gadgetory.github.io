girlfriend you could also just call me
Ari and I'll be on the channel bit more
with some unboxings and some reviews for
you guys of some really cool stuff and
the first thing I have to bring to you
is this guy the Elgato Game Capture HD
and we are so excited to be into the
channel we can finally do some more Xbox
one videos and show you some gameplay in
a really professional way so let's not
waste any time
let's get right into it why ba ba ba ba
ba ba Dada alright so here's just a
quick look at the box you have some back
information give some information on the
back some pictures yeah so of course we
have the trusty unboxing knife and last
time you guys made fun of the way I
opened it I'm left-handed not my fault
um so here we go
and we'll start opening it here looks
like the easiest way I think Irish
consumer will have to give me some
lessons on how to use this thing
perfectly smooth back to this guy this
is really cool because you can actually
record your games like livestream your
gameplay so if you consider yourself in
Call of Duty ghost Pro or 2k pro you can
actually live stream on Twitch your
gameplay really really cool uh so this
is just a sleeve here so let's just pull
this off and then you have this little
box and it opens up and presents it like
this it's pretty cute but we're going to
just take up off the Elgato Game Capture
and just put it aside and examine a
little bit later a blood seemed to the
rest of the box great so just have a
bunch of cables um this cable here is
the component cable this is great if
you're not using HDMI and then we have
the HDMI cable a USB cable and a
PlayStation 3 cable so this is awesome
because this Game Capture actually can
connect to a bunch of different consoles
so connect to the Xbox 360 the Xbox one
PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 the
only that kind of blows though is the
fact that for the PlayStation 4 you have
to buy it and actually
additional adapter for it but what can
you do you also are supposed to get a
Quick Start Guide in here there's no
proper guide there's actually just this
card so you have a just a get started
card which problem means it is super
easy to set up on the back pay to show
you how to set it up in just a couple of
steps so that should be really nice and
easy
alright so I'll actually examine the
Game Capture
let's get out of its little plastic here
take off its clothing sit it feels like
anyway so now it's all bare and exposed
for you guys and let's look at the
port's that come on it you have the AV
in port the HDMI in port the HDMI out
port and the USB port and the first
thing I'm noticing about this is it's
super glossy it is it is a fingerprint
magnet you can completely see all finger
prints here but doesn't really matter
it's not like I'm wearing this as a
fashion piece or like headphones or
anything like that I also see that it is
super small so I know that it's going to
be not intrusive in my living room when
I put it on my entertainment system so
that's great we don't need anymore
things to be added there huh so yeah
this looks it's really nice and small
and I'm loving how compact it is and
like I mentioned before this thing can
do a lot you can live stream to twitch
and you can also really easily upload
your gameplay to Facebook to YouTube and
to Twitter it the best thing of all also
it records in 1080p so that's great um
and it also has software that works with
both Macs and PCs so if you are a Mac
person or if you're a PC person you do
not need to I would not need to choose
sides here it'll work for both oh and
we're just super excited to bring this
to you guys
we can't wait to crank out some Xbox one
videos using this cute little device so
I hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing if
you liked this unboxing I would like to
see more from me remember to thumbs up

like this video I'll count below just
what are your impressions of this and do
you have one and how do you like to use
it also feel free to add me on Twitter

information down below so yes feel free
to rate comment and subscribe if you'd
