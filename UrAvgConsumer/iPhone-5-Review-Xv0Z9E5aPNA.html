consumer and today I'm gonna be doing a
review on the iPhone 5 so let's not
wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys and here we have the iPhone
5 I know it's been out for about a week
now but I wanted to make sure I had
enough time with it before I made any
real judgments for this review and
overall I must say I'm pretty happy with
the experience I got often with this
phone first thing I'd like to talk about
is the design it's very similar in looks
to the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s with
the biggest changes being of course the
new 4-inch Retina display and I must say
it's really really great to look at
although I do have my qualms about some
of the apps that don't have optimization
for the 4 inch display yet and some of
them just happened to have these little
black bars at the top and bottom but
luckily this is the black iPhone and
those bars blend in with the black bezel
of the phone so I'm not too too
disappointed but I've constantly find
myself checking the App Store for
updates to see if those new apps have
been updated for the new display and the
second biggest change of course is the
new back panel now has an aluminum back
which gives it a two-tone look and at
first I thought this would be a great
thing because they meant there wasn't
gonna be much you know there was gonna
be any glass to break it probably won't
be any scratches that I thought but
unfortunately with the black iPhone 5
the scratches seemed there seems to be
that there are scratches that appear on
this and a lot of people are
experiencing it sometimes right out of
the box even and that only seems to be
happening with the black iPhone the
white iPhone the color the metal isn't
changed the color hasn't changed on the
metal but on the black one when it
scrapes there's like a white metal
underneath so that's only to kind of
that's kind of the only downfall of this
um new design and that's by using a
microfiber cloth on this table while I
do this review without a case the next
change with the iPhone 5 is
new slender body it's a lot thinner than
the previous iPhones well not a lot
thinner but it is a noticeably thinner
when comparing a side-by-side um the
only grill it's only really noticeable
when you don't have a case on I also
have the HTC One S which is an extremely
thin phone and both of these this is
even thinner than that one is and both
of them just really aren't comfortable
to me to hold without a case I find that
without a case the possibility of it
slipping is a lot higher so I just put a
case on just in case just to avoid any
problem the fear of is slipping out of
my hands is just too real of a thought
for me a minor change to the iPhone 5 is
that the headphone jack has been placed
at the bottom previous iPhones had it at
the top but since I've never owned what
it does it doesn't really feel like a
positive or negative for those of you
who might be upgrading it might take
some getting used to the iPhone 5 also
has an 8 megapixel camera that's really
great for photos and taking videos it's
if you've seen cat-like test videos you
know that the camera on the iPhone is
just amazing and now they upgraded the
front-facing camera as well it has a
720p HD front-facing camera and if you
look on my channel you'll see a video
test of me trying it out outside and
it's just really great it's really crisp
and clear and it really changes things
as far as the what you want to you what
you would be willing to use the
front-facing camera for if you haven't
seen any of my test videos on the camera
I would really suggest checking it out
you'd be pretty surprised at how good
this is the battery life has been pretty
decent for me I get a normal state use
out of it and I check my phone pretty
frequently so by the end of a workday
I'm usually near about 30% or 20% if you
don't check your phone too often you
might if you shouldn't expect better
battery life I think the addition of LTE
has made this phone faster than any
phone I've ever used before I tend to
get about 20 megabytes per second when
for download speeds and
and that's when I have a decent amount
of bars and I've seen it go as high as
forty seven megabytes per second LTE is
seriously no joke
I know LTE really affects the battery
but because it's in most places that I
am I really don't know what the battery
life is compared to it not having it on
but if it does decently for me with LTE
I don't think that you should have any
problems when you're not using it the
new a6 processor works great to keep the
phone fast and handles games like a
champ as you can see right here on the
software side of things they're getting
the same iOS experience one would come
to expect it's simple and easy to use
and that was another row of icons for
you it's nice to have the 4-inch display
but it isn't a game changer or anything
although I do prefer to have the 16 by 9
aspect ratio which is that rectangular
shape that this phone has similar to
like widescreen televisions this phone
is great for the average consumer who
doesn't want to do too much with their
phone besides simply use it and you know
play with its apps customization is
quite limited due to the nature of iOS
and after some time depending on what
kind of usual user you are it could get
a little boring although to be honest
that might just happen more so for tech
enthusiasts and geeks alike I do think
that this is a great fit for the average
consumer as it doesn't throw too much at
you while doing an excellent job at all
it does - multitasking I definitely
recommend this phone for any of those
who are interested unless you're
upgrading from an iPhone 4s or something
I think the iPhone 4s is too similar to
the iPhone 5 - work to warrant getting
an upgrade unless you're just dying for
the 4-inch display in the thinner body
and pretty much that wraps up my review
of the iPhone 5 guys if you enjoyed it
definitely hit the thumbs up comment and
subscribe this is your Irish consumer
until the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
