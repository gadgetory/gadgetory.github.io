consumer and today we've got a
comparison between the brand new Google
Home Hub and the Amazon echo show to
second gen the new one and these are
both voices systems with screens
obviously to kind of enhance the
experience this is just like an Amazon
echo and this is just like a Google home
but they have screens now the echo show
has a 10.1 inch 1280 by 800 resolution
and the Google home hub has a 7-inch
1024 by 600 resolution they've got some
weird numbers going on here now
something you'll notice with both of
these is that they've got their speakers
all in the back over here and Google
home has a pretty moderate sized speaker
while the echo show pretty massive that
is a huge speaker over here so you know
what we got to do guys we got to test
out the sound quality okay google play
Travis Scott sicko mode and it's got
buttons on the side so I can bring up
the the B drop was kind of weak
nothing yeah the bass didn't really it's
MacOS Alexa play sickled mode by Travis
Scott this also has volume buttons right
at the top stop the fact that she heard
me is actually really impressive because
that that was loud guys that is insane
there's no comparison here nothing at
all this one sounds way louder way
better way more bass this is a clear
clear winner but you are paying for that
difference here in terms of sound
quality and overall size this guy goes
for 230 bucks while this guy retails for
150 now with these voice assistance you
got to be able to ask them some
questions so let's start off with the
Amazon echo show
ask it a basic question like Alexa what
time is it in Tokyo the time in Tokyo is
5:00 a.m. on Saturday hey Google what
time is it in Tokyo the time in Tokyo
Japan is 5:00 a.m. on Saturday something
Google's always been able to do is
answer follow-up questions based on
something you've asked already so I can
say hey Google what's the temperature
over there in Tokyo it's currently 63
teen I didn't even have to specify that
it was Tokyo but if I were to ask Alexa
what time is it there sorry I didn't get
that
so no follow up questions here something
that Google's always been able to do so
that's really nice and when it comes to
actually being an assistant these can
both add things to your calendar read
what's coming up on your calendar but
there is a little bit more functionality
here with the Google home all you have
to do is tap it and you can kind of get
a look at important information so
upcoming calendar events the weather
things like that while Alexa you'll
probably have to ask any upcoming events
on my calendar on Monday October 29th at
7 8 and there's flight to San Francisco
ok so there you go you guys see some
flight information this is what it can
pull up and while Google will be able to
tell me the same thing as well from just
the top or if I ask it hey Google tell
me my next calendar event the next event
call flight to San Francisco Oh 1848 and
obviously they can both add to the
calendar if you make a request now
something that can also blow through is
control your smart home for me that is
the biggest reason why I have these guys
being able to control my smart home is
so important and we're actually turning
my house into the ultimate smart home
right looks I'm going to be attempting
that so I'm actually really trying to
figure out which of these is gonna make
it into the house you guys will see
future videos on this entire place and
what we use to deck it out so you can
expect to see my answer on which one I
will use there but when you're actually
looking at these right now in terms of
smart home controls you can also just
tell them to turn off certain lights
certain things that you have connected
but if you want to use their screens
with the Google home hub you can
actually just swipe down and with this
you'll have access to all of that
information you can actually just go
into lights and then you can see all the
different rooms that you have set up and
take control of them from there and
actually like that it's segmented here
because with the Amazon echo show you
can actually go ahead and hit lights and
more now here you can see which rooms
I've actually created and groups that
I've created through it but what would
have been cool is to see it broken down
like the Google home has it here so
right here you guys are seeing each and
every room instead of just a list of
groups and then under that a list of
every product that I have in my smart
home
now something else that I like about the
Google home is that I can just say hey
Google show me pictures of my dog
showing your photos and I can pull up a
picture of cookie right there
that is something that is really really
awesome look at that ain't she cute now
I'm not even gonna lie to you guys
I'm not sure if the Amazon echo has that
kind of functionality I don't use the
Amazon Photos app or their cloud storage
for photos or whatever it may be it's
just a little bit easier to access my
photos and tell it to play a slideshow
from the photos that I already take
every day rather than I
whatever Amazon even offers not goal I
never looked into it now something I'm
happy that Amazon offers is the ability
to use apps like Hulu so I can say
Amazon Oh
Alexa show me Naruto on Hulu here's what
I found and we got all of the og Naruto
ready to go is it dub the end sub always
goes up guys so you can view things from
Hulu and I think I don't know if Netflix
is available yet but you have access to
streaming apps which is really nice but
with this I think you only have access
to YouTube Amazon echo does not have
access to YouTube because they're like
at war with each other there's just no
way Google's letting them have YouTube
they had it before they took it away
okay google play your average consumer
on YouTube okay plain average consumer
on YouTube what's going on guys the
travelers consumer and today we're
taking a look at some awesome tech so I
think being able to watch some UAC
content on your assistant is all the
reason you need don't even you can't
watch me on this guy's don't even try it
by now I'm just joking I'm just joke but
you do have that YouTube functionality
over here instead of over here but you
get Hulu so this is something that is a
bigger device let's say you have kids in
the kitchen waiting for you to finish
making dinner or something they'll be
able to watch something on this much
bigger display with way better sound so
the viewing experience for watching
media I will say is far better on the
Amazon echo show something that's also
pretty interesting with the echo show
that you can't do with the Google Home
Hub is access a web browser so you can
actually just say Alexa open up Firefox
here's Firefox so boom right here you
have access to Firefox can you play
YouTube videos from that day YouTube
block this
let's see although you might be able to
just watch content from here so look at
that guys if you really really want to
access YouTube you can always go into
the web browser and start playing a
video right from here now another bit of
functionality that you get with the
Amazon echo show is the fact that it has
a built-in camera so if you want to talk
to someone else who has an echo show or
maybe even the Equus that small echo the
one with the circle
spot bam so if you want to talk to
someone with the echo spot you can do
that this one does not although it does
have this ambient light sensor so with
this it'll be able to control the
brightness and the color temperature so
that it's not hard on the eyes
especially at nighttime it'll sense that
it's night and it won't have a really
bright screen so that's kind of the
benefit of this one versus this you get
either a camera or the light sensor
choice is up to you but I think I like
the functionality of having a camera a
bit more hey Google can you play games
all right which one would you like to
try and check this out guys when it
comes to games the Google home has quite
a few right here that you can have
access to so this is actually really
cool there's this Mickey Mouse adventure
let's check that out oh yeah Wow
it's me Mickey Mouse with me okay so
that's been really cool for like kids I
can imagine them really enjoying that
and just like kind of hearing the story
and being involved because they ask a
question and to answer it I think that's
really nice now with Amazon echo you
have skills so you have different kinds
of games that you can play here as well
I'm not sure if any of them are visual
but let's see Alexa play jeopardy check
that out thanks Johnny and welcome
players hey I haven't seen you in a
while thanks for joining us again now
let's see how well you do today so that
is actually really cool I did not expect
to see like a full-blown jeopardy screen
with the question right there yeah yeah
but now you can read it and that is
really cool so they both have gaming
jeopardy here which is not for just kids
and I think there are other options on
the Google home as well but right now if
I had to make a choice between the two
of them hmm
find out when we do building our
ultimate smart home video but these are
both still fairly new I want to spend a
bit more time with them I want to know
if having an awesome speaker is
worthwhile or if being able to see
personal information or maybe even
seeing my photos from my albums I want
to know which one resonates with me a
bit more so will see what I choose but
let me know what you guys think I'll
have a poll in this video I want
let me know what you think is the better
option right now remember this one it
goes for about two hundred and thirty
bucks
versus one hundred and fifty but before
we wrap up this video guys we got to
give a huge shout-out to our sponsor
simply safe simply safe is a home
security service that monitors your home
24/7 so if there's an emergency like a
break-in they'll notify both you and the
police and they offer a ton of different
devices to use with their service I'm
talking security cameras motion
detectors carbon monoxide detectors even
a panic button which i think is really
cool so if you've got something going on
you hear some weird noises you probably
want to use that button too much but
there is a panic button so you can get
in touch with the police and not have to
worry about finding your phone or
something and you guys know we just
moved into this house so security is on
the forefront of our minds I know for my
mancave I'm gonna want to have a ton of
different sensors and whatnot going on
down there so that I know if someone
tries to mess with my tech I'm gonna be
covered it was also nice is that the
system is actually fairly priced and
it's equipped for the worst case
scenario so if you lose power or the
Wi-Fi goes out you don't have to worry
it'll still work without power coming to
your home overall guys I'm pretty happy
to be partnering with them with all the
tech that you guys see on the channel
you know security is a really big deal
for me so if you guys want to learn more
about simply safe and maybe save you
doing 25% off your order during Black
Friday be sure to check out simply
safecom slash your average consumer and
learn more but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did we've the cool guy
or girl that gives this video a thumbs
up definitely let me know if you're
excited to see this whole building the
ultimate smart home video but till then
guys our average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
