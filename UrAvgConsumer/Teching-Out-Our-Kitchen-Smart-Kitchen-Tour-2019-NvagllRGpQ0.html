consumer and we finally have our first
episode of building the ultimate smart
home and as you can tell we are starting
with the kitchen and huge shout out to
Arry for hooking this kitchen up making
it look as beautiful as it does and
we've got a lot of cool tech inside of
here guys but first we're gonna start
off with today's sponsor and that is
brilliant home control so what we've got
right here guys is a smart home control
and this thing is cool
so of course you see these little dials
or sliders over here that controls the
lights so we can just take this bring
the lights down turn them up so you got
all those controls like they're dimmable
lights you know that's what you expect
so you have a smart panel over here
where you can control the lights you can
go in and see the individual settings
for each one but what's also great is
that not only can you control light
switches but you can also control things
like music so we have a sono system
hooked up over here so if we want to
play some music I can just go in
it's cool baby it's cool so right from
the screen we can control the lights and
the music and we can even control things
with our voice using Amazon now for us
that's great because that means we no
longer need to have an Amazon echo dot
or echo show whatever it may be we don't
need to have one of those on our counter
tops ari hates having things on the
countertops so that is a lifesaver
you guys take a look right here you'll
notice it has a built in camera now you
might be wondering why do you need a
camera in your light switch but the
thing is if you have multiple of these
you could go ahead and use these cameras
to create an intercom system so all you
have to do is hit the little intercom
select the room that you want to reach
out to and then hit the little video or
you could even just do voice and you see
it a little light come on
and this is our study and cookie is
answering what's up cookie so you got
ahold to talk hey cookie
anyway you guys can see the potential
there and this thing also works with the
ring video doorbell so if you want to
see what's going on outside you actually
have access to that you can just hit the
camera button right here and then boom
you can see what's going on right from
your doorbell so you can do a ton of
cool things you can set up alarms it
even has a motion sensor so if you want
it to automatically turn on the lights
when you come into a room it'll do that
and it can also turn it off after it
sees no movement for about 10 minutes
whatever you want to set it to but if
you guys want to learn more about this
I'll of course have links down below in
the description
now appliances are the heart of any
kitchen and having smart appliances are
even cooler and what we've got right
here guys our Samsung appliances that
are absolutely game-changing so we've
got the Samsung family hub smart fridge
over here we've also got the double oven
system over here we've got the range and
we've also got the dishwasher and what's
great is that they all work together to
create a very nice ecosystem so first of
all the fridge this thing has a smart
display we actually saw it in Best Buy
and that's how we knew we were getting
old we fell in love
with this we never thought we would
freak out over a refrigerator the way we
did when we saw this thing and as you
can see we have it personalized to our
cells we have a nice little row of
pictures you guys can see our little
girl cookie over here Cookie Monster so
on the screen you can of course see
widgets that you would typically want on
any smart display now the real
game-changer right here guys is having
access to apps so you have a long list
of apps over here and you can even do
cool things like use this app called
view inside where you can see everything
inside of your fridge right from here
and you also have access to this app
this view inside right from your
smartphone you can even do one thing
that is really really cool and that is
sync this up to your Smart TV so if you
have a Samsung TV maybe you're watching
something in one of your bedrooms and
it's a live show you don't want to miss
what's going on but you need to get a
snack or something or you really got to
go downstairs you can just have whatever
is playing on that screen go right to
the fridge itself I'm telling you guys
it is just crazy how it all works
together with all the Samsung products
so you can even play music this thing
has speakers it has a mic you can
activate big speed do all that kind of
stuff guys the fridge is awesome
what can I say and I think ours is
pretty great it holds a lot of food we
have the second drawer over here where
we got like tons of soda lots of drinks
we got our freezer in the bottom but
let's talk about some of the other cool
smart appliances that we have here right
here we have what our double oven this
is the double oven right re
so he's been the one who's like I need
this I need that I need this in my
kitchen so she knows all the stuff
better than I do I just know what they
do really well so we got the microwave
up top oven on the bottom this is the
double oven right oh so you have two
different zones within the single oven
okay so it's a duo and what's cool is
that you can set all the controls that
you need to right from up top so this is
really awesome because for people like
us who don't know how to cook that well
we can actually just set this to
whatever we need so if we want to do a
healthy cook we can see how to preheat
it for like grilled chicken baked potato
salmon steak eat salmon steak that's
crazy
now I didn't mention how you can use
these with the smart things app and
there's a smart control feature right
here where you can access and preheat
things right from the phone so right
here we got our galaxy s 10 + and you
can see right from the top of the screen
right in our notification center we can
see all of the smart appliances that we
have here so like I said before you can
go ahead and check the status of each
cavity and you can even set the
temperature how long you want it to go
for start yes and boom
tell me that isn't crazy so you can do
that there and you can also do it with
the range as well you have access to
everything right from the app and they
all talk to each other so they know
exactly what's going on the statuses are
all shared right here so it makes it a
very nice cohesive environment and you
just you really can't beat it guys and
the cool thing about this range right
here is that you have access to two
zones so this is one so if you want to
just kinda bake a little piece of
lasagna or you know make some lasagna
listen I don't know guys
for all you cooks out there you know
what you would do with this but you have
this little area but if you need more if
you need more space you have access to
this entire thing so this is nice if you
want to make multiple dishes because you
can kind of separate the temperature so
if this part needs to be a lot hotter
and this one not so much you can have
that kind of control here we love this
thing even though we've used it how many
times re yeah zero times baby but it's
got the tech we need mom and dad come on
out we hungry so obviously IRA and I
love that our appliances are all smart
but there are a couple of smaller
products that are smart as well the
first being this toaster from cuisine
art and I gotta give Marquez a shout-out
for putting me on to this like two years
now you'll notice that there aren't any
levers over here we just have buttons we
have a little screen over here telling
us just how high our setting is check
this out when you're ready to tow
something all you do is hit that toast
button and look how it goes down all
nice and calm oh that's nice guys and
when you're ready to cancel it or maybe
your toast is ready it's not gonna do
that crazy pop that freaks you out
it's nice calm this is a it's a fancy
toaster y'all pinkies up all right but
we have some other cool things as well
over here this is like what you come to
expect we've got a Google Home Hub so
let's say we're too far from the fridge
we want to ask Google something we want
Google to pull up some information for
us so it is cool to have you here I
figured we gotta have one of these
displays hear the echo show was a real
it was a really hard decision to not
have the echo show in here because it is
super loud big display sounds great but
we went with the smaller but still very
useful Google Home Hub and we actually
have these in the entire house but right
next to the Google Wi-Fi we actually
have this electric tea kettle it's a
nice piece of tech because one we don't
have to have it sitting on our stove we
just have it right here we put out water
inside and what's cool is that it has
these LED lights so when you power it on
right now it'll tell it'll show you what
the based on the color just how hot it
is so the hotter you get it you'll see
the different colors so you can set the
temperature that you want right from the
side of here it's nice because it's you
don't have to sit there and you know
countdown how long you've had a kettle
on the stove some coffee freaks out
there I know would appreciate that
oh gosh area is gonna kill me she wants
you all to know that she is working on
replacing the knobs that we have over
here they might they might be a little
mismatched we got a couple of them you
got a couple of them done but they're a
little bit mismatched so for all you
hawk-eyed folks out there she wants you
guys to know we're in the process okay
so don't judge and we also got the the
dishwasher over here this is actually
kind of cool it's just a dishwasher but
when it's done washing the dishes it'll
automatically slightly open up play a
chime and let all the steam out now
here's the last piece of tech that I
think is really cool but we have this
cool cutting board but was really cool
about this is this little side piece
right here so you have a digital scale
built right into it so you can just turn
this on throw something on top and then
you can see how much it weighs so you
can get the exact amount when you you
know chopping up your ingredients you
can see it in two different units you
can see it in your own PSA's and grams
so this is nice Airy Haughton will we
use this one no mom and dad now we
talked about all this food and food
making but what about when you're done
with all that right well we got this
awesome trash can over here by
simplehuman now what makes a trash can
awesome how can you put tech into
something like this check this out open
can boom magic y'all and this is not
using Wi-Fi to activate or anything it's
just listening out for the words open
can now this one also has two
compartments so you have your bit for
recycling you have your normal trash
over here now this is an absolutely
awesome trash can but there are two
things that I'm not really crazy about
one is the price tag I think this goes
for about like 200 bucks the second
thing is that it is also very very
sensitive to the command I can say
almost anything and randomly have it pop
open it is extremely sensitive if we
randomly see it just go up and down
we've kind of gotten used to it but if
that's something that's going to annoy
you you might not be too crazy about it
because it does it often but I still
love my little garbage can this thing is
awesome but I think that's pretty much
all of the tech that we have in here so
far but we will be adding even more
things later on this is 1.0 of the
kitchen hopefully you guys enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
give this video a thumbs up and can I
just give a shout out to the guy who did
our kitchen and who kind of like made
this thing as beautiful as it is huge
shout out to sing if you guys are
looking to remodel your
kitchen and do some cool things I'll
have his contact information down below
in the description but til next video
guys it's your average consumer base re
make me a sandwich please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
