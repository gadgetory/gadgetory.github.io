consumer and it's time for another ask
you a see how old are you seriously I
want to know by the time you guys see
this video I'll be 29 years old
cool edits your videos re is actually my
full-time editor now I saw her all the
trick she knows but of course you know
sometimes I can have sprinkles from you
I see magic on there but handles about
99% of everything now can we see your
average girlfriend answering these
questions
well then it'd be ask you AG and not UAC
so no I wouldn't get jealous about it
which comfortable do you rely on the
most per phone accessories well you guys
all know there are a ton of companies
out there who make phone accessories but
when it comes to phone cases I really
like to look at spigen first but when it
comes to iPhone cases
I either look at the Apple made ones
first ones that they do themselves for I
look at spigen and pretty much anything
else who knows but when it comes to
things like cables and other little
accessories I tend to look at Aki and
anchor how do I become a savage consumer
well can maybe you can find out if you
use hashtag ask you AC excited about the
new Xbox one X extremely excited
except it's not out yet can't wait are
you planning to get the Xbox one X
absolutely are you kidding me more power
smaller body some new consoles you know
I have to get my hands on all of them
scammers tired I couldn't survive
without it if you are not a youtuber
what do you think you would have ended
up as honestly it'd probably be
something in business and that's what
all my internships were related to
that's where I got my degree in but to
be honest I run my own business now so
kind of all falls in line new Mac Pro or
iMac Pro kinda hard to say since we
haven't seen the new Mac Pro just yet
but chances are people who need that
kind of power out of the any of those
machines are probably going to lean
towards the new Mac Pro since you're
most likely going to be able to upgrade
it and add more
power depending on how much you need
that does not mean the new imacro
doesn't look amazing though but I might
have to save my pennies for the Mac Pro
instead when will you do another game
room tour well I've been dying to do a
part two for the gamers paradise because
there's been a lot of changes here but I
think I'm going to wait until a year out
so that it's not too close so expected a
year from the last gamers paradise if
you haven't seen that video I'll link
down below in the description do you
think the iPad pro will be able to
replace the Mac books in the future
replace absolutely not
while I do think the iPad pro is getting
more and more powerful and it probably
will be able to compete with some real
laptops in the future but as far as
replacing the MacBook Pro definitely
don't think that's a good move there are
tons of people who rely on the macbook
pro like myself or day-to-day usage so
there's really no point MacBook Pro is
plenty portable when is Quinten making a
comeback whenever the next iPhone parity
is my friend set it up what game are you
most keen for from e3
if you don't follow me on social media
you might have missed me fanboying
on Dragon Ball Z fighter that game who
it looks amazing guys I had I played it
had a great match probably one of the
best fighting experiences I had it's
nostalgia and loves Dragon Ball Z all up
in there but it was an amazing
experience playing that one match at e3
I'm also very very excited for Monster
Hunter coming to PlayStation 4 Xbox one
X and the PC is going to be so so good
and there's probably a ton more that I
talked about over on Twitter so be sure
to follow me there if you want to know
what I thought about the games coming
out for e3 but yeah it's going to be a
good year coming up who is your favorite
anime character hmm that is an extremely
hard question but I think some of the
most likeable characters are from Hunter
hunter Gon and Killua
those are two amazing characters I
definitely have those at the top of my
list yeah what inspires your Ninja
Turtles backpack life for a lot of you
who don't know me like Austin does I
like to take a lot of stuff with me my
backpack
that's the name Ninja Turtle backpack
but I do
because I'm the kind of person who
doesn't like to be caught without having
my stuff with me and not being prepared
for whatever situation may come up so I
tend to bring a lot of tech a lot of my
favorite games with me so that if I'm
out and about and I want to get
something done or maybe I want to play
something I have all of my stuff at my
disposal because honestly I feel crazy
if I did it so I will forever be that
guy you can ask to borrow a cable or a
portable charger from or even a portable
gaming console because I will always
have those kind of things on deck what
Marvel or DC movie are you looking
forward to absolutely black panther he
is an extremely powerful character that
a lot of people don't even know about so
it's going to be really cool to see him
in all his glory on the big screen of
course I want to see spider-man as well
Justice League has my attention Thor
yeah Hulk's in it so that's going to be
cool
it's almost ever going to connect in a
way with Siri or Alexa I don't know if
that happened but I think it would be
awesome apples coming out with the home
pod so there's a chance that apples
probably not even looking to go that
route with Sonos and I don't really see
them working with Amazon in that
capacity but I think it would be really
cool if they went ahead and integrated
Alexa into this sonal system there are
tons of devices now on the market that
have Alexa integrated into it so seeing
that come to the sono system would be
mind-blowing like seriously hmm I don't
know that c-shell no value hey beeping
Apple put the 120 Hertz display on the
iPhone 8 I definitely think it's
possible to Apple would bring that
feature over to the new iPhone
especially since we've seen features
trickle down from older products over to
new ones
kind of like touch ID and even forced
touch and to be completely honest I'd be
surprised if they didn't those guys seem
really go with everything are you
kidding me gala screen goes with
everything that's why it's the best look
at this what do you use to edit your
videos well ever since I started my
youtube channel and dabbled in editing
I've done it all on Final Cut Pro 10 I
personally love it because it's super
simple and easy quick to learn and it
still has a lot of power and tools that
you need I heard Ethan have such a great
start but back in the day I was a noob
so I didn't know what I was missing but
as of today it is an amazing software
and honestly there's nothing I'm missing
from it so that is to go to but that's a
lot enough questions for today guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that give this
video thumbs up and I'll catch you guys
in the next one
so Venice your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
