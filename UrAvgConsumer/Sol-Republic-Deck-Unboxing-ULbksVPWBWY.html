consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the SOL Republic deck
speaker so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the SOL Republic deck this
is um in collaboration with Motorola as
you can see the Motorola symbols all
over so publix teaming up with them to
bring us this speaker this is a pretty
cool box um let's see if you open it up
you can see the deck right here and of
course this is this is typical solar
public boxing packaging rather and that
of course you get some information here
as well 360 full sound r2 sound engine
outdoor boost super power wireless
speaker phone so we can use this with
your phone of course um stereo out NFC
and Bluetooth so it's able to be paired
with up to five people so all kinds of
cool stuff heist mode so this looks
pretty cool has a lot of features um
let's get to the unboxing of it
the seal is actually broken already so
we don't have to worry about the
unboxing knife for right now so let's
just pull this out and grab this and
there you go
and we'll put this over here and alright
so here we have it this is the SOL
Republic deck it's a very small speaker
looks pretty cool very portable for sure
um I'm not sure what this little hole is
for I'll probably for like the base okay
it's like subwoofers usually have a hole
similar to this so alright umm up top
here you can see there it's pretty hard
to see actually because of all of these
little holes but um over here we have
the plus sign and we have a minus sign
over here so the volume control and
there's a Motorola button right here I
guess this is the power or no it's not
the power I'm not sure what that is
maybe for heist mode up top here you
have Bluetooth you have these five
I guess the sharing mode or something
and you have that singular mode of
course you have oxal√° reports in and
out so if you want to put a device in
with a cable you're able to do that and
of course it's charges with micro USB
which is really nice because that's a
standard cable and of course you have
the power button up top here and looking
around it that's about all of the
buttons that you'll get other statuses
has NFC and that's about it and of
course you have that big Sol Republic
logo right here so that's cool
and it's pretty grippy so this won't
move around a lot it's pretty grippy and
let's see what else we get inside of
here so when we open it up let's see
we've got a pouch and we've got a wall
adapter and it has two USB ports
interesting so we've got that you've got
a USB cable and you've got an auxiliary
cable so you can plug this into a device
if you want to listen to your music
through that so that's pretty cool and
this is the pouch that it comes with so
here we have it and let's see I don't
know what this little flap is for but
let's see let's turn this thing inside
see how good of a fit this is so there
you go
I'm guessing okay so that's what that
little flap was you kind of seal it
inside once you get it in there so there
you go this is it so pretty cool stuff
you've got some warranty information
what else we got here
and we've got a little booklet that's
also in here this is probably the manual
tells you all kinds of stuff here's an
example of a foam being put on top of it
for the NFC feature so I'm pretty sure
you can sync it through bluetooth we're
using that NFC feature to make it a
little quicker and while we're in here
let's see what that little Motorola
button does it's the multifunction
button so press to play and pause music
answer and end calls outdoor mode heist
lock so
okay so that's a lot of features in that
little Motorola button that's pretty
cool so before we end off this video
let's see if I could turn this thing on
I'm not gonna pair it or anything but I
just wanna see what happens when you
turn gone that's pretty cool so we've
got some flashing lights
you heard the power-on sound so that's
pretty cool it's got a it's ready to
pair and it just told me that it's ready
to pair so that's pretty cool I guess
it'll play those that sound every once
in awhile to let you know it's ready to
pair okay so that's about it um pretty
cool stuff I can't wait to pair it um
that's gonna get annoying pretty quickly
so we're gonna turn this thing off and
that's about it guys so I'm gonna have a
review probably gonna have an outdoor
sound test and all that good stuff that
