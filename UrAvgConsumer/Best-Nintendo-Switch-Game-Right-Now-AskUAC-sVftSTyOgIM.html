and it's time for another ask you AC
best platoon weapon and we got Ari with
the hashtag save but for the best gluten
weapon right now I think it's the arrow
spray mg I think that's the best one so
far because it has a wide range it seems
to be pretty fast as shooting down
people and it just covers a lot of
ground so I'm gonna have to say that's
the best one that I've had so far I'm
only like level 21 though how did you
get money for purchasing things at the
beginning of your YouTube channel at the
beginning of YouTube I pretty much just
saved up for the things that I featured
on the channel luckily I had a little
work-study job at my college so I would
save those checks buy products that I
personally wanted and then I could also
feature on the channel so I kind of
killed two birds with one stone
but that's pretty much how I started
when are we gonna see your average baby
no time soon what do you think of Reds
holographic smartphone I think it looks
kind of interesting I can't say I'm
completely sold on the actual look and
size of it but based on Marquez's video
it seems like it's gonna be a decent
phone the idea of it being modular
sounds really cool but what I'm most
excited about are the camera optics and
I can't wait to see what kind of images
and videos we'll be getting out of this
phone how high-quality they'll be if you
don't know red as a company they make
cinematography cameras really high-end
stuff for image capturing so I'm sure
we're gonna see some of that brought
down to the phone level how much better
will it be than what's already out we
don't know yet but cameras are my
favorite things to look at when you're
talking about phones so I'm excited to
see how it stacks up what brand was your
t-shirt of the ultimate MacBook Pro set
up a sip I got that from Express what
was it hmm
most likely Express what's your favorite
video game of all time that's a tough
one I'm gonna have to say it's between
Pokemon silver and Legend of Dragoon now
my reasoning for both Pokemon silver I
put a ton of hours into it I think
that's when I really really fell in love
with Pokemon it was just an amazing
amazing game introduces a ton of cool
features we saw a new generation of
Pokemon it was just great all-time
favorite but when it comes to Legend of
Dragoon that game pretty much shaped the
kind of gamer that I am today I
completely fell in love with RPGs
because of that game and I later got
into things like Final Fantasy and all
other kinds of RPGs Legend of Dragoon
was that gateway for me and it's an
underrated RPG that I think it's just
amazing it's on the Vita now so if you
haven't played it if you have a Vita
might want to check it out is there any
tech gadget that has sentimental value
to you definitely and I'd have to give
that to the t-mobile Sidekick I actually
made a video about tech that I loved in
high school the t-mobile Sidekick man I
felt awesome with that phone it was kind
of my gateway into smartphones of any
sort and I felt like the coolest kid on
the block whenever I had it out listen
what's the man back in the day man I was
the man so definitely that one that
phone has a special place in my heart
based on the leaks on what's been said
about each I phone eight or Galaxy Note
8 as of right now there's no way for me
to straight up pick one or the other
because they're both not out yet we have
no idea what's really happening with
both so I can't straight-up pick one but
from what we've heard I gotta say I'm
leaning towards the iPhone 8 only
because you know eight sounds like it's
going to be the s 8 plus plus so I want
to see how Samsung is gonna
differentiate the new Note 8 versus the
s8 plus besides just the pen I want to
see what more they're gonna be bringing
to it I guess there's also going to be
the dual cameras so we'll see the notes
are always great so we'll see how that
does but the iPhone 8 looks like you
know we're getting some drastic changes
in terms of the screen looks like Apple
might be finally getting rid of those
giant bezels I think it might be a good
look for the iPhone this year but until
we get the facts about both I can't make
any hardcore decisions yet
what is the best Mouse for gaming in
your opinion for that one I think I'm
gonna have to go with you logitech g502
or the Logitech g600 2v 602 is my
personal all-around
favorite it's a wireless mouse so it's
great for doing anything taking around
with you has a lot of macro buttons but
if you're a hardcore gamer you need
something wired the 502 is an excellent
option the Bible shows personally what I
use from my gaming setup right now so
those are my two favorites and they're
definitely not that expensive so that's
a bonus how did you propose to your
average girlfriend funny enough I posted
a video about it on this channel I'll
have it linked down below if you guys
have never seen it but I kind of tricked
her into it she thought she was gonna be
doing something else but she was coming
to get proposed to so if you haven't
seen it links down below I thought it
was pretty funny our more themed gadget
backpacks coming absolutely you guys
know I love doing my backpack videos I
think for the next one I want to do
something gaming related I'm not too
sure just yet but if there's any
specific theme that you guys want to see
you know you gotta let me know in the
comments down below if you really like
those backpack videos be sure to hit
that like button front notes real will
you be playing the switch demo for
monster hunter coming out this month
absolutely once it drops I'm gonna be
all over it but I'm a little torn
because there's gonna be a different
version I think for the PlayStation and
Xbox and that's version that I know I'm
gonna be playing with my cousins my
friends that is the real version for me
so I don't want to devote too much time
into the switch version but it's also
the portable version so it's better than
me but I don't know I don't want to
devote too much time to two separate
games that are pretty much the same
thing so I'm a little torn but I will be
playing that demo day best switch game
right now
overall I'd say zelda breath of the wild
that's just an amazing amazing game but
if you've already played that splatoon 2
is something you have to look into Eric
put me on to that game and we have
fallen in love we got her sister playing
it it's just super super fun I never
played the first platoon so jumping into
this one it was just like what degree do
you hold I got my bachelor's degree in
business marketing from Drexel
University and actually graduating I
didn't think I would be in the field
that I am now but here I am and my
degree
actually kind of matches up with what I
do and I feel like I'm one of the rare
ones but it's cool do you think this
should be more gaming tablets like the
Nvidia shield tablet I don't know while
I love gaming and especially portable
gaming you guys know I'm a huge fan of
that I just don't see who's gonna be
going out and buying a game tablet I
just think that it'd be a waste of
resources people probably wouldn't be
picking them up it'd be hard for the
company making it to really push the
product and get it to hit big numbers
honestly if people are looking to game
one to go they're probably gonna get a
gaming laptop or maybe one of the
handheld systems by Nintendo or Sony so
I just don't see it being worth the time
what was your first piece of smart home
tech and why that I'm pretty sure the
first piece of smart home tech i got was
the philips hue strips used to see it in
videos all the time with little glowing
light in the back it just looked awesome
still looks awesome so that was the
first thing that I picked out that I was
able to control on my phone and then it
kind of just exploded from there smart
home tech everywhere now so that was my
first one bill ever compared the sony
MDR 1000 next to those outrageously
priced 10 to $50,000 headphones I know I
think I'm rich but I don't got $10,000
lying around just a buy some headphones
so there's no chance that I was able to
compare something like that I did try
the Sennheiser I think Sennheiser
orpheus room something like that is 50 K
I tried that for like 30 seconds there
was absolutely no way I was gonna be
able to compare it to some guys at 1,000
X so nope I probably never will are you
thinking about buying the Red Raven I'm
not gonna lie the thought of a red has
crossed my mind and the thought of debt
has also crossed my mind and the thought
of erasing heck no also happened a
couple of times so no I'm not getting
the Red Raven it's a little cheaper than
the standard Reds it's $15,000 but I
don't know man if I'm gonna get a red
I'm gonna want something that's in the
proper lineup
EPIK w's i want to be able to see 8k
that's just the tech guy I'm gonna want
the best and I think what I'm using
right now looks pretty decent so I'm not
gonna upgrade why do you not pick up
Sony phones as much as I love Sony there
doesn't seem to be much demand for me to
review Sony phones so I haven't ever
really looked into it if I had a bunch
of people saying when are you gonna get
from Sony phone that would put him on my
radar but as of right now that's
probably like the only question I got
about a cell phone in forever I'm scared
to vlog outside how would I overcome
that now we all know vlogging outside in
the public is awkward as there's so many
people around you they're all gonna be
looking wondering what you're doing why
are you talking to a camera but in this
day and age I think vlogging is getting
more popular so people might not be as
freaked out as you might think and also
you have to think about the bigger goal
in mind what you want to achieve when
you're doing your vlogging if you have a
goal you want to have a huge vlogging
channel you just gotta tell yourself hey
I'm doing this for the vlog to be
completely honest that's the exact
phrase that I would use all the time
when me and Ariel are vlogging back in
the day I would just say good for the
vlog do it for the vlog keep the goal in
mind just do what you got to do so you
can be at the place you want to be bit
of a weird one but where is the place
you'd love to visit and would you record
any videos there if you could to be
honest I don't have a huge list of
places that I'd love to go to Japan was
that place for me and I was lucky enough
to go last year but it's one of those
places that I love so much that I want
to go back as many times as possible and
since I write you did the whole tourist
thing I think making a video out there
would be awesome I definitely think
that'd be pretty cool and might be
something I might look into in the
future favorite sport or teams now I am
NOT a huge sports guy but I've been
paying a lot of attention to basketball
in the recent years pretty much thanks
to LeBron James I'm a huge fan of his
he's the reason why I watch basketball
and know anything about basketball just
because I kind of like what he stands
for and what he does in the game so I
more like more so like LeBron James more
than any team so whatever team he's on
I'll be honest that's the team I'm
moving forward
I want to see him win so basketball and
whatever team LeBrons on but if he comes
to any other sport I'm repping New York
but that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you liked
these AskMe videos where you get to
learn a little bit more about me
definitely be the cool guy girl that
hits like button and I'll catch you guys
in the next one
until then it's your average consumer
