going on guys your average consumer and
yes I heard you you want me to talk
about more affordable tech well right
here we've got a $600 laptop this is the
Dell Inspiron 15 55 70 now the question
is how far can you get with a $600
laptop but first let's talk about what
you actually get when you pick this up
this is a 15-inch laptop and you've got
a good set of i/o here and on the left
side you've got your power port HDMI
slot Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports and a
headphone jack and on the right side
we're looking at another USB port but
this one is USB 2.0 and you also get an
SD card slot and it's actually kind of
nice to see an SD card slot here even
some of the high end laptops I've been
using recently don't even include one
and even though this is a 15-inch laptop
with a full 1080p display you still get
a number pad with your keyboard so if
you like to have your keyboard on the
side you definitely have that option
here and you've even got a fingerprint
scanner right here on the power button
which is actually really surprising
considering this is a $600 laptop that's
not a feature that I expect to see here
at all you're also getting a Windows
precision touchpad so if you want a bit
more accuracy from the touchpad you're
gonna be able to have that here not to
mention it does have an HD quality web
camera which looks okay it'll be fine
for any video chat Skype calls maybe
taking a picture here there but sorry
and for a bit of a spec rundown we're
looking at an Intel 8 generation Core i5
processor we also get four gigs of ram
here but it includes 16 gigs of intel's
octane memory and for those of you who
aren't familiar with intel's octane
memory it basically remembers the
applications that you use the most and
it begins to start launching them a lot
quicker than normal now this is great
because this has a regular hard drive
inside but with intel's octane memory
you'll be able to launch those
applications as if you're using an SSD
and that's great because you immediately
start to see the value here when you're
not paying for an SSD when you're
getting SSD like performance so if
you're someone who tends to use really
large files maybe you're a creator or
maybe you even game games tend to be
really large you'll be able to do those
a lot faster but honestly I probably
wouldn't recommend gaming on this guy
since it doesn't have a dedicated
graphics card but if you guys are
interested in other value laptops that
do have dedicated graphics I'll of
course include links down below in the
description but if you do want to put a
lot of applications or large files on
here you're gonna be able to do that
because you do
a 1 terabyte hard drive now it's great
to talk about specs and all of that but
we got to see how it actually performs
see if it can handle the Dolby sweet and
some other applications and I got the
perfect guy to try that out with all
right so we got J on Photoshop over here
how's it going J are you done honestly I
didn't know what to expect since this is
like a 600 dollar laptop but it's a Oh
No did you just you made it all black oh
okay that's dope that's dope
so no issues no stutters just nice nice
all right
photoshop's ago we watching one piece
you know the best series of all time
it's looking kind of Chris not gonna lie
the screen is pretty good but like if I
turned it the viewing angles aren't that
good and even when it comes to
multitasking this thing can handle it
fine you guys can see I've got Chrome
and a few tabs open here I've got one
note and a script opened right here on
the side and if you open it here you can
see I have a couple of other
applications open as well but what's
nice here guys is that I even have like
a wallpaper running in the back live
wallpaper so I've got a lot going on but
this doesn't slow down the computer it
seems to handle it just fine so if you
want to do multitasking and this thing
can definitely handle it now we know
what's inside of it but who is this
actually for I feel like from what I've
experienced with this laptop it's for
the everyday person probably 99% of you
watching so if you're looking for
something that's dependable good for
watching content web browsing all the
everyday stuff this thing is gonna do
you just right and you get the extra
value of having something like the
fingerprint scanner and of course that
octane memory so over time this is not
gonna be one of those laptops that just
gets slower and slower as you have them
this is actually going to improve over
time which is a really big benefit since
you got that octane memory but since
I've got a ton of laptops I figured I'd
give this guy away it'd probably be
better off with someone who can use it
on a daily basis so all you have to do
it
- this giveaway guy says leave a comment
down below letting me know how you'd use
it and of course you got to subscribe to
the channel but that about wraps it up
guys gonna be a quick giveaway probably
just one week be sure to follow me on
social media so you know who wins and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
