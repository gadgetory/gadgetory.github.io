consumer and today tis pixel day is that
even a thing it should be a thing but
today Google announced their brand new
pixel line up from the pixel slate which
is a new tablet the Google home hub
which is a tablet / Google home and now
of course the pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL and
I'm not gonna lie guys they got me
wanting to use this phone because of all
the smart features they introduced today
and these ones are pretty much identical
except for their size and battery
capacity so pretty much everything that
I say will apply to both phones unless I
say otherwise well let's get the
differences out of the way first the
pixel 3 as a 5.5 inch display while the
pixel 3 XL has a 6.3 inch display so
you've got a nicer bigger display but it
does come at a cost guys the XL now has
a pretty deep notch so if you're not a
fan of notches you're gonna want to look
at the 3 but both of these display our
OLED display so that means you're gonna
get those darker blacks and those
vibrant colors that's pretty much what
you come to expect from a flagship
device these days so hopefully there are
no display issues like we saw last year
I definitely have my fingers crossed and
as we continue to look at the front of
the phone you'll see that there are
front-facing speakers which are supposed
to be 40% louder which is really
substantial so I'm definitely interested
in hearing how those sound and being
able to actually hold this thing in my
hands I gotta say guys it felt really
nice and premium the back of the phone
of course has that two-tone design that
Google always goes with with the pixel
but the back is actually really smooth
on the lower part
it's got like a metal feel it's got that
same finish that we kind of see with the
1 plus 6 and the device that I had in my
hand today had a couple of scratches so
hopefully that's not indicting to be
seeing in the future but I gotta say
guys it feels very very nice to the hand
and an absolute best deal premium but as
you'd expect the presentation focus on a
lot of the smart features that Google
was implementing with the new pixels and
of course all the cool features that
they bring over to their new camera
which was the standout feature with the
pixel 2 and I have really high hopes
guys the pixel tools camera was my
favorite on any smartphone until the
pixel 3 came around I'm assuming that
the picks of threes camera is going to
top it and become my favorite and what
I'm loving guys is the fact that they
improved my favorite feature on the
pixel all together and that's portrait
mode now it's portrait mode when you
take a photo you can actually adjust the
Det
so if you want more or less Boca you now
have the ability to control that and you
can even use that feature to change what
you have in focus which is insane
because this is all happening with one
camera where we're seeing the biggest
changes with the camera is actually with
the front-facing camera
Google has introduced a dual camera
system up front something they didn't
even do in the back but the reason why
they're implementing it in the
front-facing camera is so that we can
now finally take group selfies without
problems so when you jump into the
camera app you will now see a little
slider for the front-facing camera so
that you can go from a normal view to a
wider view so that you can get multiple
people in your shot and Google's really
taking advantage of machine learning to
pick the right frame when you take a
photo so if you happen to blink or move
a little bit and it's blurry machine
learning will detect that that's not the
best frame to use and pick the one that
has everyone's eyes open
no blurry shots and you actually get a
nice clean photo and this is a feature
that they're calling top shot but
hands-down the most mind-blowing feature
that I've seen so far is night sight
Google actually showed an example of a
pretty underexposed shot at night that
turned into an amazing shot you guys can
see the difference here this is
something I absolutely need to test and
see how it works in person that way
we're no longer relying on flash when we
take photos in really low light
conditions and they even found ways to
improve the best voice assistant out
right now Google assistant by adding
some really amazing features I got my
mind blown when I saw the call screening
future guys what I'm telling you this
thing is a game-changer if you happen to
get spam calls it is so awesome because
Google assistant will actually screen
their calls they've worked up some magic
where the Google assistant can actually
speak to the person calling so it'll
actually have dialogue with a person and
you'll be able to see a transcript while
the call is happening so you know
exactly who's calling and what's
happening so if you get those
telemarketing calls or those scam calls
the Google assistant will be able to
intercept the call and you'll be able to
watch the conversation as it happens so
if it's a scam you can hang up right
away or if it's someone you actually
want to talk to you can pick it up and
I'm telling you guys that is a game
changer Harry unfortunately deals with a
ton of bad scam calls so I know
something like this would help her
immensely and for those of you concerned
about security Google also introduced
the Titan M chip which allows the device
to be a lot more secure there seems to
be a lot of focus on protecting consumer
data and you can definitely see that in
the settings so that is only a good
thing what the pixel three you of course
get that fast charging right out of the
box so 15 minutes of charging will get
you seven hours of usage which is just
an insane number we got to test it out
and make sure that that claim is true
but that is a very exciting promise
we've also finally got wireless charging
on the pixels and at Google actually
introduced the pixel stand which add
some more smart features to the phone
when you're actually using it pixel
stand seems pretty cool you can see
things like your nest cameras see the
music that you're listening to lots of
cool features but we'll talk more about
that in another video all right guys so
we have to move they're doing
construction in New York is not letting
me be great right now but back to this
pixel and the last thing I think people
will appreciate what the new pixels is
digital well being
now we've seen something similar on the
iPhone as well as different apps like
moment where they allow you to know just
how much you're using your phone certain
apps how much you're picking it up all
of that kind of stuff if you're really
conscious about how much you're using
your device and you want to kind of
bring it to normal levels you'll be able
to use this and monitor your usage this
is of course gonna be great for parents
but all-in-all guys those are all the
cool things that got added to the pixel
we still got some really cool things to
check out like the pixel slate as well
as the Google Home Hub those are things
I really want to get my hands on but
that's going to be in another video and
for those of you interested in picking
up the pixel is officially open for
pre-order today and it's starting at
$7.99 so it is on the higher end
hopefully you guys enjoyed it let me
know in the comments down below what you
think of the new phones I know some
people aren't too crazy about the look
of the three XL because of that knotch
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
give this video a thumbs up
now I'll catch you guys to the next one
till then it's your average consumer
