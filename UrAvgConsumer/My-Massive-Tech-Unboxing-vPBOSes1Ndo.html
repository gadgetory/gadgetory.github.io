and and you can see here you've got a
ton of packages now I actually made a
post on Instagram and Twitter asking if
I should make a video opening these up
and you guys said yes so here we have
this video it looks like we got a lot of
stuff here so grab some popcorn a club
soda and let's enjoy some unboxing
alright so I've got my trusty unboxing
knife now I'll pick a package where you
want to pick one nah like just chuck
your go ahead a pickle it okay cool I'll
just be savaging here again so let's
open this up I don't know who this is
from because we took off all the labels
so nobody runs up in my HQ like you say
you would all of you guys who said you
were going to rob me if you found my
spot I gotta be careful so let's open
this up
we've got ah the SteelSeries are two
three is there something up ssin
business card yummy oh this is no still
fears artistry this is a gaming headset
this is actually part of a line there's
like the arcs are three five and seven I
already have the seven and I've been
using that quite a bit but they gave me
the three to try out as well since they
wanted to you know stand my knowledge on
the line so the top is open
I'll even though shitboxes tried to
little boxing oh my god I remember the
last time we did a video like this a lot
of unboxing oh I like that because it
hides out suck at this take out and boom
here they are now oh so these are a
little different the headband so okay
check this out guys so it has a little
band inside so that it can adjust your
head size but this one's a little
different from the arc de sevens octave
7 comes out and all around the headband
this one is just on the inside so these
are it these go for about 80 bucks
so these are pretty inexpensive
something cool SteelSeries in with this
arc this line is that they kept the same
sound quality from the three all the way
to the seventh so no matter which one
you pick up the sound quality is going
to be the same they didn't want someone
who wants to save a bit more money on
the threes to feel like they were
getting a lesser quality headphone but
they all have different features and
whatnot so that's what you're paying for
but these are the still series
artistry's we've got a lot more go
through so let's put the concert aside
and before I jump into the next box
there are no sponsors on this video guys
nobody has pay me to say anything about
what you're seeing here but all right
let's go into the next box uh this one
I'm not sure what this is from but let's
see oh um hi jackpot
check oh yeah
all right so this is some color where I
got some customized gaming controllers I
chose the color color where cook them up
oh I'm excited
some of you might have seen me tweet
these color schemes they look awesome
but let me get them out the box so I got
a ps4 controller and an Xbox one elite
controller which was not open for a
ferry I can already see this so let's
put that to the side I want to see what
the Xbox looks like now I am extremely
excited about these because these go
with the gamers paradise they're
supposed to match the colors
I chose the color completely made my own
design ready thanks for that momentary
airy
yo we see this seriously this is so
clean Oh Oh baby
now look so the Xbox one elite
controller you can customize the buttons
or you can switch it up there however
you want to play it color you guys this
is good is it good

it just goes so perfectly alright
I'm fan boiling right now not really I'm
on both sides

so perfectly with a game of paradise
color where it shoots out to you for
hooking me up a ton lately color
customized a ton of cool tech from
gaming controllers headphones lots of
good stuff I'll have their link down
below in the description check them out

like I'm done here I thought I got the
grand prize but we got more unboxings to
do so let's jump into that alright let's
see what's over here FedEx the odd one
out so let's see what we've got inside
of this FedEx bag oh the beats pill plus
now I haven't tried the beats pill in a
while I had like the very first one so
now they've got this special red color
product red I want to see what this
sounds like it's been a while since I
tried out one of the beep speakers so
this is going to be dope oh oh this is
like a bright red to turn this rhythm
okay did they make this bigger I feel
like you've gotten a little bit bigger
which is a good thing because of the
speaker let's see what else we get you
got the lightning cable and a travel
pouch it looks like and a wall adapter
and okay that's pretty much it I'm sure
there has to be some kind of booklet
somewhere might be emphatic in there
yeah you've got all the paperwork on
their body read so uh cool
I can we try this one out the boom
bespoke plus and guys I don't have a
video plan for everything that you see
here so if there's a particular video
that you want to see based on the
products that I have here I'm going to
list a comment down below I don't even
need a knife for these Amazon boxes you
can practically like this let them open
with your hand
they're like the easiest boxes in the
world to open and let's squeak OH
hmm I know what this is y'all can't see
with yet so there's going to be a bit of
mystery here I'm going to put this to
the side I've been waiting for this one
stop following me there's a secret let
it go beat it alright let's try this
again
oh okay these are this is I guess the
mod kit for the Astro a 50s these
leather ear cups are supposed to give
you some better sound isolation not
something I really needed but I do want
to see what the comfort level is going
to be like with these so uh pick these
up I did a video on the a 50s recently
so go ahead and check that out I'll have
the link down below in the description
but I'm interested in trying these get
for like 40 bucks worth over price hmm
amazonbasics I'm not sure what this is I
don't remember pop it open
oh well the most exciting unboxing that
we're going to have yet today
some the chargeable double-a battery
yeah little manila envelope and being
too exciting until I'm sure okay this is
just too much
where is this oh okay know about these
either come on now I stopped looking
over there
oh sorry for the secrets guys but it
can't be spoiling no video ah I've been
waiting on this so over here we've got
this Belkin surge protector with a
built-in portable charger that is good
stuff folks you guys know in my tech
survival kit I always carry that Belkin
surge protector but this one gives you a
bit more flexibility since it has a
built-in portable charger in it so
there's up to usefulness and it's like
30 bucks I think very solid how many
milliamp hours I think
3000 so should charged up just about any
phone want at least links to everything
will be down in the description but I'm
happy for that one and over here I got
the strategy guide for Star Ocean I
don't know I got the scholarship game a
while so I haven't even really played it
yet but it's the next title that I want
to jump into I don't know I haven't
heard the greatest things about it but I
think I'll enjoy it
I love RPGs though so we'll throw this
one to the side and we got this big guy
there's the last one
it's the biggest box inside so far let's
pop it open and we'll slice this one
down the middle just whip it whatever is
this box open
Oh Amazon we got problems and I'm just
joking
so first things first boom yes I know it
looks like a toy but this is actually
going to be part of a video Green
Lantern he's probably one of my he is my
favorite a
superhero from the Justice League and
over here I probably already spoiled it
got it you've got a life-size a
life-size Green Lantern power battery

guys with some goodness but I mean I
guess you just gotta wait for the video

take a part in leave a comment down
