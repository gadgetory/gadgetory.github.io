Sumer and today we're gonna be doing a
camera comparison test of the iPhone a
plus and the Galaxy Note 8 and these are
probably some of the best smartphone
cameras that you can buy today so let's
see which is better so first up we're
gonna take a look at this picture of re
and these photos we're taking on the
rear cameras and immediately you can see
that these are both great quality photos
that I still can't believe came from
smart phones we're seeing a lot of nice
color with both but looking at the
iPhone you'll notice that it's got a bit
of a warmer tint to it which you'll
quickly notice as a theme here
throughout the video but taking a closer
look at some of the finer details you'll
notice some differences in the shadows
with the note 8 as it isn't crushing the
blacks as much and happens to be a bit
softer her curls don't look as defined
as they do with the iPhones photo and
what's surprising here though is that
the iPhone seems quite a bit more
vibrant which is not what the iPhone is
typically known for while the iPhone is
always taking great pictures they
usually come out a bit neutral toned but
this year they introduced a new color
filter which is why we see the change
now and with this picture we have a
closer subject and just like the
previous photo the iPhones overall image
is a bit warmer and it feels like the
colors pop out just a bit more but to be
honest which looks better color wise is
all up to personal preference
you'll notice more sharpness in the shot
taken on the iPhone again the rocks in
the shadow for example are more clearly
outlined than those in the picture with
the note 8 and if I'm being real with
you guys when taking some landscape
shots I could barely see a difference
between the two but when using the
included telephoto lens on both phones
that's when I started to see a
difference again
in color and a bit of the dynamic range
you'll notice you can see more leaves in
the shadowy areas on the iPhone shot and
it also looks like the iPhone has a bit
more color accuracy when taking a close
look at that Cathedral in the background
in reality that uppermost part of the
Cathedral is a mate green but the note 8
makes it look a bit more on the blue
side you can also see a bit more detail
with the water droplets coming from that
fountain on the iPhone and under note 8
the droplets look more like mist both
are obviously still great photos that
look almost identical unless you're
really looking for the differ
but now let's take a look at some
low-light shots low-light shots are
definitely impressive on both phones and
when these outdoor shots you can
immediately see that the iPhone is still
staying warm which I'm not a fan of to
be honest but as we've seen with
previous photos you do get a lot more
sharpness in details here which I think
anyone can appreciate and if you look at
the Statue shoes you can really start to
see this in the iPhone shot you can
clearly see edgings on the shoes and the
shoelace loops but some of that is lost
on the note eight shot but I think in
terms of wins for this category this
like many of the other shots is up to
personal preference I preferred the note
eight because of the color even though
it lacked the iPhone sharpness and over
here the note eight killed this indoor
low-light shot while the iPhone is a bit
more color accurate I just really love
the look of the shot here that we got
with the note eight this shot had no
lights
other than the RGB lights on the mouse
and the white light coming from the
monitor which it was connected to the
iPhone showed the color from the monitor
well but I think we honestly got a much
nicer look from the note eight it also
looks like we're seeing less grain from
the note eight in the areas around the
RGB lights it looks a bit smoother and
it can be because the note 8 takes
slightly softer photos but either way I
think it helped to produce a better
looking shot here now let's talk about
that selfie cam and since I can't
remember the last time I carried about a
selfie cam outside of a review I'm gonna
pass it on to Harry
hey guys out here so it's very obvious
that the front facing camera on the
iPhone 8 produced a selfie that's way
more vibrant with true blacks and a lot
more detail my selfie on the note 8
looks washed out whereas on the iPhone
my shirt color is definitely true to its
color my hair also looks closer to its
true color and my curls look way more
defined
thanks to that camera sharpness I would
be able to upload the iPhone camera as
is but with the note 8 I would have to
bump the saturation and edit it to make
it appear more vibrant and attractive
you can even see the same with this
selfie of me and Jed the iPhone 8 selfie
cam is several notches above the no 8
selfie cam thanks to the sharpness and
definitely the color and we even see the
same thing in this low-light selfie of
Gen overall the iPhone 8 is a little
warmer but still sure to the actual
color now when it comes to portrait mode
on the iPhone 8 and live focus mode on
the note 8 what
is the mode that causes those photos to
have those nice blurry backgrounds I
think we can pretty much expect the same
in terms of color temperature sharpness
and dynamic range but let's take a look
at the actual blur effect and see which
is better and first off both of these
photos are amazing and looking at them
right off the screen of the phone they
look great but when you blow it up you
can see the blur effect isn't as smooth
around the rim of the balloons on the
note 8th shot the iPhone separation
isn't exactly perfect here either
but it isn't as bad the iPhone also got
a bit blur happy around the word
District on the street sign but the note
8 happened to come out even worse
overall though for this being Samsung's
first time using a dual camera system to
create this look I think they did a
great job I was able to get some shots
where the blur effect matched that of
the iPhone with very little
imperfections what special about both
phones in this mode though is the
different kind of flexibility you get
after taking the shot with a note 8 you
can adjust the amount of blur in the
shot which I personally think is amazing
just in case the initial shot adds too
much or maybe reaches an area that
doesn't need it having the ability to
adjust later is great with the iPhones
portrait mode you'll be able to adjust
your photo with Apple's new portrait
lighting so if you want to give your
shot a different look afterwards you can
choose the one that you like a bit more
and lastly let's talk about the video
these phones are both capable of
shooting in 4k and have optical image
stabilization for smooth shots and so I
wanted to test that out with my boosted
board and from what I can tell the note
8 was a bit more shaky than the iPhone
and had quite a bit of distortion in the
dark areas and a bit in the sky with
some shots but I didn't really see much
of that with the iPhone there are a lot
of things that can be based on personal
preference when it comes to the cameras
but from what I've seen the iPhone just
performs better when it comes to video
the iPhones are also equipped with quite
a few more shooting modes when it comes
to video so when it comes to flexibility
it also beats out to know a in that
regard overall though guys both are
absolute beast when it comes to taking
photos or videos and you can't go wrong
with either and if you're on the fence
about woods phone to get your hands on
because of the camera I hope this video
helped if it did be the cool guy or girl
that gives this video a thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next
so then it's your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
