hahaha I want to beat my masters
lifestyle changes man guys this is a
start of something brand-new hopefully
hopefully we're supposed to be going
everyday but lord knows if that's for
that well every week day every week
we're going to be realistic here
yeah every weekday after the work we go
to the gym use something healthy
our lives yes
so that's the plan hopefully it we
follow it hey you guys check up on us
which is like a mid-year resolution
sorry son
yeah make sure you're checking in on us
that we're doing it ask in the comments
below how many times do we go to the gym
at the end by the time of this upload
you know we should say it at the end of
every video how many days we did it yeah
let's do that
okay alright guys so we just finished up
at the gym hi feeling big good that's
fine lot I ran two miles which might not
be a lot to some of you but for someone
who like rarely ever works out it's for
walks so I mean my workout was that it
wasn't that great actually I didn't get
to do much the stuff that I wanted to do
um I tried out some of this text off and
gosh it was more of a hassle than it was
uh no yeah working on it for at least
twelve minutes
it was crazy so I don't know I'm gonna
give it another try tomorrow before I
made some serious judgments about it but
as far as users being user-friendly I'm
not not so crazy about it right now
Friday's yeah wouldn't that be great
it's about that Friday sounds like at
this hour
so right now guys we're in trailer rows
we feel like
so we're gonna pick up some food from
here from fruits and whatnot to go along
with all this healthy eating and cooking
and whatnot let's hope we keep it
upright
we just worked out so it's okay me and
Ari are on this thing what do we call it
a reboot
so we're rebooting our lifestyles making
sure that we're doing things right being
healthy
the channel schedule came from that
whole reboot idea to making sure we just
are as productive and other people as
possible and eating right as part of
that let's go to our phone yeah I'm
updating my friends about my workout
we're all doing this together one of my
friends just went to somebody other one
is I knew everything and out and I made
some I'll see ya all right we did wonder
you check-in everybody's doing the whole
reboot thing so guys we are wrestling
with this really hard to see yeah so
we've got Chipotle here and SolidWorks
now this isn't a hard decision for me
I'm not doing Chipotle but like the the
person me who just ran to my own saying
no go for salad works but then the fat
person and me is saying with Chipotle
are you waving to waste random people
because they're looking at her this is
the way though
so every or mr. salivex always know you
guys are chastise me if I did not you
blast me
is it open sours gets no love Chipotle's
packed um so what'd you get re she feels
like she's a salad with cucumber I
chicken noodle soup and bread and that's
wheat so she's doing it all right
me I got the same thing I got a Caesar
salad with bacon bits though nice and
eggs
yep got those and I got white bread
because I'm a rebel like that you can do
it all by yourself
yeah I bought you this drink alright I'm
going to grab that son it is crazy okay

bit of shade
