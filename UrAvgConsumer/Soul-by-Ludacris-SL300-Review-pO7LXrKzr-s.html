want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys it's your average consumer today
I'm going to be reviewing the SL 300 the
sole by Ludacris
alright let's not waste any time let's
get right into it alright guys so here
we have the SL 300s and here's the case
that it comes with and this is a pretty
nice case it's a hard shell case it
makes traveling with the headphones a
lot easier and it's pretty slim on the
big side but it does leave a lot of room
for putting other things in here is you
have the little pouch here as well and
you can just add some stuff and it
offers really nice protection and just
makes carrying them a lot easier when
you're on the go so enough about the
case onto the headphones themselves
these are a really great pair of
headphones I was so shocked at how good
the quality of music was from it the
only thing I can really complain about
these headphones is maybe the material
didn't really wowed me at first but like
I got over that really quick also the
the size is a little big arm is
definitely bigger than your average pair
of headphones but it does have a lot of
really nice features that make it worth
it to be honest um first of all the
sound quality is amazing on these as far
as sound quality goes for music I give
this like a ten out of ten like it just
sounded perfect to me and um it sounds
it sounds different when you don't have
the noise canceling feature on when you
do have the noise cancelling on it's
like you just turned it on into a whole
nother level so it adds the noise
canceling but it also dramatically
increases the volume and the sound
quality so it's like two different
levels here so one thing that's also
really nice about this is that you can
turn it on and off without having to
lose the ability to listen to music I
know with the beat studios once you turn
off your noise canceling it's like
turning off the headphones completely so
these don't need batteries to operate
which is
really nice and if you want to use the
noise canceling you can turn it on or
turn it off with whatever you want to do
it's up to you so I think it's really
great that they did that there so these
are really probably one of the most
comfortable headphones I've ever worn as
well these are considered to be over ear
headphones because the cups go around
the ears but the way that this is built
the inside part is really close to the
cushions like there's not there's not a
big layer of cushion here although it's
very soft don't get me wrong it's very
soft but because it's not really a thick
thick layer of cushion your ears
actually touch the this little part in
the middle so it gives it a feeling of
being over ear as well as on ears while
my my ears in particular we're able to
touch this part and I actually really
like that because I feel like you can
feel the bass more you can feel the
music a little more when it's actually
pressing on your ears so this does a
good job of going around the ears as
well as on the ears so I consider these
over the air and on ear headphones so
definitely a really good job in the
design of the ear cups and the feel of
them they feel amazing it's extremely
soft and the band is really nice too
here you can see like the little
stitching it has and this is a really
comfortable headband alright I am really
loving these headphones I think they're
really great a nice little feature as
well as the ability to have this little
sole logo light up when you hit the
button on the left ear cup and to get
these on all you have to do is turn on
noise canceling feature as it kind of
powers on the headphones and you hit the
little button on the inside and then you
there you have it you have these nice
little lights they you know add a little
oomph to the headphones make it seem a
little more special if you want to walk
around at night with those on I'm sure
they look pretty cool and you know of
course it is
a bit of an attention grabber
so I'd be wary of that if you don't want
to draw too much attention towards
yourself with these headphones on but I
do like that I think it's really cool so
it's just a nice little feature I think
they added in there give some nice cool
points now as far as durability goes
with these headphones I wouldn't risk
doing too much they feel like I'm not
too crazy about the actual material it's
made out of this plastic II feel I just
don't really want to take my chances
with this kind of material but
everything else on the headphones are
just like really amazing they provide
excellent sound quality and it um has
nice little features as far as the
light-up bum logos and the noise
canceling feature which you don't have
to use in order to listen to the
headphones so I think that's really
great and I just really like the fact
that these are give me the feeling of
being on ear headphones as well as over
ear headphones like I said definitely
the most comfortable pair of headphones
I've ever worn
they sound probably on par with the best
headphones I've ever listened to as well
um as far as you know being in
competition with the Beats Studios I
definitely think you can go either way
with these um these have a bit more
features than the Beats Studio so I
could lean towards this but as far as
style is concerned that I you know go
for towards the Beach studios but this
there's nothing that this that the beats
to do is offer outside of style and name
that these don't offer you alright guys
so this has been my review of the SL 300
sold by Ludacris overall I think they're
amazing pair of headphones the sound
quality is just great it definitely
wowed me when I first listened to them
and they still do like I said before
they also have some really cool features
you know the little lighting up of the
logos as well as how comfortable they
are they're extremely comfortable the
only downside being it being a little
the clunky side and not really too fond
of the material but I hadn't really ran
into any cups of the material but you
know I just just feels what a plasticy
but overall they're definitely really
great like you can't go wrong with them
if you're interested in them definitely
purchased them I would suggest
purchasing them and pretty much that's
it guys these are really great check
them out these are the SL 300 sold by
Ludacris and your average consumer
