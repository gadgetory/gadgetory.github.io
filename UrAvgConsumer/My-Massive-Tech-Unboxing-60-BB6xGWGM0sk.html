consumer and as you see we've got
another massive tech unboxing to do and
I kind of know what's inside at least
most of this stuff and it's a lot guys
so as usual
grab your snacks relax we got a lot of
tech to check out all right babe go
ahead make the choice this guy okay this
is from blue color where that's a good
box to start with boom now I feel like
it's been a while since we showed
anything from color wear so let's see
some of this stuff ooh
over here we got the Logitech G 810 this
is there Orion spectrum keyboard now of
course if you guys haven't ever heard of
color before these guys specialize in
customizing tons of tech making it into
whatever color scheme you want and it's
kind of what we've got going on over
here
now as you guys can see this is supposed
to be a black keyboard and oh that looks
clean now I got mine in white and that's
because this is an RGB backlit keyboard
so I can get the keys to be whatever
color I'd like and you know what this is
the first time that I got a gloss finish
from color where yeah instead I usually
get matte but glass looks really really
nice initially like this is exactly how
it came out the manufacturing spot and
this is a mechanical keyboard so if you
into gaming you want a nice standard
keyboard that looks good in any color
that you want
you got this option right here and over
here we've got the Logitech G 403
prodigy wireless mouse now this guy over
here check this out this one I went a
little different I went with the full
UAC color scheme and let's see how it's
turned out okay
the orange came pretty nice so if you
guys aren't familiar with my logo boom
here it is and this is what the mouse
looks like based on all of those colors
everything that I've gotten from color I
got in a matte finish and I think Lots
might have won me over this is really
nice I kind of wish I got my switching
class now aim and we've got one more
thing in here but that's gonna be in a
future video so be on the lookout for
that
arrey might be in it right re yeah okay
I think I know what this is this is a
game for the Nintendo 3ds
yeah I'm right so we've got Fire Emblem
fates conquest now I don't know if you
guys heard the Fire Emblem before but
it's like a strategy kind of game it's
really popular in Japan that obviously
comes from Japan but this is a really
great game if you inter like strategy
kind of games I've been a big RPG guy
forever this is definitely worth picking
up Fire Emblem is low-key very good and
we've got a little box over here rip
this open this is okay so okay this is
called the upright go now this is an
interesting little product I'm not sure
I don't really don't know what to think
of it just yet so it's a little big
things small whoa
it can't be this small really okay Wow
so this tiny little thing guys it's
supposed to go on your back and what it
does is it's supposed to help you with
your posture it feels you slouch
vibrates helps you at your posture so I
guess it'll pretty much train you to
stand upright and look like a boss now
this I have no idea what this is
so let's see this looks like a another
video game packaging but I could be
wrong oh oh when did we get this
amiibos huh I should don't even really
need this anymore because we bought them
separately we got a three pack now hmm
there's kind of no need for a three pack
anymore those getting returned I ain't
wasting no money oh this one right here
this thing so this is my Gundam fans out
there I went and found this cool dude on
instagram called
curio Ventura he makes Gundam model kits
and customizes them to whatever look
that you can imagine and I actually got
him to work on something so I am
extremely hyped this is a long time in
the making guys oh it's in a bunch of
bubble wrap okay we're gonna pause for a
second I'm gonna get this together and
you guys are just gonna see the final
result and here it is guys now this is
one of two but this is the Gundam hi new
now I know I'm nerding out with my
Gundam model kit stuff for a second but
it's got to get some air time man cuz
this thing looks amazing this guy killed
it and obviously and went with like a
teal color scheme because that's who I
am
it's in my blood I bleed teal now I
build a ton of Gundam but I do not have
the skill to paint them and do as much
detail work as this guy can do so if you
guys are in any way interested in seeing
what he can do or maybe even getting
your own customized Gundam I'll have
them linked down below his things curio
Ventura the guy's awesome and we've got
another one on the way too so Wow here
we go so I haven't seen this year has
been out for a little while but this is
from asteroid
this is the Astro a 10 yeah so this is a
$60 gaming headset from astro that
almost doesn't make sense those guys are
extremely expensive so for them to come
out with a low budget gaming headset is
insane
now this is the Xbox one version there's
a ps4 version and a I think they call it
a Nintendo switch last PC version so
they're all different colors this is
green ps4 is blue the other one is red
and I got to try these on obviously yeah
not that but I'm wearing it wrong okay
and you know what I like this doesn't
feel cheap it does not feel cheap I will
give them that for a $60 gaming headset
$60 is on the low end for what these
guys do so not bad if you guys are
interested in seeing a budget video on
gaming headset or something let me know
all right so over here I picked up a
couple things from the Apple Store but I
figured I might as well wait show you
guys on video first up we've got an iPad
pro leather sleeve now this is the 12
inch version so it's a lot bigger than
normal well let's take a little quick
look at it okay here we go I got it out
now this is it pretty simple I really
think I would need to get my hands on
the tan one cuz this is nice but it's
kind of plain looking I don't know it's
kind of plain don't you think okay but
uh you've got a spot for your Apple
pencil right here and the iPad pro it
feels nice though this thing is like a
nice soft leather and the inside a
little bit of the soft material but it's
a sleeve this is it
it's massive but I like it I'm getting
the tan one though instead now something
a little bit more interesting
it's this guy it's a power bank yeah
whatever
but this is from Mophie but what's
special about this power bank is this is
a power station USBC double XL it can
charge a MacBook Pro so that's really
awesome now there are tons of USB type-c
portable chargers but none of them put
out enough juice to actually charge a
MacBook Pro so this is something that's
been on my wish list for a while and
it's finally here so this is awesome
it's got about 20,000 milliamp hours is
exactly it's 19,000 500 milliamp hours
but you know 20,000 whatever only thing
I don't really like there's only that it
has one USB type-c port and one regular
USB port so this thing costs one hundred
and fifty dollars yeah it's expensive
and it's but the thing is the macbook
charging functionality as of right now
that's a pretty big deal so you're
pretty much paying a premium for the
ability to charge a MacBook Pro as well
as maybe some other USB type-c laptops
and this design oh this is a giant box
and I think this one's from Razer the
mercury gear nice alright so here we
have razors sweet of mercury gear left
food up first we've got the Kraken 7.1
now the mercury gear is all white and of
course they've got like their RGB stuff
going on let's open this up man white
and gray makes such a good combo this
looks clean now these are some really
cool ear cups dang you're not feeling
that at all it is no this is this is
dope alright so this is a the Razer
Kraken 7.1 surround sound this looks
really good so far this is
the razor lancehead yo alright alright
razor you did good
cuz these look really nice oh just feels
nice in the hand too so over here we've
got the Black Widow X chroma whoa look
at that
dang that's a break it okay this is some
next-level stuff this keyboard looks
awesome it feels really nice - it's a
mechanical keyboard of course Oh setups
man set up ideas they're coming together
right now in my head you guys know you
got to hit that thumbs up button if you
want to see a setup with all this stuff
now we got the dual sided gaming mouse
mat so I'm a huge fan of razors a mouse
pads so this one I'm pretty interested
in checking out let's see try just what
there goes
is this a mousepad or what cuz they got
it like in a briefcase and whatnot so
over here you have your mouse mat you
can use it however you want but as you
can see right here all you do is pop it
open and you swap to the other side and
you can use it however you want this
side is a bit smoother while the other
side has a bit more texture to it and
this is actually a bit hefty too so if
you put this down and you're one of
those crazy gamers who are just throwing
your mouse everywhere you're not gonna
move it around on this so this is - oh
this is the mercury set it's a 1 alright
so next up we've got little box from
Microsoft
that's your some more controllers they
do they do and I love it oh I saw I saw
these online minecraft controllers oh
this looks nice this green really pops I
really like the fact that it's got like
this black and green color scheme it
looks really good together and in the
back here you got this little TNT so
this is cool
and they've got the little pink one over
here and this one's based on the pig so
we can pop this open and see oh yeah the
pigs right here this one's all you babe
so you got whooping in the back like a
little pigtail through that this is cool
this is cool alright so we've got two
more left this is from audio let's pop
this open all right so let's check this
out now I've actually featured this on
the channel before like a while back
this is the wa7 fire slice and this is a
tube headphone amp so as you can see
we've got little tubes in here and when
you power it on it lights up but you get
some amazing sound quality once you hook
this up to like your computer you put in
some nice headphones and you jammin out
so this thing looks amazing
huge shout-out to audio for sending this
out yeah this is probably gonna be a
staple I have a main desktop so I can
get the best sound quality out of my
stuff and last up we've got this guy I
don't I don't remember the name of it do
you well hopefully it's on the box do we
have a name on here oh the Expos okay so
this is the Expos keyboard a lot of
keyboards today huh you know see this so
this is a complete redesign of what the
keys should look like on a keyboard
apparently with this it should be a bit
more ergonomic so you should have an
easier time typing I got it
and try this out I just have to so I
don't know if you guys can see this but
some of the keys are you know is just a
bit well quite a bit different than what
we're used to and there's going to be a
learning curve here for sure but from
what I've been told you kind of get used
to it and then it becomes a lot easier
to type once you get it all down
it's gonna throw me off man it's just so
this is different it's just different
straight up so I'm going to try this out
this is Wireless oh it is that's cool
it's like a mechanical keyboard too so

the Expos let me know what a comment
