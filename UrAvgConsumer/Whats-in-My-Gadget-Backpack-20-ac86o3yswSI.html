today I've got a special video for you
guys I'm doing an update to what's in my
gadget backpack video so this is version
2.0 and as you can see I've got a new
backpack here the old one unfortunately
met its end
I was probably carrying too many things
it kind of ripped apart so I've got a
new one this guy seems to be a bit
tougher we'll see how it goes and I just
want to give you guys a heads up with
this video I know a ton of you were
concerned about my safety or maybe not
really my safety but you were concerned
about me getting robbed in with my
backpack but I just wanna let you guys
know I'm not taking these backpacks or
any of my gadgets on a subway or a bus
or just walking in the street with them
all willy-nilly
I'm usually driving or in a car and I'm
typically going to a friend's house if
I'm ever bringing something dis loaded
around with me so you don't have to
worry about me getting robbed or mugged
or anything like that I've seen so many
Wow put that aside let's not waste any
time let's get right into it alright
guys here we have the backpack this is a
case logic bag but um I don't remember
the model number I'll have a link down
in the description so you guys can know
exactly what it is if you're interested
in picking it up but we've got a lot to
get through so let me get right into it
so you some of you might notice what
this is already
if you saw my Instagram picture you saw
a preview these are the v-moda m100 this
is a nice very portable carrying case
very small and compact here we have the
M 100's now these are amazing headphones
as a basehead I'm in love with these I
love the size how compact it gets very
very easy to travel with
now these did thrown the beats Wireless
as the headphones that I walk around
with but I switch it up all the time so
I don't even stick to these but I did
want to showcase these since I really do
love these right now so I'm putting
these over
year I love to walk around with those
headphones very very simple and of
course the carrying case holds the
cables here we've got a cable that can
actually daisy chain so daisy chain
meaning i can listen to another pair
another pair of headphones can listen to
my music at the same time so it's got
that cable and it's got a regular cable
with inline remote so i carry those
around with me put that over there I'm
gonna unclick this it's very nice case
it's all throw that over here and let's
get to the first pouch up front so what
we have up here let's see well first
thing to know I do have my pointer shoot
camera here I have the rx100 one of the
best points oops available right now
I think the second version is out but um
they still have this this is still an
amazing camera I love this camera it's
very easy to walk around with takes
amazing pictures and video so great
stuff definitely have that there and of
course I have a tripod just in case I
want to use it and take a still shot or
something this is actually pretty useful
umm this is better than the original
tripod that I little the little tripod
that I had before this is a bit of an
upgrade here
um this has adjustable legs I can throw
the camera on here right please so
that's there um some of the little
things that I have here some of you
might be familiar with a lot of the
stuff that I'm going to be going through
here but here I have a headphone
splitter and I just pretty much use this
too just like the daisy chain effect I
can listen another pair of headphones
can listen to my music or tablet or
whatever I'm listening to at the same
time as me with this thing so this thing
is really useful I've also got my square
register so I can swipe a credit card or
charge someone for something using my
iPad or my cell phone whatever I want to
use there's an app for it and I can just
charge someone for whatever transaction
or I can do it to myself and get some
money from my credit card so that's
pretty cool and here I have a 32
gigabyte flash drive
this I got on sale this was pretty cheap
this is only a 2.0 so the data speeds
can take some time to transfer over but
overall this is a great flash drive 32
gigs and this little compact size is
amazing I'm a huge fan of that and let's
see what else we've got up front here so
this this bag doesn't have as many
compartments but I still got a ton of
stuff in here um taking a look at what's
down below here I see I do have some
spare batteries for my rx100 so that's
one I can't even have another one I have
two of them so I'm not worried about
that dying on me and what I've got in my
hand here this is my little James Bond
pen as you guys might know already this
actually is a regular pen but if you
screw off the cap I've got a 1 gigabyte
flash drive in here so I can transfer
anything I want to with this or anything
small and it's very compact nobody would
know it's there so it's my little secret
device really really like that and what
else do I have have a little microfiber
cloth this thing is great this came from
the a solution transformer prime and
this is one of the best microfiber
cloths I've used and I just love this
thing so I always carry it around with
me and let's see what else we've got
here this is my new Tramp portable
charger this is the power pack plus this
is the little pouch that it comes in so
here we have it this is the power pack
plus this thing has 13,000 yeah 13,500
milliamps of battery power so this thing
is amazing this thing is like a power
brick I love it on the iPhone 5 just so
you guys know is about 1440 milliamps of
battery power so this thing can charge
that like a ton of times 13,000 nuts so
I carried that around with me and let's
all right so I've got a stylist here for
my Nintendo 3ds that I'll be getting to
transformers is the bumblebee version
and I've got this little mini USB thing
for my mouse I'll get to that but a
little mini USB thing I'll show you guys
more about that a second um let's go
into the size you might notice this
little cable here these are actually my
beat tours so these are new beats tours
and what's really cool about this
backpack is that it has a little flap
right here a little cutout and I can
actually put some headphones in here and
plug it into my device and listen while
I'm on the go so my device isn't going
to be out in the open or in my pocket
it'll just be coming from the side and I
can listen like this so that's pretty
cool really neat little feature here on
this backpack um on the side though what
I do have in here is the iPod Touch 5th
generation which is currently dead it
but I do have the iPod Touch 5th
generation and let's get all of this out
of the way so this is what I listened to
with my music throw that over there what
do I have up here there's like a nice
amount of pouches all over because you
guys can see up top here I've got some
business cards so this is a cool little
dam from muqaam I believe and my little
youtube business cards if I ever need to
give it out this is my thumbnail unlike
everything you guys can see you AC
reviews back here so this is what I used
to give out my card if I ever need to
and as you guys can see I'm already
starting to make a mess on the other
side over here I have the carrying case
for the beat stores let's say I don't
want them dangling out but all in the
open I'll throw them in here so that
they're safe and out of sight down here
at the bottom let's see I've also got
this handy little camera grip so I can
throw my rx100
here and kind of just film like this
it's actually really really cool or if
I'm vlogging I can unfold it like this
and point it to my face and like yo sup
everybody and it's really a really cool
thing I like that it makes it really
easy to carry the camera around um let's
see what else we've got here and here
I've got the ravpower Wi-Fi disk this
thing is really cool it's a portable
charger it has 3000 milliamp so it can
get a full charge on your iPhone like
twice or charged up your Samsung device
maybe like once but this thing has a lot
of juice but what's really cool about
this is that this thing gives off its
own Wi-Fi signal and you can have a hard
drive connected to this or an SD card
and on that Wi-Fi signal there's an app
on your phone that you can get or tablet
and this thing will basically stream
your media from your devices to that
mobile device so that's just insane and
I love this there's an app for that you
know makes it all connect and work but
this thing is really cool it's a
portable charger and it's like a media
streaming hub so this is really really
neat stuff I'm a huge fan I'm gonna have
a review of it soon for you guys and let
you guys know more about it but um
that's really cool that takes care of
the sides let's see what we've got over
here not really good this pouch so let's
see what we've gotten here so this is a
little more hectic I've got a ton of
cables down here alright let's see so of
course I've got my 3dsxl um I had the
three yes before but I definitely traded
it in for this guy this thing is a beaut
I love the 3dsxl lots of fun games I
think what I've got in here right now is
Fire Emblem I'm a huge RPG guy so that's
what's in there and no RPG fan goes
without loving Pokemon so I've got that
here still umm pokemon black and white 2
and
the original is in there I've got a
dislike for games in there
I've got tales of the abyss Golden Sun
Kid Icarus still some extra stylus and
this pokéwalker thing so tons of little
games
that's the nerd in me so we'll put this
side let's see oh yeah alright so that's
a three yes I've got the PlayStation
Vita here as well this is definitely my
favorite portable handheld this thing is
amazing I'm a huge fan of it tons and
tons of games as a PlayStation Plus
member you get a couple of free games
every month so I'm hugely fan and of
course I got the pet carrying pouch
nothing inside of there but um yeah this
is it I'd spend a crapload of time on
that Vita more so than I probably should
but uh let's see what else we've got in
here
here if I don't want to use the V motors
or the tours I've got my j-bird blue
buds ex in here these are some wireless
in ear buds now this I can just you know
use bluetooth to listen to music this
has some amazing sound quality of
definitely good stuff I'm really wild by
this some guys know I love wireless
headphones so this thing is just amazing
I've been using that for quite some time
and I really like it and let's see what
else we've got now we've got a bunch of
cables this is cable madness over here
this is all the cables I have chargers
tons of charges and stuff we're gonna
just set all this junk over here in the
middle and what else I got in here is
this little stand this thing is actually
good for tablets you can use it too this
pretty adjustable you can use it to put
your tablet on here watch a movie or
something you know just use your tablet
on here it's really really nice
very compact easy to use fold it up
really good stuff and it's really cheap
on Amazon I believe it was part of like
less than $10
and let's see what else we've got we've
got more chargers this is for my phone
and it's a microUSB app the Galaxy s4 so
that's why it's white and stuff um it
also works for my tablet so that's that
I also carry around my Logitech
performance MX mouse so this is what I'm
using my laptop on the go
this is mouse is amazing so I definitely
carried around with me out if I'm like
trying to edit something I do edit from
my macbook pro or my macbook air rather
and that thing helps out a ton I've got
another USB cable over here and I've got
a big microfiber cloth this thing cleans
up my screens like no problem definitely
love that and let's see what else we've
got in here that's about it for that
compartment
alright guys almost there
okay and this is the last apartment over
here I have my tablet my Nexus 10 this
is a great tablet really high resolution
I don't think it was that popular as far
as um you know sales and stuff like that
but it's a really great tablet I love it
um really nice display some Nexus tablet
so I get the you know latest updates
very quickly so that's great um let's
see what else we've got and of course
I've got my MacBook Air this is the
13-inch this is the 2012 model so it's
not the 2013 Haswell edition with the
Haswell processor an extreme battery
life but this does do the trick I do a
ton of editing from this this thing is
great combined with this mouse it's not
a problem for me I can do all the work I
have this has an SSD solid state drive
so that means it's really really fast
and snappy so I'm definitely keen on
having that with me all the time and
I've got this little notepad with me
where I do a lot of my notes for my
videos if I'm editing
something over here using this with me
to get some editing done jot down ideas
and I think that's about it guys
oh yeah there's another little
compartment all the way in the back here
which is really cool and this actually
holds tested a lot of padding I throw my
1 terabyte hard drive in here so it's a
portable hard drive 1 terabyte I can uh
you know throw all my stuff on here get
a lot of editing done so I'm pretty
mobile I can edit from anywhere I'm
ready to do just about anything if the
bag is pretty much empty yeah that's
about it so this is it guys this is all
the stuff I have um very similar to the
last time but no a couple of new
additions if you guys want me to point
you in the direction of any of these
products that you see here let me know
I'll definitely do that for you and um
yeah this is it guys hopefully you
enjoyed this video you got an idea of
what I'm carrying around with me now and
yeah hopefully enjoy it and I'll catch
you guys in the next video
