and it's time for another favorite type
of the month this time for the month of
October but today we've got a special
guest we got my boy random Frank P who's
gonna be giving us some awesome
suggestions but if you haven't seen one
of my favorite tech of the month videos
pretty much I'd go over some tech that
I've been using for the last month
whether it's older than you but let me
show you what I've been working with so
over here we have these Sony's these
beautiful amazing Sony's these are I
don't know why some of you changed it up
the name scheme here but these are the
WH 1000 x mark 2 these are an amazing
pair of headphones these are bluetooth
wireless headphones these have insane
quality the MDR 1000 X I called the most
advanced pair of headphones out and now
Sony went ahead and upgraded them and a
pretty short time frame now if you've
never seen me talk about the MDR 1000 X
I'll have that video link down below in
the description but this pretty much has
all of those features and then some so
one of the most notable changes is the
fact that it now has 30 hours of battery
life which means you're gonna be able to
go for a while when you're listening to
your music you've also got some other
changes in the sense then now there are
less buttons so that means there are
less things to fumble with you only have
this power button as well as your active
noise-cancelling and ambient noise mode
and for those of you who don't know
about the ambient noise mode that's
actually a really cool feature where you
can listen to your music and still hear
the things going on around you so if
someone is trying to talk to you you're
gonna have your music that loud you
should be able to hear them and this
thing's got a touch panel so you can
swipe through your music and control
your volume but one thing that they
added here is the ability to use a voice
assistant by holding it down and then
it'll activate Siri or Google assistant
whichever you have connected to it but
some of the real noteworthy features
actually comes from its app so with this
app right here you can pretty much
control all the different aspects of the
headphone so you can go from adaptive
sound control over the just regular
active noise-cancelling you can actually
optimize the active noise-cancelling
right here and something that's pretty
cool that they introduced is this sound
position control you can choose where
your audio is coming from you can have
the music positions right where you want
it you of course also have an equalizer
you can actually change up the surround
sound to make it sound like you're in
arena
or in a club or outdoor stage and you
can also change the quality of your
Bluetooth connection so if you're more
interested in sound quality you can
check that off but if you want a more
stable connection maybe if you're going
somewhere where your headphones are
going to be a little further away from
your phone this is actually a nice
option so if you're playing basketball
or something you can actually choose
between those which is really nice and
most importantly be sound really really
good they're one of the best Sony
headphones I've ever tried sounds
crystal-clear I actually has some pretty
decent bass and like I said it hasn't
equalizer so you can control it and tune
it to sound exactly how you want it and
even though this is an upgrade to last
year's model Sony actually dropped the
price of these by 50 bucks which is
insane since this is an upgraded with
new features really love it definitely
worth picking up
now I'm gonna pass it on to my boy
random Frank P he's gonna let you know
where he's been using for the last month
what's up guys I'm random Frank P shout
the gender for having me on this episode
and one of my favorite pieces of tech
recently has been this Griffin Powermate
multimedia controller it's actually
pretty interesting it's extremely
versatile as you'll see in a second and
works on both Mac and PC pretty much it
is a nicely built aluminum scrolling map
it has a few tricks up its sleeve on the
bottom is a clear piece of acrylic and
rubber so it's not going to move around
on your desktop there's also some LED
lights inside so the bottom glows I
guess you can do things like have this
be a regular volume knob or something
but once you download the software like
I'm using on Windows 10 you can set each
scroll each press down on the knob
holding down etc alt to be different
functions meaning you can do things like
zooming in and out of your webpage even
link it to certain programs to have
different functions workflows
applications like setting keystrokes
macros or editing commands in Photoshop
for premiere definitely helpful for me
when I'm color correcting the software
is simple but it really lets you get
creative the knob itself is just built
really nicely to move smoothly along the
unit you can do things like change up
the lighting effects on the bottom so it
pulses in and out you even buy in
different colors I love this thing is a
great pickup for $35 see I don't even
have one of those power moves but best
believe I'm gonna be picking one up oh
hello monster how can I help you I'm
gonna put you over here but we've got to
talk about right now is what's in this
little pocket right here of this
backpack this right here
is a portable bluetooth speaker by
Harman Kardon now this I believe is
called the Harman Kardon traveler and
I've never heard of it before I actually
got it at an event in New York they were
giving these away to people who were
leaving the event and I got my hands on
this and you know I thought it was just
a regular old bluetooth speaker but this
thing is super tiny but it has amazing
audio quality which kind of just blew my
mind
and not to mention it has got a bill to
importa balagia I think it's about 2500
milliamp hours so if you want to plug
this up to whatever device you may be
using it with maybe your phone you can
do that and charge it up but we're
really sold me on this thing is the form
factor take a look at this guy's it's
tiny it feels like I'm holding a very
very thick smartphone but it is very
nice and compact which makes it super
easy to take with you whenever you want
to travel or go somewhere I found myself
throwing this in my backpack way more
than any other Bluetooth speaker any
other Bluetooth speaker that I've had in
my backpack you know you kind of have to
make room for it this it's like bringing
around a regular portable charger and
you get great audio quality despite its
small size so if you're looking for
something that's easy to take around you
can even throw this in your in your
pocket with no problem look at that yeah
I mean this is not a big deal at all if
you're looking for a great Bluetooth
speaker something that will be easier to
take around with you whenever you want
to go somewhere I definitely think you
should look into this and it's got this
dope little travel case which actually
feels really high-quality so if you want
to just take it around boom that's it
this thing is awesome but Typhon boy ran
the Frank bean dropping another bomb on
yeah then next is a way that definitely
add more glow to your desk or gaming
setup and that's what this RGB light
strip that has Wi-Fi capabilities so it
can be controlled from your phone as
well as Amazon Alexa the reason I like
this is because you can control the
lights I mean if a room or something or
tethered to Alexa like I said and have
your lights be voice controlled now I
have these behind my entertainment setup
in my office and that's wrapped around
the back of my 55 inch TV to give it a
nice pop at nighttime and the colors
here you can see our
very bright and saturated now inside the
app it's impressive because they have
different RGB effects and presets you
can make your own effects if you want
haven't do things like pulse to music or
sound even have it pick colors from the
camera if you want the app is really
extensive and it gives you a whole new
dimension that ordinary light strips
don't usually you can pick up light
chips for like fifteen or twenty dollars
but these are 25 bucks and you get those
added capabilities like I said I think
it's really cool definitely add some pop
to your room and I use them all
throughout my office and we had to
switch it up a little bit and show you
this over here guys now you might have
seen me unbox the razor Mercury set in
the massive tech unboxing that I did not
so long ago and let me tell you guys I
am in love with this setup now there are
a bunch of different things here and all
together it could cost a pretty penny
but I do think that individually all
these pieces are actually pretty awesome
and these really work well if you want
to create a desk set up of some sort
with a white aesthetic to it
you all have RGB lights in it as razor
does there's lights in the eraser hammer
head over here you got on the keyboard
and they're RGB so you can switch them
up to any kind of color scheme that you
want but out of all of these things here
my favorite absolutely has to be the
mouse this is the razor lancehead
and it is definitely one of my favorites
of all time it's a great looking Mouse
it's very very comfortable to use very
responsive I really really dig this
honestly I don't think you can go wrong
with anything here the keyboard itself
super clicky very nice to use I think
they're all great but the mouse if you
got to pick anything pick the mouse it
looks great and they've all got RGB
lights so you know it's game we're ready
whereas last time I said that everyone
got mad but yeah it does have RGB lights
I think they look great I definitely
think if you want to make a white setup
of some sort
these are awesome but that about wraps
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it I'll have links down below to
everything mentioned in the video in the
description and also follow random Frank
P you got to follow that man his channel
is down below as well but if you enjoyed
it be the cool guys girl that gives it a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
