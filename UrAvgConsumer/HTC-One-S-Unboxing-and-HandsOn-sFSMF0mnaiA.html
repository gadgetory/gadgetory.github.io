to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video hey guys what's going on is your
average consumer and today I'm gonna do
a little unboxing of the HTC One S by
t-mobile
no it was just launched today so I just
want to give you guys a quick look
inside of the box and at the phone
itself hopefully I can help you guys
make a decision if you want to pick it
up all right let's not waste any time
let's get right into it alright so here
we are with the HTC One S now
unfortunately the lovely people at
t-mobile had to open it up and I guess
set up the phone for me and not really
really help but I'm sure they thought
they were helping and they you know got
my SIM card inside there and turned it
on for me so I'm able to take off the
tape or like excreting protector that
was on there since there that was
already done
alright so first was just a couple other
features this is a 4.3 Super AMOLED q HD
touchscreen now a lot of people are have
been complaining about this being a
pentile touchscreen and that being some
kind of issue I have no clue where
pentile display is I don't know what
that is me as a average consumer I'm not
getting affected by that whatsoever I
don't see a difference when I saw the
phone in person it'll look great it's
gonna look great to your eyes the screen
looks great so you can expect it to look
great that aside it also comes with a
Snapdragon s4 processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz and it's dual-core basically
that's telling you that this phone is
really fast so have sixteen gigabytes of
internal storage now the only trade-off
was having so much space built into the
phone it doesn't have an expandable
memory card slot so you can't put in
another microSD card and add stuff to it
from there
this phone is also seven-point 95
millimeters thin that means that thing
is tiny like when I show you guys you'll
be hot you'll be so surprised at how
thin the phone
this one is also sporting an 8 megapixel
rear camera that can shoot in 1080p and
a big song claim for the 1s is that it
can take ridiculously nice pictures and
very quickly at that so that's one of
the biggest selling points for HTC and
this one s-see this one Siri is really
it comes with Beats Audio integration so
you should get richer sounds when using
your beats or I guess I'm not sure if it
works with any other headphones but it
they're saying that with the Beats
headphones and the Beats Audio
integration that you should get some
really great sound from this phone is
running Android 4.0 Sense 4.0 a lot of
people don't like cents I personally do
like it alright so let me jump right
into opening this box for you guys and
showing you what you get ok so here I'm
gonna pull off the cover and inside
you're greeted by this HTC One S and on
the side you can see how it has the
little studio headphones here kind of
the show like you know the beats
integration and HTC's big partnership
with beats so let me pull the phone out
now like I said it doesn't have the
screen protector or anything like that
because the people that see mobile
already set it up for me so there goes
that so inside we have some manuals here
here you have your Start Guide the
recycling program information and then
your limited warranty information as
well now also I'm gonna show you guys on
the front for this phone it has a $50
restocking fee when you purchase it so
if the within the 14 days you're not
happy with it or anything like that and
you just want to you know send it back
you will have to give up 50 bucks just
to do so so you got to really make sure
that this is the right decision for you
before you jump in
um okay so inside you had those manuals
and here you get your USB charger in
this nifty little bag and here you have
your USB cable so yeah this is the
charger you get here and here you are
with this the cord is pretty short so
you might have some issues I guess like
charging it and talking on the cell
phone at the same time unless you're
charging it from your computer or
something so that's what you get inside
you get the manuals you get the charger
nothing special
anyway so back back to the big boy let
me show you guys around this is your 8
megapixel camera here you have a
front-facing camera I'm not sure what it
is off that off the top of my head I'll
probably put up an annotation let you
guys know what it is now you have the
USB to micro USB slot right here and you
have your volume rocker on the right
side unfortunately even though this is
this phone is you know specializing in
its camera there is no dedicated camera
button on the side here you can see it
says Beats Audio to you know support the
integration and here at the bottom you
have the speaker and up top you have I
believe this is a another mic to cancel
out noise when you're talking this is
where you have your power button there
are three point five and then 3.5
millimeter headphone jack your other
your standard mic is at the bottom and
pretty much that's everything that's on
the phone all right so enough for that
and now let me show you guys what it's
like when you power it up see the HTC
logo
of course it's Tallis you know
advertising its 4G network
this phone is supposed to work with
t-mobile's HP HSPA+ 42 network so it's
supposed to be able to hit speeds of 42
megabytes per second if you all are in
an area with that kind of coverage here
we are this is the screen now one thing
I did get a chance since it was already
over I did get a chance to play around
with it it is very responsive and a
beautiful phone now I just want to show
you guys just how slim this phone is it
is extremely slim like the USB charger
is about the same width as this so
that's telling you it's very very thin
it's almost scary helsing this is
because I'm really scared of it flying
out of my hands as it tried to a couple
of times so I'm definitely going to be
looking for a case
- maybe bulk this thing up a little I
would suggest if you're going to pick
this up to get a case as well to add
some heft to it as this thing is very
light and very thin okay so this phone
will also run you about 600 bucks off
contract and with a contract I believe
it's about maybe 250 altogether yeah I
think it's about me it's gonna be 250
altogether and you know one the standard
$1.99 and with tags he'll probably hit
like near 250 and nowadays does a pretty
standard prices so pretty much that's
all that that's all there is to it just
for this unboxing I'll be playing with
this phone heavily for the next few
actually next couple of years actually I
just renewed my contract so ask me any
questions you want I'll let you know
I'll give you the scoop and I'm gonna
have to review out for this probably
we've asked I've played had it for about
a week so I'll let you guys know
everything there is to know so please
feel free to leave me any questions
comment rate subscribe all the good
YouTube stuff thanks for watching you
guys is your average consumer till the
next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
