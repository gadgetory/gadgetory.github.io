want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at Travers consumer today I
finally got my travel cover for the
Nexus 7 in the mail and decided I'll be
doing an unboxing for you guys so let's
not wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the travel
cover for the Nexus 7 and of course the
Nexus 7 here typically I wouldn't do an
unboxing for just a cover or a case or
anything like that but since there's
still a lot of nexus fever going around
I figured why not people might be
interested in seeing if they should um
pull the trigger on the 20 bucks that
this thing costs if they actually cost
20 bucks plus 10 10 bucks cuz um I don't
know Google didn't really give an option
to change shipping prices so they forced
big I guess they forced me to pay an
extra 10 bucks for two days shipping um
if you guys found the way around that or
something let me know down below but I
know I didn't see an option so it's
really cost like 30-something including
shipping but enough about that let's see
how this thing is alright so now we
finally got it open and let's try and
pull it up now this thing seems to be
just as difficult to pull out as the
Nexus 7 was okay finally got it out
alright so this material kind of feels
like those hard gel cases that usually
get with your phone here you can see
them there's like an embedding inside of
the case
kind of gets to gets to go inside of the
cover and sit nicely in there so that's
pretty nice um give you guys a little
close-up just a scene alright so here we
have the case for the Nexus 7 like I
said it's a hard just like a hard gel
case and when you open it up it has a
nice little Ridge here so that it can
fit inside the case nicely and on the
inside you can see that it has little
holes for the microphones
so that's pretty nice the buttons don't
seem too hard to press you also have
your holes here for the headphone jack
as well as the microUSB port as well as
the speaker you have this big slit for
the speaker and of course you still see
the Asus branding so the back looks
exactly like your would on the Nexus 7
and now of course we're gonna try and
get this thing on and it should be
pretty easy since it's like a gel case
just snap it in and pretty much that's
it um let's see it feels pretty nice I
would hope that I was hoping that this
would sit in a little more but it looks
like it might flop around a bit but I
mean it's not too bad
it does move around a lot more than I
would like for the cover to but I'm
still still alright it does feel like it
offers some decent protection the inside
doesn't have any like microfiber like
the smart cover or anything I really do
wish that the cover didn't move around
as much as it did as you can see here
it's kind of easy for it to move around
with the problem I have with that is
that I feel like dust and dirt can still
get inside fairly easily when it's like
that because if it moves over a little
bit you can see that this part is
exposed this little black part here is
actually the Nexus so with that being
exposed there's still some things that
can get to it so I'm not too too happy
about that but I mean overall it seems
the material is nice I'm just really
kind of disappointed and how the cover
sits on top but we'll see how it goes in
actual use I'll let you guys know how I
like it
if not I'll let you guys know how I
don't like it but pretty much guys
that's the unboxing I have for the case
of the Nexus 7 so I'll let you guys know
how I like this case after using it for
a couple of days I don't know if I'll
post a review if you guys are interested
in
view for the caseless in itself then
please feel free to let me know down in
the comments and I'll get to one on if
not just ask me how it is and I'll be
sure to let you know if you like this
video please feel free to rate comment
and subscribe subscribing is definitely
a big help to me and be on the lookout
for my Nexus 7 review and I'll probably
post an annotation so you guys can catch
it but alright guys this is your average
consumer on the Nexus 7 travel case see
you guys in the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
