want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
everyone the Travers consumer today I'm
gonna be doing a bit of a different
video I'm not gonna be doing your
regular review or unboxing is actually
going to be a recap of today's Apple
event so let's not leave some time let's
get right into it alright guys so here
we're seeing the iPhone 5 and there
aren't too many changes compared to the
iPhone 4s of course we have a new larger
display that's 4 inches instead of 3.5
that almost all the other iPhones have
had previously and the back is now
aluminum instead of that glass that the
iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s had and also
besides the 4 inch screen the aluminum
back it is a bit thinner so it's thinner
than the previous 4s and pretty much
that's all that's changed on the outside
of the phone itself the forest display
is a welcome change the I think the cell
phone market is leaning towards that as
you can see all the Android phones now
have like 4 23 inches and higher so it's
good to see the apples following the
market a bit especially when it tries to
be the trendsetter itself so that's
gonna be a welcome change you'll be able
to watch HD videos now without the
letterboxes those black in those black
bars at the top and bottom of the screen
so now you should just be able to see
the video and it take up just the whole
screen so that's gonna be a really
welcome change and um outside
besides the um you know the exterior
Apple's got some changes on the
internals as well one of the changes is
actually the new lightning the lightning
cable port I guess you could say that it
now has instead of the 30-pin connector
that most like almost all Apple products
have been using in the past like your
iPod your old iPhones that's no longer
gonna be useful with the new iPhone but
even though they did change that there
is going to be a new way to put an
adapter onto those old cables and plug
into the new iPhone so all isn't lost
with that but that new adapter will cost
$30 so it's a bit pricey it's gonna be
okay though because of course it's going
to come with one of those cables and
what's really cool about one of those
cables is that you can use it upside
down or right side up either way it
doesn't affect it so you don't have to
play like a guessing game on how you're
gonna plug in your device you can just
plug it in however which way you want
without that a little confusion that
typically have when plugging in your
phone also another change that's come
with new ipod iphone all that is the new
earbuds I think they're called ear pods
now there is a very interesting new
design on the headphones that usually
come with the iPhones and I don't know I
can't really tell if it's in ear or just
regular earbuds it's gonna be really
interesting to see I am
it looks like in-ear headphones but I
don't know they say it's supposed to be
great of course Apple the ones who
talked about it so of course they're
gonna say it's great so what we have
more to see on that and we've already
spoken about the 4-inch display it's
still retina um has all the bells and
whistles of the old previous iPhones
this just got that longer display now
and what's really cool about these is
that it has new antennas that will make
it work with LTE signals and what LTE is
gonna get a lot more data speeds that um
you know just make web browsing a lot
faster downloading apps faster all that
typical stuff it's gonna of course you
know faster speeds means more more data
usage so that's something to look out
for um and also you're gonna get dual
band Wi-Fi so that means you're gonna
get faster Wi-Fi speeds which I think
it's the biggest bonus of them all
because when you're home you can use
your Wi-Fi signal and it not be
diminished because your iPhone can't
handle it so now it's gonna be able to
handle more Wi-Fi speeds and that's
gonna be a great great thing and of
course it has an a6 processor which
means you're gonna get better gaming
with these um you're gonna be able to
play games better it's gonna run faster
probably not too much faster the average
consumer probably won't notice it right
off the bat a brand new iPhone 5 and a
brand new iPhone 4s won't really seem
that much faster side-by-side I'm sure
but um I'm sure once you get more apps
and things on there you'll be able to
see that it'll stay responsive a bit
longer than the old iPod iPhone so
that's gonna be a welcome change as well
and of course this is all going for
$1.99 for the I guess the 16 gig and
then it'll be increasing by a hundred
bucks per per size so if you want $1.99
that's gonna be 16 299 is 32 and of
course 399 it's going to give you the 64
gig that is of course on contract off
contract I'm not sure they've listed the
prices yet but that's how much it's
going for all in the contract and also
besides the new iPhone they announced
new iPod so that's gonna be really cool
to see as well I'm a big fan of the iPod
touch myself that's what I typically use
as my iOS device I'm an Android phone
user so having an iPod touch kind of
gives me the best of both worlds and
with the new iPod touch it's going to be
very similar to the iPhone 5 it's going
to have the 4 inch display Retina
display all that good stuff it's gonna
come in a bunch of new fancy colors as
you can see here very interesting um
it's gonna be great
I am curious about this black one though
because they haven't shown the front of
that and I just wonder if it's gonna
have the black bezel or if it's gonna
have this white vessel that we see here
so really wondering what that's gonna be
like and you know they're all gonna come
with the new ear pods that they're
talking about so definitely something to
look forward to one best move that's
what I'm looking forward to the most the
iPod so I can get that iOS 6 experience
that's similar to the iPhone
five but on an iPod well I'll still be
able to keep my Android and this is all
on the a5 chip so that means it's gonna
be a little faster and better more
responsive than the previous iPods which
is pretty good considering that you know
these are newer it's been two years
since the iPod got a real upgrade so
that's gonna be pretty cool to see it
alright so now with the iPod Nano has
also gotten a bit of an upgrade like I
said the iPods were a bit more exciting
to me than the iPhone 5 because we've
seen a bunch of leaked images of the
iPhone 5 we kind of knew what was coming
but I didn't see anything about this
iPod Nano happening so it's really
interesting to see that they gave it a
bigger screen um you know of course they
kept a touchscreen and now it's got a
home button and everything so there's
getting similar to the iPod Touch but
still keeping that still without going
outside of that iPod Nano aspect so it's
really nice that it's been able to do
that there and it's gonna be really
interesting to see how how people pick
up and use these these are gonna start
off for about one $49.99 for the 16
gigabyte version and I didn't mention
the iPod pricing the iPods are actually
going to cost about let me see here I
believe that's gonna start off at around
190 299 for the iPod Touches there you
go so it's $2.99 for the new iPod touch
and of course as you increase your size
the prices will increase as well I'm
most interested in about the iPod touch
they've all looked like they're gonna be
pretty good devices the iPhone 5 looks
like it's going to be really nice even
though some people aren't going to be
wowed by the new you know design and all
that but that's only because we've seen
a lot of the pictures already that have
been leaked and we've been hearing tons
of rumors so that's pretty funny why
people aren't too surprised but overall
I think it's gonna be a really good good
product launch a lot of new stuff that's
gonna be coming out there's going to be
a new iTunes as well so I'm that's gonna
be released in October and it's all
gonna it's gonna be pretty nice to see
and that pretty much wraps up my week
but what was released and announced
today in the Apple event if you guys
like videos like this where I kind of
just give my impressions on the new
products that are being announced like
the Kindle Fire pass the other day the
new Kindle Fire HD came out the other
day and I didn't really speak about that
but if you guys want to see my
impressions of these things when they're
released but to the press let me know
and I'll make more videos like it um
pretty much that's about it guys drivers
consumer I'll check you guys in the next
video till then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
