and today we've got a showdown we're
gonna be comparing two brand new beep X
versus the jaybird X threes you guys
practically begging for this so let's do
this so in typical showdown fashion
we've got to start off with the design
and since the Beast X or newer
we'll start with these as you can see it
has this new flex form cable which
pretty much fits around your neck and
the ear buds pretty much does chill here
which actually is pretty nice in terms
of keeping them in but we'll get on that
in a bit but they do have these two
interesting little I don't know
lumps over here I guess you can say for
lack of a better term but this is where
you charge them you have your power
switch the batteries probably inside of
there as well so it's got an interesting
look to it but honestly I think that the
j-bert X threes look quite a bit cleaner
these are really sleek but only has the
inline remote and has a pretty short
cable so it'll go around the neck put
these in and these are really really
low-key so in terms of design and looks
I think I'm going to give it to the x3
I like how low-profile they are and
there's not a lot of cable to mess
around with really short easy booming
and it's funny because beats has this
reputation of focusing on looks over
function and olympians I feel like it's
kind of the opposite which leads to the
next category which is comfort now I've
said in previous videos that was never a
fan of earbuds with this neck band
design goes around your neck kind of
sits there whenever I saw people with it
was what was it like the LG tones I
believe those one of the first ones that
really came out with this kind of look I
always thought it looked really weird
but man after trying it my mind has been
changed to me this is completely
function over form all of the earbuds
that I've tried with this neck band
design I've had no issues with ear buds
falling out because there's no extra
weight being pulled down on it like with
something with the expertise now the
expertise even though it has a very
short cable it still has this inline
remote so whenever you're running around
with them there's a good
chanting my fallout just do a
straight-up gravity where that's not an
issue here but to be completely honest
just like with my j-bird x2 when I use
the included foam tips
these have a much better time staying in
my ear but they still don't compare to
having something like this around your
neck giving it some extra support not to
mention the ear buds are pretty solid
and expand the year with no problem so I
got to give it to the beats X in terms
of comfort now in terms of what you get
you've got very similar items all across
you of course have your ear tips in case
you wants to tip the size the X threes
also come with foam tip which I find
very useful because it helps me to say
in my ears a bit better I don't really
need that with the beats X in sense that
flexible on cable but if you need a
really secure fit they both also include
wingtips but to me I think the real key
difference here are these travel cases
and I feel about the beats X I wasn't so
crazy about the travel case because it
doesn't close all the way you can't
really feel this while the X threes the
case has this magnetic clamp so that you
can have everything stuffed right inside
of here
and not worry about anything falling out
not quite the case with the beats X case
computer slash that's okay and the
extras also come with these little clips
if you want to make your cable shorter
so in terms of accessories the travel
case is a pretty big deal to me so I
gotta give it to the ex trees now in
terms of battery life you probably think
there's a tie because they both feature
about 8 hours of playback but I've got
to give it to the beats X for a couple
of reasons
the beats X introduced this fast fuel
feature that allows you to get 2 hours
of playback with 5 minutes of charging
which is crazy so imagine this you're
driving through the library or the gym
or whatever and you realize you forgot
to charge these last night
plug them in your car for five minutes
and you've got two solid hours of
playback that's the kind of thing that
changes the way you look at the battery
life and let's talk about the way you
charge these the B's X uses a lightning
cable a very common cable then if you
happen to be an iPhone owner chances are
you already have a spare so easy to
charge even if you forget both cables
there's a good chance you can borrow
someone else's so charging this is no
problem but with the X threes they've
got a proprietary cable
which means is going to be a lot harder
to charge these in case you forgot them
so if you're on a trip or something and
you forgot this little adapter this is
going to be a good chance you're not
going to be able to use your expertise
once they die you're not going to find
somebody carrying this guy around so
being able to charge the beeps ex with a
lightning cable is a huge win over the X
threes proprietary cable because if you
forget this you're pretty screwed or
even if you lose it you've got to go and
buy another one which cost like 10 bucks
but even as of right now this is sold
out on their site so you're going to be
pretty screwed if anything happens to
this and I'm sure that's a deal breaker
for a lot of people so in terms of
battery and charging I've got to give it
to the beat back now let's talk about
these features these are both obviously
Bluetooth earbuds so they're wireless
they got all the bootys features inline
remote yada-yada control your music
without touching your phone typical
stuff but they've got some special
things up their sleeves and let's start
off with beats X again so with the beat
X if you happen to be an iPhone user
you've got the w1 chip which makes an
initial pairing of it very smooth and
very simple all you've got to do is
power it on next to your iPhone a little
screen will pop up you press connect and
boom you're done you got a paired super
simple and that's the only time you have
to use this feature but it makes pairing
super fast and super easy but what's
really cool about this feature is that
if you're in the Apple ecosystem you can
connect it to any other device that's
connected to your iCloud account which
could completely eliminate the pairing
process for a lot of devices so for me I
think that's a really awesome feature of
course already mentioned that fast fuel
which is pretty insane and really
helpful and they've also got a magnetic
clasp for both earbuds so should stop
them from shifting all over the place
keeps them together nice and neat got
some good cable management going but
with the x3 if you decide it's about
listening for a bit and you leave them
on your neck like this I've had the
experience of these falling off from
walking around so you've got to be
careful with that something you'll have
to worry about with the beep but let's
talk about the x3 features I think one
of the biggest ones right now
is that these are sweat proof so if you
plan on using these for the gym a ton
and you happen to sweat profusely these
will not clock out on you because of
that
personally I don't support a time when
working out but it's nice to have that
extra insurance and while being sweat
proof might not be a big deal to me the
app this thing has available definitely
is within that app you're able to switch
up the sound quality the X threes
at the drop of a hat so if you happen to
like a little bit more bass you can
switch that up and get that or maybe if
you like it tone down a bit more you can
switch it to get whatever kind of sound
quality you're looking for out of these
and it handles that really well well
that's a really cool feature if gear
towards the more advanced user I can't
imagine the average person picking up a
pair of expertise is going to jump into
the app and start tweaking all the
settings so they can get the right sound
quality if I give this to someone like
Ari she probably will use this as is
what it has a thing and I got to say
guys it is really hard to pick a winner
between the two of these because they
both have some really awesome features
but I think I got to go with the beat X
because that w1 chip and the fast fuel
teacher definitely sold me and here's
the music category price beats X go for
150 X J's go for 130 $20 difference X
Series win now if we've collied up each
category you'd notice we've got a bit of
a tie going on but we haven't talked
about sounds which is one of the most
important categories now after testing
these both out quite a bit my findings
were very very surprising
we've had this reputation of being all
based and nothing else but the beat X
actually sounded very clear and the base
was punchy but definitely not
overwhelming songs had a nice amount but
definitely very contained but with the X
threes on their signature sound without
jumping into the app and changing any of
the settings these have way more bass
way more based into X's and I was
shocked to see that I love based oh I
don't mind but if you're not into a lot
of things you're going to have to jump
into the X threes app and change that
now this is kind of where I give the x3
the leg up the fact that you're able to
jump in
the app and start tuning it and changing
all kinds of things like the base and
all the travel all that stuff you can
change that here but you don't have that
flexibility with the beat X so because
you have the ability to customize this
to the perfect sound for you I gotta
give sound quality over to the x3 and
since Alan was a tie breaker for the
showdown
the overall winner are the X threes but
let's be completely honest here guys
this was not an easy showdown by any
means and they both actually have some
deal breakers between them that could
swing your choice in any direction the
fact that these aren't a sweat proof
that might be a bill breaker for a lot
of people and for the extras that we're
charging situation that's something that
a lot of people don't want to deal with
and personally I think I'd have an
easier time grabbing the X's and not
because their beats but just because of
the convenience of being able to grab
these charge them with the lightning
cable and heck even if you weren't
talking about the exes
even with something like my song is over
here I've grabbed these over to j-bird
to convenience is starting to be a big
deal for me especially since I travel a
lot so something that uses a micro USB
to charge or lightning cable is a lot
easier than this but you're still the
winner but hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video
shout out to the expertise for taking
the win today if you enjoyed it be the
cool guy and go like this video thumbs
up I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
