really long wait but that was pretty
decent
so we picked up some foods remaining now
and I'm gonna go back to the hotel we're
gonna meet up with Lulu David for
Dom Dom mixing so we've got an all-star
cast here it seems pretty cool so we've
got a quite quite some ways to walk
right now we've got quite a ways to go
so I'm going to keep you guys I'll show
you guys when you get inside the hotel
all right guys are now in the hotel most
of the guys are here Jackie and Marco
thing they're Austin and we got Lou here
you're used to it man so there's a
couple of us hanging out for tonight
okay
so you guys just saw a little bit of the
behind the scenes of one of the scenes
in the video of you know the family wrap
you guys get this got to see key in
being a fan boy all over that computer
so right now it's about like 12 o'clock
in LA but in New York time which is what
I'm used to or New Jersey I'm actually
it's actually like 3:00 in the morning
so I'm be I'm really tired so I'm
probably gonna get some sleep now we got
to wake up pretty early and meet up
around like 8:00 or 9:00 and yeah so I'm
in my room gonna pass out and show you
guys some more behind the scenes
tomorrow we're towing it where we're
going don't worry we've got this we've
got this safer right than you point lab
well we could just make the next love
you can go there yeah oh right here -
well I think I might be on the next one
is right in front of us yeah
I'll see the Ferrari but is it yeah this
is a rare and we're sure that this is
where the exotics are handled as well
that's why it's the same place
well the visitor parking is up here I
imagine just go inside this the official
heart for the Tesla won't we appear sort
of my ND filter on
a couple but there is a Maserati in
there though don't looks like we should
not find the touch lub just yet but
maybe they have it in some kind of
special section law exception right here
that's right this is like the famous
shot isn't it yeah oh come now right
here yes so these guys know their cars
they like the bathing right now guys
know your stuff about cars
let's on the vlog Marko is like the car
enthusiast I guess you know your stuff
too though I know nothing about
oh can i yeah of course
you can definitely Lou has been in there
forever
trying to get this Tesla we don't know
what's happening
must be because he's from Canada we're
still hunting down the tesla louise in
there forever but they don't work out hi
there ah you guys you guys spent Tesla
Model S C gonna call juniors yeah I call
juniors right now the Tesla hunt has
stopped for a moment No
well thanks for the they shoulda comes
the different name you can't see fresh
like we're playing what's going on the
rest
feel happy like so right now we're
getting props and they David is guarding
the Xbox one controllers because we need
them so this was a very long prop trip
then we left we have the carnival
realize we need this an eager enemy with
the best buy so we would specify we
couldn't find anything so then we went
back to target and then we took a while
and finally found a speaker and we had
to get a 40 minutes doing that yeah
exactly we because we couldn't find any
decent battery powered speakers which is
deadly there's no boom boxes and stuff
that just doesn't a sad thing
anymore really it has like a mozilla so
we then grabbed just a normal desktop
speaker and then we're just gonna get an
extension cable you can plug it in so I
mean hey it's gonna work yeah it's just
a little new tactic logging your block
block section the quad steps
so this is the shoe you could actually
be in front of the Los Angels and then
from up here yeah dude I'm saying we do
that and then from up there down here
yeah yeah yeah we're gonna make it work
and this is why they're worried about
insurance everywhere everybody has a
lock camera
what Universal my matrix
so right now everybody is getting ready
all the speakers are set up let's start
playing it so right now we're logging
everybody who is recording his part he's
rapping to it pretty high shoulder rig
that is dangerous I know who has to feel
like Jesus all over in Austin is so much
energy
that's what everyone's like they're
singers of talents you know probably on
a regular music video shoot different
people in my video making
Marvis here we have how many video
makers 0:09 video makers here a few more
other way so how many video makers does
it take to change a light bulb
seriously that yellow guy could be the
thumbnail right look at that
we're all about to go wild and just be
ourselves right in front of the shot so
we're gonna see what we do
as hard as you can action now that was
sick good job good job
that was crazy nice nice
so if earthquake happens right now most
of tech YouTube would be gone
temporalis not really
yeah you know does some rock in there
the rock eyebrow
this video I'll show you is the perfect
example
j√≥ska
more and more interest on family wrapped
with something else check this out today
now we're gonna get some food forget
where we're going exactly but we're
headed there now we just parked the car
so we're on our way right very very
slippery roads around yeah it's more
work than you would think for stuff
yeah we are the most organized first of
all this is happening and I'm about to
have mine this way so Marco is gonna be
the face of the song the face of the
block so now we have four behind me so I
just gave a quick review of the m8 yeah
having used it for probably a total of
five minutes but so far it seems pretty
good
I can't wait in my hands on it you know
I'm getting it so I think this is the
most interesting portable charger that
we've got to tear out it's the ish man
ish so right now we just finished eating
and we're gonna go pick up the Tesla
it's been a crazy ordeal trying to find
one of the most Tesla's but we've only
got it let's see how it is
so the Tesla is finally here there are
seats in the back of the car no cutsies
got the little red trims so there you go
if you've never seen the inside of a
Tesla this is it so what's what's what's
your average consumers take on the Tesla
the average consumer is not getting this
okay okay so it's unlock it with this
that was crazy
it doesn't even matter
yeah yeah so instant even though it's
happening this far maybe this spa
rounded to two waves David review the
Tesla go I'll tell you right now this
right here yeah I think look at this
10 out of 10 what's it don't matter
