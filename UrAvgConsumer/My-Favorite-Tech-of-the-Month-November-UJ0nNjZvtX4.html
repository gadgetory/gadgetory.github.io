and today we're gonna be checking out my
favorite tech of the month for the month
of November and for those of you who
have never seen one of my favorite tech
of the month videos this is pretty much
where I go over some of my favorite tech
that I've been personally using quite a
bit whether it's old or new and the
first thing we're gonna show you guys
are some phones so over here we have the
iPhone 10 and the razor phone which I
really really love but as you can see we
have another phone right here this is
the note 8 and a lot of you know I've
been using the note 8 quite a bit
because I feel like this is one of the
few Android phones out there right now
that have very little compromises but
the razor phone has been really getting
my attention I said we have two SIM
cards one for an Android device one for
an iOS device and the razor phone has
been making a really strong case to take
the SIM card from the note 8 now what's
great about this phone is that you have
an awesome display and you've also got
these crazy speakers which makes for a
great multimedia device this is supposed
to be a gamer phone and it has some
gamer like features like a 120 Hertz
display which makes the whole foam seem
very very smooth the camera is the
weakest part of the phone for me and
it's actually a pretty big deal and
that's why I say he's been making a case
for the Android SIM card but I've been
really enjoying this phone super super
smooth Android experience I love it love
gaming on it love watching stuff on it
and it sounds it sounds amazing
so I love the razor phone right now it's
been dope and we've got the iPhone 10
now everybody knows about the iPhone 10
at this point I just really like this
because Apple finely tuned stuff the way
you use an iPhone I personally have
really been enjoying my time with it not
so crazy about face ID I'll be honest
about that but outside of that it's been
a really nice experience with a much
bigger display watching content on it is
really nice and I said it before and
I'll say it again this notch up here it
really does not bother me I'm waiting
for more apps to be able to support the
full screen and once they do I think
it's gonna be a really awesome
experience using any app that you can
find and we all know this thing has a
beast of a camera overall I think this
is a really really solid phone
this is the iPhone to get right now but
those are the two phones that I've been
enjoying quite a bit this month and the
fact that the razor phone is on $6.99
that makes it really good but let's take
a look at the next product right here
this little guy is the most power
capsule with a lot of the phones now
dropping the headphone jack
Bluetooth is pretty much the way to go
and if you like Bluetooth earbuds and
you have a pair this is an awesome
accessory and what we've got right here
is a hard small semi hard shell case for
your earbuds and you can actually open
this up and boom you have access to your
earbuds but what's great about this is
like the name implies it's called the
power capsule and it has a portable
charger built into it so if you have
earbuds that have maybe an eight hour
battery life and you forget to charge it
one day you can just throw it inside of
the case that you have it in and charge
it up but this is definitely going into
my gadget backpack stay tuned for that
video now this case has a 1400 milliamp
hour battery which really isn't a lot
but when it comes to Bluetooth earbuds
it's actually more than enough and
what's also great is that this case has
an LED indicator to let you know exactly
when you need to charge it charges with
a microUSB cable so that's pretty common
especially if you're using a pair of
Bluetooth ear but they're all typically
microUSB so you can actually use the
cable that you have inside of here to
charge your device as well as the
earbuds
and since it uses a regular USB port
even if you don't need a microUSB cable
you can throw in a lightning cable if
you need it or whatever cable you want
just throw it right inside of here now
what I really like about this case is
that it's only $30 it's big enough to
hold any pair of Bluetooth earbuds right
now I had I said I have the j-bird
freedom twos but I've tried a bunch of
different earbuds and they all fit
inside of here with no problem it can
even charge other devices like fitbit's
and any other little things that uses a
micro USB cable so I really like this at
30 bucks I think it is a solid Buy and
while we're talking about power over
here we have the Anker PowerPort plus
USB hub now you guys might have seen me
open this up during my massive tech
unboxing and I actually really like this
thing it's got four regular USB ports
and a USB type-c port so it has five in
total
but what's great about this is that it
has USB PD now for those of you who
aren't familiar with that that is pretty
much the standard that Apple is using to
fast charge their iPhones so with the
USB see the lightning cable you plug it
in and in your iPhone charges with fast
charging now of course this only works
with the iPhone 10 or the eight and
eight plus so you got fast charging with
this guy and what's great is that this
can cost 50 bucks which is the same
price as this this is what Apple sells
fast charges your iPhone just one USB C
port that's all you get out of it this
one now it provides four extra ports so
not only can you charge your iPhone
quickly but you can charge other devices
as well it does have a cable that you
plug into the back so it actually makes
it really nice if you want to throw it
on top of a desk like you see me have
here so it kind of just whoops so it
kind of just adds a nice little
aesthetic whilst providing a lot of
functionality now easily one of my
favorite things that I've picked up over
the past month has been this this beauty
over here this is the surface book to
now I don't know if you guys know this
but I've always been a pretty big
surface book fan I've included them in a
ton of backpack setups I always really
enjoyed it but now they came out with a
15 inch model which just takes it to an
entirely different level and for those
of you not too familiar with surface
book products this is a 2 in 1 laptop so
what that means is you can press this
one button right here and you can detach
the screen so that turns this thing into
a full-on tablet and with a 15 inch
version you're working with a big big
tablet here you've also got the surface
pen which is optional this year it
didn't come with the surface book not
the 15 inch model that I got anyway but
I did have one lying around so you can
always add that but it's just kind of
great to be able to choose between
having a straight up laptop or tablet
and when it's in tablet mode is just
kind of nice to be able to watch some of
my favorite shows I could just throw it
in
yeah no spoilers I'm actually watching
black clover great anime so far but yeah
it's nice to be able to just take this
off throw in a movie or something kick
back and enjoy it on a pretty big screen
I personally love that now in terms of
the specs that I'm working with on this
machine it's got a core i7 processor 16
gigs of RAM as well as a dedicated
graphics card an NVIDIA GTX 1060 and
when you pick one of these up it even
comes with a free trial offer for three
months of Adobe Creative Cloud so you
get access to Lightroom Photoshop and to
be honest using those programs on here
is definitely enjoyable I've been using
Lightroom a lot to edit some photos that
you guys have seen on Instagram so if
you follow me on Instagram you might
have seen me post up this picture I
actually edit it all right here on
Lightroom on the surface book and might
be giving those away just saying so you
might want to follow me on Instagram but
it's supposed to being able to work with
a ton of professional stuff but I
honestly really enjoy it with is using
it for gaming and this right here guys
this is what I've been using all that
power for to do a ton of gaming if you
guys saw on social media around
Thanksgiving I was planning this thing
like mad oh now you see messing me up
cuz you're watching me but the surface
book 2 is powerful enough to play games
on that some of the highest settings and
it looks really really good and as you
guys can see since this is a surface
product I'm able to use my xbox one
controller here with no problem at all
just connected through bluetooth and
honestly that's what I really like about
this laptop I can go from doing
something professional just using it to
browse or even watch my anime just
enjoying myself and even playing games
with great great graphics I freaking
love this thing it's super pricey though
this model I think goes for I think 2400
is where the base model starts for the
15 inch and the base model for the 13
inch version goes for about 1500 bucks
so these are pricey but they're pretty
much in the same realm as any of the Mac
books that you might want to pick up but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys
let me know what you guys think of the
list do you have any cool favorite
pieces of target you've been using this
November let me know with a comment down
below if you enjoyed it be the cool guys
