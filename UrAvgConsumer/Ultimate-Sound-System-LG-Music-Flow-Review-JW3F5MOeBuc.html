musicflow sound system since my ultimate
living room setup is forever a work in
progress
I'm always looking at new options for
the gear I use in it
LG's music phone system caught my
attention because it does something that
my current system doesn't and that's a
lot for multiple pairing options and
that should make it easier to use with
multiple devices and not just my TV so
here's the kind of setup I've got the
music flow hs7
which is a sound bar and subwoofer combo
to h3s to help deliver that surround
sound and the h4 portable which is not
really needed for this setup but since
the music flow supports adding multiple
devices why not and all of this without
the need for a bridge to connect them
all this kind of functionality is great
if you want a banging setup where you
can listen to music in multiple rooms of
the house at the same time party
throwers take note and with a modular
setup like this you can basically start
with one speaker and add to it later on
so you don't have to break the bank all
at once an LG offers quite a few more
speaker options than the ones I've got
here so you have tons to choose from
when picking a configuration I've got my
sound bar under my television the
subwoofer next to it and two h3 is on
the sides of my couch it also comes with
mounting options to mount the sound bar
to the wall but unfortunately I can't
put any more holes into this apartment
so I've got mine on a TV stand the hsm
comes with a remote that lets you access
features and change settings without
having to jump into the music flow app
and set up was pretty simple with the
use of the music flow app which is
available for both Android and iOS
pairing all devices and getting a
configure took me about 20 minutes the
music flow app gives you access to your
configuration settings so we can make it
function like a true surround sound
system but what's really cool is that
you can choose to play different audio
to individual speakers group up some
speakers or play the same audio to the
entire system as I mentioned one of my
favorite things about the music flow
system is the ability to have multiple
audio sources like Wi-Fi connection
optical in blue
syncing wirelessly with an LG TV HDMI in
or using an aux cord that's a lot of
options and you guys know how I feel
about that the soundbar even has a cool
LED display that lets you know which
connection or service you're using the
most useful to me is Bluetooth syncing
that means I can grab any of my devices
and start streaming my music right to it
all of these options are great because
you're not limited to just getting audio
from your TV this is also one of the
first speakers I've used that has Google
cast and I'm a huge fan of this because
Google Play is my go-to streaming
service but if you like Spotify I Heart
Radio or Pandora there are those options
and many more available to stream from
as well while I love this feature my
experience using it with an android
device was much smoother than when I
used it with my iPhone which to be
honest isn't too surprising considering
it is Google cast now of course what's
really important is the performance I
was really impressed when I first hooked
these up the speakers are powerful
I can barely tiptoe to high volumes
before worrying about neighbor
complaints so if you don't have any
neighbors nearby you're in for a good
time the base on the subs definitely
provides that home theater like feeling
and even the age for portable has a
surprising amount of bass on its own it
has a great punchy sound which is good
for watching your favorite shows playing
games or simply using it to listen to
music it has an equalizer within the app
so you can always fine tune what you're
hearing to match your tastes so far I've
got to say I enjoyed the performance I
got out of these cuz they deliver some
really awesome sound quality but that
about wraps it up for this video guys I
like LG's music flow system and all the
options it brings to the user and I
didn't know what to expect when I got my
hands on these as I've never listened to
anything sound later from LG before but
I've got to say I'm happy with this so
far but that's about it guys if you want
to check these out definitely check the
link down
description for pricing and availability
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video till then is your average consumer
