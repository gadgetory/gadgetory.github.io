consumer and today I'm gonna be talking
a little bit about all the hate that the
beats by dre headphones get every day
and hey let's not wasting time let's get
right into it so first thing I want to
do is let you guys know that I am one
not an audiophile I am NOT trying to be
perceived as an audiophile there's
nothing about me that's audiophile ish
besides my love for headphones and good
music so just want to put that out there
so no one can say that he's not a real
audiophile he's not a true audio
whatever I'm just putting that out there
so you guys can know I am like my name
says your average consumer so let's talk
a bit about the hate that the beats by
dre line gets now typically what people
will say is that it's overpriced
it's got bad sound quality there's a
terrible value um all they do is
brainwash people with marketing and that
people like to use it as a fashion
accessory now I'm going to touch a
little bit on all of those different
things and I'm sure there are other
reasons people hate beats but those are
the few things that come to mind when I
think about some of the comments that I
get in my videos I know it's either you
love these by dre or you hate them it's
like polar opposites and it seems to be
the cool thing I think anyway for people
to say they hate beats by dre that's the
impression I'm getting because it seems
like a lot of people who haven't tried
it are saying they hate it because
they're terrible I don't understand why
someone who hasn't tried the headphones
or all of the headphones would say that
if they don't have experience with them
being overpriced I can understand that
argument
um bees badger is by no means cheap
they're very expensive headphones they
can range from 200 to 500 dollars for
the headphones themselves earbuds
probably in the 100 to 150 dollar range
so they're all very expensive I
understand that and that's a valid
argument I can definitely understand
that people say they're overpriced I
understand that but it all depends on
how people value the headphones and if
they see it's worth it so everyone is
different there as far as whether they
value that price as being justified or
not justified but I'll get to the value
thing in a minute now that sound
quality's another thing I can understand
but that depends on whose point of view
you're looking through now from an audio
files perspective I can understand when
they say that the beats by dre line has
terrible sound quality and there are ton
of other competitors out there that have
better sound but you want to take into
consideration who's purchasing the beats
by dre line and who it's targeted at is
talking to at the average consumer not
someone who knows that much about sound
quality so someone who has a pair of
sine Heiser's where the highs and lows
and all the other stuff the mids are all
great are those things that regular
average people can pick up on nine times
out of ten they can't and I'm sure tons
of average consumers if you walk down
the street you can ask someone do you
know what mids are for a headphone
they'll look at you like you're crazy
now you got to take into consideration
these are not targeted at audio files
even though they say things like these
are the didn't even say that they're the
best actually in their marketing they
never say that beats by dre are the best
at anything but the pros do the pros do
say there's some of the best sound
quality but everything else is not
saying is not trying to claim the spot
as the best sounding headphones around
so I made sure to look through their
website and everything and it's not
there the one thing that they do market
is that it's supposed to be sound it's
supposed to sound the way the artist
intended that is their line it doesn't
state any way that these are the best
sounding headphones so it all depends on
whose eyes are looking through when it
comes to the sound quality I myself love
to sound quality beats by dre and the
most noticeable thing about sound
quality to the average consumer is based
and that's what all the beats by dre
lines excel in now some more than others
but that is their main thing and it
makes sense because that's the most
noticeable thing
the average consumer will hear when
you're in someone's car and you're
they've tuned they're blasting their
speakers they're not worried about the
mids and the highs they worried about
the bass they want their car speakers to
thump and the logic works for headphones
as well so that should give you an idea
of what exactly the average consumer is
looking for they want bass and that's
what beats by dre delivers on and I'll
get tons of questions where no one's
asking me about the mids or highs
they're asking about the bass so like I
said it all depends on who's asking
about the sound quality what kind of
sound quality are asking about and what
really gets me is when people say I'll
B's by dre sounds worse than a pair of
$20 headphones seriously $20 headphones
how great a sound quality can you get
from a pair of $20 headphones that is
obviously an extreme exaggeration and
it's one of those things where I just
don't get what's the point of leaving a
comment like that we all know it's not
going to sound that bad no matter how
bad someone thinks it is that's like
getting a pair of headphones from CBS
and comparing them to beats by dre
seriously now I know there are tons of
options out there that are cheaper than
beats by dre and do sound better but
think about it there's something that
headphone must be lacking that beats by
dre is doing right
whether it's got poor design where
someone just thinks it's ugly and they
don't want to wear it or they're not
being marketed to the average consumer
and how often have you when was the last
time you saw a sign Heiser commercial or
a Denon commercial or Boston Audio like
you don't see all these brands marketing
to the average consumer and with good
reason because a lot of those headphones
aren't targeted to the average consumer
regardless of their cheaper price point
so you really got to take and keep in
mind that not all the headphones that
everyone's recommending over beats by
dre are targeted towards the average
consumer which is why the average
consumer does not know about them and
it's why they don't purchase
or might simply be that the average
consumer doesn't want those headphones I
know I wouldn't look for a pair of audio
Technica's if they were ugly and they
sound great I'm not laying here so what
it sounds great I want something that
looks good as well now people do like to
complain that beats are being used only
as fashion accessories but what's wrong
with that
what's wrong with having a stylish pair
of headphones hanging around your neck I
don't see where the issue is when it
comes to that people can buy watches
that are pretty cheap let's say a twenty
dollar watch that tells time accurately
or they can buy a four thousand dollar
watch and it still tells you the same
time that the other one will but is
anyone complaining that those watches
are overpriced are people attacking
Movado I don't think so even though it
is a fashion accessory people like the
style of different watches all kinds of
stuff but no one's attacking them for
being more so a fashion accessory than
it is for functionality so it's the same
thing with the Beats headphones so what
if it's a fashion accessory people do
that with all kinds of products every
day so I honestly feel like the fad it
being only a fashion accessory is a moot
point people do like to listen to them
as headphones and they like the way they
look so it's a win-win not really see
why people would complain about that at
all
I don't think headphones have to be ugly
and sound good in order for you to use
them I'm sure there are some decent
looking headphones and some bad looking
headphones but people who are average
consumers will take into consideration
how they look when they're outside so
they're not going to wear ugly pair of
headphones around their neck and just
walk around the streets with them that
it doesn't happen but people will walk
around with a good-looking pair of
headphones and that's okay I don't see
what the issue is with that now another
thing people like to complain about is
that beats by dre is marketing crazily
to everyone brainwashing people letting
them think that they have to have these
beads and they the greatest thing in the
world now since when is having powerful
marketing a bad thing
now if you look at any company a company
like coca-cola which has amazing
marketing does it all the time does
anyone blame them for marketing as much
as they do it's a sound business
practice to spend money on marketing if
you have the budget for it
marketing will draw in customers and at
the end of the day beats by dre is a
business and their bottom line is to
make a profit so if they can budget and
make marketing a big thing for them and
draw in those customers that will
purchase their headphones I see
absolutely no reason not to and if their
tactic is to use celebrities and get all
these endorsements what's wrong with
that Kellogg's does endorsements with
athletes all the time all kinds of stuff
so not really sure why marketing is a
bad thing and before the whole beats
craze you really didn't see too many
people walking around with headphones
around their neck or anything like that
so beats by dre has actually started
this new craze to have these headphones
and use people using them more often of
course there were tons of people who
wore headphones all the time and that's
always been a deal but not to the extent
that we see it now and I think it just
goes to show you that there was
something always lacking with previous
headphones or headphones that were
already out that people just didn't care
to have them around the fact that these
headphones are now a fashion accessory
they have the right marketing going for
them people care about headphones now
more so than they did before so beats
started this a big headphone craze so
getting upset at people who buy beats by
dre instead of walking around with no
headphones I don't see how what what the
problem is with that it's not like they
stopped buying sign Heiser's for beats
by dre like they're giving up SoundCloud
these are probably people who didn't
care much about headphones in the first
place until they got some stylish nice
sounding headphone so they started
getting more people interested in the
headphone game and I don't see where
there's a problem with that and that
leads me to talk about the value that
different people find in the headphones
audio files the number one priority is
of course going to be sound quality and
sound quality is probably going to be
much higher than their second
priority was I don't know what a second
what a second priority for an audiophile
would be but I'm pretty sure for the
average consumer the top priorities are
going to be sound and looks so if it
doesn't look good and doesn't sound good
the average consumer is probably not
going to want to wear them or listen to
them and I think that the beats by dre
has like I already said the helicanus
sound that the average consumer likes
with the bass that's what they can pick
up on and it's got to look going for it
so it's easy to find value in something
that meets your top two priorities or
top three whatever but if you're an
audiophile and you're you don't like the
beats by dre line because the sound
quality isn't there which is your number
one it makes sense that you don't want
it but it makes sense that the average
consumer does so I think value all
depends on the person's perspective and
you can't just bash it because your
perspective is different from someone
else's I'm not saying one is right what
is wrong I know a side of the fence I'm
on and that's the average consumer side
of course and the last thing I just
really want to put out there so I don't
understand the anger behind you know the
beats line I just don't get the
frustration that people get I just don't
see why it's a concern for someone if
you don't like it don't buy it if
someone else likes it let them buy it
you know their headphones doesn't matter
I can understand if someone's looking
for the best sound quality headphones
and they don't care about style they
don't care about all that stuff they
just want good sound I can understand
someone recommending something that's
not beats because they probably have
priorities similar to an audiophile but
all in all I still don't understand just
the anger anger towards the beats line
and the people who like beats like I
said you don't have to buy them no one's
forcing anyone to purchase the beats
line so it just doesn't make any any
sense to me I don't get the anger the
hate behind it all I mean what can I say
and that pretty much wraps it up guys I
mean I don't know if this is a rant or
just me explaining that I don't
understand why people are angry I'm not
trying to change anyone's mind here
if you don't like beach you don't like
beads but I just don't get why there's
any reason to hate them I don't know but
that's about it for this video guys let
me know if you disagree or agree I know
that's going to lead to a storm in the
comments section but let me know like I
said this is just my opinion and let me
hear what you guys have to say this you
have is consumer and so the next video
