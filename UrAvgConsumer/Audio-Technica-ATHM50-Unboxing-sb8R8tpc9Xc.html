want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone is your average consumer and
today after what feels like hundreds and
hundreds of comments about the eighty
eight and fifty Fabio Technica I finally
went out and got myself a pair and I'm
going to do an unboxing for you guys so
it's not wasting time let's get right
into it alright guys so here we have the
88 and 50s and I really picked these up
because I got tons of comments about
these asking whether of the headphones
are better than these or just to review
them and unbox them so finally got my
hands on them definitely want to see
what all the hype is about all around
the box you pretty got much skipped to
see the headphones themselves on the
side here you see in the little cutout
where you can see the logo of the audio
technica got some pictures on this side
and of course here are some specs so
let's get into this unboxing and see
what these bad boys are like now I'm not
even a really big oh I don't know about
like all the best headphones out there
I've only really been introduced to like
you know higher end headphones when I
started with them the beats line and you
know as I've done these videos I've
gotten more and more comments about
headphones and I've seen some stuff
online where everyone compares these two
like all other kinds of headphones
so these seems to be like a standard as
far as good quality headphones and good
value health headphones so I'm
definitely very interested in seeing
what this is like inside the box were
first created by the headphones inside
this little casing of course at the
bottom
you have here a little pouch I guess
this is what you'd be able to carry
around them um seems like some pretty
nice material these are for carrying it
around protecting it from scratches or
anything like that not too much like
protection that's part of like shock or
anything but this is definitely good to
store it and you know just travel around
a bit and of course we've got some um I
guess one registration information and
of course I'm like manual stuff for tips
and all that kind of whatnot so that
stuff aside let's get straight to these
bad boys and let's see I guess you could
fold these out here we have them these
are the ATM 50s now this is very
interesting user okay what I'm trying to
get a grip on what this looks like right
now okay let's see a lot of maneuvers
this thing can do okay cool
interesting very nice he's feel pretty
good that actually they feel pretty
durable I heard that this was made out
of plastic but it felt nice and I gotta
say I agree
I like how much this some these ear cups
can maneuver I really like that gives
him a lot of um flexibility here can do
a lot of different things with that let
me give you guys a close-up of course so
you can see what these look like alright
guys so here are the eight ehm 50s this
will feel really great like this
actually has some really nice ear cups I
do love the fact that this is an oval
shape the oval shape um over ear
headphones tend to be a lot more
comfortable than be purely circular ear
cups because your ear can kind of fit
right in the middle here and that's
really nice I'm definitely happy about
that
and as you can see here this thing can
do like so many different maneuvers a
lot of moving around it's pretty pretty
interesting stuff here I think it so you
can do all kinds of funky stuff so
that's pretty cool
gives you a lot of options there seem
pretty nice the top half the
audio-technica logo besides I've got a
technical logo pretty cool um see the
band feels pretty good just feels like
it'd be pretty comfortable there's
really sturdy at the top very sturdy but
this padding feels pretty nice so I
think this should be a pretty
comfortable set of headphones okay so
pretty much that's about it guys not
much else to show you I do like that it
only takes one quarter I was always
detachable but it's pretty nice so let's
get to the rest of this thing here all
right so let's on the rack there's some
headphone cable and it seems like it's
pretty long this is a very long cable
guys very long and the coil is pretty
pretty huge so this can definitely
stretch away from very far very far
really nice okay this is a really fit
cable so that's always a good thing I'm
not sure how these are gonna do as far
as tangling but um and here let me show
you guys what the headphone jack looks
like so here we have the headphone jack
I think that this has on the little
adapted to it the 3/4 adaptor sometime
think that's what it's called correct me
if I'm wrong but it has this a little
dab bit to it and this feels pretty nice
I do like this little coil thing it has
going along here now this looks pretty
great the only concern i've i've heard
about these um this headphone jack is
that because it's a flat a really large
and flat
um surface around here it's kind of hard
to get this inside of um inside of some
devices like let's say if you have a
case on your phone or something or your
ipod and if you can beat you can kind of
get in the way sense this whole thing
since the surface of this but a flat
part
to be touching the surface of the device
so it could be able to hinder something
in the future so overall I do really do
like this this looks like a very high
quality on headphone jack here pretty
nice and of course you have two coil
here it's a really really long coil so
you could that mean that gives you a lot
of distance as far as I'm moving away
from an object or something so that's
pretty nice and yeah pretty much that's
it for this song headphone jack alright
guys so that pretty much wraps up to
some boxing hopefully this is the
beginning of something great because I
just hear so many great things about
these headphones that I really hope they
live up to all the young hype and my
expectations so I'm definitely looking
forward to using videos should be really
interesting I just love the fact that
this thing could do whatever the heck
you wanted to it's pretty cool so
definitely a thanks to you guys for you
know asking about these and recommending
me to check them out and compare them
you're gonna see review the girlfriend
test all the works and if this really
does perform as well as um everyone says
it does I might be using these in my
future comparison videos kind of maybe
to set this as a standard seem seeing as
that's what I see a lot of people do so
this might be a set as a standard for
future videos comparisons and stuff like
that if you guys who are familiar with
this product think that's a pretty good
idea let me know down in the comment
section below if whenever I get future
headphones you want me to compare them
to these so alright guys that's about it
