and today we're gonna be looking at some
very affordable Bluetooth earbuds in a
world where air pods cost like 160 bucks
I decided to hit up Amazon and find a
bunch of good options for under 30 and
I'm telling you guys there were a lot of
earbuds to try out and sort through not
all of them made the cut but these are
the best ones that I could find like I
said for under 30 and first up we've got
this guy right here these are the sound
Pete's true free totally wireless
earbuds now this was very surprising to
me because these are actually really
good and they only cost 30 bucks and as
was standard with truly wireless earbuds
you of course get two earbuds inside of
this charging case so I've got them
right here and this is the case that
charges them and they're actually pretty
comfortable that can easily go in the
ear they have no problem staying in my
ears so that is definitely a bonus now
for 30 bucks and this being a pair of
truly wireless earbuds I expected the
sound to be really tint II not very
strong but there's actually a decent
amount of bass in here and the coyote is
very solid so you're able to hear vocals
really well now you also get about three
and a half hours of battery life with
these guys but when you throw in the
charging case into the mix you get a
total of fifteen hours of listening now
what I don't like about this case guys
so as you can see it's pretty open
usually truly wireless earbuds have a
flap that kind of covers them protects
these guys these have magnets built
inside of them so as you can see they
just lock right in and they're not gonna
move out of place like I can even though
they're staying in there but if you do
happen to drop the case well I've
dropped it plenty of times on the floor
and these have fallen out so that's
something you want to be weary of not so
people crazy about that but it does stay
in place otherwise and the only other
drawback with these is that they use
micro USB to charge micro USB is dated
by now but honestly all of the earbuds
that I tried out in this price range
they all have micro USB micro USB is
what's gonna be working with for
everything on this list now the sound
Pete's were truly wireless earbuds
but we also have some other options if
you're looking for something with a neck
band design now the first one I'm not
gonna lie to you guys this thing isn't
exactly a looker you like these re
alright anyway the quality though is
legit but this headset right here is
called the M Pal jaws now and how is it
a mainstream brand mainly find their
stuff on Amazon but I've ordered a few
of their things in the past and I will
say that their quality is actually
pretty good now as you can see these
have a neck band design so you can put
them around your neck pop out the ear
buds and just throw them in now I like
these because these have actual ear buds
on them so they'll stay inside of the
ear and when you got this neck band
design it's always nice because you
don't have to worry about gravity
working against you and making your
earbuds fall out this thing kind of
holds it all together but even though
it's not the best looking pair of ear
buds it's still pretty functional it's
got easy controls over here so you've
got your volume on the side you've got
your track controls so you can switch
between all the different songs you want
to play now the reason why I like these
and I'm recommending them even though
they're not the best-looking is that
they're very functional they're
comfortable and they sound pretty good
you definitely get a good bit of bass
here but it isn't muddy usually with
these cheaper ear buds the bass can go
overboard but this does a really good
job in making the vocals nice and clear
and having a little bit of punch to it
the ear buds are also magnetic so right
on the neck band you have a place to put
them whenever you're done using them and
that is actually pretty convenient
now these only go for about 24 bucks so
if you're really on a budget and you
happen to like the neck band design and
you don't mind the wires kind of hanging
out a bit then these are definitely a
really good option now let's say you're
not into the whole ear buds thing you
don't like the feeling in your ear and
you want to go something that feels a
little bit more like just regular ear
buds these are pretty nice these right
here are the Samsung you ear buds and
these are pretty similar to the empire's
that we have over here but I feel like
their design is a little less obnoxious
not quite as big up to ends but you do
still have this cable that hangs around
the neck band you have all of your
controls right here on the side so you
can control your volume with these two
and you also have that monkey
multifunctional button over here where
you can play and pause skip to the next
track back on a deal but for these I
think when it comes to the sound quality
they're okay they have pretty good
vocals not that bass heavy for sure but
these definitely still do sound very
nice and crisp and when you put them
around your neck it doesn't look like
you're carrying anything huge around I
like that they come with little tips so
that if you have a hard time keeping
this style of earbud in your ear you got
the little wing tips over here to kind
of help with that but they also come
with a few other options in case you
don't really like this style and the ear
buds are also magnetic so if you want to
keep them together like this when you're
not using them you got that option as
well
neck bands are a lot cooler than you
think guys when it comes to
functionality they just just don't look
The Grapes form or function you pick and
last but not least we've got these ear
buds over here from the guys over at
let's come so I found these over on
Amazon of course and if you've been
lusting over some power beats this is
going to be an option for you at about a
tenth of the price it's crazy now these
are cool because they're geared towards
people who need ear buds for working out
their ipx7 rated so you don't have to
worry about sweat or anything like that
and they've got this ear hook design so
that'll keep them in place as well so
boom power beats without the beats
projects is high these are pretty good
in terms of comfort and having that
sweat resistance so if you're looking
for a pair of workout earbud these are
definitely a solid choice now when it
comes to the sound quality of these guys
I will say out of everything that I've
shown today these are a bit on the
weaker side in comparison to them but
for the everyday person who's using
these probably won't having any
complaints it's got a lot of bass and it
can get a bit muddy depending on how
loud you put them but overall the sound
is definitely passable especially for
the gym but in terms of sound I give
these a little hand shake thing yeah
sorry you could even look at it this way
if you have a pair of ear pods or
something and you really like them but
you
don't want to mess them up at the gym
with your sweat or maybe having one of
them fall out this is a good option that
you don't have to worry about because of
the sweat resistance and of course these
ear hooks that'll keep them in place so
use these in the gym and everything else
when you're out of it
now it's also nice is that it has a ton
of color options I've got this great and
light blue over here which I think it
looks pretty good and they only go for
20 bucks and it even comes with a little
travel case and you also have a spot for
the little ear tips that it comes with
and the USB cable
20 bucks guys like who's mad at that but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it honestly I
feel like the best one on this list it's
probably those sound Pete's those were
really surprising but I think there's
some utility for everything that we
mentioned today but let me know what you
guys think down below and if you like
hearing about these way way more
affordable options than some of the
stuff that we usually talk about that's
more mainstream let me know what the
comment down below and I'll catch you
guys in the next one if you enjoyed it
be the cool guy bro that guy's video
thumbs up till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
