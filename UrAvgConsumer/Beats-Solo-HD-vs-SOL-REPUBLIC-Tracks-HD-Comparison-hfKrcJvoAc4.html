want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone and drivers consumer and today
I have a comparison video for you guys
of the beats by dre solo HDS versus the
soul Republic's tracks HD so let's not
waste some time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the SOL
Republic tracks HD versus the beats by
dre solo HDS so I know you guys have
been asking for these this video quite a
bit after which one's better especially
considering the price difference so I'm
gonna let you guys know how I feel about
them right now okay so first off we'll
start with the design I think they both
look really great I've always been a fan
of the beats the beats line
I think the solo HDS look really great
especially in the white color it's just
nice looking pair of headphones I don't
think anyone can argue the design with
these are just great and the actual look
of the sole Republic's tracking STIs
they look pretty good too umm and when
it comes to the SOL Republic tracks HD I
actually really like this design as well
I think it's a very interesting you look
um I definitely could see myself with
some nice with choosing some nice colors
I definitely can see that these would be
really nice as far as the design goes so
it's really cool
they both are great looking at it phone
I just I don't know as far as choosing
between one of the other I think being a
beats band
um leans me towards the beats a bit more
but I think it can go in you either way
with anyone else
um I both I think they're both really
soft looking headphones they both look
really good so being a fan is all that
makes me a bit biased towards these now
as far as like let's say comfort I think
that the SOL Republic tracks HDS are
pretty very very comfortable headphones
they feel really light um I'm guessing
that because the
and then being so light here comes being
pretty light too so this feels really
light when it's on your head um it kind
of actually kind of scary because it's
like you almost feel like it'll fall off
at some point never happened to me but
it's just that light of a pair of
headphones and I thought I thought
that's pretty interesting on visa no
very comfortable to me as well I've seen
some people complain that they don't
like the solo HDS Comfort and that's
very interesting to me because I always
thought these were very comfortable pair
of headphones I've never had problems
listening to these for a very long time
so it's very interesting to hear people
say that so as far as comfort goes the
fact that these feels so light on the
head maybe I'll give it to these but I
do like the fact that these um feel a
bit more secure to me they both honestly
I wouldn't really give it to one over
the other in a overall sense they are
just both fine as far as the comfort
goes I really can't complain these do
have some really soft cushions as well
as these and this does have a nice
headband cushion as well where the
facilities might lack a little cushion
in comparison to be tracks HD another
thing as far as the design goes I do
like the fact that the song solo HP's
are able to fold and by doing this this
makes them a bit more portable than the
of the tracks HD the tracks HD can only
stay like this well what you can do is
you can maybe take them apart and you
know put them in different places but
overall this it's not bent it's not
foldable so it makes it a bit more
clunky a little harder to you know get
around with I'll let you know you just
want to put it on your ear your neck and
that's always fine but the fact that
these fold up over these is a you know
pretty good bonus it's always great to
have headphones that fold verses
headphones that don't so now as far as
durability goes I would say that beyond
some public tracks HD I'll give it to
these simply because you can do the
whole um twistable on bendable headband
thing and in that were you know having
to worry about it snapping so the fact
that I can do all
fancy stuff not that it's important to
be honest like if you're doing that
stuff to your headphones and I don't
know I don't know why you own them but
these they can't do that and I wouldn't
risk it I wouldn't try it at all I don't
want to break these but it's not normal
circumstance to bend your headphones up
it like that or anything unless you sit
on them maybe if you sit on them you
don't you know that's something to
consider the it being bendable but the
fact that these can do that is
definitely a bonus over these I don't
know I've seen some stress tests on
these and you know they had some pretty
good results the newer versions do have
better results than the older ones but
like I said um I don't see why you would
end up your headphones like crazy so
there's no real bonuses there but the
fact that this can do it it's something
to mention as far as futures code they
both have inline remotes that you know
function exactly the same what is it
better than the other so that's not
really a anything special to talk about
between the two of a function exactly
the same but um one thing to also
consider is that the solo HDS are
smaller so you know it's a little less
um cumbersome around the neck so that's
something to keep in mind as well that
these are smaller headphones they don't
have this little part dangling out and
they don't have the two cables coming
out from both ear cuts which can be a
bit annoying that time when your own you
know you have these around your neck
where this has a single the single cable
coming out from the one side so that's
also a little bonus for young solo
easties so now we really spoke about all
the asked the aesthetics of these
headphones like designed with comfort
and just the overall look and durability
so now that we've gotten that out of the
way of course now we're going to talk
about the sound and I must say in sound
as far as sound goes I'm going to give
it to the tracks HDS
which um is actually pretty surprising I
always thought that the beach is done
solo it's these were pretty good but the
Trax HD do sound a bit better because it
is just a lot a lot louder it doesn't
sound quite as I guess you could say
muddy as there so ladies let's say that
this old HD sound muddy all the time but
when you do a direct comparison between
some headphones then you'll start
thinking that these might be muddy come
in comparison but overall I must say
that the sound was a bit better on the
tracks HD I think it had a little bit
more bass on and you know that's a big
thing considering it these are like real
bass heavy headphones so you know I got
to give it to the tracks HP's they just
sounded it sounded a bit better a lot
clearer a lot louder than the all the
solenoids these did so I definitely
think that these would now not only are
we spoken about really all the aspects
of the headphones which ones would I
choose overall like I said I'm a beat
spin I like the style I'd go for these
personally but as someone who doesn't
have a favor towards Beats or anything
like that I'd probably go with the solo
public's simply because it's a lot
cheaper these cost 130 compared to 200
that's a big difference there 70 bucks
you're not getting so you're not like
don't think you're paying for 70 bucks
here is the brand and like if you're
particularly like the style so if you
don't really care about the style you
think this looks just as good as this I
say go for these I personally just like
the style of you so I'm willing to pay
that money because I like I'd like to be
wearing these this is my kind of style I
like that sorry would pay the difference
but if you don't care you're neutral
between the two go with the tracks HDS
they offer a little bit better sound
they still got a really nice sleek
design nice durable headband can't go
wrong with these and the core it offers
the same features as these so there's
really no bill bonuses as outside of
doing of the looks of these versus Diaz
it's our would go with these if you do
if you do like beats though and you just
like the brand
you like the style of them then you know
go for these if you want but I do think
overall that these would probably be the
better choice for the average consumer
as you will get better sound and you
will save a lot more money so I'd have
to go for these personally for your for
you guys who are the average consumers
who don't have like a preference or
anything like that that's really the
Trax HDS and pretty much guys that wraps
up my review of or my comparison of the
solo HDS versus the SOL Republic Trax HD
