today we're gonna be building a PC now
I'm not even gonna act like I know how
to build a PC so I've got my buddy
Austin Evans over here to kind of lead
the way and show us how we can get this
thing done so a building a computer is
fun right this is something that I feel
like it's almost like a badge of honor
like if you really want to be a
full-fledged nerd you have to build a
computer at least sometime in your life
you know I'm missing that bathroom well
we're about to get it right now all
right so we've got a bunch of parts here
many of which I don't know what they're
even good for but Austin what exactly
are we looking at and what do we need
for sure so to start with you need a
processor so in this case we have an
Intel Core i3 this is essentially the
brain of your computer so a processor is
what does most of the normal stuff for
example like when you click on a webpage
the processor is what's doing the work
to actually turned all those zeros and
ones into something you can actually you
know look at if you want to get into
gaming you're probably going to get a
graphics card so this is the new Radeon
RX 4 80
this guy even though it's not super
expensive is very powerful so not only
can you play VR it can look like an
oculus rift or nations alive get all
into the matrix this is also powerful
enough to easily handle games like Tandy
key really I cranked the settings up and
everything so this guy is the
motherboard so the motherboard is
printed where everything plugs in right
pretty much you can think of this is
like the central hub of the build so
pretty much every part of the build is
either gonna be plugged in the
motherboard screwed in everything kind
of has to connect here next up is memory
this is essentially the RAM the memory
this is what allows you to load programs
to kind of keep them you're gonna
probably want at least eight gigs of ram
SSD so this is one of these optional
components right you do need to have
some kind of drive whether it's an SSD
or whether it's a hard drive this is
where for example you'll install Windows
or Linux or whatever kind of operating
system you want so you keep all your
files all that kind of stuff that is the
power supply so I get that yeah it's
pretty simple it's basically like the
computer version of like the power brick
in your phone right so when you plug
your phone in there's that little guy
that goes in the wall this just happens
to live inside the computer - how's
everything you're going to want to case
so cases are probably the easiest way to
customize
right because you can get all kinds of
different shapes and sizes and colors
and everything we have the NZXT s340
here I like a house tiny I look behind
hey guys hope you better yeah okay guys
like this is a great time I mentioned we
actually want to open bill it's a
screwdriver the thing is it's fun like
this is a Saturday afternoon cold
buddies welding a like this is
like my favorite part right like just
having fun it's not like super crazy
horny bonus okay so this is the scary
part I'm excited about this is like the
heart of the Terminator right here we're
actually not gonna use all these cables
okay that makes you feel a little better
so it won't actually pull all the way in
we need to put this guy in but basically
this is essentially where the power
supply is gonna live right here on the
bottom
cool and next is to do these guys haha
four screws in my pool to break down yet
mama do it haha we got a little bit more
to go but uh car supplies installed
pretty sorry that wasn't too bad
don't worry about all these we'll deal
with those later that's what about this
let's just shove them away get this out
of the way we're done alright next step
is to do the motherboard so this middle
bit is where the CPU goes right so we're
gonna keep in mind that CPU goes inside
this guy there's an arm to kind of let
the the good stuff loose when you're
actually go to install it it's simple is
that
so before installing your motherboard
and this is something I definitely never
ever done you want to make sure that you
actually in stop the i/o shield once you
do simple is dropping it in place this
is good general practice just in life
really just screw things in by the
corners first to make sure it's in place
first life tips with awesome editors go
with it people with it alright that
looks good to me dude I think we're good
to go now the real test is if we pick up
the case to the motherboard come flying
out
no it does not you sir have successfully
installed a motherboard to install a
graphics card we want to put it in this
slot so push it that way a little bit
more cuz yeah it slides right behind the
motherboard like that mm boom a little
more oh hey quick oh you long for the
club always hear the click so SSDs are
really easy install in this case drives
in general usually pretty easy but this
is kind of like even easier so that is
officially all of our hardware in the
case so that comes the fun part
plugging it all up dealing with this
doubt I think for the installation
portion of it all this wasn't so bad
yeah I mean seriously there's nothing is
that scary about building a PC it's
basically all of the cables were playing
in right now or all run from this top it
with power button everything and just
runs down here go down to the actual
motherboard so that's built yeah awesome
you ready great job
wait wait there's one more thing all
right turn on let's see is this how
buttons no point man right here oh boy
hey I see lights I see bikes bands I'm
good to go there that's a god oh that
happened though we got it guys yeah this
actually wasn't terrible uh I think the
hardest part was probably would probably
be just aligning the cables and getting
them all right cables are the most or
the most tedious part I guess it takes a
little while I mean there are definitely
videos turnaround that I've made they go
way more in depth and all that kind of
stuff but for the most part he just
takes a little while and that's good I
don't know man I don't really need it
really hmm
only there's a way of doing something
with this system hmm maybe one of you
guys oh wow so if you guys want a chance
to win one of these I'll be doing a
giveaway over on Instagram the post will
be down below in the description so
definitely check that out
one free chance at winning this guy and
that's about it for this video hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy or girl that give this video a
thumbs up I'll catch you on the next one
shout out to Austin Evans for helping us
out and we'll catch in the next one guys
