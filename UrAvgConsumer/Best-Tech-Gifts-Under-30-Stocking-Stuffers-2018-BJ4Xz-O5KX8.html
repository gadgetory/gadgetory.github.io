consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at some awesome tech stocking
stuffers
for about under 30 bucks for those of
you who are working with a budget or
maybe there's someone you want to get a
gift for but you know like them that
much so we've got some awesome gift
ideas and first and foremost we got this
guy right here and this is the Amazon
smart plug now a lot of us have dumb
products in our house and by them I mean
they don't work with the internet you
can't control them with your voice but
this guy gives you the ability to if you
have something like in ms on echo dot or
regular echoes so something like a
regular Christmas tree that we've got
right here I actually have a setup with
my smart plug so I can just tell them my
Amazon echo turn off the Christmas tree
lights and boom off they go and you can
pretty much do this with any product
that you have in your house whether it's
a fan Christmas tree great for the
holidays or maybe something like your TV
so you can control it with your voice
like you guys just saw or you can pull
out the app turn it back on just like
that which makes it really really simple
and all you really need to get started
is an Amazon echo those cost about 30
bucks so that can also be on this list
but those are a great pair to add some
new smart home features to your home if
you haven't gotten those already there
are a lot of smart plugs out there that
do this kind of thing but this guy right
here is pretty small doesn't take up a
lot of space on the wall I still have
access to my other outlet not to mention
it's only 20 bucks so it's a pretty
inexpensive way to start adding smart
home features to your home and next up
guys we got a pair of Bluetooth earbuds
these are the mpow flame wireless
earbuds now these are a pair of sport
earbuds so they've got the little hook
design and that means they can go around
your ears kind of place them just like
this which is very comfortable and
what's crazy about these earbuds guys
these only go for 21 bucks now you
wouldn't expect earbuds and this price
range to sound any good and I'm not
gonna say that these sounds amazing they
actually sound pretty decent for the
price though if you happen to live base
you'll definitely get that here and
since these are a pair of support
earbuds if you're working out and you
need some music that'll really just pump
you up
these are
definitely gonna do a really good job
and not only that they're ipx7 water
resistant so if you sweat or maybe you
get a little water on these you don't
have to worry it is not gonna damage
them and honestly at 21 bucks this is an
amazing deal but if you know someone who
needs a pair of earbuds and bluetooth
this is definitely something you want to
look into oh and not to mention guys it
also comes with a travel case so if you
want to protect your earbuds you can go
ahead and do that but what I want to
talk next about guys is something you
might have heard me talk about on the
channel before and that is this little
guy if I could just get it out
we got the towel slim over here now for
me this is mandatory I like to keep it
in my wallet
because we change clothes everyday you
might not remember which pants pocket
you left your wallet in so having
something like this is so clutch because
it doesn't take up a lot of space and
you know exactly where it is and if you
ever happen to lose your wallet
something like this can help you locate
it
it works with a smartphone app so right
from the app you can go ahead and make
this thing ring just like that but
what's also cool is that let's say you
misplace your smartphone but you have
your wallet and the tile you can just
press this little button and it'll
actually make your phone ring so if you
misplace that you'll know where to find
it but I actually went into Best Buy the
other day and saw that they had like a
bundle where you get to Slim's and the
two style mates I guess is what they
call them you can throw these onto your
keys I have a pair on my keys because I
tend to misplace those as well so I
always make sure I have one of these as
well as the Slim's and you can get all
four of these for about 50 bucks which
is a little bit more but I think it
makes a great gift if you know someone
who tends to misplace something well
it's also nice about these tile mates is
that now they actually have the ability
to change the battery so it's not a
one-and-done you can actually just hold
on to it and it replace the battery
whenever it needs it for me personally I
can never have too many of these so a
$50 gift like this would have me happy
and next up we've got a really
inexpensive stocking stuffer this is the
spigen Apple watch stand and this little
guy only goes for about 10
now I think this would make a great gift
for someone who has an app watch maybe
they're using just a standard cable to
charge it but what's nice about the
Apple watch is that when it's on the
side like what we see over here we
actually get a nice little interface so
not only will it charge it all you
making me look bad
hold on let's see but there you go so
you get a nice little interface over
here where it can tell you the time it's
the little things I think someone would
definitely appreciate that and it's only
ten bucks so you don't have to break the
bank for it something that I really do
like with it too is that it has a pretty
sticky bottom so you can put it on a
surface and this thing is not going to
move at all and it comes in a few
different colors to match the app watch
that the person may have and the black
version is actually only eight bucks so
it's only between $8 and $10 you're not
gonna spend a lot of money and if you
have an Apple watch it makes a really
nice body and next up guys we got
something for the gamer in your life
over here we have a gaming headset by
Logitech these are the Logitech g4 30s
now this headset only cost 30 bucks so
it fits within our budget and it's got
these large ear cups so it'll fit right
over your ears should be okay for long
listening sessions but one thing that's
nice is that it has a built-in
microphone so if you want to chat and
your party let people know what's going
on in your game on your side you can do
that but what's also nice about this is
that it has 7.1 virtual surround sound
but that's with the included sound card
so you're going to need that to activate
that but that's something you really
wouldn't expect from a $30 gaming
headset so if you know someone who would
enjoy using these these are definitely a
nice option but I will say if you want
to spend 10 dollars more you can also
take a look at this guy over here these
are the Astro eight ends and the reason
why I think this is a good
recommendation especially if you're
buying this for a child and you think
they may break it at some point you
don't really have to worry about this
because take a look guys
this thing can bend and twist this is a
very very durable headset so if you know
a kid who's just gonna lose in their
game Chuck this thing at the wall you
don't have to worry this thing is
extremely durable it's $10 more but it
is also very very very comfortable so me
personally I like these a little bit
more but if you want to save 10 bucks
you can absolutely take a look at the
Logitech g4 30s both are solid options
if you're trying to save a buck but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed this stocking
stuffer list we've got a lot of cool
options down below in the description
definitely check them out if you want to
check out other holiday videos that
we've made I'll of course have them
linked down below as well but till the
next one guys your average consumer if
you enjoyed it be the cool guy girl
gives it a thumbs up till next time
