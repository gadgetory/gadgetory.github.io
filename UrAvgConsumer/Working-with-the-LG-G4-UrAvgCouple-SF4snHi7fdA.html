in the park there's so many people out
here but we're in the park and today I'm
gonna be getting some footage of the LG
g4 you guys are gonna kind of see some
behind the scenes stuff I've got all my
gear in this giant backpack tripod over
here so we can get to work I got this
girl with me today yeah the training
needs to be his new camera person
wouldn't that be nice to have an extra
camera person on hand I could use some
help there see this summer beautiful I'm
having that extra 10 person is gonna be
pretty cool if only you had some like
After Effects skills and Adobe After
Effects or photo or Final Cut Pro skills
you pay me though you see and that's
what we go around I take bags of cement
there yet I got a 10 already it's hot
and you called me back I want I see
the minute get nice yeah I'll be just
fine and somebody needs to come in bring
them so the way Joe does this is he has
like a whole list of things he wants to
talk about and he cashes b-roll so that
he can talk about those things I'm
Manning the list right now basically I'm
an assistant basically I'm the
production manager because I tell I'm
gonna tell them how things are happening
and know what order it's right now we're
getting this footage was pretty soon I
want him to give me some other footage
from the list I'm managing this set
right now so right now I'm just doing
some basic close-up shots some macro
shots of the LG g4 was
21:35 millimeters I can swim in like
crazy for the next o so I want to show
you guys behind the scenes is how it
gets processed a up he does uses random
batteries don't think I asked if you
won't take that risk it seems very risky
to me look at this in the water yeah now
I'll be crying can you swim to go get
that I'm not jumping into this dirty
border for that that's not happening
look guys a mother duck and her
ducklings they were all swimming
together just now and stopped to take a
bath maybe they're not bathing but I try
to zoom in I think that's the farthest
we can go oh so cute oh come on
ducklings follow right where I change my
lens something with a smaller oh so cute
so this is normal we got a package in
the mail and it's redundant
one time one time it was for me and
that's in my friend Masha proposed to me
to be a bride me at one time
it's beautiful all right all right so we
are on our way to the mall as usual it's
under the mall or Walmart for us usually
or tops
yes I'll hubs Friday three places um but
yeah we are going to go get some stuff
because once again I'm going to New
Orleans so right now we're in the Garden
State Plaza Mall Perry has to go to the
Apple Store
in there for like three weeks now maybe
but I have issues with this prior to
this
yeah AppleCare is pretty much worth
look at her waiting patiently for her
Apple device
you're trying some watches too
the patient's has died in five minutes
working
stop hating
just insurance really
so I was trying on the Apple watch one
for her size just with the arrests or
for me
complicated sorry even you can move the
you like the brown mark
I think it would need a medium
science math watches and we also
switched out the stainless steel line
with different colors with the band
night light so that finish
I'm gonna go stainless steel you might
be like
it should go scratch it up guys I have
mine
stainless steel version that I have
already has some scratches on
there's there's Lisa teacup scratches
but
I don't wanna have to baby it whenever I
use it
I don't think the stainless steel
version is for me I like yours
so right now I'm using the black
aluminum this the base gray version and
now it's time to take a few years off my
life by making me wait around and Irish
shots okay she's enjoying it enjoying my
demise
sorry tells me we're almost done and I
know better than that
this is like phase one of the ten you
picked out some clothing and then she's
gonna hate it all and then try a bunch
of other clothes and we're gonna rinse
wash and repeat ten more times all right
so we're finally done it shopping God
hey I got everything that I mean it and
now we're headed to Bahama Breeze which
is a series throwback because we have
not been there in a very long time and
if you guys remember from our vlogs we
love Bahama Breeze so we get to go would
be reunited with that restaurant and
