and today we're gonna be spending a real
Dana life with the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
if you're not familiar with my real name
to live videos you're basically gonna
spend a whole day with me while we test
out the phone and see how it performs
with some actual real-world usage but
I've got to give a huge shout-out to D
brand for getting the phones in my hand
a bit earlier than the ones I already
pre-ordered so thanks a lot D Brad I
appreciate it now I do have some
pre-orders coming in so that means I
have extra phones to give away to one of
you guys so be sure to subscribe to the
channel and check the end of the video
for more details on how to answer so far
all we did was pretty much set it up get
our apps on there and we haven't done
much else so we're going to check out
things like the front-facing camera all
that no selfies have been taken yet
we're gonna do that now full day work so
the first stop is this place I got to
come in and grab a package of course all
right so I got my email pulled up and
this is like the worst kind of message
you can see when you're tracking
something undeliverable as addressed
then you got to go to this place but yo
peep the skin this is Dragon Skin by D
brands probably one of the best skins
I've ever seen
this is hot kind of goes with the outfit
too so that's up
I pretty much waited for about I don't
maybe even a half hour and they sent
back my package already where is
mmm that's all I can say guys alright so
that was a total bus but right now we're
using the phone as a GPS because we're
going to the mall right baby yeah we
know how to get to the mall after all
these years I'm not even gonna lie guys
I'm low-key scared of the phone being
used as a GPS because the s7 didn't have
great battery the notes you know uh so I
don't know this has a smaller battery of
the two so I'm a little scared yeah
we've been going for 40 minutes but
you've only lost represent three percent
yeah I need to presenting
all right it's manageable alright guys
so we're done with our ride we're on our
way inside the mall we drove for around
27 minutes and we lost about 7% so 85%
still left good enough for the rest of
the day so it's a pretty sunny day but
with brightness turned up all the way to
the max we've got absolutely no trouble
looking at apps or anything on the
screen and I mean the screens screen is
amazing it's from Samsung the Super
AMOLED display it's going to be good now
it's crazy is that I didn't even realize
it this whole time but the phone had no
issues in my hands it didn't slip or
anything but that's because I'm using
this dragon skin from D brand the one
that I used at the event when I first
tested it wasn't too bad but it was
definitely a lot more slippery in the
hands than this is so glad to get that
extra texture here so right now Aries
trying to convince me to go to Sephora
with her he's going to know I went to
hand implanted because of use there for
like two hours just to find the same
stores I know yogi know definitely two
hours and I was the best sport I was
fine except for him to buy
so you'll be coming to me to pick up
I'll go in there for a few minutes so
guys you're not allowed to vlog or take
pictures report in Sephora top piece
nada they're not doing that there's
absolutely nothing there for me at that
point we're in enemy territory folks
we're in enemy territory now this kind
of display I'm not even gonna lie is
taking some getting used to
I'm not used to having those edges on
the side I never really mess around with
the galaxy s7 edge I didn't really like
that kind of design but this one's not
that bad but still it does take some
getting used to but you got close stuff
like this that pop up on the side you
can access a couple of cool things so
it's got its benefits too but guys even
though you the top and bottom spill off
a bit because of the edges you can't
deny how beautiful this display is this
thing just looks so amazing it's
definitely worth the sacrifice if you're
not used to having those edges spill out
so Aries walking away with her goodies
right there you probably just 15% off
lucky you so right now we're in front of
this little pet shop and it's clearly a
good opportunity to use the camera
obviously if I can get a good picture
all right let's see how that came out
now it is behind the glass so kind of
hard to know if it's going to be a
decent picture pictures are kind of hard
to tell if they're really good because
of that glass but we'll try something
else for sure and it would not be right
if I did not play this game
boom Pokemon draw it seems to be running
pretty smooth no issues so far seems
really smooth actually nice and it even
fits the weird little aspect ratio that
Samsung's going for with this guy kind
of like the g6 but handles are really
well and yes I know Pokemon go is dead
for some people but not me something to
note that you can change the resolution
from Full HD to quad HD so this phone is
capable of quad HD but it comes to fault
at full HD probably to save battery and
stuff like that and to be completely
honest with you I can't tell the
difference so I'm going to put it back
on that since the aspect ratio on this
phone is a bit different it's not the
standard 1920 by 1080 is twenty-two
twenty by ten eighty so it's a little
bit more because of the extra pixels at
the top and bottom all right so our
camera died
here so this is the front facing camera
it's really close what I don't even know
what this is in this part of 1080p I'll
see if I can change that but there's the
quality looks pretty good oh my god I
gotta be like this I look crazy so got a
picture of little the P right here let's
be vision you hit that and it should
detect it you select what you need to
and let's see if it'll see um I think we
can buy this anywhere else nothing much
I know a bit sunny and something that
isn't it'll be okay okay yeah bunch of
Togo food that's actually really cool
this is just so random the fact that I
pulled it up is really nice I saw way
out of them all but as you can see the
sun's going down a bit I still haven't
really gotten a chance to play around
with the camera so I figured I'd bring
down one of my little Gundams from the
office and I don't take a couple
pictures see how it goes
all right so we've got a few shots and
my goodness guys this camera honestly is
so amazing so this has a 1.7 aperture so
that means that you'll get that nice
depth of field effect a natural depth of
field effect no special software here to
do that so basically what that means
guys is that you're gonna get those
blurry backgrounds and you're gonna have
your subject in focus so it gives you
that nice professional well it looks
really really good
ah I love this phone all right guys you
know what time it is time to jump on the
booster board let's see what that
optical image stabilization is like
where's he going alright let's see let's
see oh this looks pretty good
got some bumpy streets over here all
right I think for the most part we got
what we needed folks so I got Harry out
here she's like pleasing I am I'm very
cool right now do it for the shot though
so I was gonna try out the front-facing
camera yes these are very important to
me so let's see let's see I like it it
feels I still think it looks a little
soft like yeah it looks a little soft to
me um but in comparison to like what I
have my iPhone is pretty much the same I
like it what's clear enough alright guys
so it's about 749 right now and we're
looking at 27% of battery life left
let's see if we can find the screen on
time we're looking at about 3 hours and
19 minutes so I did use a lot of GPS
from Google Maps to pull on go um but ok
that's where we are not the best battery
life in the world this does have 3000
milliamp hours I really wish they had a
bit more but hey the LG G 6 has about
3,300 which would have been nice but uh
it is what it is using this in the hand
hasn't been a problem I was able to
throw it in my pocket with no problem as
well even though it freaks me out
because it doesn't have a screen
protector right now but it's been pretty
smooth
had no problem obviously a skin helps in
terms of being able to hold on to it
Bixby there's no real point to the
Bigsby right now to be honest but
whatever honestly I think the only real
complaint I have with this phone right
now well besides the mediocre battery
life I'd say it's the fact that apps
don't take advantage of the full real
estate by default and when I say that
that means when I open an app that
doesn't support the full real estate you
can see that there's like a black border
right here on
the notification bar so you can actually
jump into the settings and change that
so by jumping into display you can then
go to full screen apps and there are
some apps that are by default going to
take the whole real estate of the phone
and then some others that you have to
hit a switch for so if you want all your
apps to be like that you're going to
have to do this whenever you install it
so just something to note when you're
going through and downloading your apps
all right guys so I've been using the s8
obviously so what are your thoughts
you try typing with it and like writing
messages and all that yeah I did one of
my main concerns okay this feels so
scripted okay scripted not scripted it's
not suited but one of main concerns
remember I told you before about
switching from an Apple phone to Samsung
devices like the typing a texting I'm a
huge texture but it felt just fine like
it felt just the same it's weird that
phone felt like it was gonna be too big
for me that's why I opted for abs 8 but
she's going from us iPhone 7 to an s 8
plus which is a huge huge jump
so you're still finally comfortable I
still find uncomfortable but I do feel
the difference obviously in the phone
but it doesn't feel like I'm at a
disadvantage at all because at small
hands and reading this there you have it
and you like the selfie camera
I told oh that's the one thing I'm not
that crazy about it it's okay yeah
that's fine uh so you don't think it's
instagram-worthy
oh no no I only built over time oh yeah
you gotta use the the fingerprint not
the fingerprint the heartrate Caesarea
to take selfies which is actually pretty
cool ready ready for this I'm gonna
light it does look a little washed out
it does right it doesn't fit like as
crisp I think I was like the back camera
or even my front-facing camera my iPhone
shots fired
so guys we've been comparing these two
phones to selfie cameras we're spending
way too much time on this I think we are
but selfies are serious business so
yeah I don't know I feel like I got to
go with the sa re likes ideally likes
what ice so we're gonna do is we're
gonna put up both pictures up okay and
then you won't you guys will tell us
which one you think looks best we took a
picture that's almost the same exact
positioning so you guys can tell us what
you think is best you be the judge now
we spend some real time with the phone
and there's a long list of things that I
love about this phone and a handful of
things that I'm not so crazy about but
first thing that I really like is the
design I think it looks great it's
comfortable in the hand and even the si+
is pretty good in the hand as well it's
about the same height as the iPhone 7
plus that I use but that bigger screen
does make it a two-handed device but
overall I think they look great and they
feel great in the hand even with those
edges now the second thing I like is of
course that beautiful display despite
those edges that I'm not so crazy about
it is still an amazing amazing screen
the screen is vibrant and colorful and
still manages to be large on a small
body like the SI and even more
ridiculous on the SI plus I do really
like it it is a bit longer though so it
may take some time for people to get
used to it as well as developers to
develop apps that really fit that aspect
ratio but thankfully Samsung does offer
some setting changes that allows you to
fit the apps in there so it doesn't look
too weird YouTube even offers some
aspect ratio changes that do crop this
frame a bit so there are little tweaks
that you can implement to get around
that and of course the camera is amazing
just like most of Samsung's recent
devices it looks really good it produces
some excellent quality photos as well as
videos they're very vibrant have great
dynamic range very sharp so you can't
complain with the camera re wasn't
completely sold on the front-facing
camera though but I personally like that
but she thinks high phones are a bit
better for her Instagram and while Bixby
may not be super useful anywhere else
when it comes to your camera and photos
is actually really cool that you can go
in and search things on the internet
depending on what it finds in your
photos and it can be pretty hit or miss
but when it does work it's actually very
surprising and cool now when it comes to
the UI I gotta say I really do like it
Samsung has come a long long way when it
comes to the UI I used to hate TouchWiz
but now they've implemented a much nicer
version but even arranging the home
screen has gotten a lot simpler better
than what I've seen on any other
smartphone if you really care about your
home screen and arranging it and
customizing it Samsung makes it a lot
easier to do this with the SK so I'm a
huge fan of these upgrades the UI from
me has been stellar there's other cool
little bonuses like expandable storage
ip68 water resistance in case you spill
some water on it and there's even new
ways to unlock your phone so new
security you can use your iris scanner
face detection or even a fingerprint
standard all kinds of cool ways not all
of them are really necessary since it
can be fooled by a photo or even an
identical twin which is not the best
idea but you can actually just use the
fingerprint scanner which is really fast
and that's the one I use all the time
and there are those handful of things
that I'm not so crazy about speaker
being one of them it's very easy to
completely block out the sound depending
on how you hold it so that's not so
great there's also that weird big speed
button ah it is such a tease to have an
awesome button there that could
potentially offer a really cool feature
to the device but they want to keep it
as big speed Bigsby is not the most
useful thing in the world so everyone's
complaining and I get why and battery
life is a bit mediocre I had about 4
hours and 14 minutes of screen on time
that's not super impressive I wish it
had a bit more but I can understand why
Samsung's not really trying to push any
boundaries when it comes to battery
right now but either way those are just
a handful of things I dislike on a form
that I love overall and I definitely
recommend it the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
si+ are awesome phones just depends on
