consumer and I know you guys have been
waiting forever for this video but I'm
finally going to be reviewing the beats
by dre your beats so let's not waste any
time
get right into it alright guys and here
we have the your beats the beasts by
Dre's newest in-ear earbuds and usual
retail for about ninety nine ninety-five
hundred bucks so it's pretty cheap
compared to some of the other options
that beats by dre offers and it's very
interesting that these are called your
beats because there have been your beats
in the past so maybe this is just a
redesign who knows but before we get
into all that let's take a look at some
of the stuff it comes with and the first
thing we're gonna look at is the case
that it comes with now if you've seen my
unboxing you know that I was a really
big fan of the case I was really
surprised at how nice they look only to
find out that it was an older case that
the I Beats came with so there were no
surprises for some of you but I really
do like the case as you can see when I
pulled out the urbeats
I crumpled them up but I have no issues
in taking them out due to the tangle
free cord so you can stuff them in there
with no problem and you'll be in good
shape now if we take a look around the
urbeats you'll see it has a pretty
simple design it's pretty nice actually
on the top it says your beats and the
material that the your beats are
actually made out of is very similar to
the beats mixr's so if you didn't
familiar with that it's got the same
kind of feel but I'm really liking the
design I like to bear the red B on the
top and it shows really well so I'm
really happy about that and of course
I'm happy about the tangle free cable
it's not the thickest cable but it gets
the job done as you guys saw and it also
features a fully functional inline
remote for all Apple devices and play
and pause for Android and as you can see
compared to some of the beats by dre
cables for their headphones it's very
similar - some logos although I am very
happy with the tangle free cable here
you can see a big difference between the
beats tours and the Year beads they're
both tangle free cables but the beats
tours are quite
thicker than the urbeats cable and as we
go down to the bottom will find the
headphone jack input of course it says
beats on it and it's a straight input so
I'm really happy about that it makes it
very simple to just throw inside of my
devices even if there's a case on there
as you can see here I'm having no issues
with the Beats Tour I don't have such a
simple time getting it inside and
getting it to stay and of course we have
to talk about the sound quality I was
very impressed with the year beats and
as a basehead I feel they delivered
quite well in that department and if
you're one too you will find no issues
here with the bass although I must say
they don't deliver the clearest sound
and that anyone who is more than an
average consumer may find these to be a
little muddy and for those of you who
aren't familiar with what money means it
means that it may sound a little muffled
honestly I think you'd have to have an
experienced ear or be an audiophile to
feel that way about these earbuds I'm
quite confident that if you're just an
average consumer you won't really pick
up on it being muddy or anything like
that and you'll definitely enjoy these
as much as I have and of course I have
to show you guys what it look like on
and I must say that these look great
on say sometimes feel a little weird as
they droop down a bit as you can see
when you get a side view they do droop
down a bit and it can feel a little
weird sometimes but overall it does feel
great and I think it looks just fine and
I know I have some gym goers who want to
know how well we stay in the ear when
working out so I'm doing a couple little
exercises here nothing too fancy but as
you can see sometimes it does stay in
the ear it is pretty hit or miss
depending on how much activity as you
can see this is what it looks like when
it flies right out happens randomly
doing some jogging happens there too but
that's not all the time thing it really
depends on how active you are and what
kind of exercises you're doing the
urbeats are pretty light so they have a
pretty good time staying in but if
you're really really active like I think
almost any ear buds will have a hard
time staying in the ear and pretty much
that represent my review for the year
B's guys I would definitely recommend
these only a hundred bucks I think that
these are great for bass lovers or just
anyone who's just a casual listener
maybe not for an audiophile but anyone
else this is probably going to be a
pretty good pickup now thanks for
watching guys I hope you enjoyed review
