consumer and today I'm going to be doing
a review of the new trend NT 600c
portable charger so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it all right
guys here we have the NT 600c portable
charger and i'm going to call this a 600
see for sure and portable chargers are
one of my favorite gadgets to have ever
because they're extremely useful outside
in the you know daily life because
sometimes our phones died or maybe our
tablets die or anything that uses that a
charge rechargeable battery can die on
us while we're out on the go so what
this does is essentially comes and saves
the day so it can charge the device as
well this year in the car walking
somewhere anything using public
transportation this thing is going to be
great to charge up your devices what's
really great about the 600 see is that
you can carry it around just about
anywhere due to its nice compact size
you can put it in your book bag without
having any troubles this thing is
definitely very portable and very easy
to take around with you but I also
really like about the form factor of
this device is that it has an adapter to
plug it right into your wall so this is
really cool you don't have to use you
need cables to plug it in or anything
you just throw it in your wall and
you're good to go and dust feature two
USB ports so you can charge two devices
on it and what's also really cool with
having two USB ports is that you can
plug those devices into it while
charging on the wall so you can charge
up all everything simultaneously some
really good stuff and alongside having
two USB ports this thing has a built-in
microUSB so that means you can
essentially charge three devices at the
same time it's just a charging station
in your pocket it's really nuts really
really a big fan of this so speaking of
the two USB ports you'll notice that one
says 5v 1a and one says 5v 2.18 now
essentially what this means is that the
bottom one is going to be output in more
energy than the 1a so the bottom one can
be used to charge tablets and all other
high-end devices
have typically higher charge times so
this is definitely what you want to use
so if you're charging a tablet and phone
at the same time you know exactly what I
plug in the tablet and the phone so that
you have an efficient charging session
so the 600 see it has 6,000 Villa amps
of battery life and for my average
consumers who might not know what 6,000
milliamps of battery life is you can
think of it as essentially 6,000 units
of battery life and to give you guys
some perspective the iPhone 5 has about
1440 milliamps of battery life so that
means that this thinking charged that
about four times over so that means you
don't have to worry at all about your
iPhone dying because you can plug your
right and and get a charge four times
throughout the day before you need to
charge the 600 see / so when it comes to
phones this thing is going to be
charging them over and over throughout
the day before needing a charge itself
it's really good another neat little
feature is that it has a little
indicator with four little orbs so that
you can see what the battery level of
the 600 see is when you're charging it
you want to make sure that it has four
to max it out and as you see it up
depleting going down to two orbs or
maybe one or you know it's time to give
it a reup and I think this is really
cool because it lets us know exactly how
much battery life it has how much it can
charge out of the different devices that
you're trying to charge so definitely
some really good stuff there I
definitely think the average consumer
who's experienced things dying on them
like their phone dying in the middle of
the day or maybe their tablet is running
out of energy too fast anything that
uses a USB or a micro USB cable to
charge definitely definitely invest in
one of these it's going to help out a
lot and what's great about this is that
you can find it on amazon for like 45
bucks so it's pretty inexpensive and i'm
in my opinion so this is definitely a
very useful tool or gadget to have
around and it's not very expensive at
all so i definitely think there's a lot
of use that can be had with this and
multiple people can use it at the same
time you can use it for multiple devices
it's definitely just a great great
gadget to have in your pack pack or just
everyday life good stuff and that's
about it for my review of the NT 600 see
