consumer and today I've got unboxing for
you guys of the adidas miCoach smart run
and this is a SmartWatch and I know
there are tons of smartwatches out right
now but I don't think there are any that
are as dedicated to physical training as
much as this one so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it and alright
guys so here we have the miCoach smart
run and it's a pretty small box there's
not much going on with it just a couple
of pictures of the actual watch itself
and in the back it does list some
features so some of the cool things that
this has with it are integrated a heart
rate sensor a GPS so it can track where
you're running how far you're going the
kind of speeds you're traveling at so
this is really cool so it has distance
route GPS Wi-Fi data sync and it has
wireless audio so you can actually sync
this with Bluetooth to some Bluetooth
headphones and play audio from here I
think I believe I believe that has three
gigabytes of storage so you can store
some music on here so when you're doing
your dog or your run your activities you
can actually listen to some audio on
here and of course it has Wi-Fi so it
can sync all that information on to
adidas servers and track all your
progress and all that kind of stuff so
pretty cool stuff here but um let's get
to actually opening this up and seeing
what's inside so it does have some tape
on the side so let's get the boxing
knife and slice this open and let's get
the second one alright so now that
that's open let's see what we get and
here we have it so I'm liking the color
scheme by the way is a little black you
know green it looks really nice so the
lid of the box does have some steps
first is to recharge it second is to go
to my coach comm slash start so I guess
you can set it up setting or putting all
your profile information all that good
stuff and then three is run so that's
all there is to it so let's pull this
out this is the my coach
let's see I just pull it out all right
well let's grab the whole thing out
first and pretty much that's it for the
box so we can put this over to the side
now let's see how we go about opening
this up so there is a little tab at the
bottom you can pull this down so this is
where you get I guess all your booklet
information and whatnot so let's see
what kind of booklets we have we have
the start guide and the warranty card so
in the start guide it'll tell you all
kinds of stuff like what you can do with
it all the different customizations all
that good stuff and there's a lot you
can actually do with this this is really
for like hardcore fitness people who
want to know more about their progress
and things like that so it's gonna do a
little bit more than your standard Smart
Watch way it just has like a pedometer
and it tells me how many steps you've
taken how many calories you burned this
is for like real intense training routes
and all kinds of stuff so this is a lot
more intense as a fitness coach than any
of like something like the gear fit
would be or the you know galaxy gears or
any of the Android wear stuff right now
so we can actually take this out and on
the sides you see it has a couple of
things
so here's going to be the USB charger
and this is the charging cradle so let's
pull up a USB charger first and there's
less charge by micro USB so that's a
commonly used cable at least and it's
pretty short it's a pretty short cable
but this is it and the charging cradle
here is where you actually snap on to
the device so this is what you're gonna
be using and it's pretty similar to the
Samsung watches where they have that
snap on cradle it would have been cool
if all you needed to do was charge it
via a USB cable but um this is what we
have to do to charge it up so we're
gonna put this stuff to the side I don't
think there's anything else in these
boxes so we're gonna close this back up
and I think in order to get the actual
watch out we're going to have to pull
this out
let's see here there's a couple of clips
alright guys so after wrestling with the
packaging a bit I finally got it out you
guys see I had to pull back out the
unboxing knife but I finally got it out
this thing is very secure inside the box
so we're gonna put this stuff away clean
here up a bit and here we have it guys
this is the adidas miCoach smart run now
I'm going to try and take this sticker
off and power this little guy on so
let's see if it has any juice this say
to charge it up first I'm not sure if
we're working with anything here alright
guys so this doesn't have any juice
right now but let me tell you a little
bit about the watch the screen is a one
point four five inch display with a
resolution of 184 by 184 and it's a full
touch screen it has full colors it's
actually running Android a skinned
version of Android on here and I believe
it has a 410 milliamp power battery so
you got some time on here and also in
the back it includes a heart rate
monitor so you can actually use this to
just you know read your heart rate as
you're working out and one cool thing
about this guys is that it is water is
this thing you can see a splash of water
on this but it do suggest not submerging
it so that's one thing so if you're
working out you can definitely you know
sweat with this no problem work out in
the rain all that good stuff the bands
actually have a ton of different holes
so that you can customize the fit you
can actually just get it through here
and then like a traditional watch where
you get the clasp into the holes and
then it has another little hole up top
so that you can get these clasps even
further in and then you got to secure in
two places so you can get a really tight
secure fit so you can run around with
this not worry about the watch falling
off or anything like that and actually
at the bottom of the screen you actually
have a home button so you can press this
to go back home and overall looks pretty
good now I am gonna charge this up so
that I can give you guys a quick little
demo of what the screen looks like and
you guys can see some of the stuff that
it can do alright guys so I'm pretty
much done with the setup process I
actually created my my coach account and
synced all my information to it so now
all I'm gonna need to
do is program some workouts and what's
really cool with this is that you can
get predetermined workouts already or
you can create your own if you want to
have a custom workout that fits your
routine so there's a lot of cool stuff
that you can do with this like I said
guys this is just your standard
SmartWatch so don't expect Android wear
from this what you're getting from this
is a real coach it's supposed to help
you with your workouts and you know
getting trained all that good stuff but
so far I am impressed I do like the
color I do like the feel of it um I'm
gonna have to go spend some time with it
to get familiar with all the settings
but there's a lot of cool things that
you can do with this so far I'm actually
a fan you can actually change the clock
face so you can do little things like
that so it actually looks pretty good so
far guys but that's about it for this
unboxing guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you have any questions about this
especially my athletes were happen to be
watching this let me know down below if
there are specific features you're
looking for from something like this and
like I said this has GPS Wi-Fi Bluetooth
storage for music it seems like it
covers all the basis of someone who
wants to work out so I'm not sure if
it's missing anything there so let me
know in the comments down below if you
need any particular features something
that I should be looking out for when
using this and I will let you know in
their full review
so hopefully you enjoyed this unboxing
guys if you did be the cool guy that
gives us video a thumbs up and subscribe
to the channel for more content from me
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video total Dennis your average consumer
