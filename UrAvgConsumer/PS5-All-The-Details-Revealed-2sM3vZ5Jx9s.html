consumer and today we've got tons of
details on the brand new Playstation 5
now these are not leaks or rumors this
is straight from the horse's mouth so I
only didn't come out with an official
announcement or anything but they did
give an interview to Wired from their
lead architect mark Cerny now they
didn't come out and call it the
PlayStation 5 they call it their next
generation console but we know what it's
going to be called now let's talk about
the specs of this guy is going to be
powered by AMD's third generation rising
processor and they're also gonna have a
custom GPU and it's gonna be a variant
of the Radeon Navi family so it's gonna
be one of those GPUs but custom made for
the PS 5 now this new custom GPU is
gonna support ray tracing and we've been
hearing a lot about race racing things
too indeed as our TX cards and basically
what ray tracing does is it allows the
graphics in the games to seem a bit more
realistic will see light bouncing off of
things
we'll also see reflections in a 3d
environment so if there's something that
you don't see on screen you might
actually see it in the reflection of
equipment or maybe water and having that
kind of power come to consoles is going
to be a game changer and not only will
we see improved graphics with way more
detail but that AMD chip is also going
to have a special unit to allow for 3d
audio and certainly pretty much talked
about how audio hasn't changed much
since the ps3 to the ps4 and that is
something Sony wants to completely
change with the PS 5 now with that 3d
audio things should sound way more
immersive and they're saying this 3d
audio experience is going to work even
with TV speakers but the golden standard
will be of course with headphones or a
gaming headset I'm personally pretty
interested in seeing how much of a jump
we're gonna see what TV speakers
headphones I have no doubt will sound
really good but TV speakers yes I'm
gonna keep an eye out for you guys now
we're really gonna see performance gains
is from better load times thanks to Sony
now going with an SSD instead of a
regular hard drive and a lot of us has
resorted to changing the PlayStation 4's
hard drive for an SSD and so only
actually described that by increasing
the speed by a third but with the next
generation and their SSD we're gonna see
increases of
19 times faster that is a huge
difference if someone even did a
demonstration showing the difference
between the ps4 Pro and a Playstation
five they had Spiderman loaded up they
did a fast travel and what took 15
seconds on the ps4 Pro took them point 8
on the PlayStation 5 that is like
instantaneous guys that is going to be
what really changes the feel of playing
games in the next generation the only
didn't quite say which SSD that they're
using but apparently it's this custom
made SSD that runs a lot faster than
anything out on the market for PCs those
are fighting words so not only are we
getting way faster speeds more graphical
detail and better audio but they're of
course upping the resolution from 4k up
to 8k guys 8k is gonna be supported on
the PlayStation 5 and I know a lot of
you are thinking what a K TV's are out
there there are some that will exist by
the time this thing comes out Samsung
already dropped one so they're going to
exist your are going to be able to play
games in 8k if a developer of course
develops an 8k which is gonna be kind of
tough the nice little detail is that
this thing will still take physical
copies so it's not going to be a
download-only system and since it's
running on the ps4 architecture it's
going to have ps4 backwards
compatibility which is super huge
they've been stopping that for how long
now so it's finally going to have
backwards compatibility right out the
gates which is going to be awesome so
any plans on releasing games for both
the ps4 and PS 5 once they are released
so you know what that means when the
PlayStation 5 comes out if you not a
collector or anything you can sell your
PlayStation 4 to kind of fund that PS 5
and still play all of the games that you
had for the ps4 right on your new system
and while we still don't have hard
details on those specs the other things
we don't know yet are pricing a release
date but we can for sure say it's not
going to be 2019 it's going to be maybe
2020 2021 but I am hoping for 2020 and
we also don't know about the design so
when they did that little demo they
actually had like a silver curtain in
front of the PS 5 probably wasn't even
the actual system is probably just like
a motherboard with some stuff attached
to it but this is very exciting
nonetheless it looks like Sony is going
guns blazing into the new generation
it's been almost it was almost six years
now but I want to know what you guys
think of the new rumors or not even
rumors I want to know what you guys
think of the new details and Malcolm
asked a burning question what do you
think we're gonna see Final Fantasy 7
the remake come out for PlayStation 5 or
the ps4 let me know what the comment
down below but hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
like there's a video thumbs up I'll
catch you guys in the next one I am hype
that the system's finally coming out
