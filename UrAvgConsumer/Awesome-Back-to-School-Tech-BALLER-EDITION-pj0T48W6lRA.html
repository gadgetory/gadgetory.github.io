and today we're gonna be talking about
some more back-to-school tech but this
time the ball addition well ball in for
a student now the items in here on
crazy-expensive but maybe you saved up a
little change from your summer gig and
you've got a little room to splurge so
first thing we're going to look at is
this backpack and this is the og o
bandit this is hands-down my favorite
backpack to date because it has a ton of
compartments and it's still not a huge
bulky backpack you even got a small one
up front where you can put things like a
portable camera or maybe some here but
but it's got this microfiber lining so
that it'll protect whatever is inside
you also got this big compartment where
you put you things like your secondary
items to put your pens pencils stuff
like that what I really love about this
backpack is that it has these tiny
little pictures on it so that you can
know where to put things that you're
going to put inside so here it's got a
picture of a passport you got pencils it
even has some wording up here to give
you some clues on what you can put
inside each compartment so you can
completely deck this out really love
that about this but for the stuff that
I've got in here the essential the
must-haves this is a portable charger
but this is Aki's thirty thousand
milliamp portable charger this is a
freaking beast it has two USB ports so
you can charge multiple devices at once
and one of them actually supports quick
charge so let's say you're at practice
and your phone's dying from at the end
of the day you can plug this guy in and
by the time you're out of practice your
phone should be very well charged it has
3000 milliamps guys that's a lot of
battery power and next up we've got this
these are the j-bird freedoms these are
amazing ear buds I love the way they
sound
I love the form factor it has a pretty
sucky remote I gotta admit
but I do love the capabilities that this
thing has these are Bluetooth earbuds so
you're able to pair these with the
device and use it without wires but
what's cool is that you can use this
with multiple devices at once which is a
really awesome feature and you can use
it smartphone app to completely
customize the sound quality that you're
getting out of these which is a very
very nice touch and they've got a few
different colors so if you want to match
up your outfits or maybe your phone you
can do that
that look pretty good while you're going
to school now let's unzip this and we've
got access to some storage because
you're definitely going to need that so
if you're working on papers or projects
you're going to need something to carry
them on over here we've got AP and y 128
good flash drive you guys have heard me
recommend this before and it is a must
128 gigs will be able to carry all the
files that you need papers essays even
movies or whatever you want to bring
with you to school definitely a good
thing and if you got some more serious
projects to work on maybe you're in film
school or whatever it may be you need
some solid storage and this is from
Western Digital this is the My Passport
this is 2 terabytes and they have all
different size options so I'll include a
bunch of links down below in the
description so you can put something
that works best for you don't
underestimate storage guys it's good to
have backups on everything trust me your
teachers and professors don't want to
hear the excuse of my computer crash or
my file got corrupted or whatever it may
be
invest now that's it for this main
compartment here in the stuff that I'm
recommending but you can fit way way
more inside of here lots of compartments
guys now this if you saw my last video
you saw me recommend these and these are
USB cables these are 10-foot cables and
they come in a variety of color sizes
and even different kinds of cables so
right here we've got a lightning cable
this is a micro USB and the fact that
these are 10 feet and braided they
should last you all year and be super
convenient and in this little side
pocket which could also be used for a
water bottle we've got my favorite Mouse
of all time and you guys have heard me
talk about this plenty of times and that
is the Logitech g600 to no surprise but
this is an amazing Mouse and I will
always advocate for it because it's just
that good it feels super comfortable in
the hand great for long periods of time
on the computer and it's a gaming mouse
so if you've got some downtime between
classes or maybe after school you can
use this to play some games and with
this traveling case you can take it back
and forth from home to
we'll put it in here it's perfectly for
it and I got this on Amazon so I'll have
a link to it down below in the
description as well as everything else
in this video let's get inside of the
main compartment so first things first
we've got this this is a case that I've
also found on Amazon and it holds one of
my favorite headphones of all time the
sony MDR 950 bt these are amazing
amazing headphones if you're a bass
lover and they retail for 200 bucks but
you usually find them on amazon around
$100 you can connect with a Bluetooth
control everything right from here but
if you like bass you like listening to
music with a lot of thump to it you
can't be beat you just can't and what's
different here is that I've got this
case not I recommend this so many times
and so many of you have picked it up but
you always ask what kind of case can I
get with this I found this this tends to
work it's a bit on the bulky side but
the bandit can handle that but it does
protect it and you can actually use it
for other headphones as well the
dimensions of course are important to
know but for 20 bucks it's not so bad
you can protect your headphones as this
cool carbon fiber look so definitely
worth looking into if you're looking for
a solid case for your headphones you
think that there wouldn't be a book in
here but there is and this is the
uncalibrated O's in the past and for
school you absolutely can't beat this
this is the best way to organize your
life they're not a sponsor whatsoever
but this is what I use to handle my
schedule and all the things that I have
planned for the channel you've got tons
and tons of way of organizing you can
set goals all kinds of cool stuff to get
to life together and for those super
organized types out there we've got the
gritted now the grid it can take any of
these accessories that you see here and
you can actually put them inside of here
by pulling up these little tabs and then
just putting them in
so we can get this little harddrive
store it just like this
and then you can add all kinds of stuff
make all kinds of configurations and you
store it away in your backpack and not
worry about being shifting around let's
say you've used up all your compartment
but you still got some stuff you want to
store the grid it is great for
organization and it even has a little
zipper in the back so you can store
whatever you might need to in here if
you really don't want things to get lost
maybe some paperwork receipt who knows
but this is definitely a great tech
accessory if you have a lot of gadgets
around and we're not done yet
over here we have the Amazon tap now the
Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker what's
cool about this is that you can pair it
with your smartphone and you have access
to Alexa y'all know how much I like
Alexa so if you've got some downtime
between class you and your friends are
hanging out maybe after school at the
park or whatever you can play some music
from your smartphone right here but
what's also cool is like let's say maybe
you're just doing your work at home or
in your dorm you can ask Alexa some
questions if you're working on a certain
project when was Thomas Edison born
Thomas Edison was born on Thursday
February 11th 1847
that's pretty precise so if you've got
any questions that you need a quick
answer to and you don't want to type it
up in Google oh you have
firstworldproblems I know but you can
actually just do that with the press of
a button and I love having
voice-activated assistant here that can
just spit off information just like that
if some of one and one is two you see
now of course you've got to talk about
some computers I've got two options for
you guys depending on what you're into
now the first laptop is actually inside
of this faux leather case from Snug I
originally got it for the Microsoft
Surface pro 3 but if you have a pretty
small laptop like a MacBook Air or maybe
the new MacBook or in surface it'll fit
in here as well inside of it this is the
new MacBook now I know a lot of you are
probably thinking oh my
how's he recommending this but even
though it's an apple product of course
it's a little on the expensive side a
lot a bit on the expensive side this is
actually a really really solid contender
now as a student whatever you throw at
this it can handle and I just think that
the portability it can't be beat and it
functions really well and it charges
really quickly I can actually use it
with this portable charger so it makes a
great combo and definitely it's my
recommendations for students if you want
something lightweight and that will get
the job done and because I know a lot of
you would kill me if I didn't mention
Windows I've got the surface book now
this has been my go-to Windows device
ever since I got my hands on it you got
a lot of functionality here it's very
very powerful
depending on how you spec it out when
you buy it and what's cool is that you
can actually use this as a laptop or a
tablet you can actually detach the
screen and boom you can use it just like
this and they each have their own
batteries so if you're using this in
tablet mode and it starts to die hook it
back up super easy and boom you're done
definitely my favorite Windows product
today and really that's about it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video like I
said this is the more baller Edition
both of these are not cheap none of
these are the cheapest products in the
world
but like I said if you've got a little
money to spend and you want something
quality these are very great options to
go back to school with but hopefully you
guys enjoy the video if you did be the
cool guy or girl that gives it a thumbs
up and I'll catch you in the next video
so that is your average consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
