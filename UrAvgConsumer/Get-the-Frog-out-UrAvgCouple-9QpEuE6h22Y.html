I'm gonna say but yeah this is what I
usually do I write a poem while my
reviews here so I can say this is the
sennheiser reviews that I have coming up
they're dynamic so there's a lot more
that goes into the videos they're just
sitting behind the camera and talking I
like to actually write it all out so I
know exactly what I'm saying to you guys
and making sure everything is concise
and all the information is there alright

get their bags checked it's gonna be
pretty interesting seeing if I can get
this giant bag through without getting
pulled to the side - I sleep easily and
we also pulled an all-nighter last night
you cheated all right guys so check out
this picture this video as posted on
Instagram of me pretty embarrassing
look at this
this is shameful guys

finish a little bit sorry no she doesn't
bashing face all the time

I'm so I was right there with him I'm
ready to fight in this stuff they had a
problem with my tripod for my mic the
stand that my mic goes on so they wanted
to see that and then
they ran as they waited but twice and I
was fine after that
yeah but I was ready to have my fists up
guys see these big fish they're ready a
little pickle right here so we're about
to take this post pod picture
so I think you take it and then you
email it to yourself which is pretty
cool yeah here it is a little screenshot
of it it's all dark alright guys so now
we are officially in Florida we are
saying to my parents have I have a whole
year but every year we have to go see my
grandmother who also lives in the air is
just like 20 minutes away so right now
we're going to go see her for our one
visit for the year and there's a lovely
one was in the air well she wasn't

now at my parents are should a car in
front of us because we're driving a
rental right now this is different right

on guys so we're back from Florida and
we've got this one captive so Ana's

be hanging out with me mostly okay this
girl's going away for business for work
so poor year so that was gonna be me on
that on what we're gonna do you guys
hang out I want to hang out oh yeah so
for today we're going to be going to the
mall
these girls have some things to return
and also buy some new stuff some more
clothes shopping really so much in
Florida we kind of just relax the whole
time stay inside the house so it really
wasn't much to film but at the end of
this video we're gonna show you this
frog that came into our house and the
antics that went around trying to get
him out of the house so vlog in their
house first of all so weird if you're
from Florida and you get a lot of frogs
in your house or you get any frogs ever
we were coming down below I'm curious
I'm from New York so happy
yeah what are your methods of getting
them off the house because we use an
interesting one so let us know what you
guys do alright guys so we're in the
mall and these girls are have forever21
over there
and of course they're taking forever to
finish up in there I've already gone to
gamestop in that Apple store and I'm
pretty much exhausted what I can see
from the
so now I'm just walking around boy I
can't even find them in forever 21 so
this is usually why I hate console
so you're finally out of the forever 21
of course I can play these things she
bought stuff we're got stuff clothing
for work
usually she'll go in there and not buy a
face so our way isn't working
this is a two-hour wait
I met one time
spent two hours and got some stuff
I got all these witnesses so right now
guys rinse people's checking out some
office chairs I need a new one because
my chair squeaks like crazy during the
video I try to minimize as much
squeaking as possible but it's bad so
we're looking at bunch of these chairs
right now I like it so right now on is
helping me make a decision on whether or
not I should buy this chair I like it
only a hundred bucks yeah it has got
something in the back where you can like
some some tension thing but you say get
it huh well okay people first recognize
that thud the chairs missing now two
hundred thousand any chairs guys check
this out it's called the Nosefrida the
snot sucker so a mom can use this tube
to pretty much suck the snot out of
their baby's nose and possibly into
their mouths
that's quite disgusting and I don't know
what mom would really use the s that's
nasty very risky
well first up for those of you who
aren't into Pokemon they have a bunch
yeah we stop guys look at this trainer
Bob the brand new screen above so we're
definitely picking two of those up
because it's like they haven't seen a
box might be here well we don't want
good we don't want this thing doing no
cheater boxes and do it again if you
like one it should be the packs then go
online and buy the box there's only get
eight packs in the chain of all right so
you want to be
sounds good decision me okay I trust a
bit hey guys so right now we're in my
room and we are going to open these guys
up
yeah our trainer boxes yes it's been so
long since we had like pokemon cards so
we were super excited so we have
anything good we will show you and if
not we you will see our disappointed
faces making it rain pokemon cards give
me a thumbs up if you want to see my
room you guys can see my style it's not
a lot about a person by the way they
were my setup alright guys so we just
finished opening up the packs how do you
feel about meri I feel good I'm a little
disappointed that we didn't get more
than one X card but I feel good overall
I'm really happy about this I got a
bunch of like cards I can put go in my
like strongest X right now so like I
play with V's and they have these new
V's that do super cool stuff so I'm
really excited about that because I'm
going to put integrate those into my
deck and beat him even more woah a lot
of smack there but these are the good
cards that we've got or Hallows at least
we got one e^x card me x card is
basically like a super super rare card
and we got a couple of hollows yeah so
like when you're opening packs you want
to get X cards because you're like Brock
like really brawl at cards but we didn't
really get many any both this one
Kangaskhan TX got my champ holo this
looks so crazy yeah victreebel third
this is a new type of the fairy-type
pokémon Poliwrath and hawlucha he's
also a new guy so that was pretty much
it guys that's it for all of the pokemon
cards should it could have been better
20 20 packs yeah Dave we got all right
but those boxes are pretty cool because
they give you a bunch of other stuff
they give you a bunch of energy is all
this stuff good stuff my bad not bad and
I think we're pretty much gonna wrap it
up now I got my chair inside a chair and
I'm gonna replace this crummy old thing
and I probably did that for the rest of
the night and call it a day
so hopefully you guys enjoyed it
we're pretty tired you want to say bye
