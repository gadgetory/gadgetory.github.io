consumer and today I've got an unboxing
video for you guys
of the Sony rx100 Mark 3 now this is one
of the most popular point-and-shoot
cameras available the rx100 line has
been known to be the best point of
shoots out so does the newest version of
that and hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
hi dad and alright guys here we have the
Sony rx100 Mark 3 now I am upgrading
from my Sony rx100 first generation so
this is going to be quite the upgrade
for me now the reason why I'm upgrading
is because this has a tilt table screen
it's a 180 degree tilt table screen
which means I'll be able to see myself
while I'm doing my videos and I mainly
use this for vlogging with my girlfriend
so now we don't have to guess where
we're pointing the camera will be able
to see what is on the screen when we're
recording so that's going to be a really
awesome feature for us and that was the
main reason why we did upgrade to this
now just taking a quick look around the
box there isn't much going on you see a
picture of the camera on the side you do
see some accessories that you'll be able
to use with this on of those accessories
are a carrying case a grip because some
people do say that this is a little hard
to hold it's a little slippery but they
do offer a grip and of course some more
battery accessories now at the back of
the box you'll be able to see a couple
of the features that are found on this
camera some specs of course being 20
megapixels this now has a 24 to 70
millimeter lens now the original had a
28 to I think 100 millimeter so you were
able to zoom in a bit more now with this
this has a wider lens and now you can
actually have a much faster aperture at
the 70 millimeter focal length so it can
go from 1.8 all the way to 2.8 at 70
millimeters which is really really nice
you get that nice depth of field it also
features a built-in viewfinder which is
really nice I know a lot of camera
enthusiasts are going to go crazy for
that feature it also features a call
Zeiss lens annex armor our CMOS sensor
by ounce X processor which is an upgrade
from the last version it has Wi-Fi and
see 4k images 1080p full recording it
has new video formats so tons of goodies
are packed into this little box so I'm
going to show you guys that now my stop
babbling about the features and actually
show you guys the camera so let's pop
this thing open and of course we've got
some paperwork at the very top so let's
see what we get here so we've got some
instructions on using the new viewfinder
that's built in you've got some limited
warranty information register your
product we've got the Wi-Fi connection
guide not even sure this is a thing in a
different language probably another
Wi-Fi connection guide I think this
shows us some accessories that we can
get for the rx100 and shows a couple of
the other and others in the line and
we've got our big fat instruction manual
so it's got all that good stuff we'll
put that to the side let's open this
thing up and see what we get in the box
so first things first we've got a USB
cable this is a micro USB cable so this
is really nice if you're able to charge
this with a micro USB cable and those
are not hard to find so if you're
getting travel with this you can use
your cellphone charger if it uses this
so definitely nice stuff to you such a
universal no trou charging method of
course you've got your AC adapter that's
also included so we can put that to the
side let's see this is the camera in
this little black pouch but there seems
to be something else here okay there's a
couple of more things here there's also
the strap so that you can actually put
this on your camera and never drop it
hopefully I actually always use this it
saved my camera quite a few times so
this is very useful and we've got one
more thing I see some plastic over here
and of course that is the battery so
inside here we've got the battery as
well as some clips here so that you can
use a larger strap if you'd like so
that's that so we've got a couple of
accessories here and of course here we
do have the battery so we're going to
put this to the side and get to the star
of
the show so let me go here cleaned up
before we actually get to star of the
show and put some of this stuff away all
right so here it is the unveiling so
let's see here boom there we have it now
these new versions always tend to look
like the original so not much has
changed here this actually looks closer
to the original then the mark 2 did I
think because it no longer has that
horseshoe mount at the top but this does
a few things that the rx100 will the
first generation definitely doesn't do
which is tilting the screen like this
which is the main attraction for me this
is the main feature that I want to use
and also it's got some pretty neat
things there's a little switch here that
once you hit it it brings the pop-out
flash and of course one nice thing about
the pop-up flash is that you're able to
adjust it point it wherever you want so
you can point it at the ceiling which is
a move that I like to do a lot when
taking pictures with flash and also
you've got the viewfinder and on the
left side here there's a little
indicator that says finder you push this
down and then it pops right out so this
is actually really cool a lot of
enthusiasts like I mentioned before have
been dying for a viewfinder there used
to be an option with the Horseshoe mount
to get an add-on but now that's no
longer needed because this is built-in
you can actually also pull this thing
out so that you can get a better view
bring a little closer to the face so
this is really cool so we can push that
back in and yeah let's actually put the
battery inside this thing and see if we
can turn it on now I just put the
battery in but let's take a quick tour
around the camera and see what kind of
buttons and features can be found so at
the top we have the on and off switch as
well as the shutter button a little
switch here that controls the zoom so
you can zoom in and out by hitting this
little switch and of course you have
your dial here your mode dial so you can
change all the different settings so you
have your auto your program aperture
manual all that good stuff and taking a
look at the actual body of it you can
see the movie button so you can press
and record here you have your menu your
function button your play and your
delete button so these
the main buttons you also have a dial
here that can spin you can also press
up/down left/right with it and your main
in turbine right here in the middle and
of course on the side you see that we
have NFC right under the viewfinder
switch and on the right side you also
have an HDMI port so that you can attach
a mini HDMI cable in there and also a
multi out port which is basically your
micro USB cable port the bottom
indicates that this is Wi-Fi capable and
of course at the bottom is where you can
put in your battery and memory card so
now let's power it on and see what we
get inside so we're going to have to set
the date and time so I'm going to do
that now I'm in the New York area and
let me get through the setup process and
I'll show you guys if anything has
changed with the menus so just taking a
quick look at the menu it doesn't seem
to have a much different menu the layout
is slightly different there are bigger
icons at the top now but overall the
menu still does seem to be the same
navigation nothing too different um
let's see on the function side you do
have quite a different look here as far
as the options and stuff go but overall
it overall seems the same so not too
much has changed which is really nice I
actually like the interface of this
camera so it actually looks pretty good
so far from what I'm seeing I can't wait
to go out and take some pictures let you
guys see you guys will actually be that
can be the judge for yourself of the
quality of the video since we're going
to be doing a ton of vlogging with this
thing and I'm also going to have a full
review with pictures you guys are going
to see more video there but this has
just been a quick unboxing of the rx100
and yeah that's pretty much it hopefully
you guys enjoyed this quick unboxing and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
till then is your average consumer piece
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
