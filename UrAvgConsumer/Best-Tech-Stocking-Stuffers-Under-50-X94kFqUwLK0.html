by AT&amp;amp;T so guys check this out AT&amp;amp;T sent
me the Samsung gear VR innovator edition
headset for the Samsung Galaxy s6 even
though it's been around for a while now
there's my first time trying out Virtual
Reality with my phone and the things
actually legit
it delivers a super immersive experience
which is great for gaming and even
watching some of those 360 degree videos
it's powered by oculus and those guys
obviously know virtual reality it's
definitely worth to try if you've got
yourself a galaxy s6 well it might not
officially be on this list of stocking
stuffers
I definitely think it'd make a pretty
cool gift for the holidays and speaking
of cool gifts like these AT&amp;amp;T has been
running a special 12 Days of Giveaways
to take some of the burden off of your
holiday shopping and all you've got to
do to enter is check the link down below
in the description and unwrap a new
daily jiff and share it using the
hashtag ATT gift sweeps for a chance to
win but it's almost over so you guys
better hurry and into the try to win
some free stuff good luck to all of you
but now let's talk about some of those
stocking stuffers
first things first we've got something
that everyone will find useful tech
lover or not and that's this aki twelve
thousand milliamp portable charger if
you know someone whose phone is always
dying this is the perfect gift nowadays
I don't even leave the house without one
of these and it makes me super
comfortable to use my phone the way I
want to I'm talking about full
brightness playing games listening to
music and even streaming some video with
no worries about my phone dying you can
find this for less than $15 and at
12,000 milliamp
you're gonna be able to charge your
phone over and over and over before you
actually need to charge this guy up
again it's really compact considering
how much juice it's got and it also has
two USB ports for that liche friend who
always needs to charge their phone for a
second and you even get a bonus built-in
flashlight if you're looking for a cheap
but very thoughtful tech gift this is
absolutely the place to start next up
we've got the JBL clip plus bluetooth
speaker this is another nice inexpensive
gift for those audio lovers out there
when a phone speaker isn't enough that's
where this guy comes in it's really
compact and portable and has this little
clip that's actually super convenient
you can throw this onto a book bag or
belt loop and not even worry about
carrying
and if you want to use it for something
without Bluetooth you can use the
included cable to plug it into any audio
device you get some pretty decent sound
considering its price and size and
you've also got a couple of different
colors to choose from it's also splash
proof which is a nice bonus if you've
got a friend who likes to listen to
music from the speaker on their phone do
them a favor and pick this up and while
we're on the topic of audio maybe you
want to upgrade someone from those
crummy ear pods they've been using and
you can do that and not break the bank
with the sony MDR xb 50 AP these are in
your buds so don't worry about these
falling out and I actually find them to
be really comfortable when it comes to
listening devices I'm a huge Sony fan
they've been making magic happen with
some good sounding gear at some pretty
inexpensive prices the xb9 50 AP is part
of the extra bass line so they're going
to get a bit more thump out of them
compared to some cheap earbuds or ear
pods it also has a built-in mic and a
play and pause button that you can use
to answer and hang up calls at around
$30 this is definitely worth it and last
but not least on our quick little list
we've got a mini drone by machine now we
all know how popular drones are these
days but we don't all have hundreds of
bucks to shell out to buy one so why not
get a mini version you get all the fun
of flying around the drone even indoors
this little guy is fast though so you'll
definitely need some practice but I'm
happy to report that no matter how many
times I've crashed this thing into a
wall it's held up pretty well thanks to
those little bumpers around the
propellers you'll get about eight to
nine minutes of pure flight time but the
battery charges in about 45 minutes so
you don't have to wait an eternity to
start playing it again by some of the
other drones out there it's also super
simple to get started flying with the
included controller so anyone trying to
fly it for the first time should be able
to get the gist of it pretty quickly but
that about wraps it up for my quick
little tech stocking stuffer guide
everything on this list is under 50
bucks so you've got some pretty
affordable options in here if you guys
want to see more lists like this at
different price ranges feel free to let
me know in a comment down below until
the next video guys is your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
