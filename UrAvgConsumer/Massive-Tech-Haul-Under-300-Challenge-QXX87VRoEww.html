we got Ari over here hello everyone
and today we are going inside of Best
Buy and we're going to be doing a three
hundred dollar shopping challenge and
I'm going to it anywhere we got the idea
from Lou Lou did a video not too long
ago where he took a fan and it's all
shopping challenge and B&amp;amp;H put a little
far from B&amp;amp;H right now so we're going to
go and Best Buy and see what we can pick
up so you get to the end of the video to
put us know in the comments below who
had the best items regular give us some
shopping all right guys so we've got 20
minutes a pop $300 is a limit and we
just have to see who gets the better
stuff what's probably not fair is that
judge knows this place better than I do
so I'm like looking and searching for
the gaming sector what's nice is that if
you go for anything is too good you have
a high chance of running out of budget
right here we've got some x3 for a
hundred bucks but that's our third of
the whole budget I'm not sure if I want
to do that yeah that's a big amount to
commit to paper x3 299 dollars there
another knock off the air pods or air
pump I'm not doing knockoff not going to
shoot their coke Andy
in dollars next year into dollars will
be keep buried don't we keep wireless
earbuds from Sony for about a 60 bucks
I'm good I'm going with it I'm debating
getting this because I know jet is like
starting to like this style of headphone
a lot but I feel you're going to get
this because I think we could
potentially have some good uh some good
content with this and it's cute but
fifty bucks
if they had a Nintendo switch in stock
here every automatic way and take all my
budget but it Blin grab this baby psyche
multicolor light box I have no idea what
this is or what it's for
oh okay just LEDs with different colors
and they don't do anything else I don't
know I was these are everything right
now so why not I feel nervous because I
have a time limit if I didn't I would
just take my time oh this is cute I'm
going with this
oh the power bank and wireless speaker
whoo that's kind of cool for 70 bucks
gonna change color colors yeah a change
of color it says color changing right on
the box sorry
I like this window put back this sort of
funny cube I can make it pink if I want
nice game maybe
LED gloves not really a thing what the
LED gloves did you see this guy's
so these gloves have LED is in them all
right sometimes you can put LEDs in the
wrong thing these are one of those times
it's only eight dollars old I might pick
it up just because why not
I just trash-talk this and I'm picking
it up got a bubble swap pro foot bath
Jed Mesa he needs a pedicure I bet you
just picked up an amiibo is it obsessed
with these and evil things wha playing
Zelda I really don't know what to get
this is for your old room
what is this really good for them

that something pokemons related maybe no
oh this is so cute
okay I mean we don't find this cool
though I really want to win
selling $30 so I'm gonna get it bite me
oho good mount or something $70
that one cost $60
no but they got this one they're like my
favorite of all time for 40 bucks
I might have to scoop it nah that's
cheating like for something I already
need all these town such a good deal
though

there on the wheel all right so we have
some some color-changing stuff going on

it's not expensive

chat pad for the ps4 controller
I think that's cool I still feel like I
need that
Wow product that dirt Gus got they had
the NES classic in here I thought it
automatically this actually way over our
price range so I wish I knew what I was
getting psychic like one-up him okay I
think I'm in the wrong section I'm going
