consumer and today I've got an unboxing
video for you guys of the brand new
iPhone 6 plus
now I'm only doing the 6 plus but it's
pretty much the same thing as the 6 so
it's like a two-in-one
but anyway let's not waste any time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here's the iPhone 6 box now you can see
that Apple has changed things up quite a
bit there's nothing on the front anymore
you can't see the preview of the iPhone
it just has like the silhouette and it's
all white on the sides of just as iPhone
so you no longer see that numerical
value so you don't see iPhone 5 5 s
nothing like that pretty blank box
there's not much to it let you know you
know some stuff in the back but I'm
gonna get to opening this up I don't
have my typical unboxing knife so let's
get this open
you see using a when it's not the
unboxing life it doesn't do that great a
job but there we go so getting rid of
this plastic and let's pop this open get
a little jiggle boom there you have it
this is the iPhone 6 plus and it's huge
first impression right now it's huge not
not heavy though it's really light but
let's see what else we got inside the
box
we've also got typical Apple paperwork
inside of here
you know warranty information Start
Guide and of course stickers everybody
loves stickers so that's what you get
here and you of course also get the
Apple earpods so standard of course the
wall adapter and the lightning cable now
there were rumors of this being
reversible so for those of you who were
expecting that you're not gonna find it
here this is a regular standard
lightning cable so that's pretty much it
for the box so let's actually take a
better look at this
iPhone 6 plus so so far first
impressions it's it looks big when you
first see it but holding it doesn't seem
to you too huge not too bad
I also have an iPhone regular iPhone 6
right here now if you guys want to see
side-by-side kind of Dwarfs it take a
look at the back not bad there are some
differences between them besides just
the size you also have a bigger battery
with the iPhone 6 plus as well as
optical image stabilization in the
camera and as well as some iOS features
like doing landscape mode when you're
using a sideways and stuff like that so
overall you've got a couple of different
stuff here but it's pretty much very
similar to the regular iPhone six-plus
so now let's get some of this plastic
off
oh it goes all the way over so there you
go
pretty much this is it feels good guys
very very thin very light it seems like
it could be a little slippery because of
the sides it's got like a curved feel to
it it's not the regular hard edges like
the iPhone 5 or even the fours but yeah
let's power this thing on and while I do
that I'll show you guys a quick tour
around the actual phone itself so we
have the power button on the right side
and you can see that they no longer have
it on the top now it's on the right side
now this is a larger phone so it's going
to make it a little easier to access the
power button over here also on the left
side is pretty standard you have your
volume up and down as well as your mute
switch so if you want to mute it you can
just hit that bottom of course has your
lightning connect your lightning port as
well as your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and in the back you have your 8
megapixel rear camera now this camera
protrudes a bit on the back so you can
actually feel it now this is a bit of a
concern when you're putting your phone
down so you're gonna want to be a little
careful instead of just like dropping
your phone on the any surface because
it's directly impacting on it directly
impacts the camera itself so that's
gonna be something to look out for of
course got your flash and these little
strips right here I believe are antenna
bands so that you can get better
reception and on though also on the
right side is where you have your SIM
card slot so you can throw in your sim
right here and pretty much standard
stuff you also have a FaceTime HD camera
on the front and your speaker and of
course you have the touch ID at the
bottom of with the home button so we do
have it powered on so as you guys can
see here all you have to do is go
through the setup process now I got this
with t-mobile I got the 64 gigabyte
version now I feel like 64 gigabyte is
definitely the way to go if you're
planning on
getting the iPhone and you're
considering the 16-gigabyte probably
because it's a bit cheaper definitely
keep this in mind that you can run out
of space very easily I know some of you
probably went through a lot of trouble
trying to get iOS 8 on your iPhone or
whatever device you may have if it's at
a lower gigabyte so if you have like 16
or 8 gig of gigs you definitely want to
keep stuff like that in mind
you're gonna take pictures that's gonna
end up getting deleted all that stuff so
keep that in mind I'm gonna go through
the setup process a bit and just give
you guys my first impressions on how I
feel the OS runs so far on the bigger
screen alright guys so I did get to set
it up and actually it is pretty smooth I
definitely like the feel of it
everything seems pretty nice I'm liking
what I see so far it definitely feels
very good I'm gonna have all kinds of
different tests where I try out the
camera and all that all that kind of
stuff that you'd expect to see so
definitely stay tuned for that but so
far I do like it the feel in the hands
is not bad comparing it to the six it
definitely is a lot bigger but I think
that it's one of those things that when
you if you purchase it and you have it
as your daily driver you'll get used to
it pretty quickly but that's pretty much
it for this unboxing typical iPhones and
unboxings don't have much to them anyway
but this is um they're not bad at all if
you guys haven't checked out some of my
videos on the iPhone 6 already you
should check them out I'm gonna have
links down below in the description I go
over the top 5 features as well as some
top 5 features of iOS 8 so definitely
look for those in the description and
pretty much that's about it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video if you
did be the cool guy that gives it a
thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
for more content from me and I'll catch
you guys in the next video till then is
your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
