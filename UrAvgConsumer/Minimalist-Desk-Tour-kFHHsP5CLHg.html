and yes you're looking at a brand new
setup this is actually a setup for both
Ari and I but I wanted to go with a more
minimalist design since it's already a
pretty big setup in my office and huge
shout out to HP because they heard I was
setting this up and decided to sponsor
this video and send over some dope gear
for us to use now the set up was made
with the idea of getting business
related work done thus the clean look
single display and business-class
printer the actual desk and the pieces
used to make it as well as a few other
things came from Ikea and I'll have
links to them and everything else
mentioned in this video down below in
the description as for what's on the
desk we've got some cool things the
computer powering everything is HP's
34-inch Envy curved all-in-one since we
wanted to work from a single display a
wide screen was perfect so we wouldn't
have to deal with limited screen real
estate being an all-in-one also helps to
minimize the amount of cables and pieces
of gear needed so we can keep the desk
clean if you want to learn more about
the specs and the features of this bad
boy
I'll be sure to include it in the
description as for the keyboard we're
using with the envy we went with a
logitech easy switch keyboard this is
one of my favorite keyboards to use and
it's slim compact design makes it a
great addition to the set up it's
bluetooth so you don't need to worry
about any wires while using it and this
super comfortable type on and it's
called the easy switch for reason since
you're able to pair it with up to three
different devices and switch between
them with the press of a button and our
Mouse of choice is the Logitech MX
master the MX master was our top choice
for this setup since it has a really
comfortable feel in the hand and has
some additional buttons on the side to
make navigation easier and it's just an
overall smooth experience whenever you
use it and just like its keyboard
counterpart you can also pair it with up
to three different devices that can be
changed with the hit of a button now on
to those speakers what you see here is
the bose companion v these are some very
nice speakers with a pretty small
footprint since we didn't want to go
with a really large desk we didn't want
speakers that would take up too much
space but still performed well
the companion vibes offer some great
sound and a nice design that actually
tilts the speaker's upward so your audio
is going towards you not to mention the
subwoofer can really pack a punch with
the bass there's also a really
convenient control pod that allows for
single touch mute a smooth dial to
control your volume a headphone jack and
a connection for a second source if you
want to throw on your phone or mp3
player and of course we've got the
awesome printer on the side and this is
the HP pagewide pro mfp 477 DW but for
now let's just call it the pagewide pro
as i mentioned earlier this is a
business-class printer copier fax
machine something you'd see in a typical
office or business setting but HP didn't
mind hooking this up with one of their
best there are few cool features that
make this an awesome printer like
wireless printing NFC and even access to
apps like Google Drive but for us it was
all about the speed navigation with the
touch sensitive display is buttery
smooth and feels a lot like the
experience we get on our smart phones
which is a huge step up from any printer
we've used before but not only is the
navigation fast but so is the actual
printing so if we wanted this to be a
pretty streamlined setup a super fast
printer with a bunch of cool features
turned out to be pretty awesome if
you're stuck with a clunky old printer
at your office or you simply need a new
one for your own business I suggest
checking this one out and if you're
wondering about the drawers that the
printer is resting on we also got that
from Ikea and now onto the little things
to add a more personal touch to the
setup you surely notice the light behind
the desk and that's of course powered by
a Philips hue strip to add just a little
bit of flair and we've also got this
pretty cool little desk lamp on the side
if there's ever any need to get work
done at night and on the other side
we've got some faux grass because it
just adds a nice touch and right under
the desk we've got a pretty cool piece
that helps with some cable management so
you don't have a ton of cables dangling
against a wall and since the other
office desk usually has my Gundams Harry
felt like she could add a bit of her own
flavor to this one with a diecast Hello
Kitty figure among some other things
above the entire set
but this is it for our new minimalist
desk tour guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and
