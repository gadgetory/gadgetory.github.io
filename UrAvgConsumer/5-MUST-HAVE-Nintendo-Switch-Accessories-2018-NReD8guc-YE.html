consumer and it's kind of hard to
believe but a Nintendo switch has been
out for almost a year now
and that means of course there are a ton
of new accessories for it that are worth
taking a look at if you own a switch or
you plan on getting one soon and first
up we've got this power case for the
Nintendo switch now you might have seen
this in my massive tech unboxing video
last month but this case is pretty cool
not only does it have a protective hard
shell slots to store up to eight games
and a pouch for cables and joy cons but
this thing also charges your switch and
yes you heard right this is a protective
case that also has a built-in portable
charger to charge your switch whenever
you're on the go and if you guys know me
you know how much I love my portable
chargers and it's just great to be able
to travel with the switch whenever I'm
done playing with it for a bit throw it
inside of its case and then have it at a
hundred percent whenever I want to go
back and play it this thing is packing
8,000 milliamp hours so it'll be able to
charge it at least once to a hundred
percent and then some afterwards overall
if you're a big switch player and you
really take advantage of its portability
this case is a no-brainer and it's
definitely worth picking up and next we
have this really cool light up dock
shield for the switch dock but this
thing you could jazz up the look of your
back and add a little something special
to your set up what you get with this is
a base that comes with a few plates and
it has built-in LEDs with a variety of
colors to choose from or you can just
let it cycle through all of them and
you've got a few options in terms of the
look you want to go for it comes with a
Super Mario Odyssey plate as well as a
Zelda plate and a total of 17 different
color combinations with the effects that
it has but if I have to choose between
the two plates I gotta say I like Zelda
quite a bit more than Mario don't kill
me but I just like the fact that the
Zelda plate doesn't have any logos or
any words on it
Super Mario Odyssey says Super Mario Ric
so you kind of stuck with that game but
being cool to just see like a Mario
symbol and if you like both that's not a
problem sticking out the plates is super
easy and it's all powered by one USB
port on the switch dock so there's no
extra power cables that you need to plug
in which is great and it only cost 20
bucks which is a great price to add a
little flair to your setup and
continuing with this idea of
customization next we've got some custom
plates and joy cons and I also featured
this pretty briefly in my massive tech
unboxing but here are some cool
I got from my buddy over on Instagram at
Doyle's customs I stumbled across to my
his stuff on Instagram and I had to get
my hands on them he does some crazy
stuff with Nintendo's twitch plates
joy Khan's even pro controllers and a
few other things and what I like about
his work is that it looks legit doesn't
look cheaply made definitely some good
quality stuff here they're switching out
the police is actually really easy he
even included some screwdrivers for me
to actually go ahead and do that so if
you guys want to switch up your look
definitely check this guy out
he has a ton of great options that I
love and next up we've got this really
nice multi angle stand for the switch
and it might not seem like a huge deal
but if you carry the switch everywhere
like I do this thing is actually pretty
clutch it's light and super easy to
carry around but most importantly this
thing can flex to a ton of different
angles I don't care what kind of angle
or position you want this thing can do
that it also has these rubber pads that
hold up the switch and actually at the
bottom of the stand so this thing is not
going to slide around a move around and
honestly that's pretty useful if you're
on a plane and you're turning or
something you're not gonna have to worry
about your switch sliding around and you
can of course charge your switch while
you're using it which is always nice and
even if you're not gonna use it for your
switch you can always use your phone or
tablet with it which could be pretty
handy if you're using it for FaceTime or
something and another one for you folks
out there who constantly travel with
your switch we've got some portable
docks I've got two options here but
let's talk about the cheaper one first
this one is by Jay top and it's only 35
bucks and it's way more portable than
the standard switch stock
it does have some questionable reviews
on Amazon which I'm not really sure why
because I've been using mine perfectly
for the last few months
it even has all the same ports that are
included on the standard dock and at its
price it's worth picking up so you don't
have to unplug your dock from your TV
set up whenever you want to travel or go
to a friend's house and it's much easier
to travel with you basically just grab
it and go I honestly just leave it in my
backpack
now there's the second one by insignia
that's slightly bigger and a bit more
expensive at 40 bucks but it does come
with a power cable as well as an HDMI
cable only thing though is that it's
missing those two extra USB ports that
the standard one has I'm not really sure
that's much of a deal-breaker since
those ports really never get used but I
half the price of the regular dock I
think both are worth looking into and
I'll have the
link down below in the description as
well as everything else mentioned in
this video but hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
