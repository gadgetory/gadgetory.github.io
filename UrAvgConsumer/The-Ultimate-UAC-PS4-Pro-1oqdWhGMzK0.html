and today we have a very special
unboxing I couldn't wait for massive
tech unboxing to open this up so I
figured why not share it with you guys
we've got something really cool inside
of here
and let's just see what it is right got
the Box open so let's see what we got
here I already know what it is
boom we got ourselves another ps4 guys
considering this is something we've seen
on the channel plenty of times you can
make an assumption here this is from the
folks over at kala where now you guys
might have seen the new logo so I wanted
something that kind of represented that
for the ps4 and I hit up the guys over
at color ware and they were able to do
what I needed so let's see what the
sucker looks like alright so we'll start
off with the controller oh alright let's
go so if you haven't seen the new logo
this is right up there with the color
scheme that I've changed it to and man
this looks so good now these are
actually the color straight up from
color where I believe this is the
Caribbean color option that they have
and goodness this looks so good so I'm
very excited for the ps4 no it's so
height yes let's go this is it this is
so so clean guys so I went with a great
and teal color scheme of course it
matches the logo and the insides are
coarse black so this goes so well with
it and the guys over at color where they
paint this stuff and they've got the
ability to customize it a little bit
more than just throwing a couple of
shades of paint on it I even have the
new UAC logo right here at the bottom
right or bottom depends on how you're
looking at it this is the bottom left
though and it looks super clean what it
was there's a bottom left like I said it
depends on how you're looking at it
for me it's at the bottom and it's on
the left well it's on the right
don't try and mess with me Malcolm but
yeah guys did
looks absolutely amazing I am in love
and I guess this is the perfect time to
announce that we will start seeing some
changes to the gamers paradise of course
the gamers paradise will always have the
UAC color scheme and this is going to be
a part of that but man it is probably
gonna blow all of your minds
now just looking at these two together
color is just like it's just crazy that
they can make this kind of thing happen
I'll of course have them linked down
below in the description if you're not
into ps4 maybe your xbox person or a PC
kind of guy they can customize a ton of
different things but this is just
something that's really special to me
because it's the first time we're
putting the branding the USC branding on
some stuff and it's officially here in
the new color scheme and you know what
we'll also do a little giveaway this is
gonna be two of two PS for pros that
look like this
so if you guys are interested in winning
one I'll have a giveaway over on
Instagram and you guys can get your
hands on one of these ps4 pros but yeah
guys I just wanted to do a quick little
unboxing and share with you guys the new
look of the ps4 pro that is going to be
in the gamers paradise
the next updated gamers paradise and
like I said a new video about that is
coming very very soon but till the next
one guys is your average consumer if you
want a chance of winning the only other
ps4 that looks like this head on over to
my Instagram and I'll catch you guys in
the next one
till then is your average consumer face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
