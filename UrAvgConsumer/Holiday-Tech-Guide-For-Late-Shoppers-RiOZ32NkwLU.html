consumer and today I'm gonna be going
over some of the top tech tips that you
guys can get over the holiday season so
whether a late buyer or you just got
some new holiday money and you want to
spend it these are so a couple of good
deals that I found so far and hey let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it
now this wouldn't be my channel if I
didn't talk about headphones so the
first deal that I have for you guys is
the audio technica ath M 50s now feels
really great and very very popular
headphones and they're just amazing for
their price and right now you can find
it on Amazon for a hundred and three
bucks so this is the most
budget-friendly headphone that you can
find of its quality so it's really great
stuff I definitely recommend picking it
up I have product links down below as
well as reviews if I covered these
products on my channel before so you
guys can check it out and make a safe
purchasing decision but these are really
great and at 103 bucks you're definitely
getting a steal for the quality that
you're getting also on the list of
headphones I've got the Logitech UE line
from the 9000 6000 and even 4000
Logitech UE 9000 are some Bluetooth
headphones with amazing sound quality I
love bluetooth headphones and this
usually retails for about 400 bucks but
you can find that on Amazon right now
for about 235 so that's how ton of
savings right there for some amazing
quality headphones so I definitely
recommend checking that out and of
course a Logitech UE 6000 those are
amazing headphones as well a Logitech
has done really well with a u heat line
and when the 6000 is usually retail for
200 bucks but you can find them on
Amazon for only 99 bucks so really great
stuff there as well you've got active
noise-cancelling great sound quality of
really nice design great packaging it's
really good stuff so I definitely
recommend that as well and last but not
least if you want something a lot more
budget-friendly which is in the forty
dollar range
you've got the Logitech UE 4000s those
are also very nice headphones so I'd
recommend that if you want to get that
for someone who's younger or someone
who's not crazy about it but they want
some decent headphones definitely check
out the 4000 and last but not least I've
got some in earbuds these are the
Jaybirds blue buds
the Jaybirds are great rate in years
they're probably my favorite ones due to
the bluetooth feature and the sound
quality so you want to get rid of cords
you want to be able to jog and run and
be as active as you can with these guys
you definitely be able to do that so
they're really great quality
they usually retail for about 170 but
right now you can pick them up for 130
so I definitely recommend checking those
out as well so for my headphone lovers
and earbud lovers check those deals out
great stuff next we've got the canon t3i
this is only retailing for about four
hundred and thirty bucks on amazon right
now and this comes with an 18 by 55
millimeter lens so it's the standard
DSLR camera and you get a great great
camera for the price I actually use a
t3i on all my videos for quite some time
I have a t4 eye now and it was
definitely perfect for me getting those
high quality videos on my youtube
channel so I definitely recommend it's
an amazing camera and at 400 bucks it's
a very budget-friendly DSLR do you
usually get like the Canon t3i then that
it's a ton of savings so if you want to
take professional photos or you want to
move into that kind of realm or even do
you great quality YouTube videos can
check that out it's worth the investment
and while we're on the topic of cameras
you're gonna need an SD card to go with
it and I found that Sony it has some
really awesome SD cards for a really low
price you can get a 64 gigabyte for only
about thirty-eight dollars which is
quite amazing I actually picked up a
couple myself 64 gigs for 38 bucks and
very nice deal and even if you don't
need 64 gigs of memory you can go for 32
gigabytes for only $19.99 so 20 bucks so
32 gigs 20 bucks 64 gigs 38 bucks really
great quality stuff there definitely do
recommend those memory cards and for all
you early adopters out there I've got a
4k television for you guys and this is
actually much much cheaper than you
would expect to pay from brands like
Sony or Samsung this is the sekki and I
think that's how people are saying it is
the seiki 4k display and there's
actually two models there's a 50 inch
model as well as a 39 inch model the 50
inch model you can find it for about
seven hundred and seventy bucks so
that's a lot less than other
brands that are selling them for like
$4,000 and around that realm so very
very expensive but this is actually
consumer friendly as far as the pricing
goes and you can also get the 39 inch
model for only 650 so if all you guys
who want to jump in and see what 4k
looks like this is TV for you to do that
early and check out all that 4k content
out there which isn't very much to just
keep that in mind there isn't that much
but if you want to get ready for all the
4k that's coming this is a nice TV to do
that at a nice price and next up I've
got some surround sound speakers is the
logitech g502 use these and these aren't
on sale or anything special right now
but they're actually very
budget-friendly they're like 70 bucks
and you get 5.1 surround sound which is
really nice I actually use these all the
time and I love it the sound quality is
really great and the subwoofer is great
for pumping out bass so you definitely
get a good experience with this so I
think at 70 bucks it's a must-have so
definitely check that out as well
and if you're in the market for a tablet
and you don't want to just go with the
regular iPad or iPad Mini
check out the Nexus 7 you've got a great
budget-friendly product right there I
think that it's worth the investment
because you've got a great picture
quality you got really great speed it's
got some nice specs so this thing is
gonna last you quite a bit and it's
gonna perform very well and it only
retails for 230 so right now an Amazon
you can probably save like five bucks on
it but you can find it for 230 on the
Play Store so definitely check that out
i highly recommend it and while we're on
the topic of tablets maybe if you
already got a tablet or you're a
purchased someone a tablet a nice little
accessory to get is this tablet stand
that you can find on amazon for only
five bucks this is the perfect accessory
for a tablet owner and i'd recommend it
because you can propped up your tablet
in a bunch of different ways or you can
make it portrait landscape you can
adjust the heck out of that thing so i
highly recommend picking that up for
anyone who's going to be viewing a
tablet or maybe you know watching a lot
of movies on it highly recommend it it's
a must for a tablet owner and another
accessory you can get someone who owns a
tablet or maybe a smartphone or any
portable device really is the new trend
power pack plus it has 13,500
I am some battery power smartphones
right now range from 1500 milliamps of
battery to 3000 milliamp so you have
13,500 here so you're going to be
charging your device's over and over and
over if you have an iPhone and it dies
on you all the time this is definitely a
great companion gadget I definitely
recommend that even if you're not
looking at this one in particular I'll
put a couple of others down below in the
description as well and I definitely
recommend a portable charger that is one
of the best average consumer gadgets
that I think you can have because we all
have smartphones or phones that will die
on us so this is definitely worth it and
you can find the power pack plus for 55
bucks if you're not familiar with this
kind of gadget take my word for it it's
really worth it and last but not least
is the Xbox one I'm not sure how hard of
the time people are having finding the
Xbox one but it's gonna been going on
and off Amazon for past couple of days
now as of the time of recording this
video it is on sale at Amazon so if
you're trying to get one of those game
consoles for yourself maybe your
boyfriend or husband or whoever your son
definitely run on Amazon right now and
pick it up it's 500 bucks as you may
already know so it's available right now
and I'd highly do recommend picking one
up if you're looking into getting a new
gaming console now the ps4 I would
recommend but that thing is that thing
is hard to find so you can go the next
route with the Xbox one and if this list
doesn't really help you out you can
always go and get an Amazon gift card
Amazon has tons and tons of tech deals
so gift card is always a safe bet you
can go on their purchase a gift card and
they can buy whatever they want
afterwards so definitely always a good
choice to go with Amazon gift card and
that about wraps up my list of gadgets
that you might want to keep an eye out
for I'm gonna update the list down below
as frequently as possible before the
holidays ends or even after it ends for
those of you who get that holiday money
so I'm gonna keep updating the list on
cool little tech things that I find or
my personal favorites so be sure to
check down in the description for more
options or more on gadgets that you
might like to purchase so that's about
it for this video guys hopefully you
enjoy it hopefully it helps you out and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
so then is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
