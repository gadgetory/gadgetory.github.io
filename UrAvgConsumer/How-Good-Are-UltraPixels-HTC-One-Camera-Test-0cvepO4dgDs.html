average consumer and today I'm gonna be
doing a demonstration of the ultra pixel
camera on the HTC one there's a four
megapixel camera and HTC is boasting
that this is some really good quality so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna test
it out in different lighting conditions
and see how it fares so let's not waste
any time let's get right into it alright
guys so right now I'm using the
front-facing camera and as you can see
it is pretty bright out so I'm just
gonna be squinting quite a bit but as
you can see this is a wide-angle lens
and what's a wide-angle lens you can get
a lot more in the picture you can see a
lot more of the background behind me but
as you guys can see this has some really
good quality it takes some really crispy
do so nothing too surprising here I'll
show you guys some of the scenery behind
me so you guys can see what this camera
looks like on its own
and as you guys can see the front-facing
camera is good enough to be its own with
recorder so it's pretty good stuff we're
definitely very big improvements to
megapixel front-facing camera good stuff
2.1 megapixels and now you guys can see
i'm outdoors this is what the footage is
like it's very clear very vibrant on the
screen I think it might be a little more
vibrant than it would be on the computer
but it looks very nice and clear the
colors really pop when it comes to the
on screen footage and even off on the
computer the footage looks the colors
look very vibrant as well so now I'm
going to get some close-ups of some of
these flowers so you guys can see
and as I'm walking right now you might
want to take a note of what the image
stabilization is like if the camera
really jitters a lot while walking
around so here we have some flowers
let's see how it is when you zoom in and
focus
so you guys can see some really nice
quality here definitely some good stuff
but I must if the colors look very very
bright really bright and it does seem it
does seem that the color takes some time
to adjust when moving the camera around
pretty quickly as you can see here the
colors do shift a bit it takes a little
time to get the natural color in and all
right guys this is it in a afternoon or
evening setting it is about 8:00 p.m. so
the Sun has gone down considerably and
this is how its performing so this would
be pretty decent in a low light
situation it seems pretty dark around
the edges but that may just be the
camera
so I'll see on the computer if the edges
are as dark as there are on screen and
you guys will see for yourself how this
does in an evening setting so this is
the night time view of the HTC One and
you guys can see it for yourself on
screen it looks pretty dark but this is
what it is and there are a few lights
over there but it does still look pretty
dark for video mode anyway now I'm gonna
try it out with the flash so here we
have it with the flash now and you can
see the flash in the reflection of this
car but it's not having that much impact
so doesn't make too crazy of a
difference but if you get close enough
to something I'm sure you'll be able to
tell so as you can see here if you have
a subject in front of the one it'll
still perform very well although from
afar it won't be that great but if you
have a subject in mind or someone in
front of the camera talking or something
this will perform pretty well so it
looks really nice
