consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
Google pixel to excel you guys are gonna
be spending a full day with me and the
phone and we're gonna be testing out
things like the battery life performance
that display that's been causing all
kinds of drama on Twitter and in common
sections and we're gonna see how it all
performs in the real world so let's see
how it did alright guys so right now
we're using the front-facing camera on
the pixel 2xl it's about almost 11 a.m.
starting today this thing's got a 100%
battery but I'm actually in the middle
of a shoot I'm actually gonna be
shooting a video as we speak so I need
to get back to that but like I said
front-facing camera so you can expect
this this kind of video and audio
quality when you use it alright guys so
we finished wrapping up that video
working on exporting it now but it is
time for me to completely spend the rest
of the day with this phone it's got
about 90% left I haven't really done
much with it since I recorded that first
video now something I'm kind of digging
with the stock Android is that when you
jump into the battery settings now it
tells you exactly what you're looking
for as soon as you jump in so you'll see
that it says screen usage since full
charge it's been about 14 minutes of
screen on time so have you been using it
month a lost 10% that was a lot of
standby but we'll see how it lasts
throughout the rest of the day now one
of the biggest things about this phone
which I'm sure all of you already know
is that it's got some issues with the
screen and there are three different
problems but I think my biggest
personally is the fact that it has way
less color than I would like and this
right here is one of my favorite live
wallpapers I usually like this one
because it looks very vibrant the colors
are really nice and they pop but on this
display you really just don't get that
so putting this side-by-side with the
Galaxy Note 8 you can see a very big
difference this is the same brightness
on both screen but you can tell this
looks way more faded than it does on the
Galaxy Note 8 and while the Galaxy Note
8 usually looks very nice it kind of
looks like this with every other phone
that I use but over here you just got
way less color and for me that's
of a problem now unless you're coming
from something like the galaxy s 8 or
note 8 you probably won't see a
difference but it is something to keep
in mind but luckily Google says this
phone is capable of having all of those
vibrant colors so if something that can
be tweaked within a software update so
we'll have to see what happens there but
hopefully they do come out with a fix
now the other issue is the fact that
this has a blue shift whenever you have
it at different viewing angles so when
you're looking at it straight up it
looks normal
but once you tilt it back you tilt it to
the sides those different viewing angles
will cause it to have that blue shift in
the screen and that's really not
something you want to see with a phone
at this price range honestly I think of
that more as a defect
some people have it way worse than
others so it depends on the device how
bad it is but honestly you don't want to
see that at this price range it's just
doesn't make sense but I'll let you guys
know how much it bothers me throughout
the day and the last issue is that some
people are complaining about burn-in for
these on-screen buttons here at the
bottom but they usually have to pull it
up in a very specific manner with a gray
screen and it's kind of weird that they
have to go through a set a whole process
to kind of see that that's the nature of
OLED panels after extended use so seeing
it here is a little bit weird too
especially so early in the phone's life
but supposedly Google has done some
testing and they found that this doesn't
have a worse screen than any of the
other phones out on the market so we'll
have to see what it looks like with
extended use and I'm not just saying
that for the sake of defending Google
listen I bought the device on my own
Google didn't send it to me Google's not
sponsoring me in any way so Google's not
affecting my opinion by any means I just
think we really have to wait and see if
some of these issues are really issues
lighter note these D brand skins the
different did a pretty good job with
these re yeah I really wish they sent
the Panda ones I like the Panda
No well either way you can switch up
your pixel to however you want it to
look D brain all day but yeah I'll have
links down below in the description if
you guys want to check these out they
got a lot of different skins alright
guys so right now we're on our way to
Gundam planet because my beautiful
beautiful wife decided she wanted to
destroy one of money one of mine no no
you knocked into it and then he said
oops
and then you stepped on it she crushed
it
do we still have the footage you know
what boom clip and now you guys saw that
she reads some crazy havoc in the studio
but we're headed to gun the planet now
we got a GPS going we've got about 20
more minutes we're at 76% battery so
we'll see what kind of impact this drive
is gonna have on it
percent battery left so that 20-minute
drive took like three percent which is
really
yes very solid the pixels have good
battery life so no surprise here alright
guys so we're done them plan it and
they've got all these kinds of cool
figurines here this is Godzilla fall you
kids who might not know about it he's a
legend time to test out the camera we
got to do I guess a regular shot will
save the portrait mode stuff for a
little bit later let's just get a
regular shot this is pretty weak
lighting so I say low light let's give
it a shot that's a clean shot did I have
Porsche motor on because that is clean
no no what's it one for those of you who
don't know pixels have amazing cameras
okay so you guys see this guy right here
this is like or zero this is definitely
a throwback right here this is actually
really really good that's a good paint
job see this that's what I love like you
can zoom in and see so much detail so
much sharpness it's such a sharp camera
that is just a clean shot and that is a
clean shot what's crazy is that this is
behind this little not glass like
plastic but it still came out super
clear so impressive so guys one of the
favorite features about this phone is
the fact that it can detect what song is
being played in your environment so as
you can see it says say I buy fabulous
and trey songz so that's what's playing
right now this is especially nice if
you're at a restaurant or maybe just out
anywhere and you don't know what song is
being played but you like the beat of it
or you like the tune and you can find
out by just looking at your phone and it
doesn't have microphones that are
listening in and sending anything to the
cloud or anything like that you can be
in airplane mode and things still works
it's not doing anything online it's all
on the device which is pretty insane it
ain't perfect though I've had a lot of
times where a certain song would work
and the same song wouldn't work so it
can be hit or miss but it's a cool
feature nonetheless it's right now
Ares got some ramen
I've got some curry but like I said we
were working on a video today we dropped
it today and now I'm responding to
comments but one thing that I like here
is that it's pretty easy to type on this
even with one hand so for one-handed
typing I'm really not having any issues
which I really like and it's actually
not a very slippery phone not to me
anyway so being able to hold it with one
hand not worry about it falling out
especially something's a bigger phone
it's actually really nice hear that
music playing in the back it's actually
playing right on the device as we eat
definitely doesn't get more real world
than this this is a great future hi guys
so we had our ramen our curry time for
some bubble tea so I'm about to have
some of this oh there we go
I'm actually gonna take a selfie with
this because I love this bubble tea that
much okay my face is a little dark but
man yeah yeah for sure
it just it works every time
with just one lens guys it does it
doesn't make any sense
I don't know how Google does it but they
nail it with this software I want to see
this apk go over to other Android phones
and see if they can take advantage up
with two I know they have the cameras
have like special pixels and whatnot but
it'd be interesting to see nonetheless
so it is clearly nighttime figured why
not take a picture of this statue over
here
test out the cameras nighttime low-light
capabilities see how it does so let's
see if I can get a decent shot here this
guy's a grenade in this in its crazy
Danny that's a clean shot
that is a solid picture man that is a
solid picture so right now me and Ari
are very full with we're very full but
we are in IKEA and we need to pick up a
couple of things but we're just showing
right now might drop a youtube video or
two so you see guys you see when you're
watching a video on YouTube you've got
these black bars
it doesn't take advantage of the full
screen which is no kind of unfortunate
on the s8 and I think the note 8 you can
like zoom in so that the entire screen
is taken up with the video I wish they
would have had to added that feature
here hopefully they do it in a software
update but with these kind of bezels you
know I want to take advantage of it you
just can't do that right now me and Ari
are going to take a selfie together
there's such great lighting in IKEA
getting this selfie even so even in
motion this is a really good shot come
on out so check this out guys it did it
again this time in IKEA so it's got the
song over here but I didn't show you
guys last time that you can actually
jump in and see what song it is
and you can go see things like the
YouTube video you can buy it with the
Play Store or do a google search for it
shows you all the info you need right
when you tap it so if you need a little
bit more information on what song it is
that's playing you can always just tap
the screen and it'll give you a bit more
definite info on a white screen you can
definitely see it so one feature I like
is the ability to squeeze the phone to
pull up the Google assistant I didn't
get a chance to watch the Cavs game so I
can just pull it up and find out how
they did today so check this out how did
the Cavaliers do today oh dang they lost
come on y'all
either way that's a cool feature Cavs
need to get it together though and even
though you can't use the full display
for things like watching YouTube videos
still works just fine for gaming so you
can take advantage of that 6-inch
display helps games to look really good
gives you a lot of real estate and
playing a game like Riptide GP over here
which
has a lot of stuff going on is not a
problem because this thing that has a
snapdragon 835 processor four gigs of
ram all the specs you would expect from
a flagship thing I was trying to nail
that while talking but all the specs
that you would expect from a flagship of
2017 and not only does that help with
gaming but just the overall experience
when using the phone it's snappy this is
the smoothest version of Android you can
possibly expect because it's the
cleanest version so performance is not
gonna be an issue here whatsoever and
that was pretty much my day now of
course I spent more time with the phone
before doing this wrap-up and I had to
think long and hard before I decided
whether or not I'd recommend this phone
when we're in a world with the Galaxy s8
the note 8 the LGV 30 and iphone all
those really great phones it makes it a
hard decision I feel like the issues
with the display really overshadow a lot
of the good things about the pixel 2xl
the camera is phenomenal and you guys
saw how impressed I was with both the
front-facing camera and the rear camera
which is pretty rare front-facing
cameras are usually pretty hit or miss
but this one is definitely impressive
and the fact that it can even pull up a
portrait mode with just a single lens
it's just mind-blowing and battery life
is awesome
it's amongst the best that I've ever
used on a smartphone you can go ahead
and quote me on that
I definitely think it'll last you
dropped the entire day and even if you
forget to charge it at night this thing
has fast charging I was able to get from
five percent all the way to forty-one
percent within 15 minutes and when
Google says that it'll give you seven
hours of usage I think they're factoring
in standby time because seven hours of
actual usage isn't really possible with
just around 40 percent or so but
definitely not seven hours of just
straight-up usage that I don't think is
true but throughout your day yet now it
does suck that this doesn't have
wireless charging built into it I'm just
starting to really get into the whole
wireless charging thing I've got a
couple of those wireless charging pads
all over my place so it would have been
nice to have that feature but it's
definitely not a deal breaker and not to
mention this phone's loaded with a bunch
of other cool features like being able
to squeeze the phone to pull up your
voice assistant having the always-on
display and also being able to listen to
your environment to let you know what
music is playing in the background but
there's that big issue with the display
I honestly feel like that's what kills
the phone most people aren't gonna want
to sacrifice quality in any space when a
brand-new phone that cost this much I
personally have way more issues with the
lack of color on the screen than that
blue shift are you actually have no
issues with the screen at all when she
took a look at it so I think it really
depends on the person
US techies are gonna put it under a
microscope and point out all the flaws
which we should because it means a
better product for the consumer at the
end if the companies who make these
phones are listening but my biggest
suggestion is to go into a verizon store
and see the phone in person even if you
don't have Verizon they have the phone
so go take a look at it see if the
screen is actually gonna bother you I
think the average consumer isn't really
gonna have an issue with it unless like
I said they come from a phone that had a
really vibrant bright screen like the s8
or the note 8 but I think in that it
makes it a really hard sell to have a
screen that isn't as good as some of the
competitors out right now but I can
absolutely recommend this phone based on
its performance its features the feel in
the hand how it is to actually use it
but that screen is definitely up to the
person looking at it so like I said go
check it out in stores everyone's
tasting the screen is going to different
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoy if you
did be the cool guy or girl that gives
this video a thumbs up I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
