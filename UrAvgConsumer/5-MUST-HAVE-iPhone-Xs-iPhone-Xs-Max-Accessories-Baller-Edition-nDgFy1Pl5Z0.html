consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at five must-have accessories for
the iPhone 10s and 10's Macs for you
ball is out there and for those of you
who aren't ballers don't worry I made a
budget Edition version of this video and
I'll have that link down below in the
description for you to check out but
let's talk about the first product and
that is this awesome battery case by
audio mod now this is an awesome case
because not only does it protect your
phone but it has a built in battery
rated at 4,600 milliamp hours and
basically what that means is that this
case is going to be able to charge your
phone and then some but if you keep it
on is going to give you at least double
the battery life and this is great
because we didn't see Apple come out
with a battery case for the iPhone 10 so
we don't know if we're gonna see one for
the 10s and I'm sure we're not seeing
one for the 10s max now what makes this
case even more special than it having a
built in battery is the fact that it has
a built-in headphone jack and this is a
great feature to see built right into
the phone because unfortunately the
iPhone 10s and 10's max no longer even
come with a dongle so there's no chance
of getting your headphones plugged in
unless you buy a dongle separately or
you use something like this where it's
automatically built-in you don't need
any extra pieces so for my regular
headphone lovers this is a really nice
option because it kills quite a few
birds with just one stone speaking of
audio we got to talk about some earbuds
that work well with these new phones of
course you guys know the air pods the
air pods are getting extremely popular I
feel like every time I go outside I see
more and more people with them but what
you won't see them with our custom air
pods like the ones here from kala ware
now if you've never heard of color where
they custom paint a ton of cool tech
products I've got so many awesome pieces
of gear thanks to them they got some
really cool stuff and you can check
their website you can pick the gear that
you want and all the different colors
and finishes from matte to gloss to
metallic looking there are lots of great
options this air pod I have right here
is the Space Gray version and my girl
area has the purple and pink that she
picked she custom chose her own colors
so there are a ton of options for you to
choose from if you want to stand out or
maybe have your ear pods match your
iPhone and I love color wares website as
well as everything else mentioned in
this video link down below in this
scription and if air pots aren't your
style something definitely worth taking
a look at are the beats X now I've
personally been using the beats X on a
daily basis it's just super convenient
and it's cool because the beats X also
have that w1 chip which makes pairing
them super easy and you can use them
between all of your devices it's a
really good stuff I personally like it
because it has that neckband design
which makes keeping the earbuds in place
a cinch you can jog and workout with it
and you don't have to worry about them
falling out which I definitely think is
a bonus now if you go to the Apple store
and try and pick these up they'll cost
you about 150 bucks your ball is so I
know you don't care but if you go onto
Amazon you can find them for about a
hundred bucks which is quite a bit
cheaper and if you're really balling and
you don't want no little earbuds you
want some real solid headphones I
definitely think you should check out
the sony 1000 x mark threes now these
aren't an awesome pair of over ear
headphones that have great or even the
best noise cancelling on the market
right now and all the ton of other cool
features I'm gonna make a full-blown
video about this for you guys so don't
worry we'll talk about all the ins and
outs but it's nice and lightweight great
materials great sound quality and
awesome features so this is something
worth looking at if you really got some
money burning a hole in your pocket and
you want the absolute best headphones
with cool features out on the market now
let's say you're not really get an audio
person but you love some games on your
iPhone something you got to check out is
the SteelSeries Nimbus wireless
controller now this is a gaming
controller similar to what we see on
consoles but it's made for your iPhone
and even the Apple TV and iPad I'm sure
we've all gotten used to gaming on a
touchscreen but there are some games out
there that are just much better played
with a controller and that's why we have
this option although I gotta give you
guys a heads up this controller is not
compatible with every game in the App
Store there's a specific list of games
that this thing works with and I'll have
that link down below in the description
if you want to see if you want to pick
it up but it is definitely worth it if
you want to play some games very
comfortable in the hand and it is just
an awesome experience especially if
you've got the max with that big screen
now I'm supposed to Audio lovers and the
gamers out there but let's talk about
our creators and if you love making
videos on your iPhone you definitely
have to try out a smartphone gimbal like
the DJI Osmo 2 or the G and smooth 4 now
these are both awesome smartphone game
boats that cause
130 bucks in that price range but they
are an indispensable tool when it comes
to making videos with your phone they
help to keep your footage really stable
and smooth and they also have a bunch of
other features that allow you to get
some really creative shots from your
phone as you guys can see a stabilizer
you can help keep your phone right in
place when you want to get a very
specific shot but holding it in the hand
might just be too shaky even with
optical image stabilization a stabilizer
will take it to the next level when it
comes to moving around and capturing a
shot then I'll throw up some footage so
you guys can see what's possible with
these gimbals see the kind of cool shots
that you're able to get but honestly I
have a hard time picking between the two
of these they might have some pros and
cons that you might want to check out
but I did want to put both of them on
your radar so you can know that these
things are out there and last on its
list is something that I've been using
for the past few months and taking just
about everywhere with me and that is the
cetacean USB C power delivery hub now
that USB C power delivery hub is the
important part here because this is what
is going to allow your iPhone to fast
charge unfortunately the new iPhones do
not come with fast chargers that within
the box so you're gonna have to go out
and buy one separately if you want to
take advantage of that feature and I'm
telling you guys it is worth taking
advantage of that feature you'll be able
to charge up your iPhone way faster
which is not something people even
complain about but having access to a
much more battery in a short timeframe
is game-changing
trust me but what makes this hub special
and why I think it deserves a spot on
this baller list is that it comes with
three extra USB ports one of them is
even quick charge 3.0 so if you happen
to travel with a loved one or a friend
that happens to use an Android device
that can take advantage of that quick
charge it is a nice bonus and not only
are you gonna be able to take care of
yourself that a loved one but you can
even charge some more devices with those
extra two USB ports and this thing is
not only good to take around with you in
your backpack or something but it's
great to sit it on a desk as well so
that you have your dedicated spots for
fast charging or charging multiple
devices now in order to take advantage
of that fast charging feature you will
need a very specific cable made only by
Apple so far and that is a USBC to
lightning cable Apple's only one who
sells them anything else that you find
on Amazon isn't going to be certified
for fast charging and won't be
but to do it so keep that in mind but
since this is the baller edition I went
with a 2-liter version of this cable it
cost a little bit more but you get some
extra lengths that way you're not
hugging a wall to charge your phone
quickly but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
definitely check out the budget edition
if you want to save some cash but still
get some really good accessories and
also check the video link down below in
the description because I am giving away
an iPhone 10s and 10's max so you're
gonna want to enter into that giveaway
but till the next one guys if you
enjoyed it be the cool girl I give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
