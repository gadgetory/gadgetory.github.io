consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the Sony nex-5r camera so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
the first thing you'll notice about the
nex-5r is that it has an interesting
design to it it's got a giant lens in
the front while still having a
point-and-shoot like body it's not quite
a DSLR and it's not quite a
point-and-shoot it's definitely a hybrid
of the two it's got the plenty shoot
form factor with the size but it's got
the giant lens on front that's like a
DSLR and what's great about this is that
the lenses are interchangeable so you
don't have to stick with this giant lens
you can always put a smaller lens on it
depending on what you want to shoot and
how you want to shoot so there are
always options out there if you want to
change out the lens for something
smaller and make it more like a
point-and-shoot but it does come with an
18 by 55 millimeter lens which is pretty
standard for DSLRs this is the standard
range you get and this has performed
just as you would expect it to the range
is pretty good on it and the lens
actually feels pretty nice the whole
body feels really nice it doesn't feel
like something that's cheap it is a $700
camera so it definitely gives you that
good premium feeling you wouldn't be
disappointed with this at all if you
want to step into the professional realm
but you don't want to carry along a
giant camera like a DSLR this is
definitely a good option for those of
you who are looking for something
smaller I'm really a fan of the form
factor even though it has the giant lens
that's the 18 by 55 millimeter I kind of
like it I feel like it gives the camera
some personality and even though it's a
giant lens it's not too heavy I actually
walk around with this camera as my
vlogging camera for my other channel
with my girlfriend and you'll notice
that we're carrying it around all the
time holding it up with no issues so
weight isn't a problem even though it
does have that giant lens and speaking
about vlogging one of the best features
about the nex-5r in my opinion is the
fact that it has a swivel screen so you
can actually turn the screen from the
back and move
the front so you can see what you're
taking a picture of so it's perfect for
self-portraits or vlogging like I said
so we're able to see if we're in the
position correctly or if we're in focus
things like that and it's really a bonus
to have that there so definitely thumbs
up for having this swivel screen and
it's also got other kinds of angles that
you can use it for as well you don't
have to swivel it all the way but you
can actually turn the screen to tilt it
towards you if you want to point the
camera high up and you're not able to
see what's on the screen you can
actually swivel the screen to look to
face downward at you while your camera
is being pointed into the air and you
can actually see what the camera is
looking at so that's really great stuff
do you get a lot of moving the
maneuverability with this screen the
only downfall with the screen is that
the nex-5r is able to have accessories
mounted onto the top when you do have
that accessory on top you won't be able
to swivel the screen all the way around
so it's a bit of a trade-off I actually
purchased a microphone add-on for
vlogging but when using it I'm unable to
use the screen as I'd like so that's one
of the downfalls whenever you have one
of those accessories on there you won't
be able to use the screen now I didn't
mention that this camera can use
accessories which is a really great
bonus because most poignant shoots
you're not able to add accessories onto
this so like a DSLR this one is able to
get some accessories which is really
great do you have the ability to use
microphones an attachable viewfinder the
flash all kinds of stuff and speaking of
the flash this is probably going to be
one of the worst things about the camera
is that it doesn't have a built-in flash
you actually have to use the little
accessory slot to get the flash in there
and use it like that so it's really it's
really a bit of a downfall because most
cameras have built-in flashes when
you're adding on the flash you can't
look at the screen in a self-portrait
kind of manner so that's one of the
downfalls to that but the fact that this
can take accessories in general is just
amazing I love it you can always add on
new stuff to it whenever
you want to change up your experience
but another nice little bonus about the
five art is that it has a touchscreen
which is really amazing because you can
now focus exactly on a point that you
touch on the screen some people it might
not be a big deal because we can do that
with camera phones but what this does
for a high quality camera like this is
that you don't have to use the focus
ring around the lens in order to focus
or you don't have to worry about auto
focusing not getting the actual object
that you would like to focus on
so with this touch screen you're able to
touch it and tell exactly what you want
to focus with this camera which i think
is amazing one thing that I really love
about this camera as well is that it's
easy to use it's got a nice user
interface and with the addition of a
touchscreen you can actually just go
through the interface by just touching
options instead of having to use the
dial or any buttons that are around the
camera and I think this is really great
because it really makes things faster
and what's also really great about this
user interface is that when you're
highlighting an option in the camera
settings it'll tell you exactly what
that option is for and how it'll affect
you so that's really great it'll help
people learn what the different options
mean what different settings do so this
is perfect for the average consumer
who's looking to get a little more in
depth with their photography or
videography also this thing has great
battery life I'm able to record or take
pictures for long periods of time for
hours without having to worry about it
and it does use a micro USB to charge so
there's no worries about having to get a
special charger plugged in I can just
take my phone charger plug it in and I'm
good to go
so overall like I said guys this feels
pretty good it's got some nice neat
features it's got Wi-Fi capabilities to
upload photos to like Facebook and show
to your smartphone all kinds of cool
stuff here lots and lots of features I'm
very happy with the features that this
camera has and time to talk about
performance this camera takes some
wonderful pictures and what's great
about this is that you can actually
change the lens to get different effects
or you know different speeds all kinds
of stuff and this is the kind of round
that DSLRs go into with the differ
lenses that definitely have a huge
impact on your image quality and all
kinds of stuff so you have that option
and this is no slouch in the picture
department absolutely love it and here
are some sample shots for you guys to
see here
you
and of course now that you've seen some
pictures time for some video I've told
you guys a ton that I've been vlogging
with this camera so here's some footage
from my vlog to show you guys how this
thing has been working out for us
started photos like the theme song to
this trip so this is like my macbook
background these guys are actually
really huge I never knew that they were
this big
I don't know if you guys can see these
guys are huge and all right guys here's
some test footage of the nex-5r
of course I'll give you guys a quick
look around me give you some footage of
some scenery some flowers a couple of
different colors here so you guys can
get a look at that and right now guys
I'm gonna demonstrate what it's like to
use the screen to tap on a different
focus point and you can see how quickly
the focus happens so here it is on this
blue flower here and now I'm going for
the yellow flower or flowers rather and
as you can see it happens pretty
smoothly it's not abrupt or anything and
it's pretty fast now go for these blue
flowers all the way in the back and
there you go
so this is really one of the favorite
things I like about this camera I can
select my different focus points and
that's just great
and that pretty much wraps up my review
of the nex-5r guys I would highly
recommend it for those of you who are
willing to shell out 700 bucks on a
camera that's almost DSLR like but still
got that point issue ability by being so
small and compact definitely recommend
it it really is for the prosumer who
wants to get a little more involved with
their camera while not going to the side
of the DSLRs and just so you guys can
have an idea of what the camera looks
like when if I were to be using it for
my regular everyday footage this is what
it is here hopefully you enjoyed this
video and if you did please feel free to
rate comment and subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
