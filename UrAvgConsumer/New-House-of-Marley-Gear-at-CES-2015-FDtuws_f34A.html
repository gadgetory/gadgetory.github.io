consumer so I stopped by the House of
Marley booth over at CES since you guys
have asked me to check out their gear in
the past and I figured now is a good
time to show you what they've got lined
up for 2015 so let's not waste any time
get right into it so here's a quick
run-through of some of the things I saw
at the Marley booth and the first things
that caught my eye were these small
speakers called a chant BT and the chant
mini these are portable bluetooth
speakers with a battery life of eight
hours on the BT and six on the mini even
though these are pretty small speakers
Marley plans to bring some warm sound
without sacrificing bass both are made
of recycled materials which is the theme
for quite a few of the products that I
got to take a look at and I gotta say
I'm really liking how portable design
now let's take a look at some earbuds
these are the little bird in ears these
are a budget-friendly option as they
retail for just $14.99 and come in quite
a variety of colors they're also made of
recycled materials which goes along with
that theme that I mentioned earlier so
if you're looking to replace those Apple
earpods and save the planet
please look like an option that won't
break the bank and here we have the one
foundation this is a home audio hi-fi
system with built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
this thing is built with a solid oak
front with twin five inch woofers and
one inch tweeters and it has 200 watts
of power to push them now you might be
wondering why does the speaker need
Wi-Fi well the one foundation is packed
with Qualcomm allplay technology which
allows you to stream music from your
favorite apps to the one foundation and
with more all play speakers will be able
to stream to multiple rooms in your
house this is something to look out for
I also got to check out the liberate bt
speakers which is another portable
bluetooth speaker and it comes with
quite a few options in the looks
department and even a bamboo rear panel
all of these of course made with
recycled materials thumbs up if you want
to see any of these Bluetooth speakers
come to the channel and of course I had
to check out some headphones these are
the legend A and C these are premium
feeling active noise-cancelling head
it's got a very solid build with a metal
frame and some of that stylish bamboo on
the headband they also seemed pretty
comfortable when I tried them on as a
headphone lover I definitely want to
give Jesus pin and see how it matches up
with some of the other stuff I've used
in the past now Marley had a ton of
different products at their booth but I
didn't have enough time to check them
all out if you guys saw anything in this
video that you'd like me to bring to the
channel definitely let me know with a
comment down below I see a few
contenders for your average budget
myself but let me know what you guys
think and if you enjoyed this video be
the fool guy that gives it a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
