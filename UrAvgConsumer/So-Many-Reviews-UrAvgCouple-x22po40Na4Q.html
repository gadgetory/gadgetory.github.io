Lenovo ThinkPad is like a brick anyway
so right now I was about to go to work I
am going to work and right now it's the
morning of the day that's this like
iPhone 6 video Jonathan has been with
yeah and then come back there appear so
if screaming the link is gonna be in
description so if you have not seen it
yet it's pretty funny goal at the end
and that's also why I didn't drop a
video one of the days last week so I was
working on that that was the big deal so
you guys check it out I think it's
hilarious oh my god oh my god you guys
alright let me show something I'm so
excited I have a whole 1,900 followers
kill me so I have increased my father
accounts by a hundred something since
last day so thank you guys and I heard
10,000 we had the 10,000 oh my god you
guys are awesome I'm thinking giveaway
so that's awesome that's awesome
it takes about five minutes just to
start up but it is durable it can
withstand any kind of like crashes and
falls go by it if you can find it you're
giving it away oh yeah I'm gonna give it
away and I'm also gonna give away some
kisses and we love you guys but those
comments about Moving's up the vlog to a
different channel ladies make you stop
that stop no no she responds all of them
but like come on no seriously guys the
vlogs are here to stay on the channel
alright
I want them on every Sunday it's gonna
be here there's definitely an audience
for it if there wasn't they wouldn't get
views and then I would act appropriately
and then you know move it to something
else but you guys like this stuff not
all of you obviously but they're gonna
stay yeah and like the same message we
give to everyone they're not for
everyone like we understand if you
prefer tech videos and otherwise totally
cool we put the title your average
couple before every vlog so that okay
yeah so if just have it comes in your
sub box you see it up don't wanna watch
that it says your average couple skip it
and move on to another video it's that
simple okay I don't even have to click
it yeah see average couple being
completely not clicking not a problem
exactly and it takes up one spot of your
sub box
and we have fun doing that like it's
just like something fun for us and
whatever you know chocolate top it's not
that deep think about the world or the
grand sum of things I'm giving you guys
three tech videos during the week I
don't think one vlog is gonna hurt
alright guys check this out in case
you're wondering what he do his chair he
is carrying on his back to bring to New
York and I figured this way is a little
easier than carry he was like rolling it
he was rolling out the building is a
very loudly I love it so creative
alright guys so right now we're in joys
are us we're on the mission is
continuing yes so you know target wasn't
doing it for us so we had to come to the
actual place where there is gonna be
probably a whole lot of nerf guns toys
galore so now we're gonna find the
perfect nerf guns to war with alright
guys so there's quite the nerf selection
here yeah definitely
what I love down is pretty nice that
looks pretty awesome they have two of
them 46
yikes I don't know about all that all
right guys it's looking like we got to
go with this thing right here boom
they're 14 bucks huh that's the same one
Sonic
alright guys well we obviously have some
decisions to make so we're going to look
around see if we'll get a good one
doesn't break the bank so after much
debate we looked at a bunch of these
different options nerf is just way more
than we're willing to spend on probably
a one-time thing
like if we get anything decent and be 80
bucks or so yeah we can't I honestly
can't use one of these little toys I
don't I don't know these guys where are
the buco or something or these are air
zone okay
yeah Arizona's not happening it's gonna
it's got to be nurse but nurse was just
too much so sorry guys probably knowing
and therefore same time soon sorry
don't sweet nerf so tell me send us some
good preferably the one that's called
the retaliate it was super cool
that's crazy money well so now we're
headed to the dentist

dimple on this side of my face it is no
longer there oh my god it's gone guys oh
wow part of the apocalypse you know the
world maybe might happen I lost it on
our hands great can you see someone know
about not like if you're they stole my
dimple I mean it would be muscle damage
right or is there gonna be muscle fixed
because now there's a you know it's not
weak over there and hence I don't know

had a message and an aesthetic but he
just put like a needle in there and did
numbed it it out I can't see my dimple

I hear we've got a couple of the boxes
from yesterday this thing is also very
very good ever since we came from
Philadelphia Philadelphia to New Jersey

definitely not a fan anymore but in in
Philly it was always really really good
so this is what we're about to do I was
gonna also get to some work and I've got
some work to do myself
I've actually got so much work to do
I actually couldn't do any videos on
Wednesday and Friday because I don't
know if you guys know this but like I
had a sty on my eye
definitely not a good time not a good
time at all um of course I don't want my
videos to the hackney was a big honking
thing on my eye so I haven't been doing
those videos but it's getting better now
so the videos should resume starting

gonna be able going up today and then
tomorrow

you guys he is knocked out yet his
protective hand is on his surface I just
don't understand it I've been trying to
wake him up for the past hour

good job you have to put the vlog look
at you be a bum you look so comfy if I
didn't have hours and hours of work
ahead of me I come lay down with you on
that couch
so had two people it's 1:00 in the
morning Jud it is yeah Black has to come

finish some work all right guys I'm up
now
okay so let me show you guys some of the
stuff that I have to review by the way
you guys probably haven't really gotten
a good view of our living big hairy babe
they haven't seen our house at all
really right we have to do an apartment
tour that's may begin shall we do that
next vlog like to show the whole place
if you guys want to see that next next
next Sunday we can show you guys a tour
of the whole place if you're interested
in that I know some people do that but
um if you guys are interested let me
know
anyway this is our living room so here's
a good idea of what it looks like so
this is it this is where all like the
consoles and whatnot are our TV and you
know here it is so this is the area that
I'm going to be taking out I guess like
I said I have some systems over here ps4
Xbox one I'm sorry no nobody's looking
at your feet
I might worry about your feet they're
worried about these systems these
consoles right here okay
but yeah and right here I have all the
cameras so this looks kind of unsightly
right now I've got pink rear but this
looks a little unsightly because uh you
know there's a lot of cables back there
and stuff like that
these cameras look kind of intimidating
here the whole three of them stacked up
like this
two connects and the PlayStation 4
camera but um I'm going to try and
organize all of this when I'm doing the
whole of checking out my living room
adding some crazy speakers so maybe some
wireless speakers something like that
and I don't know what additional stuff I
can add to it but that's what that whole
process is gonna be about and now on to
my room what I wanted to show you guys
was this actually this is the current
pending dresser there might be some
things missing but as you guys can see
it is stacked and stacked and stacked
lots and lots of stuff that I have to
make reviews on get videos out to you
guys some of them might not even be
reviews they might just be like some
concepts that I have to do like -
comparing and whatnot but there's a lot
of stuff here over here I've got the
surface and I've got a special video
with the surface all I am is waiting on
Ari to do it
ain't that right babe yeah I'm talking
to you I'm talking I'm telling the subs
that I've got a special video on the
surface that I kind of need a beautiful
young lady's help with alright you heard
it first guys mater says she'll do it
soon so let's dog her about that make
sure I she doesn't it but yeah this is
all the stuff that I have to do a lot of
work a lot of different headphones and
products and yada yada you guys will see
all this on the channel soon and uh oh
yeah there's also this thing this
thing's cool
this is the board I write my schedule on
where I'll you know have the list of all
the products that I'm going to be
reviewing for the week I don't have
anything on there yet but oh one thing
that I'm going to be reviewing for sure
this week so if you guys have been
waiting on it it's going to be this guy
the power beats to the wireless ones I
know some of you would like to rip my
head off because I haven't reviewed this
yet but this week promise I'll probably
drop it on Wednesday so if you're
waiting for that Wednesday that's all
you have to wait that's how long you'll
have to wait for my review I promise
so pretty much this is it afford needs
to get worked on you guys will see all
the stuff to come into the channel

more than that I have the Moto 360

them coming but I have the first one
