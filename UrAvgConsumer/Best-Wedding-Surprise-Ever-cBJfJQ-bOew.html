or passionately said will never convey
how truly deep my love for you is so
please take everything I say and
multiply it by infinity no questions I
know Scoob there are a couple of moments
in my life that I remember vividly and
one of them with unison we've known each
other for more than 11 years but it
feels like a lifetime our friendship
took off quickly and we've been
inseparable ever since
so you can go I remember being in
Midwood high school's basement next to
the music classroom see I remember the
pie boy blue to his t-mobile Sidekick
texting away
I remember your white do-rag on behind
your white hat I even remember the super
quick hello you gave me when we were
introduced and then you returned my back
to your sidekick what I'll never forget
it's how I felt she looked again and now
he's like hello I caught a glimpse of
the kind of eyes and the sweetest smile
so I could sell then even underneath all
the baggy clothing and headgear that you
were different
you're good and I was right so
I gave you this ring as a symbol as a
symbol for all to see and no for all to
see n now that you love and our love
that you love and our love to up les
genius to a blessed union that shall
endure for eternity
the shall endure for eternity
you
comes far too T was the word
of your serenity
I still remember so one of the best
things about you is you make the nerdy
pool and I can't wait to experience the
nerdy still weird and fun things Japan
and Life Path offer
here's to checking off two things off
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
