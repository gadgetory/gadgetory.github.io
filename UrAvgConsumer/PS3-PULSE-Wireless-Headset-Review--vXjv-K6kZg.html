consumer and today I'm going to be
reviewing the PlayStation Paul's
wireless headset probably my favorite
wireless headset / headphones ever so
let's not wasting your time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the ps3 pulse wireless headset and if
you're a basehead stop watching this
video and go buy it right now still here
alright fine I guess I'll give you a
review if you can't tell by now I'm a
huge fan of this headset it's probably
my favorite thing of the whole year as
far as gadgets and electronics goes I
think it's got a really sleek design it
looks great definitely a bump up from
the previous version it's got everything
your pretty much need for a gaming
headset and I was very very happy with
it I definitely think the style is one
of the best that Sony has come out with
for headsets usually they have like the
smaller skinnier versions and the big
clunky version that was the predecessor
to this one and it's got some great
features to boot but first let's talk a
bit about comfort the top of the head
then actually has a subtle amount of
cushioning as you can see it's only 2
little strips but it doesn't take away
from the comfort factor the ear cup
cushions are made of a tough leather ish
material but it is still comfortable
nonetheless you'll also find a slot in
the back of the ear cup that allows your
ears to sit comfortably inside which is
perfect for long listening or gaming
sessions and although I am a huge fan of
these ear cups they're shiny on the
outside so they are fingerprint magnets
so if you're someone who's OCD about
their devices that is something you're
going to have to be careful of and aside
from that the glossy finish does tend to
get scratched pretty easily as you can
see here it's got a big scuff mark going
from the side all the way down so very
unhappy about that but with that stuff
aside let's talk a bit about the
features and functions of this headset
there you saw the power switching here
you have this slider to adjust the
volume between your game and the voices
of those in your party
moving on we see we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone input and a mini
USB port and of course we have a mic
mute button for the built-in mic and the
slider for the volume controls and all
that is found on just one ear cup let's
take a quick look at the other side the
first thing you'll notice is the 7.1
virtual surround sound on and off switch
followed by the mode button that allows
you to change the sound and bass
depending on what you're currently using
the headset for and then of course my
favorite feature of the entire headset
the base impact slider this is where all
the amazing head rattling action is
controlled and is where the real
differentiating experience comes from in
addition to all those features you get
on-screen notifications with your ps3
that lets you know some of the things
are toggling through you will be
prompted with a notification when you
first turn on the headset and also when
you're turning on and off the virtual
surround sound you'll also have an
indicator for your volume and batteries
so there won't be any surprises when
you're running out of a charge with all
the features on the headset these
notifications do seem pretty limited but
it's still cool that the ps3 shows them
at all and because Sony promotes that
this headset can be used as everyday
headphones it includes the cable so you
can use it with your mobile device
computer etc but what's also cool about
this cable is that it has features
beyond just that here we have the
adapter that you can plug into a
computer or your ps3 to get the wireless
headset to work wirelessly and it has
the pretty awesome ability to get into a
power source and use the auxiliary cable
that it comes with into the side of the
adapter and plugged into a device that
isn't USB ready
and still use your headphones wirelessly
with that device as you can see here I
use it with an iPad Mini
and the material that'd be your keys are
actually made out of is very similar to
the beats Mixr so beautifu miliar with
that got the same kind of feel now of
course to talk about how this works in
real life I've had nothing but great
experiences using it for gaming movies
or listening to music in games
it really does liven things up with the
bass impact just as DualShock would for
your controller even watching movies is
quite the experience with these on and
the virtual surround sound really does
help give it more depth and draws you
into the movie more so than normal and
if you want to update experience you can
add some 3d into the mix and just feel
like you're in a whole new world and I
might be over selling it there but it
really does sound great no matter what
you're using it for and it definitely
does liven up your experience and now of
course to talk about my favourite reason
for using these headphones and that's
the list to music when I first tried
these I was honestly shocked at what you
could do with them and now like I said
before if your bass head this is an
automatic must-have in my opinion that
is if you're okay with the looks and
everything else of course but if you are
this is going to be a great buy even if
you are in a basehead these work great
as headphones and offer some really
clear sound I've listened to a wide onra
of music and this will definitely
satisfy any average consumers needs in
the music department allow offering a
ton of other bonuses as well one thing I
must say though is that the battery life
isn't stellar but it was definitely good
enough for me
and it's unfortunate but the headphones
don't come with a USB cable so you'd
probably have to use the USB cable that
came with your ps3 and if you don't have
a ps3 a mini USB cable isn't really hard
to find but it still is unfortunate that
it didn't come with one luckily you
could still use the headphones with the
cable that's provided even if the
battery dies the battery will simply be
powering the bass impact noise
cancellation and the virtual surround
sound features but I think it's safe to
say you'll get about five hours of
battery life on a single charge and that
may be a bit of a problem for those of
you whole game
for really long periods of time but
overall I must say that I'm quite happy
with this headset and would recommend it
to any average consumer who's looking
into purchasing it and that pretty much
wraps up my review guys if you enjoyed
it please feel free to hit that thumbs
up button comment and subscribe also if
you do pick up this headset be sure to
let me know how you like it down below
till the next video guys this is your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
