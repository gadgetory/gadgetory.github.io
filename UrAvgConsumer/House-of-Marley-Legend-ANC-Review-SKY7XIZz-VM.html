consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the House of Marley legend
ANC headphones
icees I made a video that covered a
bunch of their products and this was the
most requested to see a review so let's
not waste any time
screw right into it and alright guys
here we have the legend ANC now of
course ANSI stands for active
noise-cancelling so you do have that
feature here but before we get into that
let's talk a little bit about the design
and the build quality now these are one
of my favorite looking at House of
Marley headphones and that's because it
offers a nice smooth modern look while
still having that earthy feel with these
wooden accents now this is on a
combination I would have ever thought of
but it actually turns out to look really
nice now when it comes to the durability
and feel of these headphones you
actually get a very sturdy build here as
well as a very nice premium feel to it
as well I was able to twist it around a
bit and that really feel like I was
about to snap it or break it which is
always a plus in the areas around the
ear cups and the hinges are made out of
recycled aluminum which helps to give it
that really sturdy feel because it has
that like metal texture to it so it
definitely feels like something really
really solid now you might be noticing a
trend here that house model likes to use
these earthy and recycled materials and
if you're someone who's eco conscious
this would definitely score some points
with you now we know these feel good in
the hand but how does it feel when it's
actually on I found it to be extremely
comfortable the ear cup cushions as well
as the headband cushion are very soft
and very plush and they're made out of a
nice leather material so it's got a
really nice feel to it now one thing I
did notice when using these is down my
ear set really close to the diaphragm
when I had them on and that caused me to
want to take them off after about an
hour to give my ears a bit of a breather
now that setia did interrupt some of my
longer listening sessions so if you plan
to wear these for a long period of time
that's something you might want to keep
in mind now let's talk a little bit
about the accessories that you get when
you
this you'll get a hardshell travel case
which I'm a fan of because I prefer the
hard shell cases over the travel pouches
because I feel like they offer a bit
more protection and this is definitely
going to do the trick it also offers a
carabiner clip if you want to add this
onto your book bag or belt loop however
you want to walk around with it one
thing that I would have liked to see
with the travel case though would have
been a pouch on the inside to put your
cables in so that when you open these
you don't have to worry about cables
falling out or anything
and you'll also get two cables with
these one is for audio and the other is
to charge it since these are active
noise-cancelling now these are two very
nice thick rated cables so you don't
have to worry about them getting tangled
when you put them away but I do have
some gripes with the audio cable on one
side you do have your typical audio
input but what's really cool about this
is where you typically have those three
black lines they've replaced it with a
red yellow and green which is really
cool because those are like the Rasta
colors and it's a nice little attention
to detail but the other side has a micro
USB input ah I'm not crazy about this
because it kind of makes this a
proprietary cable and I'm not a fan of
proprietary cables because if something
happens to it you got to get in touch
with the manufacturer or buy one I'm not
really a fan of that now the most people
who take care of their things this is
not gonna be an issue whatsoever I'm
just a fan of regular 3.5 to 3.5 inputs
so that you can swap them out with some
cables that you might have already but I
am very happy that the audio cable
includes an inline remote so you can
control your volume play and pause and
it has a mic if you want to answer calls
or record anything so that's always a
nice touch now these are active
noise-cancelling so they come with a
rechargeable battery built inside and
they last you about 20 hours of
listening which is actually really good
it's pretty much the standard that I
come to expect 20 plus hours and it
actually performs to that standard
pretty well in charge time's running bad
I can put these on there for a couple of
hours and be good to go for a long
listening session now even though these
are active noise-cancelling and they've
got a power switch and a battery and you
gotta charge it you don't have to use it
whatsoever if you want to listen to your
music which is always a huge bonus for
me I love when manufacturers do this and
one thing that I did
is that the sound quality doesn't change
whether you have active noise-cancelling
on or off now this is really awesome
because usually when you turn off active
noise-cancelling you take a hit and
sound quality because the amps aren't
pushing as much juice towards them so it
actually is really nice here that when
you turn these off you're not missing
out on sound quality whatsoever so
definitely a thumbs up tomorrow for that
and now I know you guys want to hear
about the sound quality and actually
these performed very nicely for me now
I'm someone who loves a lot of bass and
he's actually been really well in that
department if you're someone who really
enjoys having a lot of thumping bass
this definitely has you covered
now songs with that extra bass is nice
this was definitely a good look but for
songs that didn't these actually also
performed very well now another thing
that I notice about these headphones is
that they were a bit louder than some of
the others I compared it to which is
always a nice thing because you don't
have to throw up your volume all the way
to start hearing a lot of the good stuff
of course you know that means vocals
came in very clearly it didn't sound
muffled by the bass at all so overall it
was a very nice rounded experience and I
definitely enjoyed it
these are definitely a great pair of
headphones for casual music listening
especially if you're someone who likes
to travel you get that active
noise-cancelling to keep all those other
sounds out but I definitely think that
the legend ANC's deserve a spot on my
shelf what some of my favorite
headphones and boom clap toys you guys
