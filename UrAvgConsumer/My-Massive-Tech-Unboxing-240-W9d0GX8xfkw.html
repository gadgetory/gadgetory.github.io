pretty big mouse pad this is what the
light goes through so actually a pretty
cool design so you guys can absolutely
expect to see this in a future video I

go for this guy I feel like I know what
this is but I could be wrong
yes so right here we've got a phone from
Oppo this right here is the Oppo Reno is
that phone with the ten times zoom and
hopefully we got a very special color
inside of here on the moment of truth is
it right did they get it right
Oh way that color this is a beautiful
phone guys my goodness so for those of
you who don't know this is one of
Apple's latest phones so this is a
pretty big screen let's see so you see
it's a full display no not it has a
slight chin at the bottom but like I
said I'm gonna show you what's special
about this phone and that is of course
the camera front facing camera a you see
that pop up camera but it comes out at
an angle so it's got this really
interesting look to it hmm you see that
now another thing that's special about
this camera is like I said it has that
ten times zoom so if you want let's say
that picture of Titus in the back two
times six times ten times zoom right
there
so you're not gonna see the quality of
your image degrade as you zoom in
because it's using the lens to do that
but all right I will play with this a
little bit more shout-out to Apple for
sending this out this is just a
beautiful phone mic mmm holo real quick
let's see what else we got in the box oh
it has a case so you could throw this in
and I like that the top is cut out so
that the pop up camera can just come out

see what they've got like which one oh
this one's for you you know you can hold
on companies let me talk to you for a
second this is my channel now miss it a
floppy disc cuz stranger things takes
place in the 80s and 1985 so right here
we've got a gift card for Netflix with
six three months so shout out to anybody
who

comes with an Xbox game pass ultimate

happens Oh a microsd card was inside of
the floppy disk alright so what else

Xbox game pass and it looks like you got
a got a hoodie there you go
this box what's the name the nimble team
alright so this is from nimble oh they
make cases now iPhone 10's max now
what's cool about nimble is that they're
an environmentally friendly company so
as you can see everything here is
recyclable I love the color scheme for
this company Oh interesting
this case is made of recycled plastic
bottles that is awesome so plastic
bottles recycled into this will throw up
some b-roll so you guys can see all of
the different cases that they make this
is a company I could get behind I love
what they're doing alright so let's get
this big one right here alright so it's
upside down
so we have a suitcase over here it is a
straight-up Mophie suitcase - it says
mochi right there it's got the branding
I will say Mophie does a pretty good job
with packaging all this is extravagant
so we got cables so we got the power
station hub over here so this can just
get plugged into the wall and it's like
a portable charger nice 6100 milliamp
hours and these are power station minis
so these are really small and we got a
big boy over here now I've seen
something like this before this will
probably charge up like a math book or
something it's just like a sleeping mask
so you can sleep on the plane while
you're traveling okay sure
so over here we it is a pillow
arrey arrey loves pillows look you got
some multi branding on the side Mophie
loves you there you go
if you are traveling you need some juice
no fees got some options all right let's
grab this guy over here is from Amazon
oh nice we got the ring view cam so for
those of us in III would appreciate this
because I I've lived in an apartment all
my life and this would just be awesome
being the tech lover that I am but this
is cool this is a good buy I didn't even
know they made this alright so we got
another DHL bag over here oh I know what
this is this is the gamepad digital kick
so this looks like a really really tiny
like ultrabook or something it has a
built-in webcam keyboard USB ports holy
mess this is a laptop this thing is
really running Windows I'll figure out
the specs and post up a little something
on the screen so you guys can see it but
this is pretty amazing this is a really
really small laptop so I read just
looked it up she says this isn't out
just yet but there's an IndieGoGo page
so if you're interested in finding out
more about it I'll have a link down
below in the description for you guys to
check it out all right so what do we got
here Oh nomad
cool nice little nomads ha and they sent
over their new USBC to lightning cable
Apple has been the only one to sell
usb-c to lightning cables which are the
only kind of cables you can use to fast
charge your iPhone and now Nomad has
come out with their own version which is
going to be a lot more durable than what
Apple currently sells their cables are
good they're so good they're made out of
Kevlar so for those of you who don't
know that's gonna withstand thousands
and thousands of bends and this is a
long cable - oh this is perfect this is
it this is all you need baby I'm telling
you guys if you are not familiar with
fast charging your iPhones get familiar
it is absolutely a game-changer trust me
mark more words you AC all right so
let's grab this guy over here riding
innovation I hate big boxes FYI so we've
got another electric skateboard this
thing has an app that's how you know
it's official when it has an app just a
real deal all right
oh that color though that looks good
Oh swappable batteries is ip66
water-resistant GPS location tracking
this says you better wear a helmet I
will not be on one of these without a
helmet again for those of you who don't
know had a couple a couple of boo-boos
I'm gonna show them that so I got this
guy recently on July 4th
thanks to my booster boy with no helmet
I have a lot of a lot of breezes right
now folks and I did hit my head so I
understand the warning about wearing a
helmet this feels like quality right
here Wow
yeah right but look at these wheels do
you see this I don't even want to write
it in the street I feel like I've messed
these up I wanna see what this remote
looks like oh snap I like this so you
just kind of go up and down like this
of course we got our charger so we've
got international plugs and all that so
there's actually two versions this one
right here is the premium version and
there's a normal version as well I'm
gonna wait until I stop limping to get
on this thing and give it a try
and that'll be with a helmet wear your
helmet folks it's pretty important don't
put up a bit of a boom boom boom boom
boom boom boom oh wait my address is on
this but yes you know what time it is
y'all got a little something from the
folks over at Gundam Planet favorite
place to buy Gundams oh oh this is
favorite part of the video right here
check it out we got some awesome Gundams
here this is from gundam unicorn this is
the banshee this is a composite model
just so you guys know you don't have to
really build these they come pretty
pretty close to done and we've got two
of them this one right here is the
Phoenix oh no I got something else in
here for my Zoid lovers out there you
young bucks might not know about this
one but this guy was a pain in the butt
in the anime desert fury so I've got
some awesome stuff here don't touch that
re maybe not touch my goods so what next
what next okay so right here we got some
USB cable from bullets and these are
quick charge supporting cables these
actually look pretty good and durable so
thanks to them this little box has the
new samsung galaxy a 50 now the 850 is
an interesting phone because it has some
pretty solid specs it's a mid tier phone
but even a mid to your phone can have a
triple camera system like we see with a
lot of flagships so check this out you
can see this it's got a pretty
interesting design Samsung's all about
those prism effects right now but here's
what makes this phone special 350 bucks
350 bucks and what you get is a six
point four inch Super AMOLED display
Full HD plus and you also get 64 gigs of
storage and of course that's expandable
and it's also got four thousand milliamp
hours of battery life so if you guys are
interested in seeing me do maybe like a
real day in the life or something let me
know what to comment down below this
definitely seems like an interesting
phone to me I like it let's see we got
another box here this is something I got
from peak design so people design makes
them awesome
camera gear a lot of backpacks and
pouches well we've got right here is a
pouch so I bought this with the tech
survival kit in mind and for those of
you who know that serious you know I
take some serious pride in that one so
we've got some compartments here oh snap
even more spots big design always makes
good stuff and this is definitely high
quality that's one being extra get to
you so right here I picked up a
Bluetooth adapter for the Nintendo
switch this will give you the ability to
connect a bluetooth headphone to your
switch a must-have but you also got to
be careful not to lose it because this
thing is small and I lost mine so I have
to replace it now also picked up this
guy and what this is is that bluetooth
adapter for the GameCube controller so
all you have to do is plug in your
GameCube controller into this and you'll
be able to play it with your switch even
if your aren't next to a TV now that's
important because you usually need like
a USB adapter to make your GameCube
controller work but you can do it
wirelessly with this guy Malcolm I feel
like you could appreciate something like
this because you can take that GameCube
controller anywhere with your switch
I like this we're gonna give it a try
Malcolm will let us know how it works
all right don't be extra don't be
that's funny I got a steelseries
keyboard I ordered this a little while
ago but it's funny that you got me the
mousepad so this right here is the
SteelSeries apex 7 now this looks like a
really cool keyboard I had to get my
hands on it it's got a cool little OLED
screen at the top so that you can put
little things up there all you can do
all kinds of things like see your music
discord games it's awesome but I want to
know what this is cuz I don't remember
this at all
okay I was not expecting this big a box
but it makes sense so I just picked up a
camera lens so right here we've got the
Canon 100 millimeter lens so this is a
macro lens when I want those really
tight shots if you're gonna buy any kind
of camera equipment there's always like
bundles available where you can spend
the amount that this cost and get a
bunch of stuff for free camera equipment
purchasing tip number one always look
for the bundle
alright so we are finally winding down
but this thing I know has just been
staring us in the face we are just gonna
quickly open it up I just want to show
you guys what a 49 inch what is this
even called all is this regular ultra
wide that's surprising but it's like a
super ultra wide monitor let's just
check it out real quick this is kind of
ridiculous so this is LG's 49 inch
display samsung also makes a display
just like this but this is what a 49
inch display looks like this is like
super ultra wide this is this is huge so
I'm putting it down now we're gonna move
on to the next so we're down to the
final four so this is the base station
by Nomad I really really like this it's
the air power that we never got but this
one is actually really good it
wirelessly charges multiple devices it's
Apple watch Edition so you can put your
Apple watch
you can put your iPhone and heck you can
even put your new air pods as well if
you want to do that oh yes I forgot
about these so these right here
are the bows 700 now this is something I
am very very interested in because I've
been rocking the Sony WH 1000 X mark 3s
for a while those are the noise
cancelling headphone King right now and
we are going to see if this can dethrone
it it's a nice case like a leather
that's clean right there oh I like that
okay I like how it completely goes
around your ear both always has these
nice oval ear cups that just sit so
perfectly completely around your ear and
this one is no different the only thing
that's different with this new headband
design as you guys can see you're not
gonna fold this guy anymore definitely
expect a review on this guy
oh ho J this is what you showed me man
the 301 wireless power bank so this guy
can charge air pods and Apple watch and
an iphone all at the same time so check
this out built-in app watch charger over
here built-in air pods charger right and
you have your USB port right here this
is cool I'm not gonna lie it feels very
cheap jail no where you found this man
but the whole idea of it is really
really cool this was a little bit higher
quality we'd have a winner on our hands
Nomad if you're listening make this they
probably don't have a patent just make
it alright so this is the last thing
from the peel box so we have no idea if
we're gonna end it off with a bang well
if this is gonna be completely bad bang
or bust
let's see so this is from someone I met
at a oneplus event Dwight he actually
has a drone racing startup and he sent
me some stuff so for those of you who
don't know about drone racing drone
racing is basically like it sounds
racing for drones but the way they're
operated is that operator has these
goggles on where they can see where the
drone is going it's pretty much like
they're driving the drone but remotely
that is going to be a fun experience I'm
gonna try this out when we get home I
could put this in the backyard and give
it a shot but this is cool Dwight thanks
for sending this over so
Eagle drones I'll have them linked down
below in the description
you guys could check it out I am glad we
did not end this on a bust this is
definitely cool but that about wraps it
up for this video guys we had so much
stuff 24 was feels like the biggest one
yet easily so huge shout out to all the
companies who sent something over all
the companies who sent something over to
Ari she's not the star of the show or
anything but it's cool that y'all do
that I hope but if you guys enjoy the
video be the cool guy or girl that cuz
this video a thumbs up I'll catch you
guys in the next one
tole Dennis your average consumer base
