consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the brand new
Playstation 4 DualShock 4 controller
games top is selling some accessories a
little bit earlier a head of the
PlayStation 4 launch and I decided to
pick one up so let's not waste any time
scare right into it and all right guys
here we have the PlayStation 4 Dual
Shock for wireless controller and as you
guys can see this is from Gamestop they
are selling some of the accessories a
bit early
like the controllers the camera as well
as a couple of games so you can nab
those early if you just can't wait for
the ps4 these retails for 60 bucks um
it's got a couple of upgrades we'll get
into that but for now let's just unbox
this and then we'll talk about some of
the changes that have been made with
this controller so we've got some tape
at the top slice this through with the
unboxing knife and boom so that's all
done let's pop this bad boy out so we
can put the box over here lift this up
here's the controller so there's really
not much to some boxing guys you have
the controller as well as some
information here a manual I'm sure so
pretty much that's all you get and here
it is this is the ps4 controller feels
pretty good in the hand guys I'm
actually really liking this I this just
builds up the excitement quite a bit
more so let me give you guys a quick
close up of what to expect here and all
right guys so here we have the
PlayStation button at the bottom this
will probably take you home
of course you've got the analog sticks
which are very very smooth um of course
you got your regular PlayStation buttons
and here we have the L&amp;amp;R buttons as you
can see it's a little thinner at the top
they're more like triggers now so that's
pretty cool and up here you'll see that
there's a share button as well as an
options button and Sony's really trying
to push the social side of things with
the police stick PlayStation 4 they're
really going to be trying to integrate
like you know communication will
probably see some social media in there
as well so they're really pushing the
social ass
of things and the share button is going
to be able to share video clips that you
know of your gameplay that's always
being recorded like the last couple of
I'm not sure how long but I think the
last bit of footage from your gameplay
can always be shared I don't know if
certain developers have to enable that
or if that's just a ps4 feature
altogether but that's going to be really
cool if your friend is stuck at a
certain part they'll be able to see it
if you share it to them that's what
Sony's putting out in commercials and
whatnot so that's pretty cool um up top
here you have the LED light that will be
picked up by the PlayStation camera you
can also do pretty cool things depending
on the game that you're playing and but
the developers intend like I believe
Killzone if your health is running low
though the bar changes colors like if
you're running really low on health it
will turn red so you can do pretty cool
stuff with it it'll be pretty nice to
see how they incorporate this light bar
into gameplay there's also a microUSB
right here port so that you can charge
your device um discharges in about two
hours for a full charge and the battery
life is just about as long as the
PlayStation 3 controller so no surprises
here another thing you might notice is
that there's a speaker right here on the
PlayStation 4 so games will be able to
send sound to your controller so you'll
have a more of an experience you'll be
able to hear things on the control that
you probably won't hear on your actual
TV so that's really nice and up here we
have a capacitive touch pad so you can
fling things you can you know click it
you can do all kinds of stuff you could
drag drop it's going to be pretty cool I
really want to see how game developers
choose to incorporate this into gameplay
because you know we're used to always
using these I'm not sure how they're
going to you know throw this into the
gameplay it's going to be pretty
interesting to see but I can tell you
guys just from holding it this doesn't
seem like out of the way it doesn't seem
like you have to go like this or
anything like that I'm pretty sure
people will be using their thumbs to
start you know doing whatever they need
to do on this touch pad and everything
just feels pretty nice at the bottom you
have your headset piece where you can
throw in your headset and I believe the
PlayStation 4 comes with one it's a mono
headset
so you'll only be able to hear in one
ear I think people are pretty used to
that I'm not sure what this extension
pieces for it'll probably be for like
little accessories for the actual
controller but it's going to be pretty
interesting you're going to be able to
chat with people through this um and
that's really about it guys I hear that
Sony has decreased the latency for its
controller so it's going to be more
responsive also there's supposed to be
an improvement on the actual vibration
so the rumble feature that's going to be
pretty impressive as well hopefully but
just our first impressions I can tell
you guys it feels pretty good in the
hands you're going to get used to this
right away comparing it to the
PlayStation 3 controller you know it
looks pretty similar this just seems a
little more thin seems a little more
streamlined when you take this off
really quick and yeah there you go there
you have it side by side arm this is
comfortable PlayStation controllers I've
always been pretty comfortable to me but
something about this I like a bit more
it just feels a lot nicer I've been told
that this works with the PlayStation 3
as well as your PC so you can use these
reviews basic functions as well like as
far as the buttons go you won't be able
to use the touchpad of course and I'm
sure probably not the share button but
overall this is it guys let me know if
you guys are getting the PlayStation 4 I
know I can't wait to get it um if you
are getting it what games are you
pre-ordering I'd love to play with you
guys if you don't know my PSN name it's
sacred fire 50 so be sure to add me
anyone who wants to I'll probably get a
ton of invites now but that's ok I'll
try to add as many people as I can and
