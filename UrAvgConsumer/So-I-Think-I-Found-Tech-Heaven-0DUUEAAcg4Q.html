what's going on guys the average
consumer and today we are at Micro
Center a store with a ton of computer
parts and electronics I came here a
couple of weeks ago looking for some PC
parts and it blew my mind so I decided
to make a video about it and no they did
not sponsor this video well the figure
looking size alright guys so we are in
micro Center right now but let me tell
you why I'm even making a video about
this so two weeks ago I was actually
looking for computer parts because you
guys know I'm building my new computer
aka leek for now that's the codename and
when I came here to looking for computer
parts I'm not gonna lie to you guys
it blew my mind now there's other great
stores like bnh but B&amp;amp;H is all the way
in new york city so it's a little hard
to get to sometimes Micro Center
actually has 25 different locations and
look just right here random section you
got tons and tons of keyboards you don't
see this kind of selection and Best Buy
and it's actually really cool to me this
is my baby right here the k95 RGB
platinum I love this keyboard oh this
thing's expensive though and even if you
want to go for something that's not as
expensive you got Logitech options now
what I like here is that over here
you've got like your razor and you've
got Corsair over on the side these are
like the popular brands but then there
are some of these other ones so you got
HyperX people no HyperX but ducky
channel I've never heard of but these
are things that I probably wouldn't take
a look at online but seeing them in
front of me actually kind of changed
that and honestly guys it's when I got
to this kind of section does like okay I
need to make a video about this place
backpacks for days like this is a dope
selection ID
more backpacks than I'm used to seeing
anywhere like honestly they have all the
kind of stuff that I talk about and use
for my setups on a daily
faces a lot of this stuff I was under
the impression that you know you can
only really order it online but it's
like right in your face here and they've
got stuff for the kids you know we let
the kids this is you know you know me
right now we're in the audio section we
look at that gaming headset but they got
the good stuff locked up look at this
they got the SteelSeries we got the Ark
this five Ark this pro league game Zach
I just covered those good stuff and hey
they got a lot of ear buds matrix
Wireless in ear buds for 15 bucks how do
these sound Dan that's a big old remote
though I was wondering about to pick
this up and just see how it sounds
that's a big remote every time I see
this mouse right here the dark core from
Corsair I'm gonna bring up how I Trump
Ari in our shopping challenge I don't
forget never forget and here you have a
bunch of Mouse's the asset Mouse's you
can actually say Mouse's when you're
talking about PC peripherals
but Mouse's mice whatever you want to
call it they got a lot of options here
honestly every kind of computer part
that you could possibly be looking for
they've got it there's something about
Republic of gamers that just keeps
catching my eye I think it's their color
scheme but this is this 30 bucks see
this is a problem I'm touring this store
with no goal which means money will be
spent I know there are a ton of USB hubs
out there but for one place to carry so
many from so many different
manufacturers that's impressive
now I think you can easily say there's a
ton of peripherals here but they've also
got computers as well well that's like
their thing they sell computers computer
components so they even got monitors
laptops and straight up PCs so we're in
the monitor section right now guys but
look at this Samsung monitor
this is the big 49 inch monitor that's
just insane all right can you imagine
having multiple of these just not having
to even for me that feels like too much
so over here we've got some pre-built
pcs I've never seen this thing looks
like a tank wheel and they have an apple
section as well so it's not like you
just have Microsoft or you know guys
like asus or a sir
you got Apple as well I guess if you're
going for like the more standard office
gear you go with the Dell and what's
cool about this is you got folks over
here that are willing to help you get
your parts together I actually use some
of the guys here to figure out what my
part list would look like and honestly
it was a huge help so we've got RAM over
here
I believe storage over here and even
more RAM thought there's tons of storage
you got power supplies over here we've
got fans cooling over here some of the
water cooling that I was looking at over
here you got PC cases this is the PC
case that I actually went with in a
different color this is the corsair 570
X and then you've got graphics cards
over there down that side so you're
trying to build a PC I mean they got it
okay time for my second purchase
got to get some air dusters you can
never have too much I'm telling you so
remember I was telling you I got help
from someone here this is actually Nick
he's the guy who helped me pretty much
get my part list together to kind of
wrap my head around what's going into my
PC so you guys have got these charts
right here you mind letting people know
what it they're actually for him these
are parts to see how competitive we are
with our prices
from Amazon new way show us how
competitive we are with our CPUs over
there we have hard drives RAM and
solid-state drives
shows how much savings should be getting
from micro setting instead of knowing or
Amazon getting somewhere online I think
that's one of the biggest benefits of
coming into somewhere like Micro Center
when you want something immediately and
they've got it and it's not at a bad
price why not just pick it up right hand
in there give it up for Nick everybody
and that's what I like guys that's what
kind of blew me away not only did they
have like great inventory but I was able
to sit down and actually talk to someone
about what my PC should look like what
it should have in terms of the parts
that's me that that went a long way now
one section that we didn't really talk
about are these desktop speakers now
it'd be really impressive if they have
these logitech speakers that just came
they got it right here so these are the
g5 sixties of course they have RGB
lights so I wanted to pick these up see
how they sound see if they're worth the
money they're like 200 bucks yeah let's
do this all right you know what who's
getting out of hand I've got a cart now
I definitely shouldn't be picking up
anything else Ari will kill me but again
we got to give a huge shout out to
today's sponsor Nord VPN now I'm pretty
glad I could partner up with Nord VPN
because with everything being on the
internet these days I'm spending way
more time online to do everything from
hating banking and handling other things
that require sensitive information Nord
VPN provides a virtual private network
with military-grade encryption to
protect your data from potential online
threats and in 2018 I'm telling you the
need for that is growing more and more
and this is especially important for
someone like me who's always jumping on
public Wi-Fi networks whether it's from
hotels coffee shops or even restaurants
with a VPN I know I'll be covered and
Nord VPN allows you to protect yourself
whether you own windows mac OS iOS or
even android and they're offering my
viewers 77% off a three-year plan so if
you want to get yourself protected head
over to Nord VPN comm slash consumer and
use the coupon code consumer and check
how to get yourself those savings but
I'll have links down below in the
description so it's pretty much gonna be
it guys hopefully you enjoyed it like I
said the only reason why I did this
video is because I came in here looking
for PC parts and ended up finding a
really cool store I know I probably
should have known about this ages ago so
take away my grade card for a week
I got an aircar suspension but this is a
really cool place if you have one in
your area
I would definitely Google Maps to see if
there's one nearby there's 25 locations
but you'll want to see if there's one
near you if you want to see if you can
get your hands on tech that you probably
couldn't get anywhere else unless you
order it online but that's about it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video if you
did leave the pool guy go that gives
this video a thumbs up til next one guys
