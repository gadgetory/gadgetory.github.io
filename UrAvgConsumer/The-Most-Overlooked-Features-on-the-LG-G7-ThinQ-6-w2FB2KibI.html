consumer and today we've got a special
unboxing of the brand new LG g7 think
you and huge shout out to LG for not
only sponsoring today's video but
getting us one of these early so when
you check it out
so let's jump right into the box now my
version is a bit early so yours may be
different when it comes to the actual
retail packaging so let's see we've got
an LG microfiber cloth LG knows what I
like oh we've also got let's see we've
got the LG G 7 right here but we've also
got some other stuff inside
LG's promise for great customer service
and all that and they're not only
talking about customer service but if
you register your device you get a 2
year warranty and some paperwork inside
of this box and a sim ejector tool so
everything you need to get your phone
all set up right inside of here as well
as your power brick and USBC cable so
here's the g7 and it's been a while
since I last held it and I got to say
guys this the screen looks great and it
feels pretty solid in the hand and the
version we're looking at here is the
Aurora black but there's also a few
other colors like the Platinum gray
Moroccan blue and raspberry rose so from
the phone we got a 6.1 inch quad HD plus
full vision display which actually looks
really clean and it's also got a 3000
milliamp hour battery and that beautiful
beautiful headphone jack so with this
guy you also get a high 5 quad back and
a few other special sound features now
when it comes to audio I feel like LG is
one of the only companies that are
really paying attention to us music
lovers by keeping the headphone jack and
even providing a high five back for that
headphone jack so he can get really good
sound quality out of your headphones but
they've also got some other cool
features even if you're not using your
headphones so one of those features is
called LG boom box so of course we've
got to try the boom box feature while
we're outdoors I currently have it at
max volume and of course I'm going to
put it down on this surface so that we
can see how it enhances the bass when
it's on a surface like this maybe your
hands are preoccupied maybe you're
eating a hot dog
we'll see how it sounds so right now
I've got some Bruno Mars ready to go
and this sounds really good for just
being a smartphones so when we do it on
a surface that's nice or something like
this I feel like you don't need a
Bluetooth speaker or anything like that
to enhance the sound I can come out to
the park or whatever eat a hot dog here
enjoy some music and it plays very
loudly
now the g7 also has a cool feature
called super far field voice recognition
which pretty much allows you to have the
g7 far away in a room and it'll still be
able to pick up your voice through its
microphones now right now I've got it in
my backpack a bit far away from me right
now and so I'm gonna call out to it hey
play some Bruno Mars let's see how it
does just like that that's but that's a
pretty good fees so even though it's a
little bit farther away the mic is
buried inside of this pocket still pick
me up pretty well heard exactly what I
requested now those sound features are
great balloon we're outdoors we've also
tested what I think is probably the most
overlooked feature the super bright
display and this booster phones
brightness to a thousand minute which is
a huge upgrade when comparing it to
something like last year's g6 or even
other phones now another feature we had
to try while we were outside is the AI
camera with this feature you're able to
point your camera at something and you
can watch the phone try to recognize
what's in front of it and provide what
it thinks are the best settings for the
picture based on these characteristics
and the AI camera can even pick up cute
pets like cookie and when you tap the
icon identifying what's in the frame you
get access to filters so you can switch
up the look of your shot now I still got
some questions about people's faces but
when I get more time with it I'll see
how that does so you definitely got to
keep an eye out for the real day in the
life video but overall guys the g7 is a
very solid phone in 2018 but what I
actually love about what LG is doing
here is that it's setting yourself apart
from other manufacturers by really
focusing on audio for us music lovers I
mean they continue to keep the headphone
jack and improve on it so I love that
now what do we got to talk about is the
knock on the
display is 2018 so this thing is here
but LG does offer a lot of customization
if you don't like the look of it you can
completely remove it or dress it up to
match your exact tastes so while it is
here on the g7 it's not really a big
deal but I want to know what you guys
think of the g7 let me know as a comment
down below what your favorite feature is
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
