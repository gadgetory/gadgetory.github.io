consumer
so recently AT&amp;amp;T invited me out to an
event where I got to check out some
really cool tech for the first time so
today I'm gonna be showing you guys some
of the most interesting things I saw
while I was there first up is the galaxy
s6 active I got some time to play around
with his phone and to be honest I was
pretty surprised when I got it in hand
it's pretty much like the galaxy s6 but
without the glass back and instead it
has a rubberized and tougher exterior
the s6 active feels like the s6 but with
a built-in case because if you can't
tell by the name this was made with
people who live an active lifestyle in
mind and as one of the few tech guys who
likes to use cases I actually like the
built in case like protection because it
doesn't add the bulk of a real one
it's also ip68 certified so this means
it's shock resistant dust proof and
water resistant up to one and a half
meters for up to 30 minutes
it still has a great 5.1 inch quad HD
display the same octa-core processor 3
gigs of ram and that awesome 16
megapixel camera which takes amazing
pictures and is one of the best
smartphone cameras today and last but
not least my favorite speck on the list
a much bigger 3,500 milliamp battery
that's almost a thousand milliamp more
than the standard s6 so for those of you
who are always out and about and need
that extra battery life to get you
through the day this is gonna be perfect
can we please make batteries this size
standard across all phones please one
thing it doesn't keep from the s6
however is the fingerprint scanner and
instead it has three physical buttons
for recent apps home and return the s6
active feels really good in the hand
boots to the added grip on the sides and
speaking the sides the s6 active
features a new button on the left side
that leads you to the activity zone here
you'll get all kinds of information that
will help you hikers and travelers out
there and you can also map a different
function to that button if you want to
get access to something else
the s6 active was pretty awesome and if
you guys want to see me review it
definitely leave a comment down below
next up was the 2016 Volvo xc90 t6
that's a mouthful I'm I know means a
huge car person but the tech in me loves
what I saw here this is a connected car
which means it has its own data
connection through a TNC and a car with
an internet connection
has a ton of possibilities like
streaming music from Pandora or creating
a hotspot which would be really useful
for those tablet users and another cool
feature of a connected car like this is
the ability to pull up Yelp reviews
based on the area in can you imagine
being hungry in an unfamiliar area and
being able to quickly pull up a
restaurant or view that's pretty sweet
this car also comes jam-packed with five
cameras so you can get a 360 view of
your car and its surroundings this is
amazing for people like my mom who
aren't the best at parking you can also
control all of these features and apps
through the use of the display on the
dashboard which functions similarly to a
tablet and was surprisingly just as
responsive it's a nice large display
which allows for big buttons and a very
user-friendly interface GPS navigation
looks super crisp and clear which I
could appreciate over my smart phone it
also has an amazing sound system with
built-in Bowers and Wilkins speakers and
the sound experience is completely
customizable and sounded great I also
got a chance to check out some wearables
and there are some pretty interesting
ones I've never seen before
the first one I took a look at was the
whiffing Zack TVA this is a SmartWatch
that has the look of a classic analog
watch while still being able to pull off
features like motion tracking sleep
detection and soon swimming activity
they love coursing all that information
with your smartphone using their app and
the replaceable battery lasts eight
months so you don't have to charge it
every night then there was the LG urbane
which runs Android wear I used a moto
360 for Android wear but I gotta say
it's nice to see a watch with a full
round display it has a steel body and a
pretty classic overall look
while most Android wear devices pretty
much function the same this one is a
little different because it has built-in
Wi-Fi so it doesn't have to be right
next to your phone in order to get
notifications and for the ladies there
were some stylish smart bands for you
too and this is casemates from rebecca
minkoff notification bracelet as the
name suggests you get a slight buzz on
your wrist whenever you get a call or
text from specific people you assign
this is made to be a simpler addition to
the world of wearable tech and without a
giant screen it's perfect for all those
fashionistas out there there was a ton
of cool stuff at the event but these are
the things that definitely caught my eye
so shout out to AT&amp;amp;T for inviting me to
come check this out and hopefully you
guys enjoyed the video if you did be the
cool guy that gives this video a thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one
so that is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
