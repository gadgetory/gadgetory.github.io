and today we're going to be checking out
what's in my tech travel backpack or
messenger bag but for those of you who
have never seen a tech travel backpack
video it's kind of like my gadget
backpack but these are things that I
would take with me on a day trip so
maybe if I'm going over to the city and
I need my essentials with me some things
that I'll be well-prepared with this is
the bag that I take with me now what
we're looking at over here is a 10 buzz
messenger DNA 15 slim but yeah this is a
messenger bag that isn't really a
backpack but I found that there are some
awesome messenger bags out there that
can get the job done just like a normal
backpack would so let's take a look this
is actually a really high quality bag
you keep this color though now what's
really cool about this bag besides its
awesome color it's the fact that it has
a lot of compartments and geared towards
photographers anyone who does video work
but you can use it even if you're not a
photographer so let's take a look at
what's inside we got tons of compartment
in the very beginning this is this
should be no surprise to anyone but I've
got a pair of headphones now these right
here are my bose QC 75 I gotta say these
are probably one of my favorite
headphones to grab when traveling
somewhere because they're so lightweight
and compact it fit in this pocket with
no problem and you might see that this
one in particular is customized by color
where it's got my awesome logo over here
got some teal accents looks real good
and I really just like these because I
haven't found anything that we took QC
35 in terms of comfort and since this is
a travel backpack I need some of the
best noise cancelling I can get and when
on the train this thing is going to be a
beauty to block out all the noises I
hear on there especially since I tend to
travel to New York a lot so these are a
great companion and work really well in
this kind of backpack and over here in
this smaller pocket we'll get a very
essential item of traveling and that's
some cap stick now hear me out
you're traveling you're probably meeting
people a lot of people are thinking
because you're outside can I be a lips
looking crusty so you need some
chapstick on hand so you don't look
crazy but that's what we got in these
two little flaps all in the front
so this is like your quick access area
right in front of the messenger Brad you
don't even have to open it up you got
access to these two right here and just
a quick note that these zippers are
amazing they're really easy to open and
close because they have this little
finger top here so it looks kind of like
a little parachute but you can go ahead
and easily open eyes very nice touch
there's another one of these if uh
that's a very top that gives you quick
access to all your stuff right from
above and this could be a real
time-saver so you don't have to take off
the bag open it up pull something out
and then reattach everything again just
zip it open pull out what you need and
you're good to go but let's take a look
over here at the Sun it has these cool
mechanism that locked the front of the
bag it's actually a magnet and slide
mechanism so you just pop it off like
that really super easy and also has
these velcro straps that are really nice
and secures everything inside of the bag
so when you pop open this flap you've
got access to for me pocket me in the
very first one I've got a couple of SSDs
this is the Samsung t3 what you guys
might be familiar with this is a USB
type-c SSD I keep my files on here music
photos videos things that I just want to
take around with me I'll go on this guy
this is one terabyte and the other one
that I have over here is a glyph
technology drive now this is also an SSD
but this is a raid SSD which means it's
very very fast and this is great because
let's say Aries working on a project and
I need to take this with me through
wherever I'm going I can take that
project with me without any problem just
plug it in and I'm good to go now to be
honest I have a bit of a love-hate
relationship with this when it works
it's amazing it performs just like I
would wanted to but when it doesn't it
can be the most frustrating thing in the
world now that's not to say this thing
doesn't work all the time I would say
I've had about 9% of the time that I've
used has been super smooth but that
other 10% I've had issues with my map
with restarting or ejecting itself so
like I said a lot of hate relationship
maybe I'm a glutton for punishment
but the screen really just does work
well and in that same pocket I've got
some cables for the drive this is the
Thunderbolt 3 cable that came with the
glyph and this is a Belkin Thunderbolt 3
table that actually works really well
done they're having legit on the bolt
three cables it's kind of hard to find
so this one from Belkin is pretty good
and I have that right there now in back
of that pocket I've got a 3.5 millimeter
cable this goes with the bose qc25 in
case I want to use up any of the
bluetooth features or battery I got that
option and over here on this side I've
got a wall adapter this is actually by
taki it has a USB input as well as a USB
type 3 input and this supports quick
charge 3.0 so when I'm bringing around
my pixel I can charge it with no problem
it'll charge really fast this is just a
nice thing to have in case I need to
charge up some of my devices and it's
pretty inexpensive small so it's always
in the bag with me now that will pocket
the front but there are also some more
pockets on the inside so over here you
can see there's a little zipper and we
have now this might be hard for you guys
can see but we've got let's see a whoo
two USB hub now this goes with my
macbook obviously you guys like a
MacBook in here I set it but this is so
I can plug up a ton of the boxes without
having to worry about not having those
typical USB ports so this provides three
USB 3 ports and SD card slot another USB
type-c port as well as an HDMI port in
case you want to hook this up to your TV
or something
also included are some adapters for
regular USB devices these are off the
adapters I showed you guys in the past
but I bring these around with me in case
someone has a device that needs to be
plugged in I don't want to pull this guy
out I got some little adapters that work
really well I also have
when your three cables some legit ones
these are actually by nomads I mentioned
nomads in my last video this is from
their rugged cable line and this one in
particular this is like a regular USB
cable very thick very strong durable but
it also has some adapters on here so it
starts off as a micro USB cable or you
can make it a lightning cable or even a
USB type-c cable so this has a ton of
versatility whatever phone you might
have you can use this to charge this is
very nice high quality stuff now this
one's kind of interesting it's a
lightning cable but it still has the
rugged design and it also has a portable
charger attached to the cable so not
only does this being charge your phone
it charges itself and if you need to
take it on the go you can still charge
your phone without being plugged into a
wall which is really really cool I've
never seen a product like this before so
this is an awesome awesome thing to have
on the go especially since I'm traveling
and my phone might need some extra juice
and the last thing I've got envious very
hard to see compartment is the ark Mouse
by a Microsoft this is a surface Mouse
but it works with other laptops of
course but this thing is really cool
because as you can see it can go flat
and when you bend it upwards it turns on
and it starts working just like a normal
Mouse and it just picks up no space when
in a backpack or something like this so
it was a shoo-in and I almost missed it
but I'm also carrying a curtal
mechanical pencil I figured this in a
more recent video but this is pretty
much a pencil with a gear inside that
helps to self sharpen basically so
you're always riding with the perfect
point so this is a pretty clutch thing
to carry around
now that bring much takes care of the
front and all the little things that I
have with me but in the middle you can
see that I've got some compartment here
and that's because this is geared
towards photographers so it's meant to
hold something like your camera and a
couple of lenses but this is modifiable
so you can flip it up however you want
but over here I have my a 7 St with a 16
to 35 millimeter lens
now the reason I like being in my hims
between is because it's super portable
gives me awesome video quality and it
just gets the job done without taking up
way too much space like my fat by seven
not in that same spot I've got a rode
videomic mini that I can just slap on
top of my a 7s and get some really
really nice audio quality and some
chances are I might be outside I had two
dead cat on here so that I don't have to
hear any wind sounds when recording my
audio and right here in the middle I've
got my text revival kids 2.0 if you guys
haven't seen that video you have to
check it out I have the link down below
in the description so worth it you got
to carry one of these around just so you
can cover all grounds but be sure that
you're prepared to do whatever you need
to do now when I pack my stuff I don't
keep in mind that I have this business
for emergencies so I pack normally and
then I include this in case something
breaks or I lose something I'm not going
to back up here but check out that video
if you haven't seen it already it's good
to have one of these now in this last
apartment I've got a PlayStation Vita I
know this is a bit ancient at this point
but I'm still coming across some really
good game for it I recently picked up
this Gundam game so I'm enjoying that
quite a bit actually made me put down my
Nintendo 3 yet and I love the Vita so
I'm glad to have it back in my arsenal
I love portable gaming so being able to
take an awesome game anywhere I am
whenever I have some downtime
that's just my cup of tea I love it so
stay tuned for that Nintendo switch
video we're going to what that's all
about
so another cool thing to note about this
bag is that it has this lining in here
that can be removed so while it is games
for photographers like I said you are
not limited to that so you can have a
lot more space in the bag but you can
put things like clothing books whatever
it is that may not have a conventional
spot in your bag you can make some space
for it so that's really cool and if you
don't want to put anything it will just
flatten it out quite a bit
but with that aside is little strap
gives you access to pocket this one over
here is holding my Sony here and
wireless earbuds now I talked about this
in a recent video as well but these are
like my go-to earbuds whenever I'm on
the go so I'm not using a pair of
headphones or something a little more
compact I'll use these now I know what
kind of looks worked with this neck band
but I got to say I've really been
enjoying this kind of design
I'm preferring function over form right
now that may change in the future but
right now I'm really enjoying being able
to throw in some earbuds and that has to
worry about them falling out due to
gravity this is just a really well
thought out idea for the earbud world
but it was also cool that it comes with
this cable that you can plug into the
microUSB port so if the batteries die on
me you still have access to your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack so that you
can listen to music even with no battery
and you never really see that feature
with Bluetooth earbuds so having that
functionality is a nice bonus and in the
back here we've got my MacBook Pro 15
inches this is the latest model USB see
all the things I suppose so I can do all
of my editing right from this laptop and
having no issues even this video is
going to be edited right on this guy so
I can go into a coffee shop with this
gear chop this video up and send it out
to YouTube with no problem aside from
reading adapters but that's besides the
point it gets the job done now one would
think that everything but there is
another zipper in the back that gives
you access to the more conventional side
things got a book you know get some
writing done get some planning done slot
for your pens and pencils I got even
more good so the pimples right here and
a jeeps apology
and that's all I have back here and that
it for the Czech travel back time now I
want to like this messenger bag
I wouldn't think a messenger bag can
hold all the stuff that I bring with me
to get work done but this one does the
job really well and honestly I just like
how flexible it is being able to hold it
from the handle up top has added sling
around me you can even add more straps
to it to get a really secure fit and
this is a really well made and
thought-out bag so if you're a
photographer or someone who likes having
quick access to their stuff this is a
really solid option but I'm no messenger
bags aren't for everyone so I have
linked to other travel backpack down
below in the description if you want to
try something else but hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one total energy arms consumer
