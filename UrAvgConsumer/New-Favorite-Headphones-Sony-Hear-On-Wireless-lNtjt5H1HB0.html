average consumer and today we're gonna
be finally taking a look at the Sony
here on wireless noise cancelling
headphones now when I first saw these
online I was into impressed and they
looked a bit gimmicky since they were
single coloured but when I got to try
them out at CES 2015 I was extremely
surprised they come in quite a few
colors but I gravitated towards the
Viridian blue which is pretty much like
to you and when you see this in person
and you get it in hand you can see that
it has a matte finish with a bit of a
dark undertone which helps it to feel a
lot more premium and less gimmicky this
has your standard headphone design but
it is foldable which is awesome because
typically with over year headphones they
tend to be a bit larger but this one
keeps the size pretty compact and makes
it easy for traveling when it comes to
the build quality it is all made out of
plastic but it does feel very solid the
headband offers some nice flex and the
hinges are pretty strong my only real
concern is that matte finish I feel like
over time you will be able to see a ton
of scratches on this but if you take
care of it and you store it away when
you're not using it shouldn't be much of
an issue and when it comes to the
controls and buttons on the ear cups
something does a pretty good job of
laying them out on the left ear cup you
have your noise cancelling button your
power button your micro USB port your
input so you can put in an audio cable
as well as a mic on the right ear cup
you'll have your switch so that you can
control your music as well as answer
some calls and a volume rocker
you'll also notice another mic since
these are noise cancelling headphones
it'll listening to the frequencies
around you and use that to tune them out
and speaking of the ear cups these are
really comfortable they have the right
oval shape so that they fit perfectly
over your ears and the cushions are very
very soft you also get that same comfort
on the headband which has a solid amount
of padding and this is great if you plan
on taking them on a long flight and you
want to use them for their noise
cancelling and of course you can adjust
the band if you've got a big ol head
like mine now let's talk about some of
the features you're gonna find on this
and since we just mentioned it let's
talk about noise cancelling and like I
mentioned before I first tried these out
at CES and I was shocked at my ability
to cancel out the entire show floor by
putting these on so there was no real
prai's when i was able to block out re
perfectly in the wife test and if you
didn't get a chance to see that video
i'll of course have links down below in
the description and another awesome
feature that you'll find here is NFC if
you have another NFC enabled device like
a recent Android phone you can tap them
together on the left ear cup and be able
to sync them wirelessly without having
to jump into your settings and if you
don't have another NFC enabled device
you'll still be able to sync them
through the regular Bluetooth settings
and that brings me to my favorite
feature their Wireless if you guys know
me you know I love Bluetooth headphones
since they're a lot easier to manage
since they don't have the dangling cable
and you're able to control your music
through your headphones and answer calls
without having to actually touch your
phone now one thing I'm not too crazy
about here is that if you're using them
wirelessly you might experience some lag
even if it is a split second of lag it
can get pretty annoying if you're
watching a video or playing a game but
when it comes to music it's not a big
deal at all I don't know if mine came
with a defect but I was way too lazy to
return it because honestly it wasn't
that big of a deal and I actually found
a little trick around this and weirdly
enough by simply turning the noise
canceling feature on and off I was able
to get rid of that lag so if yours
happens to do the same thing you've got
that little trick there but definitely
keep your eyes peeled for that I'm gonna
turn it if it's a big deal to you and
the battery life on these is great with
active noise canceling on I can get over
20 hours and without it I can get way
more which is way above the standard of
regular Bluetooth headphones but if you
don't want to use a battery life or the
Bluetooth features you can just use the
included cable and plug it into your
device for warning you will not have
access to the Bluetooth controls and the
cable of stuff has no control options so
you'll have to use your phone if you
want to switch up your songs but the
cable is a bit of a lifesaver if you run
out of juice the only other accessory
that you get here is a hard shell
carrying case which is perfect if you're
traveling with these and really
important if you want to protect them
from getting that matte scratched up and
the moment you've all been waiting for
the sound quality and let me tell you
guys I'm in love with these if you're
looking for some really crisp audio
these will definitely satisfy you the
vocals on these are really crisp and if
you're looking for some nice clarity
these are
in Italy a winner and for my fellow bass
lovers who I know are out there these
offer some excellent bass and it's
actually really nice and controlled
you won't hear it spill into songs that
don't need it but when there is some
bass in the track these really thumb now
try these with a ton of different genres
and it works well with everything I
threw at it so I gotta say guys I'm
really impressed with these they got
some awesome sound quality and got that
bass that I like and they've got a
couple of awesome features like NFC
Bluetooth and of course active
noise-cancelling but they do retail for
350 bucks which is pretty expensive
thankfully there is another option if
you don't want to spend that kind of
money with the wired version which is
pretty much the same thing without the
active noise-cancelling and bluetooth
features but you still get that same
amazing sound quality it only retails
for about 200 bucks so you save $150 but
that about wraps it up guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
