some sort of noxious it's gonna shoot I
know so right now we're in Walmart cool
duh we were here yesterday and forgot
stuff naturally to have a list now we're
back look at this is my favorite section
guys if you know me I love some cereal
so after making you guys wait forever I
decided my next video I guess after this
vlog is going to be my review of these
guys right here the Sony X the Sony xb9
50 bTW now I've I should have been
dropped that video but I'm working on
that now that's going to be the next one
I'm kind of liking the idea of dropping
it on Tuesday so you can probably expect
to see it then so I was getting some
filming done with that but another news
I'm pretty excited because I've got this
guy the Final Fantasy 14
heavensward Collector's Edition Bundle R
so let me lift this off now that the
seal is broken I can't refund this but
that's okay there we go
and C just sick so let me pull this open
oh that's pretty though has does
heavensward I lift off the top C alright
so we can see a couple things here on
the side this is the game itself
oh let's pull this out boom here it is
heavensward man this looks dope they're
trying to suck me back in so we've got
the art art book the game itself
collector's edition we've got I think
soundtrack and just a little figure
reading so this is the figure looks
pretty cool dragons
always a good thing this is my first
time getting a collector's edition that
came with like a figure
or anything like that so that's pretty
cool glad it was Final Fantasy pretty
though let it yell at the camera because
we are
yeah
is that this hole here one can see Oh
you guys pretty
I know they can't hear me I walk low but
this looks pretty sick guys there's like
water right here I don't know how
dangerous this is but this is insane
you guys know her from when the other
lives
cake looks pretty dope
here
Oh
check this out guys red velvet cake
alright guys so right now where'd it go
me supreme supreme yeah and we're
picking up food yeah fourth of July
that's our contribution we you know
we're not big chefs or you don't cook
anything ever so my parents are having a
barbecue and our contribution are our
dancing little side we're getting like
potato salad and coleslaw stuff like
that yeah so we're doing our part yeah
we're bringing food to the table so you
know we want and I feel guilty I'm happy
and by the way guys we're still using
this selfie stick and I gotta say it's
amazing I feel like a loser but it feels
so worth it for the blogs or the blog
and as you guys may have noticed I have
curls in my hair so I'm trying something
new for for hairstyles because you guys
know that I am going natural
I am 16 months post relaxer and I'm just
trying to hold out until I get fully
natural and middle to cut out that old
relaxed ends for the girls who care but
yeah she's going from straight hair to
curly hair guys all the guys would want
to understand what she meant
straight hair to curly essentially and
this is thus I'm gonna be wearing until
it's all fully curly okay but yes we are
are we to Kings Plaza not your average
consumer for breaking it down to the
averages honey alright
oh man everybody keeps Plaza as always
to just quickly return something this
Elvis it kind of just swung over we got
a more expensive one I mean a better
quality one yeah so right now we're in
Sears I'm going to return this camera
that I got for Ali's bad it's supposed
to be like the Dropcam or something like
that but uh I'm gonna head in just got
him with Dropcam instead
return this guy and while we're in the
mall
I figure we might as well try and see if
we get a decent self-esteem and before
it's been a more expensive boom if I
wasn't a bad quality one I get a lot of
money for this one is Rita hoping to
make quality selfies exact thing yet but
we're able girl so judges have noticed
in Sears and then the person also knows
me he's like no yeah I know you from the
boxers girlfriend and I said to
afterwards like he can't ever cheat on
me because people know me from the box
and they would be quick stick effective
like nope that's why you are hey guys if
you ever do see that though if you
tagged me at your girlfriend it might be
my sister or my cousin okay so hasty you
take the pictures I have a selfie
so we found some selfie sticks but to be
honest they're the same quality as the
one that we have not really sure we're
gonna find anything much better than
what we're currently using which is
pretty cheap so maybe watch a search
online
this
my two best buys so
some pretty embarrassing to walk around
and ask you guys saw something sticks
alright so we're at Best Buy and the
second I walked in my eyes started right
to it it's right here
there are two options that this one in
this one this one is pretty much what we
have mm-hmm look at this one this looks
a little different
yeah like the stick part uh I don't even
know if it'll work with ours - man $25
is kind of brolic okay there's a third
one called the original selfie stick I
swear it's one company that makes them
all they look exactly the same
this is insane so it seems like Sony has
an option here
it's a ridiculous price absolutely four
dollars but if I oh yeah
it's called an action monopod so if
anybody's actually it's a glorified
selfie stick
are you using something stick no it's an
action monopod we're above the selfie
stick yeah alright guys so
we got there
we got action model pod we're going to
see how it works hopefully it's worth it
if not right back to Best Buy it grows
so we're using the new action monopod
sort of fallen I'm not using a selfie
stick
I know selfie sticks look silly and I
think I look silly but do it for the
vlog it's worth it exactly and we have
to protect the mark for when we get it
so you're just gonna be stating a mark
for two so we'll show you that once it
gets it so right now I just gonna use
the loo stick so I am all our food is
falling in the back there we gotta hurry
up and get to this place yeah but we it
was a success we found a better selfie
stick
well I'm sorry action monopod is gonna
be easier to get ourselves in focus
since we won't be so close to the camera
which is going to help a lot yeah so my
full girl summer go down one more sorry
okay so my focus issues with the rx100
hopefully will be fixed with this as a
solution if not they both go back and
I'll switch to something yeah he has
been getting so frustrated with his arcs
100 mark 3 and it's like focusing issues
hopefully the mark 4 works alright guys
so it's time to do some editing of the
vlog I'm going to be working on that but
surprise surprise look what I just got
in rx100 mark 4 so like I said yeah I
said like yesterday we're going to see
this is going to be the replacement to
my mark 3 but if I'm still having
focusing issues it's gonna have to go
and I'm going to look for something else
I also picked up a 128 gigabyte a heart
of why am i blanking on this SD card now
it's going to need a special memory card
because it's going to be shooting in 4k
almost a thousand frames per second so I
need something really fast so I got this
guy um but this is it let's see if I do
a quick unboxing for you guys the tab
pull it's open this is it looks exactly
like the mark 3 let's see if I can get
this thing out here it is and this is
the mark 4 so hopefully this guy
performs well the image quality is going
to be great I already know that
I just really want the focusing to be
better it's supposed to be better at low
light as well so we'll see how that goes
but this is it one thing I did want to
show you guys even though you've
probably seen it in person is what it
looks like to use the selfie stick so
I'm going to put Ternes rx100 on and you
guys can kind of get a look at that
alright guys so this is the action
monopod I kind of just twist it you can
open this thing up so what I'm vlogging
now having it look like this in person
hopefully you guys gonna look silly we
know this but uh is gonna be worth it to
get a wider field of view yeah I get
those great shots some years I'm going
to shock this way it's gonna be great so
this is how slowly oh look walking
around like this also this is taken with
the rx100 mark 4 so uh boom alright guys
that's pretty much it
we'll catch you in the next one
hopefully this little bit about selfie
sticks is useful to you and it isn't
overkill let us know if you use a selfie
stick there are actually some people who
saws with a selfie stick and said that
they wanted to get one themselves yeah
so we pretty surprising but do you use
one would you use one do you think it's
obnoxious would you do it for a vlog let
us know until next time please bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
