where we showed our experience using the
LG grant for about a week and we asked
you guys if you wanted to see a full
review after a month and the answer was
overwhelmingly yes so here are my
thoughts on the LG gram 15 inch model
with a max configuration after a month
and bonus LG sponsoring today's video
and a giveaway of the brand-new LG gram
that I have right here and if you guys
want to enter you just got to make sure
you subscribe to the channel hit that
like button and leave a comment down
below and boom your answer to win and
when you leave a comment down below let
me know how you would use the LG Graham
and also throw in your Twitter handle or
Instagram handle that way I'll be able
to get in touch with you a bit easier
after I've selected the winner and I
plan to announce it over on Twitter so
make sure you're following me and good
luck but now on to my thoughts in
thinking about the LG Graham you got to
think about who this laptop is for and
its utility in the average consumers
day-to-day life
so first let's take a look at the specs
on what's powering this thing the first
and obviously most notable thing about
the LG Graham is the fact that it weighs
less than two and a half pounds it's
made out of magnesium which helps to
minimize the weight making this thing
extremely portable over the last month
if I was heading out and I needed a
laptop for some of my simpler tasks it
was the one I grabbed the most and every
day when leaving the office and I throw
this thing into my backpack I'd really
appreciate how light it was usually it's
the laptops that really weigh down my
backpacks amongst other things but
usually the laptops of a big heavy guy
so having this thing be so light made
carrying my backpack even easier and
just because I like grabbing this thing
for simpler tasks doesn't mean it can
only handle simple tasks
this thing's packing Intel Core i7 8550
you processor 16 gigs of ram one
terabyte of storage so it's pretty solid
and I'll throw up the full spec list for
those of you who are interested and with
all this this means you'll be able to do
your typical web browsing video chatting
with the webcam in the proper position
now and fully use Microsoft Office
software but also some more demanding
things like photo editing or even some
video editing depending on the kind of
footage you use I've easily done some
photo editing using Lightroom for my
Instagram pictures or even my YouTube
thumbnails without feeling like I needed
to grab another machine to get it done
so I imagine if you're a student this
thing will meet all of your needs unless
you're doing something really in
pensive like if you're an engineering
major or you're doing three renderings
for school
that might be a bit different and in
terms of i/o the ground is pretty solid
on the left side you've got your port
for power a USB 3.0 port your HDMI port
as well as a Thunderbolt 3 port which
you can only see on the 15-inch bottle
moving over to the right you've got two
USB 3.0 ports a headphone jack and a
micro SD card slot and in my first week
with it I mentioned how difficult it was
for me to get into the flow of typing
with this thing because they fit a full
keyboard with a number-pad
in 215 inches but as I expected once I
used it a bit more I adapted pretty
quickly and now I'd say I find it pretty
comfortable typing on it and it's really
nice to have that number pad on the side
especially when I'm working with excel
sheets and I'm plugging in a bunch of
numbers for business purposes so it's
really nice to have those extra keys and
a nice little touch with the Graham is
the included fingerprint scanner right
there on the power button which lets you
get into the computer without a password
very quickly and even better for doing
those business tasks for me is being
able to finally connect it to an
external monitor with the Thunderbolt 3
port I don't have many laptops I can
really take advantage of these nice
Thunderbolt 3 monitors that I have here
so it's great that this can especially
when it comes to gaming
now this laptop might not be the best
for intense gaming like I mentioned in
the first video but it can definitely
handle some really light gaming and
another bonus with having that don't
involve three port is being able to add
an external GPU which I don't have
currently so I haven't been able to
really test this out but having this
laptop makes me really want to see how
much an external GPU can help so maybe
sometime down the line I'll pick one up
just to kind of do some more tests now
in terms of media consumption like
watching my shows and some movies even
though I typically use my tablet I was
still able to enjoy doing so on the gram
especially when lying in bed since lying
down allow the speaker's to be
unobstructed now all the speakers have
pretty great volume and they're crisp
it's located under the keyboard which
means when it's on my lap it gets a
little muffled and I've got no real
complaints when it's on an actual desk I
just found that when it's on my lap I
tend to block the speaker's quite a bit
other than that this thing has a really
beautiful display if a full HD IPS panel
and I gotta say guys this display looks
really really good it's sharp colors are
vibrant and you get some really deep
blacks and
got a nice responsive test screen so all
together it's a really awesome package
and probably one of the most underrated
things about the grant and talking about
gaming and media consumption brings me
over to the battery life I've
consistently gotten about eight to nine
hours of battery life with my 15-inch
model but on Eric's 13-inch model she's
gotten a bit more than me which makes
sense since her sees it as power-hungry
and it's got that smaller display so now
the question is who is this laptop for
and the answer is pretty simple I think
almost any average person could use this
laptop for their day-to-day tasks and be
really happy with the display
performance and other features I already
mentioned but where you really get the
value out of this is if you're someone
on the go
so if your student constantly going
between classes or someone with a long
public transit commute and you'd like to
get work done during that commute with
that awesome battery life and super
lightweight feel this laptop is perfect
but overall I've been very happy using
the grant for the last few weeks and I
can't wait to see what LG does with the
next iteration since they are always
getting better and better
fingers crossed for a dedicated GPU that
would be really awesome maybe some speed
replacement changes but hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video if you did be
the cool guy girl that gives it a thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one definitely make sure you answer that
giveaway but until the next one guys
it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
