consumer and here's a quick look at my
desk setup I'm using dual monitors with
an iMac and PlayStation 3d display I use
a pretty large desk to do most of my
recording and work and to the side of my
desk is my section of portables
including handheld gaming systems
tablets and phones what makes my setup
unique is this hanging cabinet with most
of my gaming consoles that are all
connected to my Playstation display as

the perfect work and play environment
