consumer and we've all heard of Tesla's
these are probably the most popular
electric vehicles on the streets right
now but if you can't afford something
like a Tesla we have some alternatives
so check this guy out in the back here
no I'm not talking about the car talking
about these guys good alternatives if
you don't want to pump gas anymore first
we got to give a huge shout-out to
today's sponsor Robo rock the Robo rock
s6 isn't just a regular vacuum it's also
a robot mop you can customize the area
that the s6 tackles with its companion
app which means you don't have to have
this thing running around aimlessly in
your home it has a bunch of other cool
features like multiple sensors for
obstacle avoidance laser distance
sensors even carpet detection that'll
automatically activate maximum power and
you also get up to two-and-a-half hours
of battery life and a lot more features
and if you guys are interested in
learning more about the Robo rock at 6
I'll of course have links down below in
the description and this guy will be
officially hitting the US June 26th so
be sure to check it out so alright guys
we've got our lineup over here damn
that's dirty over there now all of these
you can pretty much charge at home they
run for a few miles well more than a few
miles and they all have varying speeds
but we'll go over those as we touch on
each one of them let me go with what I'm
comfortable with the scooter board
alright alright fine
we're gonna go with the scooter board
first since you know Ari likes to choose
first this guy right here I think has a
top speed of 15 and a half miles per
hour and you can ride this for seven and
a half miles so right here you have your
acceleration this is your brake up front
and you've also got a break in the back
you can kind of just hit this thing and
of course it'll stop and to get this
thing started all you need is like a
little kick 2 miles per hours all the
ease and then you get on oh all right
I'll snap I can do that better so
something to keep in mind with Electric
skateboards they have brakes like the
one I just talked about over here so
we're gonna do that again this time
you'll see how it goes all right all
right
and then you just slow it down slow it
down and what I like about this is it
can handle some pretty rough terrain so
that's good and while I want to just
give it a little bit more speed
yo shout out to these guys for running
with me this is cool
this one's pretty entry levels not too
hard re rides this way more than me and
she's pretty good at it
Malcolm what do you mean you just put
your foot on it
all right so kick get your positioning
there you go let's go you there you go
there you go
now we got to have J do it all right J
you got to remember the brake you forgot
so yes people it is very important to
remember the brake feature there you go
you go yeah there you go
all right all right so that one was
pretty simple very easy to get on but
let's try this guy over here this one
not so much
and I'm prepared for that re you want to
pass me the stuff all right guys but all
right guys right here we of course have
some pads because you got to be safe on
these I'm not too worried about anything
else but this guy right here this is the
solowheel Glide and I am terrified of it
I definitely think these are the kiddie
size bib as all that target had but all
right let's do this
now just standing on it that's gonna be
hard I don't even know how to
let's go over here how about that all
right whoo all right so I'm gonna the
most dramatic fall I barely did anything
be careful did you hear that Wow yeah it
turned off it said no way Malcolm you're
up buddy
I'll catch you Malcolm all right uh-huh
I got you I got you go ahead
you just stand on it I have no I have no
other tips for you than that all right
not just okay yeah all right so we are
not gonna risk his life and I'm not
gonna risk JLo
all right I think we've seen enough the
solowheel unless you know how to ride a
unicycle I don't recommend it fine Jay
got it now you got to do it Jay so fun
fact guys there's also a headlight up
there so you guys see it oh all right
Jay all right
I'm not trying to see anybody get hurt
you don't got workers comp or this thing
has some battle scars right here it's
been through it and it hasn't been
written once
nobody has successfully moved this thing
now those two don't work for your dream
of replacing a Tesla then this guy might
be what you're looking for this is the
uni milk so this is an electric bicycle
now if you're expecting this thing to
kind of just go on its own like you're
thinking a motorcycle that's not what
this guy is it's not what it does this
pretty much gives you a boost when
you're writing you have to ride normally
and it gives you some assistive pushes
and this thing can go up to 20 miles per
hour and believe the range is 31 to like
37 miles per hour depending on your
weight and all that kind of stuff but
I'm gonna show you guys how it goes so
basically you got to ride it normally
and then and all of a sudden gives you
that little kick right there
now even though this is meant to be more
assistive than it is to just ride you
along it can do that and then it will
just keep going indefinitely where you
don't have to pedal but the thing is
it's not very fast kind of just hold it
and then it takes off and then you're
pretty much just cruising you're just
kind of cruising at this speed I don't
have to pedal at all and this is just it
anything's also got like this display up
front so I'll tell you how fast you're
going it'll tell you how much of an
assistive presence it has so if you want
to max that up all the way to nine you
can do that and you can take it down all
the way to one so once you start riding
then you're gonna feel that kick so go
for it buddy Oh wasn't expecting the
kick huh alright so once you kick you're
pretty much good to go
so anyone you can get into this with no
problem as long as you understand what
you're getting yourself into
since this most people will probably
look at this and think it's like a
motorcycle or a moped of some sort it's
not that and for this one I feel like
all of you guys know it we got a
hoverboard
now this one's this is the swag chain so
people know this one this fad has died
very very quickly once the battery
started exploding and burning down
people's houses and whatnot so people
don't ride this anymore but they still
sell them goes at 4.8 miles per hour
for about seven miles so you could use
it to get somewhere probably not the
coolest thing to do anymore but it's an
option so the hardest part is like
actually getting on it for the first
time when you're not used to it
but alright there you go so yeah you
pretty much lean forward and you're just
able to go if you want to stop you kind
of lean back you want to turn you just
kind of lean one foot in the direction
that you want to turn or the opposite
direction that you want to turn you can
of course spin on this because of the
way the wheels are set up and those are
pretty much your movement it's really
not that hard to get this is me moving
right now with very
very very little experience mouthing you
ever rode one of these yeah don't don't
do that you know what's coming you
scared of this one so you just put your
leg on that and then just jump on the
other one you got this oh just do it
you're too scared just do it I'm the
same turn that part of your brain off I
can't do that JJ's got this he's been
he's been training so he could use this
with the camera whew go ahead Jay Jay's
just showing off right now yeah
Jay's busting out the camera moves like
you got a gimbal in him but let's move
on to where I am the most comfortable
and that is with this guy the booster
board electric skateboard and we also
have the Z bar over here which is
actually where I learned to ride
Electric skateboards
so the booster board uses a remote I
think most people are familiar with the
booster board you use this remote you've
got a little trigger that you press up
front and then you hold onto this wheel
to go forward or to go back and that's
pretty much how you move on it now with
the Z board you actually have a
different system than a remote control
you see these pads over here these two
pads are how you control it so this is
your reverse and this is your
acceleration now moving on the booster
board is more than just using the remote
you also have to balance so if you want
to go right you want to lean more on the
toes and if you want to go left you go
on the back of your heels now of course
depending on how you're standing this
can change so if I'm standing this way
it's the opposite but as you use these
things more you get way way more
comfortable so right now I could turn
the speed up in a heartbeat
and I have no problem moving around now
this right here is the Z board and this
is the first electric skateboard that I
use really fell in love with them after
getting my hands on one of these and the
way that you ride on these it makes
sense it just feels natural but it is
way more taxing on the legs so you have
these pads as I mentioned before so you
kind of just stand on them and if you
want to give it a little juice you just
kind of lean the more weight that you
put on one side the faster this thing
will go and if you want to back up and
just kind of lean back but it's really
really simple once you get it honestly
the choice is yours between which one
you get I personally like the booster
board a bit more because it's just a lot
smoother and it's not as taxing on the
legs with these acceleration pads but it
is kind of nice to have hands-free when
you're using this thing now obviously
none of these are real
Tesla alternatives but it's summertime
and these are great to use in the park
like this one so if you just want to
ride around you'll have a good time with
these but I think the major takeaway
here guys is don't buy the solowheel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
