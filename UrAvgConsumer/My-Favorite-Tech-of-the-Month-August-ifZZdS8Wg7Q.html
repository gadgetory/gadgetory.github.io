and it's time for another favorite tech
of the month video this time for the
month of August and yes yes I know I'm a
couple days late guys I get it but I was
in Germany packing up I finally moved
out of my old apartment
yes I'm throwing some excuses out there
but you know I've been busy but for
those of you who have never seen one of
my favorites I go to Milan videos I'm
pretty much gonna be talking about the
tech that I've been personally using on
a daily basis whether that's old or new
but check out what I've been using so
first things first I feel like this
one's gonna be an easy no-brainer the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 now if you miss my
real day in the life video you gotta go
check that out where I go over almost
everything about this phone but honestly
this is the phone that I've been
carrying with me alongside my iPhone you
guys know I carry an iPhone and an
Android phone so I gotta have best of
both worlds but the note 9 has replaced
the Google pixel for me the pixel to
excel and it hasn't been letting me down
now the note 9 is a very big inexpensive
phone so I can understand why some
people might not be too crazy about it
but aside from those two things this is
probably the best Android phone on the
market now of course when it comes to
personal preference in terms of like the
way the operating system looks and the
UI all that stuff I really don't think
you can beat this phone it has
everything 4,000 milliamp hour battery
great cameras with great low-light
performance it's snappy it's fast has
the best display on the market it's got
a nice great big display so you can
watch content and do all kinds of stuff
it's got the s-pen which I know for some
people they don't really care s-pen for
me it's a nice bonus honestly guys I
just feel like Samsung makes no
compromises with their phones these days
they're putting out some of the best
hardware without having to remove
anything so we didn't lose the headphone
jack
we still have wireless charging water
resistance honestly the note 9 has just
been everything that I'm looking
or in one package so I really like
carrying this thing around not to
mention I've been using the Galaxy watch
as well and these things just play so
nicely together
I really really really like this watch
and I'm gonna do a full video on it just
so you guys can know what you're getting
but so far this combo honestly it's just
been a killer experience but something
else that has been carrying guys and I
feel a little bit guilty here are the
bose qc25 twos yeah I believe that's
what they're on the twos now I know I've
said it in the past and I still stand by
the statement the Sony what is it WH
1000x mark twos are a better overall
headphone than these in terms of feature
sound quality even noise cancelling but
there's that one one one aspect of
headphones that you just can't ignore it
and that's comfort for me these have
been so incredibly comfortable that it's
been making plane rides just ah so nice
and honestly that's really the only leg
up that I think it has against the
Sony's but it plays such a big role
it just makes picking them up a little
bit of an easier decision than the
Sony's even though you know the Sony's
are gonna sound a bit better they still
sound good and they still have great
noise cancelling so the inferior
headphone wins for me lately only
because it's so comfortable to use and
it's just nice to wear for long periods
of time went outside so that's my little
confession over there
I feel like blasphemous for saying it
but we're gonna say now something I'm a
little bit more processor I've been
using it's this guy right here the msi
gs70 my mning laptop by MSI is what I've
been using for I believe like a solid
month now and guys this thing is so so
good
I've been using the surface the surface
book to as my gaming laptop I've been
using for a lot more than gaming but
this guy it makes me want to replace my
surface book - this guy's a bit more
gaming oriented so I've been taking
advantage of that and it's just been a
really really nice experience especially
when you look at how thin this guy is so
thin guys now this does not even look
like a full-blown gaming laptop it looks
a bit sleeker than that beste named
stealth but in terms of power it's
rocking Intel 8th gen Core i7 processor
it's there 8 758 chip as well as a
dedicated gtx 1070 16 gigs of ram 512
gigs of SSD storage not to mention a 144
hertz refresh rate it's a 1080p display
but it actually looks really good
everything looks solid and honestly it's
just the form factor and power here that
makes this thing so special and look at
this guy's
well gaming laptop with these kind of
specs can you just hold like this with
no problem uh-huh but I'm gonna be doing
a full-blown review so you guys can know
what I love and dislike about it but for
the most part I've just been loving it
it's been one of my favorite laptops so
far now something that's been a bit more
low-key not as flashy as the gaming
laptop over there is actually in my
gadget backpack my current gadget
backpack and that's this Satechi power
hub now I know you guys have seen a ton
of hubs and you know power cables
adapters all that kind of stuff but this
one's actually been super convenient for
me
I don't usually walk around with the
regular wall outlets anymore the wall
adapters
I don't really walk around with those
anymore I've been just using this guy
and that's because wherever I go Ares
nearby Ari never brings around her own
charger so something like this with four
ports has been extremely useful to me
now these ports are actually really nice
because the first one is a USB PD port
so you can plug in a regular USB C cable
to power up something like a MacBook so
I can charge my macbook with this guy
right here and I also have access to
quick charge with my iPhone so with this
I can have
this cable right here which is a USBC to
lightning and with that I can quick
charge my iPhone and get it charged up
super fast re is always and I mean
always asking for this charger because
he like uses her phone down to one
percent but that's neither here nor
there but this has been very useful
because when she's bugging me for it I
can still take advantage of the other
ports and charge my devices even though
she's using it look at that did you hear
that guys I need a charger I was what
what is the chance what are the chances
I just said you always need a charger
you never have one and you're always yes
oh yeah my life guys anyway the other
ports here you've got a quick charge 3.0
port right here which is really nice so
my note 9 even though it has quick
charge 2.0 I can charge it up pretty
quickly there and it has other USB ports
this is why I carry it around with me
really like this makes my life a bit
easier and the last thing that I'm gonna
show you guys blew my mind a little bit
I'm telling you that's not easy to do
these days but check this out and this
is the thing guys right here is the
Amazon fire cube TV now I picked this up
I mean there wasn't any real hype around
it I did want to try it out because I
wanted to stay in the know and man I
love this thing guys it's very very new
to me I've only recently really messed
around with it but check this out turn
on the TV okay and just like that we are
good to go and I know trust me I know
there are ways to do that with like the
logitech harmony remotes and all that
kind of stuff but to have this thing
connected to your TV it is really nice I
can even say watch my hero Academy up on
Hulu getting my hero academia from Hulu
academia Academy
so it'll start up the who laughs even
when it's sleeping and then it should
show the show that I just requested
pause guys this is crazy stuff here I
can completely control my TV with my
voice no need for remotes anymore
everything can be controlled right here
and what's really impressive is the fact
that it also works with the sono sound
bar that I have right here so I can say
something like increased volume on the
TV okay
oh it's getting louder and louder but
what was kind of surprising to me when
it comes to controlling the TV is that
you're not limited to just being on the
alexa homepage in order to control it
you can set to less 8 set TV to HDMI to
it'll go switch over to the input that I
want HDMI 2 is 4 I believe my xbox and
you can still control the television
with the Amazon cube something like the
Apple TV you're not really going to be
able to control unless you're on the
input that it's on so this thing is
straight up functioning as a full blown
remote with your voice and I am
completely here for that you guys know I
used to love my Xbox Kinect for those
kinds of features but honestly it's even
more powerful and has more control than
that does so not okay Lex by cutting off
the support for Kinect and even if you
don't want to use voice commands at the
moment maybe it's nighttime you don't
want to yell or anything you can just
use the remote that it comes with kind
of scroll through the whole menu but
yeah guys that's the tech that I've been
using in the month of August
I know it's September don't crucify me
in the comments but hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one so
then it's your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
