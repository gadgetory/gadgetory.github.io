so we're the best by seeing if there's
any interesting tech here as best vice
little thing to you guys
like Amazon Amazon all things on all so
the reason we have like coming to us
because tonight will be the first time
in forever that we are cooking you guys
always get on us about our really bad
eating habits and we finally are going
to attempt okay so that should be
interesting
we're going to see if there's any tech
we can get here that can like assist us
in the process or just just to have make
it making funny before but yeah so Aries
been dying for a battery case for her
iPhone 6 and they finally got the Mophie
Juice Pack air and the Juice Pack ultras
was really going for I think I'm gonna
get the juice out
Ultra Ball guy so quickly so so you
don't you don't care that is bigger what
what is it thicker is it just wasn't all
very secure what is this ha we're
talking about cases people uh uh I don't
know okay guys I think we've come to a
decision
I think we'll go with this one we've
always yes I've seen this in another
vlog so like there's a vlog and I think
what's July or something and we we will
get this we were so entertained by it
Oh tickle but and now I like it share it
this would be fun to have in the kitchen
while we're oh yeah so how in Best Buy
he found one who recognized dud and they
are taking a selfie
now nope so that they can the sounds oh
I'm screaming your inaudible this is
pretty cool
it says yeah you should be scared
introducing the next generation of
gaming HP or man this is really cool
it's like has each audio that's really
awesome
has some light up stuff at the silence
it's kind of cool that price tag though
surprisingly area's been really into 3d
s oh it's so good
and Mario she's really like Sophia I
mean it makes sense though I usually
people's introduction to games is like
through Mario and stuff like that she's
finally got her piece so good IBC of
everything the Mario game that I bought
no no poster you always do that he'd be
found but he said he wouldn't take the
take credit for and I he okay so listen
guys I couldn't do the Robin thing by
Jerry she did everything else except for
some parts where she called the over
anyway so I'm playing it again so I'm
trying to collect the 90 star coins you
need for to open the star world so it's
not over you think it's over it's really
not awesome
hey everyone so we are finally back home
we've been out all day um and we're
finally home we're sorry and we're about
to start cooking and everything we're
cooking is coming from that box and as
you can see it is from a company called
blue apron so it's only fitting that
morgan apron right now i'm really
excited about this because they deliver
this right to our door and basically
believe what is a service that delivers
ingredients and recipes and everything
right to your door for you to cook so
let's take my forty minutes maximum and
so when i reached out to us to ask us to
try the service we figured it was
perfect yeah why not
you guys know we are terrible when it
comes to cooking food at home we're
always eating out almost every day like
the people at tops notice like a we had
every single waitress at dog so we're
gonna go check inside this box actually
boxing knife here so we're gonna box it
open this up and what kind of
ingredients we've got and see what we're
working with I'm so excited we really
the thing that keeps us back a lot from
my cooking and stuff like that is the
fact that we have to like look up
recipes we don't know when you're in our
own I'm gonna go out and buy ingredients
but hey this does all the work for you
ah yes of course you got to refrigerate
this stuff unless see what we get but it
comes like with with anything like these
things to protect the freshness of it so
like even if you're out at work and this
is deliberate it'll still stay fresh
which is awesome all right so we've got
some memos and some recipes all right
tell us exactly that's good is that
we're making today
I think so too much told you a mistake
nice and this is a two-person box with
obviously there's two people who are
issues two of us so we have a two person
or a family of four box ah we could
probably eat the whole thing with our
Bob you guys we can do it we're going to
try and make some sense of everything
we've got in here and get ready to start
cooking and crank up the music time oh
yeah yeah JB pulse so we're going to see
if this is any good we just got it just
to play some music while we're cooking
so see how that goes all right guys so
we've got our ingredients all sprawls
out we've got our vegetables our meats
everything we need to make a meal and
this is actually enough to make three
different meals here our package came
with three different meals that we can
cook of course we're going to go for the
sirloin tip steaks but we've got other
options here as well so good yeah so as
stemming goes over here and everything
is individually sealed so we know
exactly what every ingredient is so this
is actually really cool
great first this would be perfect for
someone like me oh yeah look at the back
of it so in the front is the the
ingredients my back has just like six
steps only six EPS to make this like I
it's unbelievable to me so while we get
set up say hi
I we're vlogging say what's up to the
blog say what's that vlog shut up your
channel go follow hello look at this
right here this is the little JBL
speaker oh that's dope
can they see it you guys are right
yeah laughing periscoping this is so
cool - multitasking this is 2015 welcome
alright guys so we are all done don't
think it's like what 30 minutes I guess
30 minutes to get this is awesome check
it out
so this is our creation right here yeah
I also find myself in this is only about
700 calories and things of 680 but all
their moles are between 500 to 700
calories which is awesome and you guys
know I'm hashtag sweating for the
wedding so it's writing with my meal
plan so perfect so we are going to chow
down and eat but if you guys want to
check out blue apron the first 100
viewers get two meals off their first
order so definitely check the link down
below in the description to try it out
and I can't wait to eat ready I'm sorry
sorry it is really good alright guys so
just got the mail and a new case came in
for the galaxy s6 this is a spigen Neo
Hybrid e^x case so I'm gonna try it out
as you can see here I've got a bit of a
dilemma I've got three different phones
these are typically the phones I jumped
between as my daily driver
iPhone 6 plus galaxy s6 and the Nexus 6
over here these are all cased up I like
to protect my investments and phones so
I like to put cases on them as much as I
love to rock them the way they were
intended the way they were made it's
just really scary when I might not keep
these
I might sell them sometime and I just
want them to be protected so I got
myself a little case here this is the
spigen Neo Hybrid DX and it looked like
the least intrusive of a case it doesn't
look like it covers up everything the
design will still be shown so I like
that huh okay
oh I wasn't expecting this this looks
like it's just a bumper and this is a
screen pick no this is a back protector
I guess oh that's kind of disappointing
I was definitely expecting this to have
a clear back a see-through back not a
not no back at all and a screen
protector so uh hmm that's pretty
interesting let me see what this is
actually like when I put it on all right
so here we go I guess
you put this piece on first I wish I
knew that this was pretty much just a
bumper kind of like applet Apple came
out with with the iPhone 4 so now I know
that these neo hybrids are like this I
mean it doesn't look bad I like this
looks pretty good but um the back isn't
protected it definitely does do the
thing that I wanted it to in the sense
that it doesn't really hide the design
of the phone but uh it's not protected
ah so I guess I'll throw this little
screen protector on the back and that'll
be it
not a fan kind of wish that there was a
little bit more to it but are you what
phone that you guys rocking I'm curious
to know uh there are so many new phones
out which ones are you guys rocking I
really like the galaxy s6 I'm not I like
the edge but I don't know I'm not I
can't pick it over this for some reason
it just the getting used to that screen
was a little tough for me I'm gonna have
a video on that on what day what day am
I having a video
on Friday so you guys will see my
thoughts on the six and the six edge on
a video Friday but so far I'm really
liking the six this more so than this
edge uh yeah and I've also got the
iPhone six-plus here this is this is
pretty much my real daily driver I would
say because I keep finding myself going
back to this phone instead of any of the
other Android phones which is really odd
to me because I'm an Android guy at
heart but I'm just really loving the six
plus the battery life is amazing I love
how it works with all that Apple stuff
that I'm using right now so there's a
lot of synergy here with the products
that I use but um yeah Nexus 6 it had a
good run I really liked using it with
especially with Android wear but I don't
know I think this time that I I put this
away cuz I really don't see myself going
back to the Nexus 6 especially over the
s6 this one feels a lot more comfortable
in the hand I can use this a lot easier
and it's got this amazing camera so
between the Nexus 6 and the galaxy s6 I
think I'll have to go with the s6 it's
not as hard to use definitely a lot
easier but I do want to know what you
guys are using what are your ideal
phones out right now oh and by the way
guys this speaker it is quite the
speaker it's really nice I've really
liked all the lights and all the crazy
stuff that it can do you guys can see
here that you can kind of change it up
to do whatever you want it's got a
couple of cool features right now
there's no music playing so you don't
see it as interactive as it can be but
um I don't know is it worth 200 bucks
the sound is pretty good it's got a
decent amount of bass as sound gets
really loud so I mean it performs very
well if you know what just kind of
reminds me of it reminds me of a lava
lamp you know how back in the day people
you should have lava lamps just for like
the design and decor in their room this
is what that reminds me of while having
the functionality of a pretty good
speaker but it is 200 bucks I would have
liked to see this happen
be like 150 or something 200 just seems
like a little excessive but um it is a
nice speaker though that's my mini
review of this thing I don't know how
long the battery life is or anything I'm
getting blown up right now on my Google
Hangouts but yeah this is a pretty
decent speaker not work 200 bucks I
don't think alright guys I've been
messing around with this a little bit
more I actually paired it with my iPhone
yesterday I paired it with the MacBook a
mini MacBook and I actually got a
notification to download that half when
I connected it now what's interesting
about that is that this app has a couple
of cool features that I didn't even know
about so you can download different kind
of lighting schemes like this one you
can download a quite a few of them and
then you can see a few different options
here which is kind of cool so it's kind
of cool that they you know have things
that you can add to it instead of just
being stuck with the simple stuff that
you get when you first get it so that's
pretty cool
give them some bonus points for that
like I said guys the sound is not bad
it's pretty good
you might none you might not be able to
tell but it gets really really loud it's
hard shoulder video of course but it
gets loud guys so for a tiny little
speaker like this about in guys you saw
the new video I dropped with the iPad
pro case we'll check this out I got it
from sunny I got quite a few of them 50
of the exact 50 iPad pro cases I have to
go and recycle these or something
because there's no way I need this mini
I only need a one for the video but I
couldn't just get one had to get 50 so
but you got to find some way to recycle
all this stuff but what do you guys toss
on the iPad pro I saw in the video a lot
of you thought that it was going to be
kind of crazy if Apple came out with
something like this because it'd be too
big
I'm still very interested in seeing
something like this I think it'd be
pretty cool if they go about it the way
I'm speculating with like a possible
keyboard attachment or a USBC adapter
could be USBC on both sides who knows so
if you have it in landscape mode you can
still have USBC over here portrait USBC
over there I don't know but if Apple
does that
that'll be taking tablets one step
closer to fully functional laptops just
like Microsoft is doing so that would be
pretty cool but yeah that's about that
this is what I'm currently working on I
have to finish this up this is the wing
0 custom Gundam that I got last week and
the iMac behind it
it did that old iMac that I had before I
still need to get rid of this thing I
need to sell it but yeah I'm working on
this guy I need to finish building him
up I've got the head so far as well as
the body and the arm
I was just rx100 will focus a bit better
I think there's time I look into another
vlogging cameras I mean that autofocus
is a bit faster and better than the
rx100 this is just taking way too long
now I got it but it just takes too long
so I might be looking into another
vlogging camera but yeah that's about it
guys I think I'm gonna finish this up
I've got a lot of videos to work on this
week this week is going to be super busy
hopefully I get all the videos out that
I want this week I have like three
videos planned that's a lot of work so
can you think this cross hopefully I can
do it all but yeah that's about it guys
hopefully enjoyed this blog um
definitely check out the link down below
check out our sponsor for the video and
yeah we'll catch you in the next one
Harry is probably off doing whatever Ari
things she does but till next video guys
