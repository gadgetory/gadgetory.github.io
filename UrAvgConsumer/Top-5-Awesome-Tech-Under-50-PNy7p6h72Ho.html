consumer and I feel like it's been way
too long since last year average budget
video so here we have a new list of tech
under 50 bucks so let's kick start this
list with the corsair k55 RGB keyboard
i'm becoming a pretty big fan of
Corsairs keyboards and I personally use
their k95 mechanical keyboard but if
you're ballin on a budget you can go for
the K 55 and this key part pretty much
comes with everything that you need from
a number pad on the side to six
programmable macro keys to even RGB
lights if you have a special setup or
theme that you're going for this
keyboard can do it and it even has music
and volume controls above the number pad
which is definitely a nice touch now I
first thought that I was going to have
to use Corsair software in order to
customize this but I couldn't figure it
out and then I had to to read the manual
but within seconds I read that they have
pre selected color schemes and all you
have to do is to the FN key and the
numbers at the top row and you can
choose between the different things that
you want to go for if you're looking to
start your own cool little setup and you
need a nice keyboard without breaking
the bank
you absolutely have to look at the k55
and next up on this list we've got the
syllable V 900 meaning truly wireless
earbuds and the fact that truly wireless
earbuds can even make it to this list is
pretty insane have you seen the price of
those things but I gotta give a huge
shout to my father-in-law for actually
pushing me to pick this thing up because
they really weren't on my radar he
wanted completely wireless earbuds
without even the little strap on the
neck to keep them together and I
actually heard some of you guys request
those kind of earbuds as well so
actually gave these a try and was pretty
surprised by what you get for 50 bucks
and I'm not gonna sit here and say the
sound blew me away
I do wish it had a bit more bass but my
father-in-law liked it every tried him
out and said that she had no problem
with it so probably for the average
consumer you should be just fine with it
if you're looking for that experience
without wires it'll definitely do the
trick that was really cool about these
is that they come with a travel case
that also charges it and like most other
truly wireless earbuds since they're so
small they have limited battery life if
you have about two hours on a full
charge but when you put these inside
their travel case in about 30 minutes
you'll get all two hours back
you're ready to listen again and the
case has no juice for about six full
charges now if you don't care about a
truly wireless experience with your
earbuds and you still want a bluetooth
earbud that isn't expensive actually
Beach of these em pouch on another top
five video a novel link to that video
down below in the description but those
are ones that I really did enjoy so go
ahead and check that out if you're
interested now what kind of top five
video would this be without a portable
charger now don't get me wrong this
isn't just any old portable charger this
is actually the Belkin surge protector
with a built-in portable charger now
with the surge protector you can turn
one outlet into two and you also get a
USB port now in terms of battery we're
looking at about 3000 milliamp hours of
juice which doesn't seem like a lot but
it's enough to charge most phones at
least once but what I really love about
portable chargers like this guys is that
once you're done using it as a surge
protector you can just pull it out and
you're ready to use it as a portable
charger because it's been plugged into
the wall the whole time getting juice so
you don't have to ever worry about
actually going and charging this ready
to go portable chargers are always great
next up we've got this really cool
color-changing Bluetooth speaker by
drill Pro now this thing looks awesome
as a decorative piece I can imagine
three of these on a desk or maybe just
one somewhere in a room just to give it
a nice pop of color and it even features
a remote that you can cycle through all
the different colors that it features it
has some modes that cycle through all
the colors so if you want to switch it
up all the time you can do that I
honestly just think the thing looks
really really good but it also does work
as a Bluetooth speaker it's not the best
sound quality in the world the way the
two speakers are shaped though if you
throw this in a corner somewhere you'll
definitely get some amplified sound it
gets decently loud so you can use the
person listening to music with no
problem but definitely nothing high
quality 20 bucks guys okay you can't
honestly ship decent speaker but a more
amazing visual piece for any desk or
room setup and laughs on this list is
the man crow backpack I swear some of
these amazon item comes the worst names
and his backpack was actually featured
on the channel before you know what's in
my gadget backpack $300 challenge video
that I redid and I gotta admit I'm Loki
mad that she's the one who found it so
she gets all the credit for finding this
to a backpack now as you can see it
looks great it looks like a regular
standard backpack but it has some really
really key awesome features and of
course has a ton of compartments because
it can't possibly be considered a gadget
backpack without them now something that
really stands out about this backpack is
the fact that it has built-in security
if you happen to be using this as a
gadget backpack or you're just carrying
anything valuable on the inside you can
lock the zippers within the top lock and
make sure that nobody can sneak up
behind you and just feel your stuff this
is an awesome feature especially
especially containing anything expensive
but it doesn't stop there folks another
awesome feature that this thing has is a
built-in USB port now you're probably
wondering what is the back packing to
USB port for but it's actually pretty
genius if you happen to have a really
nice portable charger you can plug it
into the backpack and use that USB port
to charge your devices without actually
having to hold your portable charger so
that's one less thing to carry I think
that is genius it saves a lot of trouble
it's super simple and easily accessible
so I definitely like this feature and
the fact that it only cost about thirty
bucks is amazing but that about wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy or
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
so then it's your average consumer taste</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
