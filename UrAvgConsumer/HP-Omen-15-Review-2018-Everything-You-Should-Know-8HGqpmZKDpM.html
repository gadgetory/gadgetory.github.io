going on guys trap which consume right
and I am back in one of my favorite
places Micro Center and if you guys have
never heard of Micro Center they sell a
ton of cool tech inside of here but I
have a mission today I'm looking for an
HP omen and I'm gonna go see if I can go
find one all right guys this is the HP
omen now this guy right here is a gaming
laptop I'm not gonna lie this thing
looks it looks pretty solid I like the
way this thing looks so I'm excited to
pick this up but they have a ton of
other Intel based products here I think
as low as 629 bucks
so if you guys are interested in finding
out what cool devices that they've got
of course have links down below in the
description but this is what I'm here
for
so let's go pick it up
so my crescendo was cool always a good
time over there but what we have right
here guys is the HP omen this is the 15
inch version I gotta say guys after
spending a few days with it this is
actually a really impressive laptop for
the price it's a pretty good-looking
laptop definitely designed for gamers
you can see the aesthetics here are
definitely gamer oriented that black and
red the sharp edges all that carbon
fiber look so you can clearly see who
they made this thing for one thing about
those sharp edges though it does take a
little getting used to handling this
thing because these edges they actually
are pretty sharp not enough to hurt you
or anything like that it's definitely
not that sharp but when you pick it up
you might be surprised these parts are
actually pretty pointy but overall I do
like to design those bezels check this
out so it's a 15 inch 1080p display IPS
and the bezels are nice and thin looks
really good now in terms of ports on the
right side we've got one USB 3.1 port
and on the left side we've got another
USB 3.1 port as well as a headphone jack
and microphone jack and a built-in SD
card reader so pretty standard stuff but
you've also got IO in the back so in the
back we've got an Ethernet port another
USB 3.1 HDMI mini display and a
Thunderbolt 3 port which is actually
really surprising to see on a laptop in
this price range so this is like a mid
to your gaming laptop and usually
laptops around this price you don't find
Thunderbolt 3 ports so I was very
surprised and happy to see that here
Thunderbolt 3 is the truth now as laptop
cost
$10.99 million plus tax and that's
actually a really good price for the
spec that you get with it so we're
rocking an eighth generation Intel Core
i7 processor 16 gigs of ram you get a
256 SSD with a one terabyte hard drive
inside of here and in this price range
I'm actually surprised to see an eighth
generation Intel Core i7 in here that's
a very good processor and in a laptop
that's only a little bit more than a
thousand bucks and you also get an
nvidia gtx 1060 graphics card so if you
want to do some gaming you're definitely
gonna be able to do that here now I've
actually gained a lot with the 1060 on
my laptops and you're definitely not
gonna be able to max out
settings but you are gonna be able to
play with high in the settings for the
game still looks visually pleasing and
you still get really good performance my
boy Malcolm used it to play some
overwatch and he had to bring down the
settings just a little bit but he still
said it looked really good yes he's
using the controller because this guy
plays on the ps4 but the overall
experience he said he really enjoyed it
still now I'm not gonna lie I don't play
that many first-person shooters or even
anything online so all the games that I
played like titanfall 2 tales of
zestiria pretty much play offline so my
experience has been smooth always so I'm
very very happy with this and the 1080p
IPS display looks really good
even for just watching content so I
definitely like the package that you get
out of these and they have banging olsen
speakers and they're kind of located
right here so that's also a very very
nice bonus but another thing that I want
to point out is this trackpad the
trackpad is ok one thing I really can't
stand though is that you can't click
into it you do have to use the buttons
or do a double tap or a light tap or
something it's not a big deal I guess
I'm just kind of used to those trackpads
that you can kind of click in I do wish
that this did that overall for the
performance of the mouse is fine I just
wish that it had a clickable trackpad
and something you might have noticed
that this thing has a backlit keyboard
so you can go ahead and change the
colors of this this is actually an RGB
keyboard the keyboard is lit in
different zones so you can't
individually change keys to match a
certain color but I do think that it
still works pretty well and I have it on
red because obviously it's the whole
theme as far as the typing experience
goes it's actually really comfortable to
type on these keys have a decent amount
of travel so it definitely feels good
nice and quiet and what's nice is that
even though this is a 15-inch laptop you
also get a full number pad right here on
the side and the overall fit of this
keyboard and layout honestly I just love
it one thing though guys take a look at
this in just me handling it I clean this
thing off before we actually started
shooting and then just me handling it to
talk to you guys about it look at all
the fingerprints so that is something
you are definitely gonna have to get
used to I always keep a microfiber cloth
on deck
so I'm not always worried about that but
you will have to clean this guy up if
you really care about fingerprints and
that kind of stuff so it's something to
keep in mind one thing that's actually
really nice about this laptop is that it
is user upgradeable so that you can open
this thing up they've got little
Phillips screws all around very easy to
take this thing off and take a look at
what's inside one thing I will say these
fans are massive and they do make a good
bit of noise even when you aren't doing
too much on the computer you do hear
them kick up which I'm not too crazy
about but for the most part you kind of
get used to it but the fans I get pretty
loud but overall guys I really did enjoy
using this laptop especially for the
price I think this is a really good
value you get some really great specs
honestly this laptop is probably gonna
be the first thing I recommend for
someone who's looking for a mid tier
gaming laptop back in multitask has a
good display has a good body this is
probably going to be that one that I say
Oh HP omen 15 so this is a really really
good laptop very surprised great value
but if you guys want to check this thing
out I'll of course have it linked down
below in the description I'll have a
link to micro Center where they've got
really really good deals going on with
this and a bunch of other Intel products
this is definitely something you're
gonna want to look out for if you want a
gaming laptop for Christmas or something
but that about wraps up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guard girl I give this video
a thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in
the next one
till then it's your average consumer
