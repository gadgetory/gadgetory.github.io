consumer and these are the best
accessories for the ps4 in 2018
now we already did one of these videos
please switch this year so you know the
Xbox one and the PC version is going to
be coming out soon so thumbs up we're
very excited for that so first up we got
to take a look at some brand new
headsets from the folks over at
SteelSeries now I've talked about
SteelSeries a ton on the channel so when
they reached out and asked to sponsor a
video and send me the newest ps4
headsets before they got released
you knew I was all over that so let me
introduce you guys to the SteelSeries
arc this pro with a game tag and the
arcus Pro Wireless now the whole idea
behind their new line is to have audio
catch-up to the huge leaps that we're
seeing with graphics and visuals so
we've got the arctas Pro here which is a
wired headset and comes with a game DAC
and for my average consumers out there
who aren't familiar with Dax they're
pretty much where you get your audio
from from various devices and while you
can get audio from your ps4 controller
it is definitely not the best source and
that's where this comes in with is that
you'll be hearing tighter bass
individual sound effects will be more
distinct and the positional audio will
be a lot more accurate which will be
awesome for first-person shooters and
open-world games and this is a pretty
high quality USB DAC so the audio you
get from this will sound great and it
even works with PCs and I gotta say guys
these sounds awesome but not only do
they sound good but they also look good
as well
I thought these don't have that crazy
gaming headset look but they do have
some nice LEDs though and you guys know
how I feel about that now there's also a
wireless version as well but there are
two differences you have a wireless
transmitter with an OLED display for
your ps4 instead of the game dock and it
includes bluetooth so if you want to use
it with other devices you can take these
on the go
second is no LEDs but personally I love
wireless gaming headsets especially when
they've got this nice black stealthy
look going for it so if you guys are
interested in checking out SteelSeries
as new ps4 headsets I'll have them
linked down below and now we've got to
talk about some dope controllers I found
these pretty cool ones from Walmart
there's a clear blue that's personally
my favorite kind of reminds me of the
ps2 days back when they had the clear
controllers they've got red as well and
a couple of other options and if you
want to go a completely different route
maybe customize your own version color
where's where you need to go to get your
controller looking exactly
you want it this is my current version
and I love the stain color does a great
job painting these things it looks like
it came right from Sony and the next
thing is an accessory for an accessory
and here we've got the ps4 chat booths
chat pad try saying that five times
faster but if you're playing a game
we're chatting is important or maybe a
message of friends a lot or even if you
like to stream from your ps4 onto twitch
this is a really nice option all you do
is pop this thing into your controller
and you've still got access to your
headphone jack or if you want you can
even use it separately because it is
powered by bluetooth so you can use it
on its own without even having connected
to your controller and this thing's got
a built-in battery so if you want to
extend the battery life of your
controller this is a really nice option
I personally think it's very comfortable
to use in the hand I have no issues
playing games while having this
connected to my controller I just think
it's cool to have access to a full-blown
keyboard right at the bottom of your
controller whenever you want it and next
up we've got a pretty simple accessory
but it's very useful and here we have a
power a charging station for the
standard ps4 controller and I just love
having these things around because you
know exactly where to put your
controller when you're done playing and
while you're doing that you know it's
gonna get charged up you don't have to
look for any micro USB cables or
anything like that just put it in when
you're done charge it up and it's ready
to go for your next session an
additional piece you throw on your
controllers to make it all work is very
small so it's not a big bulky accessory
it's very nice compact and it doesn't
get in the way and next up is something
I think is really important if you get a
lot of digital games this is a four
terabyte Seagate hard drive made
especially for the PlayStation 4 if the
black and blue theme didn't give that
away but this thing is made to work with
the ps4 so as you throw it in you get it
hooked up
and those exactly what to do with the
operating system and you've got access
to another 4 terabytes so that means you
can throw your games on there and your
save files everything that you need to
access on your ps4 you can have it right
on this hard drive and I personally
think that digital games are the way to
go now it makes it easy to access from
multiple consoles
I feel like physical copies are just
good for collector's editions but once
you get your hands on one of these I
thought you're gonna have a hard time
worrying about space and you no longer
have to go ahead and delete those games
to get new games on your system this is
just the way to go but that's about it
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it and if you did be the cool
guy girl that gives video
thumbs up definitely stay tuned for the
Xbox one version as well as the PC
version coming soon but till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
