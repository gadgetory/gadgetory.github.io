gonna kick things off with the games
Vanguard and this is probably one of my
favorite pieces of tech on this list
it's a portable gaming environment
that'll allow you to play your favorite
gaming console practically anywhere it
has a briefcase design and when you open
it up you'll find a 19 inch 720p display
which I found more than adequate for
such a unique gaming setup you get some
standard monitor controls for brightness
contrast and a lot more as well as some
equalizer settings for the built-in
speakers what's also pretty cool is that
you can plug in some headphones
considering you might be playing this in
places that may need a little more quiet
it comes with two pouches that will go
on the sides of your console so you can
carry your controllers and cables this
is the perfect little system if you're
looking to play your console and
somewhere you normally wouldn't be able
to or even if you want to change a pace
and don't want to sit in front of your
TV it's also tons of fun to take this
guy out and meet up with some friends
and let them enjoy some gaming without
having to be stuck at home I personally
love being able to lazy up in bed and
still enjoy my fun next up we've got the
ring video doorbell ring brings the
people to a whole new level with a wide
angle HD camera that allows you to see
who's at your door without even going to
it it comes with a companion app that
you can find on both iOS and Android
that sends video feed of who's at your
door directly to your phone through the
use of Wi-Fi this means that no matter
where you are you can answer your door
and even have two-way communication with
your visitor it's perfect for those of
us who get a ton of packages and we just
want to tell the delivery man just leave
it at the door it even comes with
everything you'll need for installation
right in the packaging so it doesn't
have to be a scary process getting this
all hooked up you can use this as a
standalone doorbell to your device and
it'll run on the built-in battery or you
can hardwire it to your existing
doorbell system which was super simple
and you won't have to worry about it and
honestly I think that's the best route
to go so everyone at home can know when
someone's at
or it has a ton of other features you
can take advantage of like cloud
recording motion detection night vision
and tons more so if you want to up your
smart home game this is definitely the
place to start now let's talk about the
IOT easy flex this is a wireless car
mount charger and it's one of those
little gems I've stumbled across that I
didn't expect to be so good if your
phone supports Wireless Qi charging this
is pretty amazing it comes with a micro
USB cable to give it the juice it needs
to charge your device and it makes it
super simple to just drop your phone
into the mount and it starts charging
instantly this is super convenient and
two knocks out needing to find a cable
or a place to put your phone wallis
charging one thing I really love about
this is the ability to use any size
phone with it from a smaller phone like
the galaxy s6 to the obnoxious Nexus 6 I
haven't had any issues fitting phones
into here and that's even factoring in
cases you're able to open up the hinges
and lock your phone in when you place it
on the center button it's also super
flexible so you'll be able to position
this any way you might need you can even
spin it upside down when you're looking
to charge your phone that doesn't
support Wireless Chi
another neat little trick I like to use
with this is throwing my Moto 360 on
there when it's running low on battery
this thing has definitely been clutch
and here we've got the same glide pulse
a smart LED with a built-in Bluetooth
speaker now I've reviewed this in the
past so some of you may have heard of it
but it's definitely an awesome piece of
tech that surprised me to know even
existed when plugged into your standard
light bulb socket this thing gets all
the power it needs to start functioning
making it completely wireless with the
companion app you're able to have full
control of each bulb and its speaker you
can power it on or off increase or
decrease your brightness and even
control the volume of the music you play
from it the speaker performance is
pretty good but what's really amazing
about it is that you're able to add up
to seven bulbs to a master bulb
giving you a total of eight bulbs for
some ridiculous surround sound outfit in
an entire room with these and I'm sure
your neighbors will hate you the bulb
itself is a little on the larger side
but it's a seamless integration of cool
tech that doesn't take up any room since
every home already has a place for it
and last but not least we have Netgear
and 300 Wi-Fi extend
and this does exactly what the name
implies by plugging this into a power
outlet somewhere in the middle of where
your current router and where you want
to receive signal you'll be able to
extend the signal of your Wi-Fi well
this little device does is lock on to
the Wi-Fi signal you're looking to
extend and creates a new extended
network I've seen my connection strength
almost double when using this guy this
thing has been a lifesaver for me with
some of my gaming consoles I have them
in this enclosure above my desk which
tends to limit the signal strength they
receive so having a closer signal is
great this little guy is especially
useful for larger homes where certain
spots lose signal strength or if you
just have some walls that cause
interference another awesome feature is
being able to use an Ethernet cable
directly from the n300 to your device
for a more stable connection and that
about wraps up for this top five list of
awesome tech but you might have noticed
that a lot of these devices can help to
build up a pretty awesome smart home but
there's actually a device that I think
should get an honorable mention and
that's just because it's not out yet and
I'm talking about the only smart home
system the Lummi plans to make it crazy
simple to smarten up your home by making
it easy to add and control smart devices
with a simple tap you can add things
like smart bulbs a controllable power
outlet HD streaming devices and tons
more and everything is controlled by
UMI's edge-to-edge glass remote and it
features a touch screen that allows you
to control everything you've got hooked
up to the system we'll be one step
closer to living like Iron Man and so
far it looks like it's going to be very
easy to use and I love that they're
looking to provide so many options it's
currently in the crowdfunding phase but
it picked up a ton of traction so far
I'll have links down below in the
description to their IndieGoGo campaign
if you guys want to learn more about the
Lummi smart home or maybe even get your
pre-order in and I'll also have links
down below for all the other products
that I mentioned in this video but till
the next video guys your average
consumer ace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
