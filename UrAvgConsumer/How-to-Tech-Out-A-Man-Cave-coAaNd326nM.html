consumer and today I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to take out a man cave or a
lady cave whatever you want to call it
but today I'm gonna be showing you guys
the basics the things you're gonna want
to know about what you should be looking
out for when you're starting to set up
your man cave so 101 class you could
think of it intro course the first thing
we're gonna start off with guys is it TV
everybody knows that the TV is the
center of the mancave this is where you
watch stuff you entertain people you
play your video games this is the main
attraction now things you're gonna want
to look out for let's break it down into
three different terms
we've got 4k and that's the craze
nowadays is the highest resolution it's
pretty mainstream now so you can get TVs
that aren't too expensive with that
feature you're definitely gonna want
that for the mancave and you've got
stuff like HDR which means high dynamic
range and for my average consumers out
there that pretty much means you're
gonna get way better picture quality
colors are gonna look more vibrant
you're gonna be able to see details in
places that are really dark and bright
in the shot so you're gonna see a lot
more detail a lot more vibrancy it's
just a better clean looking image and
the third and last term you're gonna
want to keep in mind is OLED now I'm
sure you've heard of LCD panels LED OLED
is that next level up but all that is
typically on the more expensive side of
things but there are some really nice
benefits to having an OLED TV like
really dark blacks getting better
viewing angles so that's something
you're gonna want to keep in mind but
you don't need to spend a ton of money
to get really good picture quality this
is a TV that I got like last year has 4k
has HDR you probably get it under a
thousand bucks nowadays but you can find
TVs from the range of like five hundred
dollars and you can spend as much as you
want depending on the kind of quality
you want I'm gonna have some links down
below in the description to give you
guys an idea of what's out there in all
different kinds of price ranges but all
that aside the main two things you're
gonna want to future-proof your mancave
4k HDR and you're probably gonna want
something fifty inches plus to really
take advantage of that 4k resolution I
mean honestly guys you ever seen flowers
of this pretty
huh and one thing please guys make sure
I have small bezels you don't want
anybody coming up in the mancave seeing
giant bezels you think you got an old TV
and nowadays your TV's with some pretty
decent built-in speakers but I promise
you nothing beats having a dedicated
sound bar this one right here is the
sony HT st 5000 and this guy is packin
Dolby Atmos now Dolby Atmos is gonna be
something you want to pay attention to
just like you worry about 4k HDR and all
that stuff for the TV Dolby Atmos is
what you want for your sound bar and
gotta give you a huge shout out to Dolby
Atmos for sponsoring today's video so
now I know you're probably wondering
what is Dolby Atmos so let me show you
guys up front here you can see our array
of speakers we got some going from left
to right this is what's gonna be sending
audio directly towards you but not only
do you have these set of speakers but
with Dolby Atmos you also get speakers
built into the top of the sound bar and
what these do is they send audio
directly upward so it bounces off the
ceiling hits you and you've got a 3d
immersive sound experience all from one
sound bar and this is a pretty
interesting version of surround sound
you're not just getting that audio
firing towards you or maybe even behind
you from external speakers you're
getting it towards you and overhead
which is a completely different
experience and the Xbox actually has a
Dolby Atmos app so that you can go ahead
and jump in and experience dolby atmos
with these little demos so it's meant to
sound exactly like you'd experience the
sound in the real world so like you'll
see in this video you'll see shards of
glass moving across the screen and
baseballs flying but I'm gonna show you
guys what the difference is between the
TV speakers and this sound bar
you'll hear a slightly battered and
bruised baseball fly master right here
as a cloud of debris blooms insurance of
glass tray overhead
just looking gravity takes hold and
there you have it folks
dad is the difference and just like
we've seen 4k content come to apps like
Netflix you can find dolby atmos on
netflix vudu of course blu-rays and
there's a growing library of things so
just look for that little symbol next to
the title and you know it supports it
and I say all of that to say you
definitely want Dolby Atmos in your
mancave
if you're looking for a particular sound
bar this sony one is a very very nice
option but you don't have to go with
this one there's a bunch of different
sound bars in different price ranges
that feature Dolby Atmos so I'm gonna
have links down below in the description
so you can get a variety of price ranges
that fit your budget now in terms of
content it is 2017 so if you're getting
a 4k HDR TV very high chance it's going
to be a smart TV so you're gonna have
access to Netflix Hulu all of those apps
that already give you content but there
are still good reasons to get different
kinds of set-top boxes Xbox one for
example this is the 1s the 1s gives you
access to 4k apps as well as HDR and the
reason why I think this is still a good
pickup is because you get the Xbox one
Kinect there's nothing like walking into
the man cave and just saying xbox on
turning on your xbox turning on your TV
you can say Xbox go to Netflix Xbox go
to Hulu and then it'll just do that you
can go ahead and impress your friends
when they're over it it makes things a
lot easier you don't have to look for
your remote and let's not forget it's a
console so you gotta have some games in
the mancave baby you gotta have set in
the peano sit back relax and enjoy so
not only is it great for just
entertainment and content consumption
but you have to play games on it it's a
win-win oh but Jud I don't want to
connect - watch me
I don't play games well I got you fan
you can always pick up one of the new
Apple TV's now this is great because it
works with 4k HDR as well and you get
access to a cool remote where you can
talk to Siri let it know what you want
to watch Siri show me some action movies
in 4k
and you can see it reads it right there
gives you a bunch of titles and I really
like the idea of having Siri on hand in
the man cave because it just makes
finding content a lot easier we've all
been there where you're searching for
something to watch on Netflix or any of
those apps your food's getting cold you
just search in search and search and
you're spending more time looking than
actually watching so this you just kind
of tell it what you're looking for and
then pulls it right up
that is a very clutch feature and of
course it supports 4k HD are all the
stuff that you will expect with a new
system like this and another nice
benefit of having an Apple TV is the
fact that you get access to Apple music
so if you've got a really nice sound bar
you can listen to your music directly
from it and of course this being an
Apple TV that means you're gonna get
access to a ton of apps you got an app
store where you can just download
whatever you want
so if apps are a big thing for you you
got them right here on your television
so pick a set-top box that works best
for you just make sure that they do
support 4k and HDR can't miss those now
if you still want access to voice
controls but you don't want to use your
xbox a little combo that I've shown
before in the past is getting an Amazon
echo dot or any kind of Amazon echo and
getting your hands on a Logitech Harmony
home hub so with this little combo you
can speak to your echo and control your
television so I can say things like turn
off the TV and you can also use it to
control other things like changing the
channel opening up Netflix all kinds of
stuff so if you want that voice control
that's a really nice option and not only
that you also get access to controlling
your TV right from your smartphone
through the Harmony app so if you can't
find your remote you don't have to worry
you know what your smart phone is I'm
sure you do
so that'll give you access to
controlling all of your television
controls right from your phone and the
Logitech Harmony home and the echo is a
pretty inexpensive combination that
gives you access to a lot of controls
not to mention that the Amazon echo will
give you access to a ton of smart
devices that you can implement within
your mancave but that's for another
video but this has been my little crash
course on the kind of technology you're
gonna want to look out for when you're
up your mancave you don't have to go for
these exact items that I've shown in
this video but there are a ton of
different price points and different
options that you can go for I'll have a
bunch link down below in all the
different categories that I mentioned so
if you enjoyed this video be the cool
guy or girl that gives it a thumbs up
let me know if you're interested in a
part two where I go over other things
that you can do in the mancave
but till then guys your average consumer
