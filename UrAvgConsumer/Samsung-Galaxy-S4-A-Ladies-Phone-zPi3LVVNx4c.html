consumer and today I've got a bit of a
special video for you guys as we all
know the Samsung Galaxy s4 has just been
released and there have been some
changes with this one in comparison to
the last one the screen size being one
of them it's now got a 5-inch display
and for a lot of us guys five inches is
fine some might even think it's too big
but I really wanted to know what a
female's perspective would be so I
wanted to give you guys some input so if
you want to get this for your girlfriend
or your mom or if you're a girl watching
this you guys can get some input on with
some other ladies thing so I went around
and asked a couple of random females and
see what their opinions were and here's
what they had to say was not wasting any
time
let's get right into it so here we have
Ariel answering some questions for us
and we'll have some other ladies
answering as well so the first question
is what are your first impressions of
the galaxy s4 my first impressions all
right definitely it's really light it's
a lot lighter than I thought it would be
looking at it it's a really big phone so
it just was surprisingly light it's
really been it's been yeah it's it's
slim it's really light
it's just nice there's nothing much to
it though it's not like really pretty or
anything there's nothing special about
this technically just a regular phone
the back is kind of like looks kind of
cheap design it's very light it's very
light it's very thin which is nice
alright so now what about the screen
size they made the screen a bit bigger
so what do you think do you think it's
too big like and like how very vibrant
well now that I have the s3 it doesn't
oh okay I had like a really small like
flip phone like a Samsung
that basically is like a third of the
size and the first time I got the s3 I
thought it was really huge but now that
I had at the s4 same time okay so coming
from an s3 this doesn't seem like it's
too bad so that's good to hear
yeah I mean I really like smaller phones
that I mean I'm an iPhone person so this
definitely feels big to me because I
usually throw my phone in my pocket I
don't think I'm here pain compared to my
having the HTC One S I think it is I
think it is definitely a little too big
for me but this is what I'm used to so
alright there's quite a difference it's
a quite a difference there I don't know
how big the iPhone is I feel like the
iPhone is probably like that do you see
this this this feels better this is just
I would definitely if I had to pick one
I would pick the iPhone it's pretty bad
it's okay to be honest yeah we can put
them in pocket but it was like a badge
or something that's fine I think they
should make it smaller couldn't they cut
off like an inch so what do you think
about the holding it to your face using
it as a phone of course do you think
it'd be too big this this feels like I'm
like yeah this feels I mean even in
comparison that feels weird but you know
how about making like a voice call do
you think you'd feel weird having it to
your face no okay well that's good to
hear
yeah having that to your head
well no it just seems like we're going
backwards you know things were getting
smaller and smaller but now they're
getting bigger it feels like it's level
with your mouth okay
so overall it's not too bad it's very
light right because they did change the
size a little bit you got a little bit
bigger mm-hmm doesn't even notice right
and all right guys there we saw some
opinions from a couple of ladies on how
they felt about the galaxy s4 some felt
the size was okay some felt it was too
big those who have experience with I
guess bigger phones don't seem to think
it's that big a deal but some did but
overall those were stuck a couple of
opinions for those of you who might be
interested in buying this for your
girlfriend your sister your mom whatever
of course it doesn't mean all females
will feel the same as these ladies but
just wanted to give you guys some
insight there and all right guys that's
about it for this video there'll be tons
more galaxy s4 videos there'll be tons
of galaxy s4 videos to come so stay
tuned for that and I'll catch you guys
in the next one till then it's your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
