want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with dad which consumer
in mind all right let's get to another
tech video what's going on everyone at
your average consumer today I have a
review for you guys on the 2012 MacBook
Air all right let's not waste any time
let's get right into it so here we have
the 2012 MacBook Air and here are the
listed specs for those of you who are
interested but I'm not going to be
talking too much about the specs because
I want to keep this video average
consumer ready but a few things have
changed on this MacBook Air and a couple
of them are the new USB 3.0 ports that
are included here so now the new USB 3.0
means you'll be able to use 3.0 devices
such as like new hard drives or flash
drives with this computer and you'll be
able to do faster data transfer speeds
pretty much like you can move your files
between the computer and the device a
lot a lot faster now the second change
is the new MagSafe connector so here we
have the new MacBook Air max a charger
and I believe the MacBook Pro uses this
as well and here you can see it compared
to the old one so they're a bit
different the new ones a bit flatter and
wider so that means that if you've had
an old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air and
you still have the chargers chances are
you won't be able to use these as a
replacement or anything for the new Mac
the books another welcome change to the
MacBook Air is that it not the 720p
FaceTime HD camera and as you can see
here I'm video chatting with my
girlfriend wah she eats an apple and you
can see the clarity is pretty nice on
there so I definitely think people who
are video chatting and things like that
will definitely be happy with the
quality that they'll be getting with
this now enough about the changes let's
talk a bit about the performance of the
actual MacBook now this thing has wowed
me as far as performance goes it's one
of the fastest computers I've ever used
ever and I really think that has a lot
to do with the solid-state drive
now that's also called the SSD for short
but the solid-state drive is basically
your hard drive and your storage so
where you place your photos your music
videos all that kind of stuff this is
where it's placed so it's just like your
hard drive and the main difference is
the way that they're built your typical
hard drive has like a mechanical it's
like a mechanical piece of machinery and
it has like a spinning disk that reads
the data that you have on there so
usually when you hear your computer
humming or you feel it humming it's the
hard drive spinning it also could be the
fans but that humming is usually from
the hard drive spinning but with this
they're built the hard drive space is
actually made with flash memory chips so
their little memory chips that are
placed on the insides of the computer
and this is a lot better because that
means there's no mechanical or spinning
parts inside which makes it a lot safer
so that means you can move this around
and not really worry about messing up
anything now
what's also great about this is that it
increases the speed of your computer
drastically and I think that's really
what makes this one so fast I can open
up I can open a application here and it
opens almost instantly
whereas a hard drive it will take a bit
longer and I can definitely see the
difference in using my macbook air
compared to my macbook pro as my macbook
pro has a regular standard um hard drive
and it definitely takes a lot longer to
open up applications and files so
there's definitely a big difference
there and I'm able to see it between the
two and it's funny because my macbook
pro is actually actually has much better
specs than my macbook air but the
solid-state drive makes all the
difference so I definitely think a
solid-state drive is what pushes this to
be as great as it is and just so you
guys know the saw state drive is similar
to that of the things inside of your
smartphones like
in your smartphone's SD cards anything
portable really it uses flash memory not
really the regular hard drives that you
are typically finding computers or
external portable hard drives so it's
similar to that and it really makes this
great for traveling because like I said
before you can move this around without
worrying about any pieces malfunctioning
and it just really makes this great for
someone who's traveling a lot or moving
from room to room all the time
so this definitely helps with the
portability of the MacBook Air so for
those of you who want this for just
regular everyday use such as like things
like browsing you know watching some
videos on YouTube and other things like
that opening Word documents this is
definitely gonna be good for you at the
base model I don't think you have to
upgrade anything if you don't plan on
doing any using any really heavy
programming like on video editing or
things like that or Photoshop if you
have for if you're planning on using
Photoshop and things of that nature like
those heavy programs I would I would
suggest upgrading the RAM from four
gigabytes from the base model to eight
gigabytes because the thing about the
air is that once you get once you
purchase it there's no going back you
can't add any more specs to it or
anything like that there's no upgrading
it so it's best to make sure you know
what you want to use when you're
purchasing this so that you can get this
right specs right from the jump because
that's you only get one shot for those
of you who are a little concerned about
the solid-state drive not having as much
storage space as a regular hard drives
you can always get an external hard
drive for very cheap nowadays you can
find the one terabyte external hard
drive for like a hundred bucks depending
on where you're looking so storage space
really shouldn't be too much of a
problem for the speed that this thing
gives you and as for using the base
model for things like Final Cut Pro and
those video editing software I've been
able to do that much better than my
macbook pro actually but it doesn't
leave much space to do anything else
because the lack of RAM but I've been
able to use it really quickly faster
than my macbook pro primarily because of
the solid-state drives being able to
read all the files that I'm using
at once pretty quickly so I definitely
think it's doable I'm doing it myself
but had I known that I wouldn't be able
to upgrade any of the parts I would have
opted for the aging Ram version and
pretty much that wraps up my review of
the MacBook Air guys it's a really great
laptop I would definitely suggest it for
anyone who's interested it's great for
college use great for everyday browsing
and it can even be great for the some of
those heavier programs as long as you
make sure your specifications reach the
requirements of those programs all right
