consumer and the question everyone is
asking right now is which is better the
air pods that everyone knows and loves
or the new Samsung Galaxy buds so this
video is gonna tell you everything you
need to know about both now the first
thing you're gonna want to know of
course is the price so with the air pods
we're looking at one hundred and sixty
bucks while the galaxy buds are one
hundred and thirty dollars so if price
is a big deal you can save thirty bucks
with the galaxy buds but of course
there's more to the story than just a
price now air buds are very personal
items people see them on you so looks
are very important and with the air pods
people used to laugh at these people
used to laugh at the air pots but now
they are a status symbol and you guys
can see they have that classic look or
like something is hanging out of the
here so some people love it some people
hate it I'm not crazy about them I do
think the galaxy buds look a bit better
and honestly design wise you got to have
a specific ear to really comfortably fit
the air pods I am NOT someone who can
wear them comfortably they fall out of
my ear all the time because of my ear
shape you guys can see I don't really
have a hook for the stem of the air pods
to kind of chill on so if your ears
don't happen to have that hook shape
this might not be a good option for you
since you don't have anything for that
stem to kind of hook on to now when it
comes to the galaxy buds these are as
much as you'll see they are very very
tiny so there's no stem there's nothing
like that they just go right inside of
your ear now some people aren't crazy
about in ear buds because they have this
little piece that goes inside of like
the ear canal not everyone's crazy about
that but for someone like me this what
helps keeps the ear buds inside of my
ear so obviously looks are subjective
but when it comes to the actual design
of these two I think that the galaxy
buds will fit a lot more people than the
ear pods will now real quick let's talk
about the looks of the cases the galaxy
buds pretty much look like a giant pill
while the air pods look like their box
of dental floss so you can kind of pick
your poison here but I honestly think
that the air pods have a nicer case only
because it is just so much easier to
Ben just pop it open like that while the
galaxy buds you kind of need two hands
to easily do it it's definitely not as
easy as just pop and open the earpods in
terms of colors for both the earbuds and
the case apple offers only white air
pods that is all you can get unless you
hit up the folks over at color where
they're the ones who customize this put
my logo on it made the ear pods
themselves different colors you can
pretty much pick whatever color you want
if you guys are interested in getting
custom ear pods really want to flex and
show you not a broke boy
I'll have the link down below in the
description but when it comes to the
galaxy buds you get a few options you
get the prism white I believe prism
black is an option and yellow but
without color where being involved you
get three color options from Samsung and
just one from Apple now when it comes to
the set of process and pairing both of
these earbuds they're honestly both
stupid simple so for the air pods and I
think there's the ones who introduce
this all you have to do is hit open the
case and then you'll see it pop right up
on your iphone and the very first time
you pair this all you have to do is hit
connect and then boom you're done and
when it comes to the galaxy buds all you
do is pop them open and then you just
wait for it to show up on this you hit
connect and then it is gonna pair it up
just like that now these weren't
actually paired to the phone when I
started this but otherwise look open
them up and then it'll just pop right up
on the screen just like that so pretty
much the exact same setup process but I
will say the very first time that you
pair the galaxy buds you will have to
hit allow for a few of the settings
because that's how Android is but after
that it's a simple connect and you're
good to go
now question a lot of people are asking
is can you use galaxy buds with an
iPhone or can you use air pods with like
an Android device and the answer is yes
you can use both of these earbuds with
pretty much any device that has
bluetooth now when it comes to that set
of process for the Galaxy buds you just
pop them open and then you go into your
Bluetooth settings and then you should
see them at the bottom of your list I
already have mines here so I can just
hit galaxy buds and boom it's connected
so setting this up is extreme
simple for all devices I really like
that now the air pods it does have a
little button here in the back so all
you have to do is press this and then
you go into your Bluetooth settings and
then right there you'll see it on your
list of Bluetooth devices you click it
and then it'll start pairing so boom
honestly very simple process for both
they can work with either platform so
they're both solid in that regard and
for both earbuds you pair one device at
a time but something that the galaxy
buds don't have that the Apple earpods
do is the w1 chip now with the w1 chip
it pretty much syncs to your iCloud
account so if you have an iPhone and
iPad a macbook pro you can actually use
this on all of those devices just by
going into your settings and selecting
that as your music option or audio
option now when it comes to messaging
around with the settings for both of
these devices you don't really get many
options for the air pod you can change
the name you can change what happens
when you tap the left or right arrow pod
so right here you can see you can select
Siri play and pause your music skip to
the next track go to the previous track
or have it do nothing at all so that is
all you get this is pretty much all of
your settings for the air pods while the
galaxy buds has an entire app dedicated
to it and with this app you can actually
control a few things you can change the
equalizer to kind of change up the sound
quality that you're getting out of them
maybe you just want to hear vocals
really well you can jump into clear
maybe you want that bass you can jump
into there so you don't have to go and
find equalizer settings within the phone
itself you can just do it right from the
app if you were trying to do that with
the air pods you'd have to go into like
the sound section of the iPhone and kind
of mess around there it'll also let you
control what happens with the touch pad
just like what we saw with the air pods
now another one of the features that you
can access from the Galaxy buds app is
ambient sound and that's something that
we're seeing with a lot of Bluetooth
headphones these days where it allows
you to hear what's going on around you
and that's kind of nice for a pair of
earbuds because these really seal off
the outside environment so you can be
able to hear what's going on around you
I'm not gonna lie to you guys it's ok I
found that everything that
I want to hear has to be really close so
if I want to hear someone they've got to
be like sitting right next to me so yeah
it's okay you'd probably be able to hear
like a car coming if you're a jog or
something so there's that benefit but I
personally like to use it a bit more for
voices and I found that it was just
alright in that regard and I think the
last feature which is a very important
feature that I want to mention here is
define my buds feature the air pods
actually have that feature built into
the Find My iPhone feature so you can go
ahead jump into that app and then make
the ear buds ring so that in case one of
them has fallen out your ears you can
find them and you also have that same
feature on the Galaxy buds although I
don't see myself using this unless I
just misplace it but if you happen to
drop one or something you can use to
find my buds feature and it'll make it
ring as well
now of course we've got to talk about
the sound quality and you'd be surprised
you'd think that the air pods are just a
wireless version of the ear pods but
they actually sound pretty good
you get really clear vocals not so crazy
on the bass so if you want that thumping
you're not gonna get it here but the
overall sounds great I don't think
anybody would really complain unless
they're looking for a fuller more rich
sound but for the average person I think
they'll be pretty fun with it now when
it comes to the Galaxy buds I personally
like them a bit more the vocals aren't
as clear or I should say as loud as with
the air pods but they still sound very
clear you definitely get a lot more bass
and honestly with the way that the
galaxy budget designed because they're
in ear buds they'll be able to stay deep
inside of the ear and you have a
complete seal so you're pretty much
hearing every piece of audio from the
actual buds while with the air pods they
can't really be completely sealed inside
of the ear it allows for a lot more
sound to escape your ear canal so
someone who's wearing a pair of ear pods
the person next to them will be able to
hear their music a lot easier than
someone who's listening to a pair of
galaxy buds but I will say I think the
air pods are a bit louder you hear those
vocals more clearly but with the galaxy
buds you hear some of that bass a bit
more itself now I know you guys want to
know about the battery life and how long
can actually be able to use these
earbuds and
galaxy buds have about six hours of
battery life and the air pods five but
what makes these things special is that
they have these charging cases so that
they charge them when you're not using
them and the galaxy buds have seven hour
charging case while the air pods have a
20 hour charging case so you'll be able
to get a lot more juice out of your air
pod case than you would with the galaxy
Bud but the galaxy buds does have a
special feature in that it can
wirelessly charge and check this out
guys so I have a wireless charger right
here I can just kind of throw this guy
on and have it charge wirelessly which
is just absolutely insane and what's
special about this is that the new
Galaxy S 10 and S 10 plus have wireless
charging built into the phones
themselves so you don't even need to use
a USB type-c cable or anything like that
you just take the phone itself do it on
top if I got my setting on all right so
I turn the setting on so you can take
your Galaxy S 10 go it on top and boom
you are wirelessly charging you see out
with a red light that means we are good
to go so now you guys learned everything
you need to about these two now comes
down to what I think of them which one I
like more and honestly I'm gonna have to
go with the galaxy buds now the air pods
I love their convenience with the iPhone
I use iPhones primarily so I've been
trying to make these things work so
badly like you guys have no idea I've
tried and now that this is so easy to
pair with the iPhone it is it's a
cakewalk I have no issues pairing I can
just use them whenever I want without
having to jump into my setting it's just
a very nice experience and these stay in
my ears with no issues y'all and I'm not
worried about losing one I like the
sound quality from these a bit more to
because they have a lot more bass
honestly these are just the better
option for me now the question is are
you still a broke boy if you don't have
air pods and you have galaxy buds I
don't know you take the chance buy them
and find out if you get called broke but
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that gives this video
a thumbs up I'm gonna catch you guys to
the next one till then it's your average
consumer
