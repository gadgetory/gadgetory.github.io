want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at your average consumer and
today I'm finally going to be doing an
unboxing of the beats by dre pros now
you guys have been asking me a lot when
am I gonna unbox and review these things
so I got my hands on them and I figured
why not start today
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the beats pros and you can see here
that this is the monster version and
this is all they had at Best Buy and
have the new one but I'm actually more
than fine with that because if it's
anything like the new solo HDS that are
you know beats by Tori only no monster
is gonna be the exact same thing the
only difference was the missing branding
for a monster the quality was the same
the chords were the same everything was
the same - the UM branding wire set of
monster so enough about that this is um
pretty much the box
pretty standard beat stuff nothing you
haven't seen already
alright so let's jump into this unboxing
let's try and get this thing open a bit
and get that open there's another one at
the bottom so now that we have those off
we'll be able to slide off the top gets
us to the little red box and let's open
it up this keyboard out the way open
this up so we're not really used to
seeing this little plastic thing
covering the headphones usually inside
of the case so that's a little different
um inside we have some manuals and
booklets and we've got a black
microfiber cloth here and you know it
just dawned on me that the solo HDS the
news releases didn't come
with a microfiber cloth these microfiber
cloths are branded by monster so I'm
wondering if that's the reason why it
was excluded so maybe the new ones won't
be coming with microfiber cloths anymore
I'm not too sure but that's something
you guys might be able to tell me if
you've got some of the new ones and here
we have the cable to like DJ cable with
the coil and give you guys a close-up of
what this looks like okay so here we
have b2 cable this is a very long cable
mind you it's very long and this coil
makes it even longer so you can kind of
stretch away from something if you will
have to which is pretty nice um it also
has the beats branding here is a really
nice cable then I say these are these
feel like metal so that's pretty nice
and here you have this little converter
I'm not sure how what size this is in
order to show what they are but no just
a 3.5 millimeter but I know you connect
this and I think you I think you might
have to screw it in here okay so this
part you have to screw in in case you
want to set it up to like a stereo
system or something like that and pretty
much that's it for the cord this is
really nice quality these are very thick
these are very thick compared to regular
beats um cables like for the solo HDS or
beats Wireless or mixers anything these
are much thicker so that's definitely
something the pros have against the
other ones much thicker headphones
alright so let's get back into box and
now to get the headphones themselves out
okay so first things first when you take
off this little plastic you have this
little box here let's see if we could
get the little tape here off and we're
back on okay so this is the case that it
comes in I mean it comes with and it
seems to just be a little pouch silica
gel included now this is a pretty small
pouch well considering how these fold up
I'm not too surprised this is very nice
feeling a pouch I don't know what this
material is called
but it feels really nice um I'm sure you
guys can pretty much see it here the
inside is got this kind of material like
a mesh material but that's pretty decent
and I guess you can just kind of close
it up like this so that's cool um now
let's get this thing out ah
here we have the giant mixers so this
thing is covered with a lot of plastic
and tape so we are take this stuff off
let's see here we have another piece of
plastic something similar to what goes
inside of a button-down shirt we can
take that out get rid of it and here we
have the pros
sorry that without a your view but here
we have the pros and these feel really
really high-quality the metal aluminum
finish is really nice um adjusting it
feels really good yeah these just feel
really high-quality
I must admit the band feels nice these
seem pretty great to be honest I even
I've seen the demos of like the demo
models of bees and they've never I guess
they've been worn down quite a bit
because they never feel this good and
let me just give you guys a close-up and
here you got them these are the beats
pros this is what everybody's been
waiting to see these things are great
looking they're really amazing I got a I
guess the silver one I'm not even sure
what kind but this must be like the
silver one and these look amazing it's a
little big for me but you can't beat
this this looks great and it feels great
this really feels high-quality and I
like the fact that this has the two on
the two inputs for the headphone cord
and that's so you can daisy chain I
believe the feature is called so someone
can plug in their headphones right into
one of these while you have yours
plugged into a device and you guys can
both listen to the same audio at the
same time which is really nice so if
you're on like a bus or in the back of a
car or anything you guys can share audio
and you know do whatever you want with
that which is really cool the insides
here you can as you can see this also
rotates which is pretty much a DJ
necessary feature because they just like
to have the one ear cup up so they can
hear what they're playing as well as
listening to hear so this is really nice
for your regular person you could use
this kind of a feature to listen to your
music and talk to someone at the same
time it's pretty nice and it really does
feel great amazing so there's only one
cable with this I'm going to plug that
in now get me Bette you guys see what it
looks like okay and then even locks into
place okay cool so you have to make sure
you get it into the right spot and then
boom you're there you get to go and hear
you guys have the beats pros
very nice I'm very impressed by the look
can't wait to try these out alright guys
so that pretty much wraps up this
unboxing uh my first impressions of
these are that they are really really
nice I really love the feel of it and
the look so I'm really looking forward
to testing these out um hopefully it
sounds as good as it looks and feels but
I'll let you guys know how they do in
the review which should be up soon and
pretty much that's it if you guys
