iPod or mp3 player if you still use one
as you'd expect from the latest iPod
this one is better than its predecessors
with better specs you can count on a
much smoother and fluid experience you
can expect things like apps being more
responsive better load time to get into
gaming and you can even take that rear
camera more seriously now that's rocking
eight megapixels reason number four it
makes a great gift nobody's going to
scoff at a gift like the new iPod Touch
with it starting at $199 it's pretty
inexpensive for what it does but I
personally think that the 32 gigabyte
model has the best value this is
essentially an iPhone for the low-low
and everyone likes an iPhone right
Android users don't answer I'm actually
going to be giving away a 6 gen iPod
Touch over on Twitter so be sure to
follow me there and check the
description for more details on that
reason number three it's a great
dedicated media player if you've ever
gotten those messages about your phone
running low on storage you know just how
annoying they are with the new iPod
touch you can have a dedicated spot for
your songs movies and some of those
large apps you don't want cluttering
your phone while the streaming services
we use on our phones are nice you might
not always find your favorite songs or
movies through them the iPod Touch is a
great place to put all your favorite
media without sacrificing the valuable
storage on your phone which can better
be used for storing the millions of
selfies you need for Instagram reason
number two an iPod Touch is perfect for
teenagers and even kids if you're a teen
and you can't convince your parents to
get you a smartphone and iPod Touch is
your second best option you'll be able
to browse the web go on all social media
apps use iMessage and pretty much do
anything in iphone
and without mobile data and the whole
phone part it's not like you guys talk
on the phone anyway and of course reason
number one Android users get iOS without
having to commit to an iPhone and this
is actually something I did four years
back when I only cared for Android
phones you'll be able to access and use
those iOS only a switch was a pretty big
deal back in the day and sadly those
kinds of apps still exist
it always felt like I have the best of
both worlds without having to make a
complete shift from Android over to iOS
I know plenty of us Android users would
never question our faith when it comes
to which OS we want to use but that's
not the truth for everyone so for those
who do this is a pretty good way to test
the waters now another unofficial reason
to get the iPod Touch is to catch up on
some reading using audible you see what
I did there
audible is awesome it has over 180,000
titles to choose from so go over to
audible.com slash consumer to check them
out my book at the moment right now is
the 4-hour workweek by Timothy Ferriss
it gives tips and tricks for doubling
your income and leading the lifestyle
you want
I highly recommend it so run on over to
audible.com slash consumer to start a
free trial and check it out as well as
tons of other titles but that wraps it
up for my list guys hopefully you
enjoyed and make sure you check out my
giveaway on Twitter of the new iPod
touch so the next one is your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
