there's so many things that we've seen
covered from rolling TVs bendable
tablets and a lot more but here are some
cool things that you guys didn't see
some stuff then that everybody's talking
about so first up we've got Bosh now
they're responsible for a ton of cool
features that we see in tech that we use
on a daily basis and who shout out to
them for not only sponsoring my trip to
see yes but also today's video you might
not know this but Bosh is actually
responsible for a lot of the cool
features that we see in cars things like
adaptive cruise control which give cars
some like autonomous features Lane keep
assist and a lot more and we got a
chance to see some of the cool tech that
they plan to add to motorcycles like
sensors for collision warnings which is
a no brainer in my opinion and they even
have the system where they can turn
electric bikes and even non electric
bikes into smart bikes with the use of
an app but probably the big thing that
they showed a CES was their IOT shuttle
which is pretty much their concept for
removing stress from daily commutes
since the shuttle allows for a safe
autonomous commute essentially making
life easier and less stressful and while
what they've got going on for connected
mobility has me pretty excited they've
also got some really cool stuff in the
works for connected living they've got
this really cool piece of tech called a
PI which pretty much projects a smart
display onto a kitchen countertop so it
has a touchscreen you can interact with
it it also helps you with cooking it can
tell you or how to cook your meat how to
slice up a piece of cake lots of cool
stuff that is very useful in the kitchen
and honestly I really want to get my
hands on it to my surprise they even had
smart fridges that you can use the
smartphone app to check in on it and see
what ingredients you're running out of
and the fridge even has a display on the
door so you can control things from
there they honestly just surprise me
with just how much of their tech is and
all the things that we use they even
have this cool wall showing a lot of
products that they are involved with but
like I said links to be down below in
the description for you guys to check
them out and next up we've got the smart
desk by Centrex and I got to give you a
huge shout out to Shiva from Nintendo
for showing me this actually while we
were on the show floor I have them
linked down below in the description but
guys check this thing out this is a
smart desk with a built-in computer and
triple monitor setup and this thing has
eight
ton of crazy features so first off it's
got a hidden computer at the bottom of
the desk I'll throw up some specs so you
guys can see what it's working with and
not only that it's got the triple
monitor setup but those triple monitors
are also touchscreen they also have a
built in webcam built-in speakers as
well as a built-in scanner so you can
scan documents right from this whole
desk the desk itself has an integrated
keyboard and touchpad as well as
wireless charging so you can just put
your phone down on the desk and you
don't have to worry about plugging it in
what's also kind of crazy is that it
includes truly wireless earbuds built
into the desk so you can just kind of
pop these out and actually throw them in
your ears and immediately start
listening to whatever is going on on
your computer this thing also has
gestures so you can just kind of do all
these different hand gestures and move
documents around open up browsers and
all kinds of crazy stuff they were
showing a demo there's a lot that you
can do with this thing just by using
your hands so you don't even have to
interact with a mouse or anything like
that and that is actually just kind of
crazy that that's integrated into this
and of course this wouldn't be a smart
desk without being adjustable so you can
actually adjust the height here so no
matter what size you are if you want to
stand sit whatever it may be you can
adjust that here which is also a very
nice bonus but for me the biggest thing
here is the fact that all this is in one
system guys that means the only cable
you have to deal with is the power cable
aside from that everything is already
hooked up plug together you don't have
to touch a thing now this isn't really
meant for consumers it's moreso meant
for the workspace I think their vision
is to get rid of cubicles and kind of
have people work at this smart station
it definitely could do the trick at home
but it will cost a pretty penny
this thing is retailing for 4,500 bucks
so this thing ain't cheap but if you are
looking for a nice all-in-one system
this is like all-in-one system this is a
really cool option now next up is
something that I want from my house so
so badly and this is a smart toilet by
Kohler
2.0 now this is a smart toilet with
features that remind me of my time in
Tokyo lots of cool things that this
thing can do from heated seats to a
spray that comes out and helps you clean
yourself it also has the ability to
automatically open and close when you
step near it lots of cool stuff but this
one in particular has even more features
this one has RGB lights and it doesn't
just have like a static glow this thing
actually dances moves around changes
color lots of cool effects that you can
turn on or off and not really sure if
that's something that is gonna let me
turn on all the time but it is cool
nonetheless and there's even this foot
warmer that keeps your feet nice and
toasty while you're on the throne but
not only that guys it also has Amazon
Alexa built right into it mm so you got
Amazon Alexa and you even have built-in
speakers so you can actually command
Alexa to start playing some music flush
the toilet all that kind of stuff hey
listen what you want to do a tutorial is
your business but color at least has an
option that allows you to do a lot more
than your standard toilet and this thing
even has a controller that you can have
on the side so if you want the toilet to
do anything specifically you can just
press it with the tap and get it going
but all now guys the new me 2.0 looks
awesome I cannot wait for this thing to
come out in q4 of 2019 I hope I can get
one of these inside of the house to kind
of complete the whole smart home that
we're trying to make video also made
some cool announcements on some
affordable RT x graphics cards now
invidious RT x cards have been out for a
little while now but they just
introduced the 2060 which is only gonna
retail for about three hundred and fifty
bucks and I think this is gonna be a
great bang for your buck graphics card
for those people who want to build a PC
and I spend a lot of money but you still
want really good graphics and access to
that ray-tracing so you guys can see the
reflections in certain games it really
adds to the realism and immersion of
playing a game so it's really nice to
see this card come in at a more
affordable price but what I was really
excited for when checking out Nvidia
stuff were the laptops and these gaming
laptops and feature RT X cards from the
2060 all the way to the 2080 now I'm a
fan of the gaming laptops that have a
lot of power and still have some great
portability
and the lineup that they have coming out
this year looks so good I personally got
my eye on the ones I saw from MSI and
Asus over there but we'll see and while
we're on the topic of computers and PCs
main gear actually dropped some really
cool things as well so they have this
backpack that just came out these cool
gaming chairs you guys might have seen
the gaming chairs in my last massive
tech unboxing but what I think really
stole the show for them were the cool
apex tubes that they just came out with
and you guys know me I like to have
certain themes for my setups whether
it's a specific color character whatever
it may be but apex tubes that is the
next level because it helps with
customization so the tube itself will
have a white coolant and it's backed by
RGB lights so that white coolant is
going to take on the color of whatever
you set it to now this is going to be a
game changer because me I like to switch
up my themes a lot and being able to
change the water cooling look man and
they actually did a really good job you
guys can see with the footage here it
looks awesome and there were a couple of
other really cool things things that I
know didn't get a lot of attention like
this little tiny robot that is an actual
transformer guys I didn't get a lot of
footage of it I just kind of saw it in
passing and did a couple social posts
but I had to tell you guys about it if
you love transformers this is the kind
of toy we all wish we had as a kid one
that actually transforms from a car to
an actual robot and this thing can drive
it can move around when it falls it gets
back up and you can control with an app
you can make it walk around it does a
lot guys it is actually mind blowing and
I just kind of wanted to throw my money
at them but I don't know if it's
actually out yet
but like I said guys it looks amazing
but there you have it guys those are
just some of the things that I saw that
I think look pretty interesting
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
being a cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one so then it's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
