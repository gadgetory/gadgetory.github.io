consumer and today we're going to be
spending a real band of life with the LG
G six and in this kind of video you're
going to be spending a full day with me
and the g6 as we check out things like
that new display the form factor things
like performance camera all the things
you want to know about the phone and
we're going to see how it holds up in a
real day of usage all right guys so
we've got the g6 in hand and I actually
have been on this phone for a good bit
this morning because I've been
responding to a bunch of you guys over
on Twitter because I hit a million
subscribers last night so today I'm just
responding to everybody wishing me
congratulations and stuff like that so
I've been on it for a good bit shot for
you guys you guys are awesome wouldn't
be here without you but we got to keep
testing this phone a battery solution
100% I don't think I've been on it
enough to knock down a couple of notches
so we're going to see throughout the day
so you have some notifications are
blowing up folks we're going to see how
much the battery is impacted through
daily use all that good stuff but we're
going to find some breakfast first and
get the day started
but before breakfast I'm gonna do a
little plug here if you don't know I'm
actually giving away a Nintendo switch I
have a link to the video down below go
check that out and get a free chance of
winning one of these it's kind of hard
to come by right now alright guys so
breakfast is here for those who wait
nothing hey what I wanted to talk about
the design of this phone as you can see
I'll do what with a more premium feel
for it I've got the metal edges as well
as like the black back but I'm still not
sure if it's a fully glass kind of feels
like plastic through but if a glass back
way smaller bezels so the phone looks
good but my only problem is that it's
slippery as all heck and as you can see
as a fingerprint magnet as well so you
know I'm going to be dying to get a case
on this this I don't drop it or look at
these fingerprints anymore alright so
we've got a couple of spots to hit up
today first off I'm going to New York
wearing it uber right now I'm going to
the Nintendo store I'm going to look for
the best possible Nintendo Swift case
that I can find and then
to actually head to a meeting with the
CEO of v-moda val Colton they make
awesome headphones you guys know that I
rock their headphones all the time but
it's time to see what's next let's see
what new products they've got coming up
so keep your eyes peeled for that but uh
yeah we've got a long day ahead of us
this isn't like how long does a little
bit right probably like 40 minutes so
we've got a little bit of timely kill
but think that might as well as placing
games while I'm at it see what that
Bilby vision screen is like all right
guys so something I'm really liking
about the g6 is the screen now apologies
for the bumpy camera because we're in
the car driving right now but the screen
is amazing guys it has these tiny tiny
bezels LG did a really good job at
keeping these really small and compact
and it also has these rounded edges so I
don't know if a lot of people will like
that some people will probably like the
traditional look but this is a nice
change of pace I really do like it and
this is the quad HD display like I said
before has that buildi vision so it has
like HDR but um this is a really
beautiful screen now guys because this
thing has an 18 by 9 aspect ratio you
probably can't see it but there are
letterboxes around these sides of the
content so it is different than what
we're used to usually content isn't a
sixteen by nine but it doesn't seem to
be a big deal since the borders are
black
it kind of just blends in with the bezel
of the phone so it's not too much of a
big deal so we made into the Nintendo
store and it looks like this which is
kind of a big deal yeah time to find a
good case so area is height because they
got like Pokemon plushies here so she's
going to jump in this is all you babe
you do you have all get like every
single one but you know what this is
perfect time to take some picture with
the phone so we're going to take a quick
picture of this venusaur over here grab
that damn alright since the z6 has extra
real estate you see some of the
something else or the pictures that you
last hook and jump in as you see fit
well that is a really awesome feature
you can kind of just jump in and see and
I got to say the camera quality it legit
LG's always been pretty good in terms of
providing good cameras and the 13
megapixel camera on this one lives up to
the reputation so some cases have been
acquired
got some interesting results on ones
over here so this would be pretty cool
so the g6 also features that wiring the
list that you can switch to so instead
of having a closed picture like this I
can get the whole thing in the shot and
take my pick which is really awesome so
we've got Mari over here I figure it's a
good time shot the front-facing camera
take a selfie with this guy since he's
kind of famous so let's see what that's
like
and it also has a wide angle mode so
we'll try that one out as well oh this
is crazy
so we're going to use that something
else here again and this is a this is
clean I thought it would be more okay
this one's a bit more overexposed
wide-angle one looks really good but
this looks pretty good this will
definitely qualify for Instagram selfie
your job LZ now while I really like the
thumbnail feature where you can go back
and look at your photos I did notice
that a lot of times it would make the
app crash something I can't replicate it
right now but it did happen quite a bit
already so I don't know if it's
something because this is a
pre-production model but hopefully those
kings get worked out before this goes on
sale this is so crazy right now the
reflection of the glass showing the
people behind me make your way there are
people in that police van
I don't know if you guys can see it but
look like the guy who got but it looks
like there are people in the police van
anyway okay let's get back on track so
right now the phone has about 56 percent
battery left I think I've been using it
I think at about two hours of screen on
time let's just double check that
so yeah about two hours and four minutes
of screen on time
sixty-six percent less I'm using it at
about sixty percent brightness so
battery life is decent nothing crazy so
far but it's been alright cool thing
though I happen to be a Starbucks while
waiting and this thing does support
wireless charging so I just throw it on
there and then this guy will start to
charge wirelessly so after my meeting
with Val gotta head back home now but
something I notice is that even with a
lot of sunlight when I had the max
brightness set on this guy I can see it
with no problem whatsoever
even when directly in the Sun I've got
no problem with visibility I can see
everything on my screen without an issue
so really really good for the screen
brightness if I can't see that on camera
but take my word for it it's good
alright guys so we're back in the studio
but I got
show you I gotta get this off my chest
I'm not crazy about the UI of this phone
only because there is no longer an app
drawer so without the app drawer you
have all of your apps on the home screen
unless you you're super organized and
you throw them into folders it's going
to be quite a hassle to keep things
clean lead personally I like to have my
four folders at the bottom if you saw my
what's in my smartphone video you know
my layout you know how I like it but
this one made me introduce a couple more
folders and honestly some of the apps
that I don't really use some of the
bloatware that comes on the phone I just
kind of have to just throw into random
folders that you see over here now that
might not be a big deal for some people
and LG does offer an option for a home
screen with the app drawer but let me
show you what that looks like so when
you jump into the home screen settings
you can select the regular home screen a
easy home which is for like honestly
older people or people who have a hard
time seen there's also the home with the
app drawer which I must show you or some
other homes that you might have now home
an app drawer let me show you what that
looks like guys look at the app drawer
guys this thing takes up almost like a
third of the screen so it's very very
weird that it's so large you can throw
some things out the bottom there so you
can customize it a bit but it's still
weird so even if you wanted less thing
you wanted to have all your regular
stuff there this still takes up way too
much real estate in my opinion and it
just it just doesn't offer a clean look
so to be completely honest I do think
I'm going to end up using that Google
now launcher I don't have mine set up
just yet to fit my needs but I will get
that set up I'm just glad that Android
allows you to switch this up however you
please
now click update on the battery I've got
about 33% less and it's 807 p.m. but let
me show you guys what the screen on time
is like so going into the battery see
with the usage so the screen on time 20%
of the battery was used up by the screen
and I use this for about three hours and
26
minutes for three thousand twenty-six
minutes of screen on time and I wasn't
using that that like max brightness
pretty much I try to stay around sixty
percent in the brightness area so this
has I guess average battery life
it's got 3300 milliamp hours which is
pretty decent it's not bad I would hope
for a bit more but you know it'll get
the job done alright guys so it's the
middle of the night the phone just shut
off but before it did I ended up getting
four hours and 34 minutes of on-screen
time which is actually pretty decent it
actually surprised me how long it lasted
towards the end of its day so uh four
hours in the four and a half hours can't
really complain about that I got to say
so far I'm really liking this phone
definitely the best LG has come out with
I think it's safe to say I love the
direction LG took with the g6 it's got a
wing more premium feel than the g5 was
before and I think it does a really good
job at seeing like a quality phone the
feel in the hand as well as the build
quality is great on this phone but what
I'm not so crazy about is the glass back
being able to get all those fingerprints
now that might be because this is a
black version I don't know how the other
colors will react to fingerprints but
I'm not so crazy about what you'll see
with the black makes me want to put
either a skin or a case on it now even
though I'm not too crazy about the home
screens of LG skin I do find the
performance to be right where I'd
expected now the thing isn't running the
latest version of the Snapdragon
processor but I honestly don't find that
to be a big deal it was very snappy
handled everything I threw at it so
there's really no complaints beside the
fact that it's not the latest not dragon
process now in terms of performance in
the real world
latest chip or not I had no slowdowns or
hiccups and this thing ran super smooth
for me throughout my time with it so I
have no complaints now in terms of the
camera I got to say I was really
impressed being able to switch to a
wide-angle lens with the press of a
button is an awesome feature this makes
getting certain shots a lot easier since
you don't have to back up all the way
you're still on that wide-angle lens and
you're able to capture way way more my
pictures came out nice and sharp however
I did notice that some of them were a
bit overexposed especially when it came
to that front-facing camera but for the
most part it did the trick
and also being able to have that
wide-angle option for the front camera
as well is a nice touch and I also
really liked other features like
expandable storage the wireless charging
and it's even water-resistant for those
accidental spills and honestly it's
looking like a great phone to pick up
however I do that Google now launcher on
there and not look back but it is a very
very solid phone and I definitely think
that once it's released a lot of people
will be happy but that was my day with
it hopefully you guys enjoyed it those
were my thoughts let me know what you
think of the g6 down below I'll catch
you guys in the next one if you enjoyed
it give a cool guy girl that gives this
video a thumbs up so then it's your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
