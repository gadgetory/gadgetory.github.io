consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the Microsoft Surface
pro 4 and I want to give a huge shout
out to youtube for sponsoring this video
for its awesome stuff week and this
week's theme is Monday Tech unwrapped so
let's not waste any time
stare right into it alright guys here we
have the Microsoft Surface pro 4 and
they've also got a new type cover
keyboard now this I've already been
using quite a bit it is an amazing
upgrade in comparison to the old one so
I'm gonna be checking out this one with
a fingerprint scanner I haven't tried
that out yet so that's gonna be pretty
cool
now Microsoft says this is supposed to
be 30% faster it's thinner a lighter so
looks like I didn't need my unboxing
knife and you're greeted with another
white box do is pop that open and boom
there you have it this is the Microsoft
Surface pro 4 so of course we've got
some booklets branding that we've also
got the surface pro pen but we've got
some stuff to the right side but and
that is of course your charging cable
this is a proprietary cable that
Microsoft uses it's magnetic yeah
there's nothing too special with this
guy so yeah let's put this to the side
so we're just gonna peel this back okay
there we go and boom now I gotta give I
gotta give Microsoft props this is
thinner but this feels good in the hand
all the bezels are definitely thinner
got that hinge so you can just place
this down and use it as a tablet and now
you've got what looks like a mirror as
the windows logo up top we've got a
power button and of course some volume
controls right next to it and to the
left side we've got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and on the right side
we've got a display port as well as a
USB port but now is powered on and see
what this nice bigger display looks like
now of course this is running
ten on a twelve point three inch display
so one thing I'm noticing with the
surface pro 4 with the magnetic pen is
that if it's really well I'm really
liking this this is pretty secure as you
can see I can move the surface around
and it's still a tag now we didn't
actually check out the surface Pro's new
keyboard so let's do that right now so
just have a very simple packaging just
like the surface all you got to do get
the tape up and boom you got it now
what's super awesome about this keyboard
is now there's space between each key
now another cool thing to do with the
smart Keyboard is they actually change
the trackpad trackpad is now larger and
it's much easier to use it's got a lot
more space a lot more room to travel so
it feels a lot better in that click
definitely satisfying but taking a look
at the screen guys it looks great is
higher resolution than the previous
version now if you guys want to pick up
the surface pro 4 you don't even have to
check the links in the description just
hit the top right button with the eye
you can buy one right from this video
but hopefully you guys have enjoyed this

stuff week and if you want to see a
