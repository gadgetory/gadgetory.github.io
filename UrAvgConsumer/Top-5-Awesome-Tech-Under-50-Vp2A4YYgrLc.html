consumer and today we have another top 5
tech under 50 bucks now we're going to
start this off with something I find
mind-blowing come check this out
so this well let me introduce you to the
eye roller that sounds crazy it sounds
weird but I swear this thing is magic so
you got these two or I guess you can get
different sizes but you got these little
rollers here that basically can clean
screens can pick smudges off of a
touchscreen you can clean off
fingerprints all that kind of stuff
dust and dirt this thing removed it all
so this is magical to me because you
guys know how much I love my microfiber
cloth and this actually replaces it
check out the magic I know it ain't me
to say it but it's true and honestly the
thing is just nuts
so we've also got a macbook pro over
here and you guys know these things can
get really dirty after a while so we've
got a lot of smudges a lot of
fingerprints and all that but we just
take this to it and let's get this
cleaned up so all the fingerprints over
here if you could take a look right here
check this out this is nuts
all those smudges and fingerprints
disappearing it's crazy so this and this
is like 20 bucks so they've got the eye
roller they've got the mini eye roller
and except there's other weird one which
is supposed to be for glasses I've used
it on a geek lasses and I what you think
it was yeah so it cleaned it up really
well but since we're talking about tech
I actually found another use for it
which is really nice and that's to clean
off like a keyboard so you can you get
it all cleaned up if you have like
greasy fingers or anything like that you
have those smudges when you're typing on
your keyboard this thing is a good
angled way to give excellent up now
you're probably wondering what do you do
when you get a bunch of dirt and stuff
on it all you got to do is run it under
some water and it cleans it right off
and then you're able
we use it again like brand new I had a
hard time believing that something like
this could even really work the way it
does and after using it I am a believer
you will always be in my backpack now
and a microfiber cloth I'm not going to
be alright guys so next up we've got a
Bluetooth audio transmitter this one is
by a Lewis Tech I believe but you can
find a ton of bees all over Amazon so
I'll have some links down below in the
description now the reason why I think
this is cool is actually because of my
dad
so shots when you pops him in anyway I
actually got this for him because he was
complaining anything that he wished that
his TV had bluetooth so that he can use
some headphones instead of having the TV
speakers go off at night when my mom was
sleeping because she would tell him
turned it off
every time she heard and woke up from
sleep so with something like this he's
able to actually just plug this into the
headphone jack in his television and
plug in the USB port and that gave him
access to Bluetooth audio on his
television and if your TV doesn't happen
to have a headphone jack you can always
use this cable that comes with this guy
and plug it into your TV by using the
RCA inputs let's say you don't need it
for your TV but you maybe want to use it
for your car and your car doesn't have
bluetooth it has an aux port you can
plug this in throw this into some USB
car charger and you got Bluetooth right
in your car now let me bring your
attention to no not the beautiful
Gundams but this speaker that actually
happens to be right on the cabinet so
this is a speaker by G gray city I
believe but it's a portable wireless
Bluetooth speaker that's also waterproof
but this is a little different than all
the other Bluetooth waterflow speakers
because it has this little suction cup
feature here so not only can just stick
it on to your nice little Gundam cabinet
but it works really well with places
like bathroom showers or maybe even a
pool so if you want to use this
somewhere where there's a lot of water
you don't have to worry about it
slipping around or getting lost or
falling or anything like that because of
that feature which is really cool like I
said it sounds pretty decent let me show
you what I'm talking about
Hey
and what's also really cool is that it
has the light so these are the
color-changing led so go through a bunch
of different colors adds a little flair
to your party and also comes in a couple
of different colors so if you guys want
to switch it up you want to go with just
bright orange which I like you can go
and pick a couple different ones as well
and it only looks like what 35 bucks and
be back now for my real techniques out
there I got to show you this t√∫cume
precision hardware tool set now every
cent you showed hardware tools and
screwdrivers it's boring but the
technique is you know sometimes you got
to take something apart and get it fixed
now you just pop this open and you have
access to a ton of different heads now
what I ran into where I felt like I
really needed this I don't know if you
guys know this but Nintendo does not
allow you to switch your game space from
one console to another ticket it's
baffling since this is a portable
console anyway I had to take off the
back since I got this one from color
where I wanted to use this color I had
to take off the backplate and switch it
out with my original Nintendo switch so
it required having special tools to do
it and this had me covered so if you
went into something like a game console
or your PC or whatever this thing should
have you covered
it even has these little tweezers that
you can use to get little objects out
it's a good buy trust me
and this thing only talks like nine
dollars you've got to have this in your
arsenal alas not least we've got the
sound piece q12
and shout out to the dings who
recommended me checking them out on
Twitter you get a good job buddy I
actually try these out these cost 30
bucks Bluetooth wireless earbuds similar
to the Jaybirds
and they actually sound pretty decent so
it's pretty regular standard design
nothing too crazy and too
no it doesn't look bad nothing too bad
and it includes all the typical
accessories that you come to expect so
you've got your USB cable you've got
different earbuds so if you have a
different sized ear you can all try that
out it also comes with these little
wingtips
like a lot of Fitness earbuds come with
now they keep it in place when you're
doing stuff like jogging it also comes
with these little clip to shorten the
cable or you can clip it to your shirt
whatever you want and even a travel case
so at 30 dollars you're getting the
value of pretty much all the other more
expensive Bluetooth earbuds but at a
much lower price point I chose out with
a bunch of different songs I didn't even
realize that I was listening to
something inexpensive so I could take
this with me to any day trip and not
have a problem listening whatsoever that
is a strong feel of Approval my friend
but that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it now there are
no sponsors on this video but you've got
to get that eye roller that thing is
just amazing and shout out to Ari for
finding it in a sea of emails but if you
enjoyed the video be the cool guy or
girl that gives it a thumbs up I'll
catch you guys in the next one
links will be down below in the
description to everything you saw here
