consumer and it's time but some more ask
you a see what shoes are you wearing
right now I got on some haraki's by Nike
we got a couple of these I think they're
pretty good for how long do you think
the Galaxy s8 will be your daily driver
now I don't know if you guys know this
but I've been actually texting the
Galaxy s8 to see if I can make it my
daily driver I'm going to have a video
coming out in a couple of days letting
you guys know what I decide to pick
either way whether I stick with the
Galaxy s8 or the iPhone 7 plus that I've
been using become Isilon a time they're
both going out the window which gundam
is your favorite if you only had to pick
one favorites on them if I could only
pick one I would probably say double
riser or double-oh-seven sword they're
pretty much the same but different
variations definitely my favorite so
would you prefer to have a switch with
ps3 exclusives or a ps3 with switch
exclusives
now that's an extremely easy question to
answer because there's not really that
many switch exclusives so there wouldn't
be any benefit to having them on the ps3
but the idea of having cool ps3 games on
the go on the switch you can't be bad
that's a way better option
what older games would you like to see
brought over to the switch now that's
another easy one I'd have to go with
Monster Hunter I used to play that game
back in the day on my PSP way way way
back in the day I was addicted my family
members were addicted we used to play
all the time having that on the switch
which is actually a possibility since it
was on the 3ds would be amazing there
haven't been any announcements but that
would be wow that was so good out of
every stolen Mays what has been your
favorite and what has been the best tech
purchase you have made now I'm gonna go
a little old-school with this one and
I'm going to say the HTC Hero I was in
love with that phone when it first came
out I just thought it was amazing
Android which is so fresh back in the
day they just announced widgets I was in
love they had that cool fire brew fire a
background that phone had my heart but
it was on Sprint and I was never able to
get my hands on it so it's like the one
that got away but in terms of today's
phones I mean
gotta be like the iPhone 7 plus or the
SI plane to shore after the best tech
purchase eyes were made has to be my fs7
that was quite the investment but it has
been amazing for the channel got me some
excellent quality a good business
decision if you ask me will you ever get
around to doing other themed setups
definitely I've been toying with the
idea of doing a DBZ set up a lot of you
have been asking for that quite a bit
recently actually if you really like the
idea of a Dragonball Z themed set up be
sure to hit that like button let me know
when is your savage consumer returning
in the meantime what's the worst piece
of tech you recently checked out shut up
so check me out but your savage consumer
is going to be returning really really
soon but in terms of the worst detector
I've been trying recently well I haven't
been trying it that much but feed me
Samsung case mmm not going to say much
now wait to the video favorite thing
from colour where that's actually pretty
hard question we got that dope retro
PlayStation 4 Pro
we've also got the Xbox elite controller
that looks really good and now the
Nintendo switch if I have to pick on her
I don't know I'd probably go with the
switch because that's going to be with
me all the time it actually is with me
all the time more so than I seen my ps4
pro or delete controller so I'm going to
go at the switch when will you be
bringing your average couple back Ari
and I are actually working on getting
the vlogs back we're going to be posting
them on the your average couple channel
that we used to use back in the day
we're going to be reviving that in that
right area so if you guys are interested
in that I'll have a link to that channel
right down into the description
subscribe to the channel and if a lot of
you do subscribes that'll show us that
there's some real interest in having the
vlogs back and it'll get some fire under
our buttons one thing you wish the SAS
eight-plus has now one thing I wish to
si+ had for sure is the reach ability
feature that you can find on the iPhones
now there is a one handed mode for both
the Si and si plus a reach ability is
just a lot easier to use
just DoubleTap that home button your
screen comes down you can access things
from the top since you have that big
screen that would just make my day and
I'd be actually be able to use si plus
instead of that fate I know you like
Pokemon but what Pokemon is your
favorite ah there's just so many to
choose from if I had to pick one I'd
probably go with Typhlosion second
generation was my favorites in the Cole
was my starter so of course the last
forum ended up being my favorite of all
time if I had to pick somebody else
though if that's your favorite
I'd probably maybe go with Lucario and
that's because Lucario one looks really
cool and he's all about aura which is my
last name so kind of like it's meant to
be you know it's a Pokemon that's right
what kind of music do you listen to
now I listen to a wide wide range of
music things that you probably would
never expect but of course there's the
typical rap and hip-hop and R&amp;amp;B that
kind of stuff I love it's in my blood
there's also a progressive metal that
I've been getting into recently some of
you guys may have noticed me showing
bands like made of construct or
intervals when I'm listening to music on
some of my videos there's also what else
do I listen sorry I know it's down what
are your thoughts on the upcoming iPhone
I don't have any real thoughts on the
iPhone because there's no real
information out there just speculation
but I do think we're going to have a lot
of disappointed people in terms of
rumors we've heard that this thing will
have everything under the Sun so I think
a lot of people have their hopes up
everyone I've heard talk about this
phone has been extremely excited I think
every future under the Sun is going to
be coming to it so I think a lot of
people will be disappointed unless Apple
can pull out a miracle
will you make a second channel for
gaming now you guys have expressed some
interest in me making a gaming channel I
just don't know how feasible it is to
start up a whole new channel having the
vlog channel alone was pretty difficult
back in the day so
trying to get a third channel in the mix
would be a bit hard but I do want to
dabble into like twitch and stuff which
I have never done even though I spoke
about it before but one day that's what
I want to do what is the best cookie
ever made
I know well I was going to say oatmeal
raisin because it's my favorite kind of
cookie but I think arias guilted me into
feeling bad about not saying my dog
cookie so my dog cookies the best cookie
ever made right open elation is really
good to sonic or Mario well my first
system ever was a Sega Genesis
so I'm Sonic guy the font it's just way
cooler than Mario anyway he's like a
blue hedgehog that run stupid fast so
how did I not pick Sonic would be good
for me to leave my help desk job and do
what you do also any interest in retro
gaming No do not leave your job not for
a youtube career start your YouTube
career while you have that job but
definitely don't leave your job in
pursuit of a YouTube career it just
sounds like a bad idea
I didn't leave my job when I first
started YouTube it took it took some
time for that to eventually happen but
definitely definitely don't do that but
if you're interested like I said start
while you work as for retro gaming man I
know when we're talking about retro
games we mean games from way back in the
day and while those are fun when you're
playing as a kid I'm too spoiled with
all the good games that we've got
nowadays to actually want to go and play
those old games I just don't see it
happening
what are you looking forward to at e3
this year absolutely more information on
Project Scorpio I hope Xbox talks about
it maybe we can see a reveal of what the
console will actually look like that
would be amazing I'm not really
expecting much from anybody else
hopefully we get some more titles for
the Nintendo switch that would be nice
but as right now Scorpio lasers are
focused earbuds comfortable for sleep
now I don't know if I recommend going to
sleep with any ear buds it doesn't sound
like much of a good idea but I am guilty
of having done it
so I think that's the best bet for that
would be the short se215 those fit
pretty well in the ears they fit in my
ears really really well I think that
those don't protrude too much so if
you're laying down you should be just
fine and they sound good so they
definitely get my recommendation and
kind of come up with your own stuff what
do you think of this new trend of
rounded off-screen corners I personally
like it we've had those rectangular
screens on our phones forever now so
it's nice to see some variety see some
companies switch it up a bit and it
doesn't impact the way you watch your
stuff anyway so I don't see the harm
rather be an Apple fanboy or an Android
fanboy do we have to be one or the other
that's how you get angry folks don't be
a single fanboy were you nervous before
doing your first youtube video no I
don't think anybody was going to watch
it so I didn't really care
any advice for novice video makers on
how to funnel creativity if you're
trying to get your creative juices
flowing I think the best thing that you
can do is watch other content whether
it's a movie or other video makers see
what kind of techniques they're doing
the kind of shots they're getting that
should definitely help I'm not saying go
ahead and copy it but you can get some
inspiration from watching other people
do certain things without about wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did
he's a cool guy or girl that'd give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
