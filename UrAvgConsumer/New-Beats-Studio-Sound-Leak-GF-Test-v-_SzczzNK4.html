consumer this is my beautiful girlfriend
hello and today we've got another sound
leak and sound isolation test aka the
girlfriend test and this time we're
doing it with the brand new beat studio
the 2013 version so let's not waste any
time staring into it alright guys so
first we're gonna start off with the
sound leak test and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna put these headphones on
and we're going to play them at volumes
of 50% 75% and 100% and we're gonna see
how much the headphones leak or the
music leaks at those different volumes
and as you guys can see there's none of
my hair at blocking the air cups I make
sure that this time okay so my hair is
back today no hair is blocking the ear
cups mmm big poofy hair hey alright guys
so first we're gonna start off at 50%
right yep alright so 50%
hmm I hear a teeny bit but this is a
huge improvement compared to the old
ones so that was 50%
definitely a very good job in comparison
to the old versions I did hear it a tiny
bit but not enough to bother anyone
whatsoever so we'll crank it up to 75%
and see how it goes there all right you
ready yeah I definitely hear a bit more
here still much better than the old ones
it's crazy all right so we did hear a 75
percent not bad
and now let's try it out at 100% I
remember I'm just remembering the last
time with the old CEO Oh God no sir
so here does that 100% and guys we don't
recommend listening to your music a
hundred percent because it can damage
your hearing yeah so let's try it out at
1% it is clearly leaking quite a bit so
we're not going to let it run too long
and that was it now just so you guys can
get an idea of what the old one sounded
like we're going I'm gonna try it on
after special you guys 50 percent and
100 percent just for kicks and giggles
cool and all right guys here it is at
50% it's so obvious
I hear awful Eric it's so honest so 50%
right here now we show you guys on shake
it up and there's none percent
ah that's particular piercing anyway
enough of that you guys saw the
difference between the sound a leak this
is definitely a huge improvement
thumbs up two beats for getting back
together and now we're gonna do the
girlfriend test Gator explain sure
alright the girlfriend test is my time
to shine this is the time where I do
something really annoying like talk a
lot or complain and he had to see if his
new headphones can block out my annoying
sounds today what I'm going to be doing
is he just got this brand spankin new
computer and I love to be on it because
it is huge like I watched my music
videos um so I'm gonna watch my music
videos in the background here and he's
going to try to block it out with this
headphone
we don't always enjoy the same music so
 it out so we're going to of course
do this at 50% 75% and 100% to see at
what different levels we can block it
all out and alright guys so here it is
at 50%
all right so didn't really hear anything
at 50% that's pretty good some nice
noise cancelling I think that's pretty
loud so let's go to 75% and see what
it's like this for the sake of
consistency right yeah
yeah
all right so 75% nothing um I'm pretty
impressed 50% just did a good job
Oh 100% just for the sake of it ready
oh alright guys so it played at 50%
second 5% 1% and it blacked out
everything so really good job here and
I'm sure that music was really I heard
if ad when I took off the headphones so
that's really good stuff I know some of
you guys are probably wondering why they
bother going through the rest of it I'd
be a pretty short video we just kind of
stopped that 50 yeah and if you know the
girlfriend test you know that we always
do 50 75 and then 100 percent just to
build it up and keep it consistent yeah
so that's about it for this beat studio
sound leak and girlfriend test guys the
new ones did a really good job the sound
leaking we did I did hear that 50% 75%
but it was a drastic difference in
comparison to the old one
I don't really think it bothered anyone
outdoors but indoors it probably would
if you're in the same vicinity like
you're really close but other than that
pretty good stuff and that's about it
guys we'll catch you guys in the next
video stay tuned for some more
girlfriend tests and we'll catch you
guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer this
beautiful girlfriend
