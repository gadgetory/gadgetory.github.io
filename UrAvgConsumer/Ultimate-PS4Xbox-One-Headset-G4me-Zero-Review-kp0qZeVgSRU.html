consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the Sennheiser game zero PC
gaming headset so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it alright
guys here we have the Sennheiser game
zero PC gaming headset while this is
meant for PC used I have course righted
out with my ps4 Xbox one and my Mac as
well so let's see if Sennheiser is
premium gaming headset is worth your
money first let's talk about the design
the game 0 sports a premium look and has
the fancy black and red color scheme
that's so many love now when looking at
this headset one of the first things you
might notice about it is the super large
ear cups although they are very large
they don't feel oversized at all the ear
cups will fit nicely over anyone's ears
and I mean anyone this helps to provide
a very immersive sound so you can really
feel like you're a part of whatever
you're listening to the headset also
features a pretty flexible design that
allows you to fold a headset and even
twist it ear cups depending on how you
want to use them when folded the headset
becomes pretty compact when it comes to
design I think Sennheiser nailed it it
sports a premium look and it does it
well now we know it looks great in
high-end but how does it feel I have to
say the feel of these matches the looks
the game 4-0 has a very sturdy build and
feels very great in the hand as well as
on the head the ear cups are padded with
a leatherette material and has a triple
layer of memory foam the ear cups even
feature more cushioning towards the base
of the cups to allow for an even better
seal around the entire ear this of
course helps to reduce sound leakage and
increase the sound isolation when
playing the headband also features the
same soft padding as found on the ear
cups so comfort definitely won't be an
issue for anyone using these I'm really
a fan of the small details about this
headset as the hinges seem very well
built and they don't seem like they'd
give out after using these for a long
period of time they also produce a very
satisfying click sound when folded I
share these sentiments for the build
quality of the mic as well it's a very
solid mic which is a nice change of pace
compared to the flimsy mics you get with
some
systems it also features a three meter
cable with a headphone and mic input
this is an extremely long cable but
there is a strap for those of you who
don't plan to use the full length now
let's take a look at some of the
features you'll find on the game zero
the mic has built-in noise canceling
that's supposed to help eliminate some
of the background noise you typically
hear when chatting with others right now
I'm using the game 4-0 to give you guys
a quick sample of the mic quality and
what you can expect your friends to hear
that is another sample of the mic
quality and the noise canceling ability
with some music on in the background as
well as a pretty loud air conditioner
whoever you're talking to using this mic
definitely won't have any complaints and
as you can hear by the example you can
even have some things going on in the
background without worrying about
upsetting any party members due to the
noise cancelling mic when you're done
talking you can simply push the mic
upward to mute it and there's a quick
and easy way to stop to talk to someone
next to you if you don't want your party
members to hear your conversation on the
right ear cup you also have a volume
dial which i think is pretty convenient
instead of having to look for a volume
switch on the cable while you're playing
the game zero also comes with a pretty
cool carrying case if we happen to be a
traveling gamer or you just want a nice
place to store your headset it's a
hardshell case so your cans will
definitely be protected when inside and
there's also a little pouch inside
that's pretty useful if you carry any
extra accessories speaking of
accessories there is a must-have
accessory for those of you who want to
use this with the xbox one ps4 or Mac
and that's the combo audio adapter
because the games zero has two separate
inputs for audio and the mic you won't
be able to use both at once with systems
without the adapter since you're paying
premium prices for a premium headset I
wish this was included I understand this
is primarily a PC gaming headset but I'm
sure this little cable barely cost
anything to manufacture so it would be
nice to get this instead of having to
pay an extra 15 dollars for it and for
those of you who want to use this with
an Xbox one keep in mind that you'll
need the stereo headset adapter with
this you can plug into 3.5 milimeter
input into the controller and use it to
listen to audio and chat an absolute
must for any Xbox one owner now of
course let's talk about the
performance I thoroughly enjoyed using
this headset game sounds and party chat
came in crystal-clear bass is clean but
not heavy so you won't expect any head
rattling when explosions go off or
anything like that
due to the sound isolation the air comes
provide you won't hear much going around
you besides the game that you're playing
and that really really helps for an
immersive experience voice chat and game
audio both sound great with the game
zero so I'm sure you won't be
disappointed you can of course also use
this to listen to music as well even
with regular music you'll get rich
detail amazing clarity and some pretty
subtle bass overall I'm very satisfied
with the performance of the games your
PC gaming headset the only real cons I'd
say this has to your average gamer is
the lack of compatibility to other
gaming systems without the $15.00 add-on
and the high price point however if you
have the cash to spend or you take
gaming seriously this is no doubt going
to be an asset to your gaming experience
but now let me show you guys what these
look like on and all right guys time to
show you what these look like on so here
we have it from the front boom you've
got the front view and the sides and of
course this is the top now when you want
to have the mic down you just throw it
down like this and you can adjust it so
it can get in closer proximity to the
mouth and get clear audio straight to
the mic and here you have it so like I
said guys these ear cups are a little
large but you're going to be playing
indoors so it doesn't really matter much
these are still awesome looking
headphones or headset so pretty much
that's about it for this review guys if
you plan on picking this up let me know
with a comment down below or if you're
looking at any other gaming headsets
leave comments down below as well and
that's about it
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy that gives this video a
thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
for more content from me and I'll catch
you guys in the next video till then
it's your average consumer
