consumer and this is my favorite MacBook
Pro set up which I basically outfitted
with a bunch of my personal favorite tag
and just to give you guys some context
this is where area and I will be doing
all of our editing unless we're working
on the go but I wanted it to be
comfortable and for it to fit all of our
needs and it does this whole entire
setup is powered by a 15-inch MacBook
Pro with touch bar and for my spec heads
this is the configuration I'm using a
shout out to be brown for the black
dragon skin you see here it's easily the
best scan I've ever used and if you're
interested in picking up one for your
device I'll be sure to have it linked
below and the best part about this setup
is that it all comes to life when I plug
in just two cables but the LG ultra fine
5k monitors and I'm sure some of you
guys have seen these monitors before but
they felt like an obvious choice if it
works so seamlessly with the MacBook Pro
especially since we use Final Cut Pro
before I got these monitors I added it
on my laptop and that was fine but a
little limiting sense to preview in
timeline were all on the same screen
but with this I get to use an entire
screen for the video preview and can
then work on my editing timeline on the
second screen and with all that extra
screen real estate we're finding it a
lot easier to edit our videos especially
considering we're not able to use a bit
more tools without them taking up the
entire screen now these monitors are
great not only because of the 5k
resolution but they've got amazing
screen quality they've got some pretty
decent built-in speakers an adjustable
base and they have a built-in USB hub
right in the back you get three USB
type-c ports and I pretty much have been
all outfitted with this awesome USB 3.0
adapters which makes my life a lot
easier when I have to plug in devices
that don't use USB type-c it's also
great because when I dock in my macbook
all of the accessories I have on the
desk are automatically connected to it
and I know these have a bit of a bad rep
through the router and Wi-Fi issues but
mine have been working just fine for me
without any issues at all so far knock
on work and if I ever feel like
switching it up I can go for three
monitor setup with the MacBook Pro in
the middle sometimes I really like this
setup because I get access to the touch
bar which has some really nice tools for
editing on Final Cut
Appl if you're listening please make a
magic keyboard with touch bar that would
be amazing now even though the monitors
have built-in speakers my personal
favorite low-profile desktop speakers
are the bose companion 5 and i've shown
you guys used before but they produce
great powerful sound without needing to
be large and bulky they even angled
nicely to get the sound directly to the
person using them and you can also
control the volume in you right from
this dial which also has a 3.5
millimeter jack in case you want to use
headphone and the doll also has an aux
port in case you want to plug in
something like a phone I start jamming
out with some music there and speaking
of headphones one of my favorites at the
moment are the sony MDR 1000x
they can be used wired or with bluetooth
which is a nice bonus since they have a
ton of features which makes them one of
the most advanced headphones out right
now but be sure to click the link below
to check out my last video about these
if you want the full details on them or
if you want to insert the giveaway I've
got going on to them right now
but they're resting on this headphone
hanger by Sennheiser and with this my
headphones are right at my side and
super accessible now in some of the
peripherals I got a couple of my
favorites so let's start off with the
mouth this is a tried and true Mouse and
a definitely a flavor for a lot of
youtubers I know the Logitech g600 -
this is close for gaming or even editing
with its 11 programmable buttons which
really helps my editing process since I
get quick access to things like cutting
deleting and all the other basic editing
functions it's also extremely
comfortable Wireless and has smooth
enough tracking to use without a mouse
pad this is definitely my favorite Mouse
of all time now as with the keyboard
we're rocking some more Logitech with UK
811 this keyboard fits the theme well
but it's also great because it's
specifically made for Mac OS but they
have a Windows version as well which
I'll link down below along with
everything else mentioned in this video
I also love how comfortable it is to use
it's got cool features like being able
to switch between three different
devices with the push of a button but in
all honesty I just love how comfortable
it is to type on this backlit keys are
nice and it looks great with Apple
products now even though we've got a
keyboard and mouse I've
Magic Trackpad to here which helps with
scrubbing through my timeline when I'm
editing so it's a must-have for me but
now let's talk a bit about storage
unfortunately means that the MacBook nor
the monitors have an SD card slot so I
have this card reader from Sony that
leads both SD cards and xqd cards that I
use for my ff7 and it's mounted up here
with a little 3m tape so that it stays
secure and this is nice because it's
clean and I don't have any dong zhuo's
hanging off my macbook and right under
that I have a one terabyte SSD from
Glyph then I went through some growing
pains with but it's turned out to be
pretty awesome portable storage it's a
very fast Drive and I'm even able to
edit projects directly off of it which
is awesome if I need to pass off a
project to a tree I've also got this
little stand to rest my iPhone 7 plus
and to keep it charged and yes I made
the switchbacks because I honestly
missed the synergy between the iPhone
and Mac both especially considering the
MacBook Pro is my main computer but
that's my macbook pro set up slash
editing station and just remember this
is what works for me and my workflow
meaning every kind of like how this is
set up and it's been working out pretty
well for us but if you guys are
interested in any of the cosmetic pieces
like that don't gum them or maybe that
lamp I'll have links to those down below
in the description as well hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video if you did be
the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one so then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
