consumer I know a ton of you guys have
been asking me about the monster
inspiration headphones so I finally got
in contact with someone at monster and
they shipped me out a pair some box for
you guys today so thanks to monster for
sending these out and it's not wasting
time let's get right into it alright
guys and here we have the monster
inspiration and like I said big shout
out to monster for sending these out to
me um really excited to UM try these out
I know a ton of you guys have been
asking you to pick these up and let you
know what I think about them so it's
really cool that I was able to get in
contact with someone at monster and get
a pair for you guys to review so let's
unbox this thing and I just want to give
you guys a quick heads up if you hear a
lot of wind in the background it might
be because it's hurricane sandy is
passing by and just want to give you
guys a heads up and I apologize in
advance if it makes too much noise but
back to these headphones um it's pretty
cool that this comes with a bonus
headband inside so they have
interchangeable headbands that's going
to be pretty interesting to see as you
can see here on the side they show you
little examples of that and um this is
the actual actually this is Dean
noise-canceling version I got these
because even though it's noise
cancelling it probably can be operated
without batteries which I'm a huge fan
of I like having the option of you know
not needing to use the batteries if I
don't want to so I know the SL 300 sold
by little Chris um also had this kind of
feature and I was really pleased with
the fact that it gave me a choice
unlike the studios and executives which
is pretty disappointing but this has
less you get them have the choice and
I'm pretty excited about that
um as you can see they have the control
it has a control talk cable on the
inside as well and that works with you
know all Apple products um it should
work with Android devices HTC phones all
stuff like that it also comes with a
straight cable and this is just a quick
look at what I look like on a couple of
people's heads so it's a give
quite a bit of an idea of what it's
going to look like on you if someone
looks like you here but alright enough
of that blabbering let's um skip this
thing unboxed and let's rip it open here
last to go love it that's taken care of
let's see how this opens up do you pull
it yeah
Oh a little flap will tell you alright
so you pull this little flap and boom
here you are and just gives you a little
picture on the inside of the headphones
so you got that right there and let's
see what's inside this little packaging
so here you've got some okay you got a
microfiber cloth and some more product
information let's see alright alright so
now that we got that off let's put this
thing down
alright so you've got a microfiber cloth
hair monster white this is um just to
give you guys an example of all the
different kinds of headbands that you
can attach to this to kind of change up
the look and make it fit to you what
your taste is like it was pretty cool as
you can see there's tons and tons of
options which is really cool kind of
kind of reminds me of the Seoul
Republic's that had like you know tons
of interchangeable headband colors and
stuff so this is really cool that you
can really make this fit what you wanted
to do that being armed we've got some
instructions of course some information
and let's see here
what's this more instructions and
warranty information and more
instruction ok so now that we got all
the paperwork out of the way let's see
the actual headphone
now this is okay this is an extra extra
band that it comes with which is pretty
cool all right so this is interesting
room it's got a nice soft feel on the
inside okay okay it gives it like a
leather slit all right cool we're going
to put this to the side for now I'll
give you guys a close-up when I'm
actually going to switch it out or
something and here we are with the
monster inspiration the case looks
pretty nice this is a pre premium look
in case I'm very impressed by this looks
great and it also has a little clip so
you can attach this to your book bag or
your suitcase whatever you want to put
this onto you can do that so it's pretty
cool so let's put this box aside and
open this thing up
alright so now let's flip this open at
the top and these are the inspiration
alright not bad these look pretty cool
guys I must say this is opened up pretty
cool so let me put this to the side real
quick see what else we get we get a ton
of cables apparently so you got okay
yeah we've got three cables inside there
and then this is the inside of the case
it's got a nice soft white material in
here and of course two triple A
batteries for the active
noise-cancelling so first off let's go
through these cables I think I mentioned
them all before when I was reading the
box what would be cool to show you guys
as well so let's see this is the
straight reg this is a regular straight
cable now this has no remote on it or
anything but this is pretty cool it's
gray this one now has the inline remote
the control talked so that's pretty cool
as well and this one is let's see okay
this one's pretty cool too it's the same
inline remote but this one doesn't have
the volume up and volume down buttons it
just has the play and pause and the
microphone so just to give you guys a
quick close-up of what they look like
and
here we have the ones without the volume
up and down buttons and it's just the
plain pause and the volume up and down
buttons look like this so this is pretty
cool and of course this works all Apple
products as I said and um you know
should work with some Android devices
and whatnot so it was pretty pretty nice
alright guys back to these headphones
now they say monster on the side
inspiration on the hinges up here this
is pretty cool this feels pretty sturdy
it's got a pretty thick headband that
feels pretty soft at the top so it's got
a lot of cushion right here and on the
ear cushions feel pretty soft as well so
this is not bad I'm pretty impressed by
these and as you can see they can fold
up like this and there you have it so
let me give you guys a quick close-up of
what the actual headphones look like and
alright guys here you have them this as
you can see it says monster right here
and of course it says inspiration there
you go
and also there's inspiration at the top
of the band like I said you can change
the bands so let's see how that how that
goes there you go so I was just able to
pull it out so out with this band let's
try that other one that is included so
putting it in is pretty simple
not bad alright so there's not you're
not going to have much trouble getting
these on headbands changed so that's
pretty cool you can see I've just
switched it out really easily so that's
nice and um pretty much that's it look
you can see how thick the band is at the
top it's got a lot of cushioning here
it's got a lot of cushioning on the
actual ear cups as well and of course
like I said it takes on two double-a
triple-a batteries so let's see where we
can um get those in alright guys so I
just found the compartment for the
triple-a batteries it's actually in the
ear cup you kind of just pull it down a
bit
and then boom there you go so let's put
in these batteries real quick and
alright so now it's putting these
batteries
get one here get one there and let's put
these back up and voila just like that
so now when you hit the switch it got it
has this little green light as you can
see here so it's critical can't wait to
give these a try
um and yeah that's about it for this
close-up guys and okay that pretty much
wraps up this unboxing um I'm definitely
going to have a review and girlfriend
tests all that good stuff of these
headphones maybe some comparisons if you
guys want to see some comparisons of
these and some other stuff let me know
down in the comment section below and
let me know what you want to see me
compare to so
alright that's about it for this
unboxing guys thanks again monster for
sending these out and I can't wait to
give him a test run alright till the
next video guys to cherish consumer
