lucky subscriber Gabe who was super
excited to win right now he's waiting
and B Best Buy parking lot so I'm about
to meet up with him and help him tech

about to go meet up with Gabe I have
some ideas for this setup that I would
want to do but it's not about me it's
about Gabe I'm just here to help Gabe
what's going on of course of course
congrats man y'all here exposing my
height what's wrong no I'm sorry all
right guys so we're about to do this we
got Gabe over here
he's obviously excited let's do this
y'all and my man got on the tix to
represent that to you
he's really great already y'all alright
guys so we've got Gabe here and we are
in vest I so the deal here is Hisense
wanted to sponsor $8,000
giveaway including the price of the TV
but I decided to change things up a bit
so we're gonna get him to TV but we'll
give you the full thousand dollars so
you can do the full giveaway here I'm
here to help you got any questions okay
you want some ideas to bounce off of me
I'm a resource for you right now but
this is your deal man awesome all right
let's go get some stuff
so this is the Hisense
h8f this is like one of their really
good TVs but at a friendly cost so we've
got you a 50 inch model and it has 4k
HDR Dolby vision the works everything
that you need it's Android TV so you
have Android built right into it so you
can actually activate the voice
assistant with the remote so you get to
speak to it give it commands help to do
certain things to answer questions you
still working with a 1080p all right all
right
it's the perfect upgrade this is the
perfect upgrade it also has smooth
motion with a 240 Hertz refresh rate
it's a smart TV so you have Netflix you
have all those apps that you come to
expect and it's there you LED television
so lots of tech inside of here you are
definitely gonna enjoy this thing man
thank you okay there we go
this guy is oh yeah I like how it
matches your kicks though oh it does the
whole box man all right the world is
your oyster man let's go what are what
are you thinking first every time me and
my wife we watch a good movie we like to
eat so okay I'm with that what's your
thinking we got the appliances and
whatnot yeah some nice air fryers over
there so our air fryers some items in a
movie item number one winds in the room
you know that this one looks like a nice
capacity going okay hundred bucks only
hundred dollars well this one looks a
fixture and there goes that and the way
baby is meant to be and you wanted the
wings it's here oh man you know video
needs to be 10 thing definitely the
options over there Nintendo looking real
good right now my gosh you know I'm a
big Nintendo fan man are you you have a
switch I don't oh yeah you got you got
to think about that oh my gosh can we
come back to this out yeah yeah yeah I
was actually looking for a tablet
I think tablets are down there okay so
let's go straight for it go over there
oh he's getting swayed by the Apple wait
wait you want the iPad 9:27 and yeah so
we'll grab one of these guys right here
okay okay
I'm out to be I'm gonna be your
calculator here yes please
350 we still got we've still got plenty
of room to video it like 650 so you know
coming we make a little suggestion here
yes please please if they have an amazon
firetv cube I would recommend that it's
not really it's not expensive right and
you can use straight up voice controls
to control the TV now the TV could do
all this too but if you aren't near by
it you can use this like as a backup
since it can go hands-free so 120 you
want yes let's go for it that's what all
right well I think that's a solid Buy I
think it's a great upgrade compared to
what I have so now let's add another 120
so we have for 70 plus tax and all that
other pretty solid man
that's much money and then some all
right let's go back now we want to do
this way let's do this which we got to
get some gaming in all right so if you
go for it right yeah like 8:30 all right
we doing it let's go yo you doing all
right then there goes smash so you got
the watching down you got games you got
smart home upgraded everything what
controls grub man what do I do
one other suggestion
okay okay let's see I feel like if you
have some decent audio you'd be you'd be
pretty happy man let's just get you like
a decent sound bar go to a decent sound
bar something with like a sub but if you
see anything else that you think Trump
Scott right by all means man want to
drop a hundred bucks on the light strips
get the LEDs now the guys working have
blue shirts on Oh try and get that pixel
a oh you um please stop that's the pixel
3a right 64 gig wow that looks amazing
but you would have to give something I
will have to sacrifice
that's what 350 that's 350 yeah I know I
know I've used it from my experience
it's a legit phone man that camera is no
joke and I think I might have to drop
that switch because that'll be even
almost like an even trade out I think
I'm gonna do that yeah hey whatever you
happy with man so now you have about 180
you know what I think um that sound bar
might be good okay I mean that's gonna
be good though so when you're watching
like your movies and we're eating your
wings it's gonna be booming okay cool
cool cool all right so we'll grab one of
these guys with that you're solid man
that's game let's go get that phone yeah
let's just do that
we went $40 over but it's all good
oh man where you gonna stop that's for
$40 thank you oh how you feel how you
feel I'm high dude oh man let's all take
this somewhere and then take a look at
it polka dot all right man so you got
your spoils
how you feeling feeling great man I'm no
words can describe this man I'm glad
you're happy
I'm height man I'm height I'm ready to
try this stuff out so you got your
50-inch Hisense 4k HDR TV but not only
does he have the TV here but he's also
got the Amazon fire TV cue let's go so
not only that but you got the sound bar
behind you trying to kind of complete
the whole entertainment setup so while
we love TV speakers if you can get a
dedicated sound bar take your nya take
it higher and takes it up a notch not
only that my man got what you get here
man what is that man baby and then his
wife they cook up some food before they
seen us sit down and watch why not and
you also got some real goodies in here
too so he has an iPad nine point seven

from going with a Nintendo switch and
Smash Bros to completely upgrading his
phone without killing his budget so the
pixel three a solid phone it's gonna be
