massive tech unboxing you know what time
it is
get your snacks get your drinks we're
gonna chill open up a lot of cool tech
because this one's a good one
now ari is an absolute traitor she's not
here right now she went to go do some
house stuff so she can't pick some I

the samurai blade from last time you
know I love this thing oh you picked a
good one my friend right here you got
the 1 plus 6 and yes I know you guys are
waiting for this video it is coming out
trust me very soon but this one right
here is the silk white oh well let's get
rid of just hold on oh that's nice I can
see why they call it so quite but it's
got this nice coating on it it would
have been even better if they called it
like pearl white or something but silk
white that still works this is a clean
clean looking phone now I'm not gonna
talk too much about the oneplus 6
because you know you guys gotta check
the video for that but uh this is a
really good phone spoil alert I should
have said spoiler at first but whatever
okay so here we have a Nintendo switch
pro controller and some joy cons but
these aren't your standard ones you know
Scala where it up this one's from their
128-bit line you know already he had is
nice so you know this is all based on
the Super Nintendo so if you really love
Super Nintendo and you're one of those
people who went nuts when they
rereleased it with all those games
you're gonna want this in your
collection if you have a switch this is
dope and of course you know the joy cons
are gonna look like this too so check
these out guys these are the joy cons
that
with it and then this looks so so good
this is a great combo they kill it every
time if you guys aren't familiar with
kala where they customized a ton of tech
gear they've done so many things for me
now if you have a Nintendo switch lucky
for you me and color are teaming up and
doing a giveaway over on Instagram so
all you got to do is hit the link down
below run to my Instagram page look for
the post about these guys leave a
comment all that good stuff the rules
will be there enter and you get a chance
to win these guys so good luck to you
folks whoever wins is gonna be happy
oh-ho-ho-ho-ho so yeah but what we have
right here guys is the sony SP 700 n
these are those wireless active
noise-cancelling earbuds that i showed
you guys during CES one of the first
things that impressed me when i went to
look at headphones was this guy so this
is really cool to see so this is for
people who like sports I think it's
waterproof you got active
noise-cancelling lots of good stuff but
I actually want to open this up cuz I'm
excited and inside of the box you of
course have your charging case that
we're seeing with a lot of truly
wireless earbuds and of course the
earbuds themselves and you also get a
USB cable micro USB as well as some
earbuds and some wingtip hmm they fit in
very easily and I remember this from CES
DS I had no problem getting them on
that's nice
even though I'm not gonna like these are
a bit on the larger side when it comes
to these kind of earbuds and just for
those of you who don't know about
wireless earbuds like that you just kind
of throw them inside of this case and
this is where they get their juice they
charge up right inside of here and it's
easy to carry them around mmm you're
done all right what's next we go for
some of the big stuff I feel like we
should go for some of the big stuff you
might remember the electric scooter
board that I showed on the channel
before this is the official version
all right oh she even cookies interested
look at that so they really upgraded the
look compared to the one that the
prototype that we had for those of you
who have never seen a scooter board
before you can pretty much take it like
this and boom you're in scooter modes so
this thing is like an electric scooter
pretty much you give it a kick and then
you have a little control right here
that allows the motor to kick in and
then you keep on going so that way you
won't just hit the trigger by mistake
and have a take off yeah this is this is
gonna be fun
so if you guys are interested in this as
well as anything else in this video
everything is gonna be linked down below
in the description oh wait there's
something else oh the huawei mate book
10 Pro and the huawei media pad m5 nice
ok
wait a minute NVIDIA GeForce what are
the specs on this guy so we have a
dongle right inside so this thing is a
USB type-c
you also get a USB port over here and
you also get another USB C HDMI and I
guess a display adapter looks a little
small for VGA but has to be a display
adapter get your cable as well and this
is your power brick all that color is
nice oh that is a clean looking device
right here looks like a MacBook I'm not
gonna lie
screen looks kind of good ok guys so
before I put this thing away there are a
couple of cool things going on here I
believe there's a Thunderbolt 3 port
right here and this is where you charger
this is a standard USB type-c I'll
correct myself if I'm wrong this is a
fingerprint scanner right here on the
power button so that's awesome so
something you'll notice it with these
super small bezels on this display is
that there's no webcam anywhere
but there's actually a webcam button
right
here look what happens hmm
you got your webcam that pops right up
that is cool so if you're worried about
privacy and security somebody hacking
into your webcam you put that thing away
and nobody seeing anything that is
really cool okay so my excitement level
for this has gone up quite a bit okay
and inside of here you get power adapter
sim ejector tool this thing must be able
to take a SIM card and a USB type-c
cable and some paperwork oh and a dongle
for your headphone there's no headphone
jack on this but it's a tablet there
should be space I'm a little
disappointed by that tablets are the
last things I would think would have a
headphone jack excluded but okay so it's
got these crazy long speaker grilles
here on each side so I'm expecting the
audio to sound really good it says high
res audio on the Box Harman Kardon so
I'm expecting good stuff but man this
thing has no headphone jack that's a
little baffling to me now this thing is
running Android if you guys are
interested in learning more about this
in a future video let me know with a
comment down below of course do that for
any product that you see in today's
video let me know if you really want to
see it in another video
with a comment down below oh I saw these
cases online so this is a tenth
anniversary limited edition classic
iPhone case that they came out with so I
got this leather case on mine right now
no we got a co teal okay I could dig it
this color looks beautiful to me this
thing tell me this thing doesn't pop you
know it does so that's cool lots of
different options if you're a classic
iPhone lover I'm sure you'll love these
oh these are ND filters for the iPhone
really so basically these guys are
trying to give the iPhone a cinematic
look with these nd filters oh snap this
looks
official okay not bad now I'd have to go
take this outdoors to really mess around
with it and see what I could shoot with
this but it's a cool concept and this
definitely does seem high quality so RJ
makes some awesome premium earbuds and
some budget-friendly ones as well and
they just came out with a wireless
version so I want to see what they've
got
oh snap this came with raspberry and
vanilla bean white chocolate trying to
butter me up folks so here it is this is
the ma 650 Wireless are a chaise
wireless earbuds oh that packaging
though that's that's a nice display
right there this looks good huh and
that's one thing I love about RHA they
give you a ton of different ear buds so
if one size doesn't fit you you know you
have quite a few different options here
and this thing is supposed to have 12
hours of battery life which is actually
really good
Oh uses USB type-c that is a nice bonus
and I believe they got that magnetic
body so you can keep them together
so these I'm very very excited for I
can't wait to give it a try right here
we have the RA ma 390 universal so here
we have it now this is a standard earbud
and you're still getting that RHA
premium quality but at a much much
cheaper price so this is nice standard
stuff nothing too crazy here by regular
3.5 millimeter Jack travel pouch and
some earbuds these are from vo or file I
can't remember but I think it's file and
these are headphone amplifiers so right
here we have the q1 mark 2 this is a DAC
and headphone amp so if you want to
listen to your music and you want to get
more juice into your headphones and get
better audio quality you're going to
want one of these so this right here is
the bluetooth headphone amp so what
you're going to be able to do with this
guy is you're going to be able to pair
it with your phone or whatever
device and is going to have a Bluetooth
connection and right here you're gonna
be able to plug in your 3.5 millimeter
headphone cable so if you got a pair of
headphones you can just throw them in
here and have a Bluetooth connection to
your phone or whatever device and it's
an amp so you're gonna get even better
audio quality than you would from a
regular headphone jack so this is
actually a nice item for those phones
out there that don't have a headphone
jack and you kind of force into
bluetooth or using the same power
connector okay so this is a cool looking
headphone amplifier I've used some of
theirs in the past but this is kind of
something that I was looking for because
you know they kill off the headphone
jacks leave us barren leave us with
nothing but bluetooth headphones I
wanted to see what this thing could
offer to something like the iPhone 10
hey we still got so much more to go now
this right here is from the same guys
who made the electric scooter board and
right here guys we've got the glide Bri
this is as you can see an electric
unicycle today this thing is heavy for
one wheel whew oh snap look at this
thing has a tire on it this is like a
legit tire this thing looks high-quality
though but basically guys this is like a
unicycle but it's an electric unicycle
that you can just ride with one wheel oh
man I am this is like super scary but
super exciting at the same time oh yeah
I picked up the surface dial this is not
super exciting or anything but I got the
surface dowel after I made that black
panther video because I thought that was
really cool so I got the surface dog
because it works with the surface book
too and I love my surface book too so
this works with it I want to try it out
right here in this inconspicuous box we
have a phone now this isn't the retail
packaging or anything
but will phone take a guess pause the
video leave a comment down below this
right here this is the ACC you twelve
plus this is nice and it's got that blue
okay this looks cool so these are those
faux buttons that everyone's talking
about they're basically like fake
buttons on the side there's a really
hard I guess when you turn it on you're
supposed to feel a little bit more this
is a good looking phone this looks like
it's gonna be a nightmare to try and
shoot on video because of all the
reflections but take a look at this you
probably won't be able to see it from
this camera but it's kind of see-through
you can see the internals right up here
that's a good look and you don't really
see phones in this color I used to be a
huge HTC fan back in the day oh that's
the jingle I'm excited to give this a
shot
do you 12 plus it's a good-looking phone
hmm the you'll phone power five and it
includes a wireless charger flash
wireless charging ticket 13,000 milliamp
hours what Oh dinner joking oh wow
okay this is a thick phone yes it does
have 13,000 milliamp hours this feels
like a portable charger okay so it's got
an 18 by 9 aspect ratio it's got an 8
core processor dual rear cameras 21
megapixel 5 megapixel dual front facing
cameras 6 gigs of ram 64 gigs of ram I'm
guessing that's 64 gigs of storage okay
so it's got full HD for a 18 by 9 aspect
ratio 2160 by 1080 13,000 this is never
going to die on you Wow face ID a
fingerprint scanner Android 8.1 and
wireless charging on this and it's got
USB type-c this is oh okay I am very
very interested I don't know how good
the processor is but here we have it the
yo phone power five it's a brick it's a
brick y'all but these specs are worth
taking a look at let's see what the
grand finale is like so I went ahead and
got another one of those RGB mouse pads
I like our jeebies what you want me to
say this one is by Corsair has a USB
port in the back which I find very
useful so this is there mmm 800 mouse
pad so like I said you get those LEDs
around the nice rubbery bottom so you're
not gonna have a sliding around the
bunch yeah I just wanted to get one of
these from Corsair and the last thing
which was a purchase influenced by
recently building my own PC there was a
lot of screwing in little screws so I
decided to get this little screwdriver
that has a motor but it's not a crazy
motor or anything so you're not gonna go
and destroy your PC in the process you
can kind of use this just to save
yourself some time instead of just so
yeah I wanted to pick this up because I
figured I'd be doing more work on that
PC and whenever I do that I'm gonna want
to have something like this just to make
my life a little bit easier and it
wasn't really expensive so why not but
