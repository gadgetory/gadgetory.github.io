consumer and today I have another
unboxing for you guys of the brand new
iPad Mini
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the iPad Mini I'm pretty interested in
seeing with iPads version of a 7-inch
tablet or 8 inch tablet this is 7.9
inches so it's pretty close to 8 inches
they're pretty interesting to see what
this is like from what I've heard it's
pretty much like an iPad 2 but in a
smaller version there's no Retina
display or anything like that but um
enough about to talking it's pretty
simple design on the box very minimalist
like Apple does and hey let's get to the
unboxing so we're gonna just pop open
the sides like so and then we'll just
rip this open I can't find my unboxing
knife or else I would have used it but
we'll have to do with this all right
I've got the plastic off now let's see
what comes inside and okay
I of course got the slate version
because I like my Apple products with
the black the black version more so than
the white so this is it okay pretty nice
and I see of course got the wall adapter
some packaging of course you got your
lightning cable over here let's see what
we got inside course some instructions
and stickers always gotta have some
stickers and as you can see this is the
lightning cable I think this is can be
called standard now since all my solves
Apple's products have it okay and that's
about this let's see the mini so we'll
get this plastic
I love the slate colors devices I think
they're the they're my favorite and okay
this is it pretty nice actually like the
feel of this this feels pretty good let
me give you guys a quick close-up of
what I'm seeing I know you guys can see
the reflection of the camera here but
this is the FaceTime HD camera that they
have up top just got the volume rocker
and I guess I'm the mute button or it
can sweep probably can use this to
switch the keep the orientation lock or
use it for mute we've got the 5
megapixel camera this can record in
1080p HD and of course you have the
Lightning port right here your speakers
at the bottom as well not sort of both
of these have a speaker in it but this
is where the speakers are your 3.5
headphone jack this is probably a mic
right there
and pretty much this is it guys this is
the iPad Mini
so let's power this thing on and most
likely it has some juice as you can see
here I must say I do like the design I
do like the feel of it this definitely
can be used with one hand so that's
pretty cool and here's the back of it as
you can see here this is very similar to
the new iPod touch and the new iPhone
which I do have here with me so we've
got the iPod touch to the left the iPad
Mini and the iPhone to the right so it's
all the slate-colored versions so I'm
very very happy with this design I like
this very much
so it all shares that same kind of vibe
but it really looks like a family here
it's pretty cool stuff now of course we
got to compare the screen size all this
thing is still booting up ok so here it
is it shows up is iPad but let's just
compare it to some other products here I
have the Nexus 7 and we compare the
screen size
they seem to be okay the mini seems to
be just a little bit taller than Nexus 7
as you can see here this is a bit taller
a little bit wider if you could put it
like this you can see how much the iPad
Mini goes around it and comparing it to
something like the original this is the
iPad 2 I don't have any of the newer
iPad this is the iPad 2 and comparing
the screen size here you can see that
this is much smaller so you've got some
King examples going from iPad from iPad
2 iPad Mini to iPhone to iPod Touch you
can kind of see the difference in sizes
iPod Touch and iPhone pretty much the
same size to both 4 inches but here we
are pretty much there I've set this
unboxing guys you got to see what was
inside you see how the design is I do
kind of like the new design that they've
got the new form factor that they've
gone with these the iPod Touch also
shares the same kind of feel it's not so
much curved in now feels kind of
rectangular around the UM device so it's
kind of like a rectangular look here and
the iPad it has that really curved look
you can see that I just go really down
that's not the case with the mini the
mini come kind of comes down a little a
little different and it makes it for
holding it a lot easier I think I've
experienced that with the iPod touch
compared to the old one so that pretty
much wraps it up guys enough of my
babbling definitely stay tuned for the
review comparisons between like Nexus 7
stuff like that and thanks for watching
until the next video guys your average
consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
