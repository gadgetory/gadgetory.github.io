and today we're doing an updated office
tour in 2018 I don't think I did one for
like two years now you guys should be
familiar with this area this right here
is the gamers paradise I've done a few
videos on these you guys might have seen
it but this is where we have a ton of
games a ton of Gundam now not much has
changed here since last time you guys
saw this place on video but there have
been a few nice upgrades first one being
the Eko Beast which Plus and he
shout-out to our friends over at ecobee
for sponsoring today's video it has a
built-in Amazon alexa inside of it and
with that you'll be able to ask your
questions give it commands control your
smart home Alexa turn on Sealand wipes
it actually has built-in sensors so it
has smart features that allows it to
turn on and off lights whenever someone
comes in or if someone stays out of the
room for a long time not to mention it
also has a built-in nightlight so it's
gonna be good for the kids as well it's
also going to be getting some
functionality in the future so that it
works with the eco before that we have
right out here and when they're paired
together is going to work as a separate
room sensor so that it can allow the
ecobee for two minutes hot and cold
spots in your house this is actually a
really cool thermostat you can of course
control it very easily with this touch
panel on the front and it has ms on
alexa built right into it but what I
love about this thing is that it has
remote controls so that if you're away
you can use your smart phone app to
control the temperature and visually
take care of things right from your
phone and check out echo V comm /s x SW
to insert it when your very own echo be
outfitted smart home but both of these
are officially out right now I'll have
links to them down below in the
description but aside from the switches
and the thermostat guys I've also got a
little upgrade here in the looks of
these shades now I'm gonna be completely
honest with you guys I don't think these
look the best these are from I believe
link shades now why I got these is
because one they're blackout curtains
which is nice for when I'm shooting but
what's also great is that they've got
these remote controls so that I can just
hit a button
and I'm able to have the shades go up I
can control it by having it go down and
of course you guys have seen my iMac pro
setup I don't I don't know if I went in
depth with what's going on over here in
terms of all of the accessories that
we've got so if you guys are interested
in seeing a full-blown video about that
let me know what to comment down below
heck throw in some likes maybe get the 0
to 10 K but yeah let me know if you guys
would be interested in seeing a video on
this it's actually a pretty cool setup
and this guy right here you guys saw me
pick this up in the massive tech
unboxing this turned out to be a much
cooler product than I thought I am
really happy with this you can open a
ton of different things on this guy I
haven't fully customized it and set it
up yet but this thing is really cool if
you're interested in seeing that feature
in another video I'm not gonna ask you
guys I'm gonna feature this thing in
another video you guys gonna get more
details because that thing is awesome
alright guys this is what we call the
orange room why is it called the orange
room well because we got an orange couch
in here but this is pretty much the
office now we do have some new people
helping out on the channel and this is
pretty much where they get their work
done so over here we've got a setup
and on this side we've got a setup as
well you guys might have seen this setup
before it's been my setup for years now
really but you know it's got the nice
Grove made products here to go with this
iMac we've got the nice wood walnut look
going for with the white desk I love
this table it's great to get b-roll
looks so good
but over here we've got a lot of ware
which you've been seeing some new
graphic stuff when it comes to the
thumbnail so this is kind of where that
magic happens so we've got a little Mac
Pro over here this is an asus monitor i
forget the model number for this guy but
this thing is no joke
so it's an ultra wide gaming monitor
being used with the mac pro but whatever
it takes to get the job done
but what you'll notice guys is that
there's not a ton of tech inside of this
room we've got some cool lights and
stuff like the aurora and Annalise to
kind of tie the look and theme of this
room all together but you really won't
see that much aside from these desks as
well as this little
entertainment area this has this is one
of the Samsung TVs that I got a while
back has 4k HD are 55 inches does its
thing it's a great TV but we also have a
sony sound bar i forget that model
number but it's got a subwoofer dolby
atmos this thing sounds great so when
we're in here we're pretty much chillin
or you know getting some work done
behind the computer and you don't forgot
this home pod when it comes to listening
to our music we have this as an option
as well as the sound bar but this just
makes it easy to just ask Siri to play
something it doesn't take up a lot of
space it looks good and it sounds really
awesome now one cool thing that I really
like about this room is its closet you
guys know I take my closet seriously but
this is pretty much where we have a ton
of equipment now this is where
everything gets stored from old monitors
to a ton of laptops this is so much that
goes into this closet on the right side
we have all of our cameras and
everything so all the things that we use
to shoot our videos record any Content
it's all right here down there do you
see this mess guys inside of this
container are all headphone cases as
well as light stands backdrops so this
is where everything gets stored this is
how we try to keep it clean on the
outside so yeah lots of nice space
inside of there but let me show you
where we put all the real equipment now
I got to show you guys the living room
firstly this is our entryway it's got
the 100 cakes subscriber plaque shout
out to you guys but over here we've also
got some Electric skateboards I've got
two z boards the first generation and
second a boosted board and the scooter
board which ever uses this is her her
way to get around but I love my booster
board this thing is awesome and the Z
board - and listen
we bought some water for all everybody
who works here and I already kind of
overdid it but we can never say we're
thirsty
and this right here is our kitchen phase
honestly not a lot of tech going on over
here we do have some smart lightbulbs
that worked when we give it commands to
turn on we have all of the outlets being
taken up by battery chargers for all our
different cameras and whatnot so it's a
kitchen what do you expect nothing too
crazy inside of here but we do have
right here this is pretty much our set
this is where all the shooting goes down
even right here in front of me or behind
me rather is where I do my voiceovers so
this is where all that gets done
we of course have some Aurora Nano Leafs
in here to give us some nice color
I got a Sky panel but I am noticing that
it is a bit dark in here so I'm going to
actually use this guy to give it a bit
more light Oh too much light all right
but yeah we got a few desk in here just
to give you guys an idea of what
everything is this is the flood setup
you guys know flood floods an amazing
gaming PC we've got tons of peripherals
around it there's nice color where
keyboard with this keyboard they
actually colored it to be black and
white to fit the theme that I've got
going on with floods so this thing looks
awesome man gear does an amazing job at
crafting their pcs I mean look at this
get his handiwork guys looks amazing
cookie monster wants to say hello don't
mind her gigantic a little polo over
here she's got a scratching issue say
what's up cookie all right Colin get out
of here get out of here so yeah this is
pretty much where we shoot this is like
my favorite b-roll area it's got a lot
of nice colors I like the wood look you
guys know that and you see a lot of
greenery here I just like my videos to
be nice bright and vibrant with lots of
color so that's why I kind of designed
it to look like this so this is an
awesome setup over here
yeah this is where a lot of the shooting
gets done honestly I just love the way
it looks but over here we've got tons
more equipment so this is a jib with
this gym you can throw a camera on top
and kind of bring it down use it to get
all kinds of cool shots this thing is
awesome but it's just I can't it we got
this is my baby right here this is my
day one this is the sony fs7 ah
let me tell you guys this is what
brought me into the 4k world and it
treated me so well I love what I get out
of this camera an amazing and investment
for a few years now and we've got a
couple of other things in terms of
camera gear here as well tripods little
lights C stands and tons of batteries so
we need batteries because we're always
shooting we always need a lot of
batteries on the charger and we even
have the DJI Ronin so if you guys have
been seeing some nice clean shots lately
and then coming from this guy and this
other gimbal that we actually have so
nice clean stuff over here and for a pro
tip for some of you guys who have a ton
of camera gear and you're doing shooting
in lots of different locations get
yourself one of these little trays from
Ikea so this little tray holds all of my
lenses so whenever I'm shooting let's
say I'm shooting over here and I need to
go over to that side I need access to
all my lenses just walk them over and
boom you got access to them and you guys
might have noticed this like black-ish
grayish wall back here I actually got
this color from my boy John he found
this amazing color to shoot video off of
it it said this thing has just been
great so I had one of the walls painted
and this thing has been treating me well
ever since so shout out to John so this
is pretty much the space that we use to
get our videos done hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did leave the cool guy
girl I give this video a thumbs up
subscribe all that good stuff but I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's ravage consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
