and today we are introducing a brand new
series awesome
but overpriced tech and today's culprit
is this guy right here this is the
Sierra modern home smart speaker coffee
table thing don't get me wrong this
thing is absolutely awesome and we'll
talk about price a little bit later but
let's talk about all the cool things
that this thing can do now as you guys
can see this thing is an awesome looking
coffee table it's got a nice dark walnut
look to it and it also has that just
nice gray stitching it looks really good
it really fits with the aesthetic of
kind of what we're doing in this little
studio it looks awesome and it's a cool
coffee table it works as you would
expect a coffee table too now there is
another color with more of like a veneer
would look to it and this is the other
one now I initially picked this one up
at first honestly it just doesn't fit
with what I was looking for but it's not
a bad looking coffee table but this one
I think this one right here this one
just looks amazing okay so you're
sitting you got a nice coffee table on
the side if it's with the aesthetic of
your room now what makes it special
besides it just being a coffee table
well there's some really cool tech that
we got to talk about now I know you see
these buttons over here and that's
because this table has a built-in
bluetooth speaker so it could connect to
your phone or any other Bluetooth device
and you can stream music right from the
coffee table and what's awesome is that
this thing gets crazy loud has some
great bass and vocals come in really
clearly show you guys what I'm talking
about so first of all shout out to
spider-man
enter the spider verse
now that's not even anywhere close to
max volume but check it out I don't know
if this doesn't translate well over
video but I'm telling you guys it gets
loud now these are one of those speakers
where even if you bring the volume all
the way up on your phone you're gonna
want to control it here as well as
separate but it gets so loud and there's
a lot of bass this is a pretty big room
I don't know if you guys can tell but it
is a large room and it is loud enough to
completely fill it all by itself now not
only does it work with Bluetooth but it
also has an aux port in the back so if
there's a device that you guys want to
have plugged into it you can just plug
in the aux cable right here but as you
guys can see here there are a couple
other things in the back here as well of
course you have a DC in this is where
you actually plug it into the wall and
as you guys can see here this thing is
functioning without that and that's
because this thing has a built-in
battery
this one right here has a 6600 milliamp
hour battery inside of it and I believe
there's a 13,000 milliamp hour version
as well so you can take the capacity
that you need so if you really care
about your aesthetic and you don't want
to see a black cable plug into this guy
you can always unplug it still listen to
your music and access all of the
features that this thing has which is
awesome now having that built in battery
is awesome for a few reasons you have
two USB ports over here so that means
that this thing is going to be able to
charge your devices without needing to
be plugged into anything so essentially
it's like a portable charger now with it
being portable that means you can take
this put it anywhere you want to in the
room so I can just have it right here
it's not gonna be an issue whatsoever I
don't need to have it near an outlet
that is great for designing your room
and having a really cohesive look
without having that black cable what's
also nice is if you just want to take
this thing somewhere else completely
maybe a friend's house you can do that
it's actually really easy to take apart
and assemble honestly I was really
surprised when we first put it together
all you need to do is really screw in
three legs that it comes with and it's a
one-and-done kind of process so not only
does this thing have a crazy loud
bluetooth speaker with some great sound
quality but it also has that built-in
battery so that you can move this thing
around take it wherever you'd like
completes it right here and charge up my
devices without having a cable plugged
in or check this out guys I know you see
this little symbol over here see this
right here something Wireless right well
you can just roll your phone down boom
the thing also has wireless charging
built right into it can you imagine
having people over someone just places
their phone down on here walk away and
they're like wait a minute why have my
phone charged imagine that but it's cool
because you don't need any cables it's
just a nice feature to have and it's
something you would not expect in a
coffee table that looks like this or a
side table that looks like this because
this thing looks like it's not super
techy but it really does have all the
features you would kind of want from it
now while this is an absolutely awesome
side table now we got to talk about the
price you knew it was coming this thing
goes for 220 bucks now I don't know how
many of you badly need a side table with
a Bluetooth speaker and portable charger
inside of it and honestly I wish this
thing was a hundred bucks less if it
were a hundred dollars less insta buy
insta cop you have to get it it's just
great so for me it's a little bit
overpriced if you don't have that
specific need I don't think anyone
really does but that does not take away
from the fact that it is just an awesome
awesome piece of tech and I genuinely
really like it I just wish it didn't
cost so much so that is why this is
going to be the first item on our
awesome but overpriced tech list the
Sierra modern home side table thing it's
dope though
now would you buy this you would oh
okay Jay would you buy this CJ says it
has some little whittling thing going on
I don't I don't really see oh I guess if
you tip on one side too much maybe
stability
that's something I've never reviewed it
side table before so I'm sorry if I
didn't mention that okay so Jay Jay says
no Malcom undecided because he's
flip-flopping on his answer I like it a
lot I'm a huge techie so I think it's
great but I want to know what you guys
think if you pick this up I think you'll
enjoy it if you've got the money for it
you'll absolutely enjoy it but it is
expensive let me know what you guys
think and what you think of this series
are you interested in hearing more about
cool tech that I think is just a little
bit too pricey let me know what's a
comment down below what you think of
this new series and I'll catch you guys
