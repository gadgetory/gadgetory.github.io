average consumer and I feel like it's
been a while since I showed you guys
some awesome tech under 50 bucks so
we've got a new list today but I got to
give a huge shout-out to ExxonMobil for
sponsoring today's video and first up on
our list you gotta have that new Google
home menu basically this is the little
brother to the Google home which is
pretty much a voice assistant you can
place in your home
much like the Amazon echo and echo die
what's great about the meaning though is
that it has all the features of the
normal Google home but it comes at a
cheaper price and a much smaller body so
that means you can ask anything that you
would ask Google from random questions
to setting reminders to even playing
music and controlling smart home
products it can do other cool things
like recognize who's talking to it make
phone calls and a bunch more but if you
guys want to learn more about its
capabilities I'll have a more in-depth
video that I did linked down below in
the description if you guys want to
check it out and next up we've got this
aki 46 watt USB type-c wall adapter
something really important to note here
is that this wall adapter supports USB
PD which stands for power delivery and
this is what you'll need to see on your
adapter if you want to access the quick
charge feature you find on the new
iPhones this thing goes for 40 bucks
which is ten dollars less than the
option that Apple offers and what's
great here is that unlike Apple's
version it also includes a normal USB
port so you can charge multiple devices
if you like so don't get caught up with
all of the USB type-c wall adapters that
are out right now make sure you get one
that has USB PD
so you can quick charge your iPhone and
while we're talking about Apple we all
know they recently brought wireless
charging over to the new phones so I
figured I'd show you guys this car mount
from IOT that I've been using over the
last few years now this isn't the first
time I mentioned this on the channel but
I noticed in some of my recent videos
where I happened to show it I still get
a lot of questions about it so this car
mount has built-in wireless charging so
whether you're using one of the new
iPhones or one of the mini Android
phones that have had wireless charging
forever you'll be able to kill two birds
with one stone here by having a great
phone holder in your car for whenever
you want to use GPS and by having an
easier way to charge your phone when you
get in the car and I'm telling you guys
it is dead simple to get your phone in
here
you just squeeze the arms open you place
your phone down and it locks it in place
and this thing is also super flexible
whatever viewing angle you would
possibly desire you're going to be able
to get it with this guy and so all my
Nintendo switch lovers out there we've
got a portable dock by teh top which is
a very nice replacement to the dock that
the switch comes with if you want to
take your big-screen gaming on the go
you might have seen me mention this in
my ultimate gamers backpack video and if
you haven't seen that video I have a
link down below if you want to see what
I carry but I really like this option
because there's way less bulk compared
to the original dock and if you want to
pack it away in a backpack or something
it makes taking on a trip much easier
you still get three USB ports a USB
type-c port and an HDMI slot like the
original so you're not missing out on
anything at all here what's also great
is that unlike a ton of docks you'll
find on Amazon this isn't a DUI option
everything you need to make it
functional it comes right inside of it
and not to mention this thing is 35
bucks compared so I think the 80 bucks
that an original dock costs so this is
definitely a good option for any switch
player and last on our list is this cool
selfie stick stand set for GoPros and
smartphones and trust me I know selfie
sticks are kind of played out and not
everyone is a fan but I actually think
there's some pretty good functionality
and gear included here so of course you
get the selfie stick itself a mini
tripod a wireless remote and some
attachments for smartphones and a GoPro
so you can use the selfie stick for wide
selfie shots but what I like here is
that the stick can be attached to the
mini tripod which can give you some nice
options in terms of setting up a shot
you can even give your phone some real
height without even needing to hold a
stick and while positioning may be a
little limited due to weight and balance
you can still get some really nice
angles if you work it right I try to be
on the lookout for beginner gear for
those who want to start creating content
but only have things like their cell
phones handy so I think this would be a
good piece to add to your arsenal if
you're in that boat but again I gotta
give a huge shout out to today's sponsor
Exxon Mobil if you ever heard they've
got a pretty cool app called speed pass
plus and with it you'll be able to pay
for your gas right from the app without
having to even pull out your wallet and
app to pay for your gas it is a good
time to be alive folks so you can fill
up and pay from
phone and get some great savings you can
even apply for the Exxon Mobil smart
card right within the app and if
approved you can start using it
immediately if you think out this point
system for every time you fuel up so you
can stack your points and get some
savings when you redeem them if you guys
want to learn more and get started head
on over to get speed pass plus comm
slash Dubner and I'll of course have
that link down below in the description
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy girl that
gives these video thumbs up I'll catch
you guys in the next one till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
