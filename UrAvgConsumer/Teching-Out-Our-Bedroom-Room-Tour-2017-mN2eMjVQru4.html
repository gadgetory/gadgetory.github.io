it has been a long time since you guys
have blasting this room I think the only
other time you guys saw it was back in
2014 when you did an apartment tour but
we are here again back then I did not
allow me to play any tech in this room
because I had my own little recording
space in the other room this one has to
be tech list but I broke her down folks
and now we have tech in here we're
checking out this room and let's start
with the biggest piece of tech this
mattress from Sleep Number and shout out
to suite number for sponsoring today's
video and getting the ball rolling on
checking out this room and we made the
bed and everything for you guys that's
how you know it's special but right here
we have the i8 mattress looks funny
enough is my dream car but this is a
king-sized bed guys and I promise you it
is awesome but there is some cool tech
inside of here which is shocking enough
because this is a mattress you don't
expect tech in a mattress but they've
actually got some really awesome stuff
now it is we call Sleep Number for no
reason you can actually control the
Sleep Number that you have right with
this remote and basically what that
means for me and Ari is that we can
control how soft and how far in the bed
is and that actually works for me in
Eric because Eric prefers a firmer bed
than I do I like to sleep on clouds baby
Harry doesn't I don't understand it
now the bed will even give you a
tutorial to find your Sleep Number and
they even offer something called fleet
like you to see how well that number is
working out for you and it tells you a
ton of information so that you can
better track your sleep and know what
kind of patterns you want to adopt so
that you can make sure you get a restful
night's sleep and you guys all know how
important it is to get some proper sleep
or else oh you're going to be a zombie
the next day it'd be super hard for me
personally to get a video out so I'm
guessing good sleep but you guys can
actually get a chance to win one of
their mattresses I think they're giving
away a queen size p5 mattress so if you
guys want to enter all you have to do is
click the link down below in the
description use the Sleep Number store
locator and then leave a comment down
below with the closest store near you
and whatever sleep issue you may have
and why you want to win now obviously
the biggest piece of tech in this room
is the mattress probably in the whole
apartment but something you'll notice
all over is the fact that we have smart
lighting just about everywhere so at the
hot top of this headboard you'll see
that we've got some lights even at the
bottom over there on the best the
dresser wherever you look there's some
cool lighting and that's all powered by
philips hue and it's a nice way to make
a room feel sort of techie without
something that's like really in your
face so it's a nice subtle accent that
you know gives you that nice tag vibe
and you can control it all using
something like the Google home that we
have right here on the side now over
here on this desk we've got pretty much
Aries iMac and a little setup for her if
you couldn't tell by all the pink but
yeah this is all Aries but like I said
we do have a Google home here that we
can control all the lighting in this
room so I could go ahead and give it
commands like hey Google turn off all
bedroom lights okay turning seven lights
off and boom they're all gone so hey
Google turn on all bedroom lights okay
turn in seven lights on so there you
have it so Google home is actually
pretty cool to handle some of that now
it's not as advanced as Alexa in terms
of controlling stuff but it works for
here and I also like it because it works
would be Google chromecast but we'll get
to that in a second now right next to it
we have Google Wi-Fi now this is one of
three of my Google wi-fi's and basically
this is a router that helps to create a
mesh network with the three of them I
can put them in different places
throughout this apartment and have Wi-Fi
that goes pretty much everywhere now
this apartment has some really thick
walls and I've used powerful routers
that really just couldn't get a signal
to my side of the bed which is a problem
and having a mesh network honestly
changed all of that so I'm definitely a
believer I know some people haven't been
too crazy about the Google Wi-Fi
experience but mine personally has been
awesome now this is a pretty basic set
up the area has going on over here she
has her iMac pretty standard peripherals
and over here she has these JBL speed
which are actually pretty decent there
let's get a hundred bucks they sound
pretty good
they're also Bluetooth which is
definitely a win so she wants her phone
to play music she can do that so this is
a nice cool little simple setup got the
Google home I got the iMac got
everything she needs
alright here and if you guys are looking
at the furniture wondering where we got
it pretty much everything that we've
gotten here is from Ikea I'll have links
to all the furniture things that you
guys see here down below in the
description along with everything we
talked about so you guys can go check
that out if you're interested but let me
let me show you something guys Pete this
this girl has so much makeup every
drawer has a ton of makeup but I guess
it's only right since I've got a ton of
tech and and you know she's got to have
her thing too right but yeah this is all
her I've got my stuff over here this is
my surface book as well as my macbook so
whenever I want to browse the web I
could do that over there now looking
past that one thing that I have over
here is the Samsung 40 inch 4k
television and a sound bar now I don't
have a huge giant TV over here because
we've got one in the living room we
don't need another in the bedroom so
nothing too crazy over here we didn't
want to overdo it with tech in the
bedroom keep it nice and simple still
give that homey vibe without making this
place feel like a laboratory but what's
cool here is that with the Google home
and the Google chromecast I can say hey
Google turn on Voltron on Netflix and we
just like me ultra legendary defender
from necklace playing on you make a cast
and just like that without me having to
do anything lifting a finger no remote
involved I can get some Voltron playing
right onto the television
Netflix is takin too long but
nonetheless it works you guys know me I
am a huge fan of voice controls and that
is something that attracted me to the
Google home being able to tell it to
turn on certain shows being able to
control it by saying hey pause hey
Google pause hey Google skip to the next
episode stuff like that all will share
with no problems can't really do that
with the Amazon echo so that's why it
has a leg up in here and why we use it
in the bedroom
now we've also got this sound bar from
Samsung it's actually just some pretty
good sound and it was pretty inexpensive
this end the sub that it came with man
it's about 120 so if you're looking for
a good sound bar and sub combo this is
definitely something I recommend I'm
doing super impressed with it but yeah
this is what we use to you know binge
watch stuff before going into bed maybe
catch a quick movie so this is really
cool
now over here look at this come check
this out guys hopefully you'll see it
before it goes away you didn't catch it
but this is a digital frame that we have
over here so you know we just have it
going playing a little slideshow a lot
of pictures from the wedding and just us
hanging out back in the day so this is
cool to have on the bookshelf nice
little digital frame going we've got
some books over here we got a Philips to
go lamp so this thing is actually pretty
cool you can change the colors I think
it gives just a nice little flick of a
color to the bookshelf nice light and
over here we have a portable speaker
this is a Bluetooth speaker by v-moda
this is the V motor remix now this has
some really really good sound me and
Alli
we're jamming out to this and we're
cleaning last night for this video and
it was awesome so if you guys are
interested in seeing maybe a video where
I feature this let me know with a
comment down below but this is really
really awesome really unique features on
it too and down here at the bottom we've
got some fancy books a discussion now
Louis Vuitton some fashion stuff and
that smacked of Zelda strategy guide
over here because I just wanted to mark
my
sorry not really I just I don't know
let's hope I control you there you go
now this is my side of the bed notice
hide it I didn't show a side of the bed
cuz it's black so over here we have on
both sides actually we've got this cool
little aromatherapy what I even call
these well you got this cool
aromatherapy lamps
this thing has LEDs inside and as you
can see it's changing colors giving off
this nice mist we've got some peppermint
oil going in the back so it smells great
you can get all kinds of stuff like
lavender
all the spoon aromatherapy stuff but
pretty much guys this is my side this is
how you want to sleep alright so we got
to a Sleep Number and over here we've
got dis listen are you makes fun of me
for it but this is cool we've got this
little arm here this adjustable arm so
that you can have something like a
tablet or in my case a Nintendo switch
where you can before going to bed you
can have this facing you you don't have
to hold anything and you're just
watching or playing now you might be
wondering why I have a Nintendo switch
here since it's portable but I actually
like to use it with this pro controller
now you can't hold the switch screen and
the pull control at the same time so I
got something to do it for me and I
think this is awesome this was I
remember how much this cost but it
wasn't bad at all maybe like 20 bucks so
you can have this on your bed you know
somebody might make fun of you for it
but I think is cool nonetheless I like
it it's staying hopefully but down here
guys I've also got some amiibos because
uh in a while I'm playing I like to grab
my amiibos and get my bonuses from them
but behind that I have my Aki pretty
much a charging station with this I got
10 USB ports they also have two with
quick charge 2.0 so I can charge all of
my devices here at night not have to
worry about it in the morning but over
here on the side of my bed I have my
main companion this is my iPad pro this
is the pretty much the 13-inch model
this is what I watch all of my shows my
aunt
me on before bed doing what I used to
use actually before we got a TV in here
but I kind of like being able to just
watch like this when I want to lay down
I lay on my stomach folks so having this
against the headboard leads to a good
experience before bed so I like having
this here my Nintendo switch I'm going
to bed right folks tell me I'm not tell
me I'm not whatever
yeah guys right here used to be pretty
much a dead spot in terms of Wi-Fi this
is like the furthest point away from the
router that is possible and having that
Google Wi-Fi helped us out a lot so if
you're having those kinds of issues I
suggest to definitely look into a mesh
network something that has like those
three routers actually in place
everywhere definitely absolutely worth
looking into now let me show you
something else that's really cool this
little grill over here this is cookie
say what's up cook so why did you
disturb my slumber but that's about it
for this video guys hopefully you all
you coming out to play
come sit what's up to the people so I
got to go to the groomers all right come
here
we'll finish this off together so that's
about it for this video guys we'll catch
you guys in the next one hopefully you
enjoyed it I'm so sorry
hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guy girl that give this
video a thumbs up till then it's your
average consumer beef</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
