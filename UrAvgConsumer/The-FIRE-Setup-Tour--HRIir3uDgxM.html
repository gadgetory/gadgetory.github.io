average consumer and this right here
behind me is what I'm calling the fire
setup now all of this has happened on a
whim really I was supposed to be making
a video about the Asus PG 348 q but I
figured this was a pretty cool-looking
monitor with a cool little effect at the
bottom here a nice little color scheme
so I decided hey why not make a whole
theme based around it and thus we have
this setup now before we go any further
into this setup I know some of you
hardcore PC guys are gonna go oh my god
the cable management well that was not a
focus here because this is a temporary
setup just a little something I had fun
with if I didn't go nuts with cable
management so I'm not drilling holes
into this desk since this is temporary
now this monitor was actually the winner
of a Taiwan excellence award and Taiwan
excellence was cool enough to send me
one of these and make this video
possible now let's actually talk about
this set up like I said this is the PG
348 Q and this is a beast of a monitor
as you can see it's a curved ultra wide
display so it has a 21 by 9 aspect ratio
and I'm actually a fan of the really
wide displays now I'm not going to hit
you guys with the ton of specs because
we want the average consumer to
understand this right but this does have
a high resolution so we're looking at 38
40 by 1440 it's an IPS display so that
means it's going to have great viewing
angles since its curved so either way
you're looking at it quality is gonna
look good and it's even got Nvidia
g-sync so if you happen to be using a PC
with some Nvidia graphics cards you're
gonna be able to take advantage of that
especially with this wide display and
this thing can even be overclocked to
100 Hertz it might not be 144 for you
seriously hardcore gamers out there but
for any average person this thing is
going to be great and if you've got a
serious gaming PC like the one I've got
over here from main gear you're gonna
get some great performance out of this
I've been able to play Gears of War for
Forza and a ton of other games with no
problem and it actually looks stunning
but crazy specs and performance aside I
think one of my favorite things about
this monitor is the
so this actually looks like a
straight-up machine if you pull this up
here you'll like you got some kind of
turbine down here made with copper it's
just got a really cool look to it you
got these metal edges there's no real
crazy bezels this thing just looks
really good and it looks so good that it
inspired me to make this entire setup
but one thing that I really do like
about the base
besides this crazy turbine look is that
it also has this LED at the bottom that
shows the Republic of gamers logo and
you can actually control how bright this
is and I just think it adds to the look
so if you're a big fan of LEDs and RGB
lights and all that good stuff like all
I've got over here it could add a little
extra something to your setup now I've
got a knock this monitor for anything
it's the speaker's now typically that's
not a big deal because you use external
speakers with a setup but if you did
plan on using your speakers don't and
that's why I got the JBL pulse 2 over
here not only does it add to the set up
with this cool lighting effect here that
matches I can match any color with this
JBL 2 speaker but it actually gave me a
nice way clearer sound than what these
speakers could offer now as for the
peripherals for this setup we've got
here a cougar 700k this is a mechanical
keyboard with some cherry switches so
they've got that nice cookie sound and I
got to say this is actually very very
comfortable to type on and it's got the
whole color thing that we're going for
so it looks solid with this setup and it
even match so perfectly that I have to
go ahead and get the mouse - we've got
the Cougar 700m which is very
customizable has a ton of buttons here
that you can actually customize course
for gamers and this is the counterpart
to the 700k they go perfectly together
and it fits well with the theme but
under that we've got the Razer Firefly
mousepad but what's cool about this is
that it's got some LEDs so I was able to
switch up the colors here and of course
make it match the rest of the theme and
let's see right here this
is the SteelSeries Siberia 650 it has
these huge comfy ear pads so you can use
this for long gaming sessions so you've
got them included mic so you can stretch
this out do some chatting yeah yada and
it's got the LEDs so you can change up
the color so they fit with any theme as
well very nice bonus now the main beast
here powering all of this is my main
gear PC and I've actually named this guy
flood because it has the teal water
cooling on the inside but because it has
RGB lighting I can switch it up which
makes it very versatile and it can make
it work with any setup but dare I say
the most important part of this entire
setup is this guy over here this is
actually the Destiny Gundam this is a
metal build he's a custom version this
is the Destiny Gundam I love this build
and he just happened to work perfectly
with everything that I've got going on
over here so he was a shoo-in but this
is the whole setup huge shout out to the
Taiwan Excellence Award for sending this
out to me making it all possible if you
guys have never heard of them they've
got some really awesome products like
the Asus PG 348 q I'll of course have
them linked down below if you guys want
to check out other innovative products
made by companies in Taiwan that are
good enough to win the Taiwan Excellence
Award and all those products actually
want awards because they really focused
on their R&amp;amp;D design and quality so
you're gonna find some great stuff over
there now I actually had a lot of fun
making this set up going after this
whole fire metal theme was pretty fun to
see all come together so if you guys
actually enjoy content like there's me
making these cool random setups with a
different theme leave a comment down
below letting me know what kind of theme
you want to see me go after and I can
actually try to work on that but
hopefully you enjoy the guys till the
next video it's your average consumer
