consumer and today I've got an unboxing
video for you guys of the brand new
Google Nexus 9 now I've heard some
concerns about the quality of this
tablet so I'm gonna let you guys know my
first impressions and if there's any
reason for concern but hey let's not
wasting time let's get right into it and
alright guys here we have the Google
Nexus 9 if you couldn't tell by the big
9 on the box but taking a look around it
you can see that this is clearly the
year for all white boxes this is the 16
gigabyte Wi-Fi model there is going to
be an LTE version available but it isn't
out yet but really guys there's not much
to the box this is it in the back you
will get to see a picture at least and
you can have these little has these
little cutouts right here so let's get
the unboxing knife and actually tear
that off so there goes one and there
goes the other and boom now I am a
little concerned I was excited about
this tablet but after seeing some things
online I'm not so sure it's going to
live up to my expectations now I was a
huge Nexus 10 user I used it quite a bit
and it's still my main tablet like
Android tablet today so I'm hoping that
this will be okay
but let's see if we can get this thing
out we have a little piece of tape here
let's see here
okay there we go so it's out but let's
put this to the side for now and see
what else we get of course got some
booklets says Nexus on the top in blue
you've also got the nine inside of that
and this is pretty much gonna be a
warranty information set-up guide blah
blah blah nothing we really really need
here so we're gonna put this stuff to
the side as well and let's see what else
comes in the box of course you've got
your microUSB cable and your wall
adapter now this is HTC made so you will
see some HTC branding here on the wall
adapter
got some HTC branding on the wall
adapter and a regular microUSB cable
let's see how long this is and it's yeah
it's a decent length not that long so
you won't be able to plug this into like
a nightstand or you know a desk and use
your tablet this is just not that long
so wish it were a little bit longer the
Nexus 10 had a very long USB cable but
let's put all of this stuff aside now
and take a look at the tablet and
alright so here it is this is the Nexus
9 so let's peel this off okay and boom
okay so this definitely reminds me of
the Nexus 7 as far as the feel in the
back and it looks like a blown-up Nexus
5 which is not a bad thing the front
kind of reminds me of the iPad to be
honest it has the large vessels at the
top and bottom and the small bezels on
the sides and we've got a little dust
here which is pretty common for Nexus
devices for some reason but I've got
some dust there let's clean that off so
let's start off with the front if you
couldn't tell this is a 9 inch display
above that we've got a 1.6 megapixel
front-facing camera and at the top and
bottom we've got the boom sound speakers
that HTC is known for the HTC One m8 had
amazing speakers so this has some big
shoes to fill considering that this is a
tablet I definitely am expecting this to
sound amazing
so hopefully they got that right let's
take a look around oh wow so the first
thing I'm noticing right now is that the
screen now you've heard that click the
actual bezel around it wasn't completely
connected to the back of the tablet so I
just clicked it in place uh not a good
sign I'm hoping that that's not
something that happens a lot I don't
want to see the back separate from the
screen so yeah let's continue with the
tour now the back has an 8 megapixel
rear camera with flash
also you've got that Nexus branding that
you'll usually see on Nexus devices to
the right we have the power button and
the volume rocker now I heard that these
are pretty flush within the tablet it is
pretty flush gotta admit but I'm not
sure if it's gonna be a problem
I'll see what data they use if this is
actually going to be an issue but it
does seem pretty flush from the first
impressions here up top you do have your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and at the
bottom you have your micro USB port so
you can charge this thing and pretty
much that's about it the size are
supposed to have like these nice metal
bezels which actually feels pretty
decent like I said this really reminds
me of an iPad from the front but let's
get this thing started let's turn this
thing on and see what lollipop has in
store for us now this does carry the
latest version of Android Android 5.0
lollipop and it's supposed to have a ton
of great features a ton of apps have
been redesigned for the whole material
design thing that Android is going with
now so I'm very very excited about that
so while spooling up let's make a quick
comparison to the Nexus 10 as I
mentioned before the Nexus 10 has been
my main Android tablet and I love going
back to this tablet this is my go-to
tablet for everything and as you can see
what's different here is that this seems
like it'd be more comfortable in
landscape and portrait mode because of
the four by three aspect ratio whereas
with the Nexus 10 it was mainly a
landscape kind of thing for me
portrait mode just seemed a little odd
but I love this tablet though it's still
a great tablet but um yeah so it looks a
bit different it's it's a little wider
it's a little shorter but um yeah so
let's get rid of this let's actually set
this thing up and I'll take a quick look
around and give you guys my first
impressions so far as far as the build
quality goes it doesn't seem too bad but
having to click the back in did didn't
leave the best impression on me I did
also hear that you can actually press
down on the back a bit and you can feel
a slight gap between the back and actual
and I do feel it a teeny tiny bit
definitely not as bad well I feel it a
bit but I don't think it's gonna be an
issue at all feeling this you'd really
have to be looking out for it not a
problem I don't think this is gonna be a
big deal all right guys so I just
connected this to my Wi-Fi but it does
seem like I have to update it so once I
finally get past this and the setup
process then I'll give you guys my full
impressions all right so updates
installed now got the little Welcome
pop-up so we'll just click got it and
here it is and like I said this is
running Android 5.0 this is lollipop you
can see some of the changes here as far
as like the notifications can switch
your brightness move it all around yeah
so this is pretty much it there's gonna
be a lot of apps to go through I haven't
set up my accounts or anything yet
but um a lot of tons of apps and whatnot
to go through I can't wait to try it all
out but overall guys I'm liking it so
far I'm definitely gonna put it through
its paces and see if it's gonna replace
my Nexus 10 as my main like in bed
tablet so I'll let you guys know my full
impressions and hopefully you enjoyed
this video if you did be the cool guy
that gives it a thumbs up and subscribe
to the channel for more content from me
