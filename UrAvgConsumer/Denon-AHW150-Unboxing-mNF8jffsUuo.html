consumer and today I'm going to be doing
an unboxing of the new Denon exercise
free ahw 150s and my good friend hi-fi
guy sent these out to me to check out
and be sure to check his channel out
right about here and let's not waste any
time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the Denon
exercise free
ahw 115 that's a terribly long name but
this is going to be a quick unboxing I
just want to show you guys around this
product that hi-fi guy wanted me to try
out so let's get right into it let's
unbox it we had some little tape here
but this is worn out so I'm just going
to peel this off let's throw that over
here and pull this up and it's got some
pretty nice packaging already and let's
see here alright and here we are right
in front of us first of all we have a
case and let's see what's inside of here
unzip it and okay so we get some ear
buds it's got some extra ear buds
alright and since this is Wireless we
have a micro USB and there's something
else here
we have a clip this does promote
exercise so I guess you can take this
with you whenever you're dogging or
whatever so that's that and pretty much
that's it this has got some really soft
material it's actually a never felt a
case like this before it's really soft
and it's pretty compact seen considering
the size so that's pretty cool
so I'm going to put that to the side as
well and let's get to the actual earbuds
themselves also we do have I guess some
instructions that were tucked away in
the back here so we've got a couple of
those not going to go into it but just
right there and as you can see this is
the back you got this little cable here
so let's pluck these out
and get this one out as well and you got
to take this apart like this so they
really have this secured inside and boom
so that's that guy and here they are so
let me give you guys a quick close-up of
what I'm seeing alright guys so here you
have your right side and your left side
on the right you have your play and
pause button over here and you can also
have your volume controls as you can see
the play um volume up and volume down
and on the left side you have your I'm
not sure what this is I guess of
half-circle looks like a phone so I
guess you can maybe turn it on and off
through here as well as hang up calls or
something I'm not sure but I'll figure
it out but this is how it goes as you
can see here these are pretty adjustable
so that's really cool so it can get into
your ear and fit properly
um let's see that seems like it's about
it oh no way here we are here's another
little portion this is where you put in
your micro USB to charge it and here we
have your built-in mic and pretty much
that wraps it up guys and alright guys
that pretty much wraps up this unboxing
as you can see we have the actual
earbuds themselves a micro USB cable to
charge it some earbuds to you know get
your right size in there up clip and you
get this mesh carrying case and it's
going to be pretty interesting to try
these out I can't wait to give you guys
my review these are supposed to be like
a sweat proof long-lasting bluetooth
earbud made specifically for exercise so
it's going to be pretty interesting
alright guys if you enjoyed this video
please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe and thanks again it's a hi-fi
guy for sending these out to me to try
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video until then it's your average
consumer please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
