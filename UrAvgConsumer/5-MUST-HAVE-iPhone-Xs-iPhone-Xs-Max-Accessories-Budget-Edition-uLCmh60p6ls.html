consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at five must-have accessories for
the brand new iPhone 10s and 10's Macs
but this is the budget Edition now the
first thing on this list which i think
is really cool is a battery case now
Apple hasn't come out with a battery
case for the iPhone 10 it's only been
for the seven and eight I believe so now
we have one for the iPhone 10s this also
works for the iPhone 10 which it was
originally for but it works great it has
six thousand milliamp hours it has a
really low key design and I'll warn you
guys it really doesn't cover the face of
the phone that much so if you're looking
for something with a lip around it
you're not gonna get that here but it
does work really well it feels good in
the hand and what's really awesome about
this is that the way to charge it is
hallelujah was a lightning cable we've
seen ton of these battery cases that
require a micro USB and that means
you're walking around with that and a
lightning cable if you want to just
directly charge your phone it's a lot
this one works with a lightning cable it
makes life a lot easier and guess what
guys
only around 30 bucks so I actually
picked mine up for 30 bucks I think it
might be thirty to one Amazon right now
either way it's really inexpensive and I
definitely recommend this especially at
6000 milliamp hours you're gonna be able
to charge your iPhone at least twice
over with this and next on our list is a
cool dock by Albarn and if you happen to
be a huge Apple fan you're deep in the
ecosystem you got your watch you got
your air pods
you got your iPhone this is the dock for
you and what I really like about the
stand is that it has a premium feel it
feels nice and weighty so even though
you move your iPhone up try to take your
iPhone off you're not gonna be shifting
this thing around and it has that
quality while still being inexpensive
you can find this in the $30 ball park
and it's nice because you can charge
three devices at once only downfall with
that though is that you have to put your
cables inside of it so it takes a little
work to set up but overall it is
absolutely worth it if you want to just
have something on your nightstand so we
have all of your device is charging next
to you when you wake up in the morning
so usually if you have all three this is
definitely a good buy now one of the
biggest game changers on this list is
this achey USB C power delivery wall
adapter and this is one of those things
that we all wish Apple included inside
the box the iPhone 10s and 10's max are
capable of fast charging but Apple
doesn't include a fast charger inside of
the box unlike other companies
unfortunately but this one doesn't break
the bank and it gets the job done my
girl Ari who's right there
loves love's love's fast charging I do
too but she's always stealing my fast
charger so that she can get her things
charged up really quickly don't be
looking at me Harry
but seriously once you've experienced
fast charging you're always gonna want
to use it and unfortunately you will
have to get the cable directly from
Apple
they're the only ones who can provide a
USB C to lightning cable that allows for
fast charging so you can get the one
millimeter version here which is cheaper
than the 2 millimeter if you want a more
convenient way of charging there's
always the eye Adi ion Wireless mini
fast charger yes that is also a mouthful
I don't know where these companies get
these names but this is a really cool
little dock we can actually just lay
your iPhone flat down and have it
wirelessly charge and that will actually
improve the wireless charging on the new
iPhones so it's a bit easier to get it
charging whenever you just place it down
and it also charges a little bit more
efficiently now the iron Wireless
charges at 7.5 watts but for Android
phones that support it it can fast
charge at 10 watts so if you got your
notes and those kind of phones you can
use it here as well and I think I Adi
offers a bigger version that has a USB
port in the back I think that's like
their charger plus or something but if
you're looking for something with a
little bit more flexibility there's
always that option as well but the
budget Edition you know we gotta go for
the meaning keep the prices down and for
those of you who just want straight-up
cheap options to protect your phone
there are a ton of cheap but good cases
for the iPhone 10s and 10's max there's
more social stuff for the iPhone 10s
right now 10s max this is gonna take a
little bit of time I'm gonna include a
few down below in the description for
you guys to check out they have them as
low as 4 bucks guys when you've been
seeing the case that you've been seeing
right now $4 case it's got the TPU so
that it's lined to protect your phone
when it drops on its corners or anything
like that so there are good cases out
there if you don't want to spend a ton
of money and this one even has a clear
back so if you got that new gold and you
want to show it off you always have that
option but that pretty much wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it there's
to be a baller addition so you got to be
on the lookout for that and I'm also
giving away a brand-new 10s and 10's max
so if you guys want to enter into that
giveaway check the links down below in
the description and I'll catch you guys
in the next one so then it's your
average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
