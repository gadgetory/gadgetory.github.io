consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at tech you can actually afford
now we all love those big-ticket items
like TVs monitors all that good stuff
but what about some options that don't
break the bank so first up we've got a
smart phone this is the Alcatel a 30
fierce and when you're thinking about a
smart phone with some of the latest
features you know you're looking at at
least $300 plus but this guy is just 80
bucks
so huge shout-outs and metro pcs were
not only sponsoring today's video but
getting this in-house for it now you're
probably wondering what kind of specs
can you get for 80 bucks so we're
looking at a 5.5 inch 720p display it's
80 bucks guys cut us some slack but
we've also got 2 gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage which is actually really good
for this price range and you've also got
a fingerprint scanner in the back a 13
megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel
front facing camera which also has an
LED flash in the front which is very
surprising I don't think I've ever seen
another phone with this actually the
Moto e 4 has it right yeah well there's
the first one I've seen in person with
it and this all got a quad core
processor but I'll have all the specs
and all the information about this phone
listed down below in the description so
be sure to check that out now something
I love about this phone is that it's got
built-in Amazon Alexa and all you got to
do is double tap the power button turn
off game room and without even saying
the name it starts to shut down
everything of course I let my recording
light stay on but this is an awesome
feature if you've got some smart home
products like smart lamps or whatever
you can actually turn them off wherever
you are because this is connected to
your mobile data so your Alexa is always
connected you can control things in your
house without even being home and I
think that's great
now if you guys want to learn more about
the phone of course I'll have it linked
down below but my buddy Austin Evans
actually just did a video on it so you
guys can go check this out he put it
through a bunch of challenges to kind of
show off what it can do so I'll have
hidden link down below as well so
definitely check that out
I remember metro pcs has great rate
deals but on network that covers 99% of
people in the u.s. just like the big
guys so next up we've got an LG
ultrawide monitor and this
guy is just 157 bucks guys so that is
such a deal on an awesome monitor now
it's not the biggest monitor in the
world but it's pretty decent I think the
actual model number is back the LG 25
um 58 P look I'm sure I got that right
but check this out guys
this is a decent ultrawide monitor if
you're on a budget this is a very solid
option and of course gives you a ton of
real estate so you can have a few things
open you get a lot of work done with all
the different things multitasking all
that good stuff and it's just pretty
good quality now you don't get a crazy
stand this won't be able to go up or
down but you can give it a little tilt
here and there so you can move with it
like that and I just think it's a solid
option 157 bucks monitors that are ultra
lights usually cost quite a bit more so
this is a nice hop ssin if you want to
jump into the ultra wide world
without spending a pretty penny and the
colors look pretty good on this it's an
IPS panel
I think the resolution is 2560 by 1080p
but you're still getting full HD quality
here honestly I just really like this
panel considering the price and with
this thing being so cheap you can
probably get two for a nice dual monitor
setup although you probably won't need
that since this is an ultra live monitor
it should be able to give you enough
real estate but if you really wanna have
an awesome set up 300 bucks for two
ultra whites it sounds like a good deal
to me and next up we've got a gaming
headset these are the Astro eight tens
now it's kind of weird to even mention
Astro in a tech you can actually afford
video but this is their latest 810
headset and this is supposed to target
those people who want the Astro brand
but don't want to pay the insane 200
supreme dollar price tag for a gaming
headset now as you can see we've got the
green version here which is for the Xbox
but honestly this works for all the
systems
it's just color coded so if you want an
Xbox version it's green ps4 is blue the
red one is for PC but there are they all
function the same there is an Xbox
version that comes with an additional
mix amp but honestly the functionality
is saying you just pick the color you
want
now a special about these headphones
besides the $60 price tag
is the fact that these are extremely
durable so you can actually just take
them and go like this bend them up do
some really really insane things to it
and that's because it has the steel band
inside of the plastic that gives us some
flex so you can actually give these a
bit of a beating without worrying about
them clunking out on you so if you're
one of those angry gamers you don't have
to worry about throwing these around
they're gonna be okay and in terms of
comfort these are actually really
comfortable
I like the padding on the ear cushions
but I do wish the cushion on the top was
a bit wider I can actually feel the
pressure from having this little point
on top of my head but it's not extremely
uncomfortable or anything it's honestly
just fine
it sort of been more comfortable with a
lighter cushion up top now when it comes
to the actual sound quality I kind of
like these now they're not top of the
line of course but they do get the job
done this is definitely gonna be way
better than listening to the speakers on
your TV so I think they're a go in terms
of a 60 dollar gaming headset
I honestly think in terms of the price
durability and sound quality you're
getting a solid deal and that about
wraps it up guys hopefully you guys like
seeing some tech back cost a lot less
than the typical and if you want to see
more videos like this let me know some
suggestions down below on high-priced
items that you want to see cheap
versions of but I think this was a
pretty good batch don't you think
smartphone gaming headset monitor
ultrawide monitor it's a good bunch but
till next video guys hopefully enjoyed
be the cool guy girl like this video
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then is your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
