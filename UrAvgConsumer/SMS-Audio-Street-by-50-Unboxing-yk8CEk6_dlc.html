want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey guys what's going
on it's your average consumer today I'm
gonna do a quick unboxing video of the
street by 50 cents
alright let's not waste any time let's
get right into this so here we have the
street by 50 cent and let me give you a
quick tour off the box on the side of
the other picture of 50 M self here you
have some of the so I got some of the
features listed on the back like a
polished rim soft leather memory foam
cushions shatterproof ufp adjustable
head then I don't know you have P means
and rubberized coating and on the side
you have a little message by the you
know SMS audio team and pretty much
that's all there is to it some fairly
large box for some headphones but let's
see what they got inside so this is
pretty much this is a fairly large box
let's open it up and see what's inside
alright so i'm gonna rip open the
plastic here
that's inside and we have some tape on
the side saying I want to get something
all right so now that we have the tape
all off I think we can open this bad boy
out let's open this up once it opens up
like the beats headphones which it does
you open up from the side and here you
are and let's see if we can pull this
plastic off
okay well that phone's came up a bit
with it here we are okay these cups are
a lot bigger than I expected
interesting these cups are a bit bigger
let's see if um in comparison to see
some wireless beeps we have here and I
think a lot of speeds have some pretty
you know decent sized cups and this just
Trump's it by by far so that would give
you some insight on just how big these
cups are so I should prove to be pretty
interesting the bands are about pretty
much about the same width I would say
yeah pretty much about the same way this
obviously has a bit more padding than
the wireless or even the solos would
have I want to see where else we get in
the box
have a little container that these came
in and here let's we have a mushrooming
manuals the cords let's open this up
okay so you have your cords here and
this is your mic with your I guess play
button it doesn't have doesn't seem to
have a volume up or volume down control
okay so it has no volume of volume down
control it also comes with this um I
guess some kind of adapter I'm not too
sure what this would be used for yeah
I'm not sure this is used for so but I
and here you probably have some manuals
and warranty information I'm sure
owner's manual and this is okay a little
booklet to show you the different
offerings of SMS so far so pretty
standard stuff comes with a nice little
blue microfiber so this is very opposite
of beats as far as color scheme goes
pieces all black and red and it seems to
be black and blue and this is a pretty
nice pouch it's a nice pouch but I don't
feel like this would be protected by any
inside of here obviously it'll protect
it from some scratches and things like
that but as far as from Falls or
anything like that I don't think you'll
be getting much protection from those
these don't seem to be adjustable as in
you can't bend the cups in or anything
so all I can do is just you know adjust
the length it's probably why they gave
you such a big bag because it can't
close like you know like the beads do or
anything
I'll give you guys a little bit of a
close-up of the ControlTalk thing here
so here you are like I said before this
doesn't have a volume up or down control
but you can see here it has the SMS
Audio logo on here and this must be like
there play and pause button your mic is
up here
I'm guessing you still use this for your
iPhone to answer calls and things of
that nature and here you have the 3.5
millimeter jack that goes into your
device and just to give you guys a
close-up of the headphones themselves
there are they do seem like they'd be
able to pick up some fingerprints so
that's the microfiber cloth and here you
have the SMS Audio logo at the top and
pretty much that seems to be all there
is to it here you have the input for the
3.5 millimeter jack and really these are
really some pretty standard headphones
they just have some pretty large ear
cups and pretty much that seems to be it
they seem pretty durable which is
definitely a bonus this is nice
I've never ever risked doing this before
but this just easily seems like it can
handle it so that's pretty nice so as
far as durability goes this looks like
you can you know handle a little
something pretty much that's all you get
in the box guys you have your Street
headphones here your cord with the
somewhat light version of control talk
your microfiber cloth your carrying
pouch with Decimus on you over there you
get some men owner's manual there's a
little booklet with more offerings from
SMS audio this little adapter I'm not
too sure what this is for if I find out
I'll let you guys know and there you
have it guys
it's just a real quick unboxing of the
street by 50 I couldn't get my hands on
the white the sync ones but hopefully I
will soon and let you guys see what
that's like inside to you so after I use
this for a little bit I'll have a review
up for you guys of course I'm gonna have
to compare these to the beats headphones
as that's their biggest competitor I'm
sure in the kind of market that they're
and so I'm definitely going to have a
review on that soon and I'll let you
guys know alright this is your average
