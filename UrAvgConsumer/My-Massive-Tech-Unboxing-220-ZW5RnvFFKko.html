consumer and today we've got another
massive tech unboxing this is number 22
and as you guys can see we've got a ton
of packages here so you know the deal
grab your snacks grab your drinks cuz we
got a lot to open up and we got our you
shout out to arey wow do it though
alright guys so you know the deal boom
pick the first one let's go this one has
your name on it this one has your name
on it just stupid you know this one is
this you know you know this is huh oh
look at that it's an iPhone 10 case or
10s so what is it
oh but okay
got some black girl magic over here well
we'll have the maker of this case link
down below in the description okay so
airy picked her first one I am going to
pick next let's go for this guy from
FedEx hold I know this is air pod to air
pods to so we finally have them in house
guys the brand new air pods to with the
wireless charging case now for those of
you who don't know the difference
between this one and the first one well
obviously wireless charging case is one
of them not to mention the inclusion of
the h1 chip that gives you longer
talktime dangit drops my first thing you
also have the ability to say hey Siri
without tapping on the actual ear pod
there's some design changes here too so
over here used to be a more stainless
steel I think it was like stainless
steel this is like a brushed aluminum so
small detail right there and there's
also an LED indicator in the front of
the case so when you're wirelessly
charging it you can see when it's
actually charging with the you know
orange light or if it's done with the
green light and for those of you
wondering if it looks any different
looks
the same so people will definitely
recognize when you were in the air pods
all right next up go for this guy know
what this is - all right yeah so I was
recently hit with some nostalgia and you
guys can probably see what's in here
I recently picked up a gameboy color on
ebay now he's looking at me like why
well I got a teal gameboy color it's
still in the box the box looks like it's
in pretty good condition now let's see
what the actual system looks like sigh
let's use but that's ok it's it's used I
expected this isn't brand new and man
this thing is so light oh no the
slightest touch just broken the battery
case it really sucks I just got it
anyway I picked up this shield gameboy
color and a couple of games pokemon
silver the original now here's a funny
thing about old Game Boy Color games or
Game Boy games the cartridges there are
batteries inside of these that keeps the
game save alive and after years and
years the battery dies out you lose your
save file but this has a refurbished
battery inside of it so I should be able
to play this and save my game with no
problem and over here we also have
pokemon crystal so they were silver gold
crystal these two are actually the only
ones I've been missing we have like all
of the other ones right finally finish
the collection for all of the Game Boy
games so I'm really really hype about
this and we got a big box over here
let's jump into this one who's this from
Oh
Bandai not late this time we were peed
figurine ok so I don't know if you guys
saw the last massive tech unboxing where
I showed Tales of Vesperia so that is a
Tales game that I really really enjoyed
and this is one of the characters this
is the actual figure for it so y'all
know me I'm all about my figures and oh
this is like in legit packaging hold up
ok this
there's actually really really nice all
right been that I see you thanks for
sending it over and for those of you
guys who haven't played a Tales game yet
Vesperia is definitely a good place to
start and the definitive edition is like
on all the new consoles so definitely
check it out you'll go for this one this
one's on the side let's go for it okay
okay I did pick this up this is from
Philips hue so this is nothing
surprising but it's it's different it's
a different design than we've typically
seen oh but these are a lot smaller than
I expected so it's gonna be interesting
to see how I use it but I'll figure it
out
alright this is from the peel box what
we have here aluminum wireless charging
dock okay so this is it this is the
wireless charging dock from Galvin ox
it's a pretty interesting design it
looks like it definitely will protect
whatever it's on here because of this
rubber padding and it's even got like
this LED soft glow indicator so you guys
can kind of see what the status is of
the charge so that's kind of cool nope
thanks Galvin ox all right we got
something here
from Xbox always showing love let's see
what they got this time oh oh let's go
Malcolm you see this yeah Malcolm is a
huge one-piece fan so we got one piece
world seeker the Pirate King edition oh
we got a copy of the game right here
y'all do we have like this is the
obviously like the collector's edition
but I'm curious what's inside of here
all right we got the Luffy figure over
here the detail on this is nuts yeah
that is clean like that
oh okay so they sent over something else
in this box - so we got luffy's devil
fruit over here go ahead and Malcolm eat
it what's this is this a nap and we got
them at a this is crazy
so this is awesome Microsoft Xbox thank
you so much for sending this you guys
know us over here
and for those of you who love one piece
and you're interested in picking this up
it's already out they dropped March 15th
so you guys can hit the links down below
if you're interested we'll go get your
hands on it that's what we've got in
this black box over here black boxes who
sends black boxes
I'm vet you Incipio incipio so we got a
bunch of cases from incipio for the new
Galaxy S 10 sort of got lighter ones
they've got ones for more protection you
guys are interested in Scipio
I'll have them linked down below these
are actually really nice all right yeah
now it's time to go for a really big box
that we've got over here I know it's
inside of here ain't no guessing another
box in a box
are you serious there's another box
let's see well it's a boostin okay
Stella PL but the way this is packaged
is not ideal this heavier this
definitely feels different than the
generation 1 booster boy it does feel
heavier this is absolutely heavier yeah
this battery is huge and I think there's
like a fifth mode I think the first
generation had four modes this one has a
fifth mode that goes even faster it goes
up to 24 very well says who listen
listen don't bring up the Tesla here
alright guys hated me right now and you
know what hold on guys I didn't really
do a good job of letting those of you
who have never heard of booster board
know exactly what this is so this is an
electric skateboard and it uses a remote
so we've got this remote right here and
all you do is hit this trigger button
and this dial will go forward or reverse
and break I personally don't know how to
ride a regular skateboard but this guy I
feel like I'm a master at and I
absolutely love it the best way to get
around if you're not trying to use a car
all right Ari
what's next yes okay well this is yours
so listen guys at we're working on a
little video I won't say what it is just
yet but I was gonna be in it
and it involves her playing on a PC so
she did her research and found that she
wanted to use a one-handed keyboard and
that's her logic so this is what she's
gonna be using to make her life a little
bit easier to you know walk around get
around do her thing feels nice and
clicky you still get that mechanical
keyboard feel well she's gonna be using
this in an upcoming video with her
playing on a PC so keep your eyes peeled
for that one oh we got another one from
Xbox so we got the sport red and we got
a charging stand a red Charton oh this
matches it oh this goes exactly for it
oh this is nice I'm dressed for the
occasion - that's what's up and it has
the grips in the back so this feels
really comfortable this is a really nice
controller
check out the metallic accents on the
d-pad and around the design of the
controller and you sit it on top of this
guy charge it up come on that is clean
so if you like red
they got this sport red Edition and it
looks dope yo it really doesn't feel
like a massive tech unboxing unless we
get a controller in there all right
another one from the peel box so these
are cases for the iPhone so these are
all for with the 10s oh okay check this
out guys so this thing has a built-in
handle so you can throw this under and
boom so you'd never drop your iphone you
it doesn't need an extra attachment this
is cool I like this they do some quality
though and they've got this cool little
kickstand so if you're watching
something you can just prop your phone
up I think it does it click out
oh no this reminds me of the Nintendo
switch another one from the peel box so
these are accessories holders for like
different gadgets and whatnot so like
chargers I'm always down for these the
quality is on point
has got a lot of straps and compartments
listen compartments I'm a thing and
these yeah this is like some kind of
jegging material it looks like jeans but
it bad this is a really really nice
travel pouch so I am definitely going to
be using this this looks really good all
right we got another big box over here
now I can pretty easily tell what these
are based on the pictures right on the
box
you know this wasn't it oh you thought
was a tablet Rick bookshelf speakers
baby now I've never glossed heal Oh
can't so knows what they're doing
okay all right give them marketing team
erase descending the right stuff to the
right people
all right huge shot to cancel for
sending these out I can't wait to try
them out so this thing also comes with
all of the cables you need for obviously
and it even comes with a remote and this
is like a legitimate remote too so you
can control your audio and everything
right from here so we have the stands
for the speakers as well so with desktop
speakers like these you want a desktop
stand so that you can place the speaker
right on top and have it angle towards
you so that is really cool and if you
maybe have these on a stand instead of
having them on your desktop you can do
it the other way as well and have them
firing down towards you so you can kind
of pick the way you want to use it but I
am so glad that they sent all this over
hold this I purchased a little while ago
now this is basically an air duster so
if you guys have used any of those
little canisters to blow air you know
those things run out in a heartbeat you
always got to buy new ones I figured
it'd be nice to just invest in one of
these little machines that basically do
the same thing but you never have to go
out and buy another one of those little
canisters again oh this is something
that we needed in this office badly Oh
Nomad how did we miss this oh nice a
rugged case for the iPhone 10's max but
this has the moment lens attachment so I
can finally attach a moment lens to my
iPhone I've been dying for this very
very good and this is leather nothing's
there Harun leather yeah and you guys
can see how it ages over time but this
is cool I'm very glad to have this
thinking nomad know what else we got oh
they have their new titanium bands or
the Apple watch let's go
so Apple had the titanium bands for the
Apple watch one the very first one was
released cost a jillion dollars but
finally we have some options from a
reputable accessory brand so this is
really good this looks awesome oh this
is absolutely going to take out this
Milanese loop and it includes this piece
so you can take out links if you need to
and it comes with a pouch so if you want
to store it away maybe you're not using
it at the moment kind of throw it in
there boom all right thanks nomads okay
can we not ignore this beautiful box
here this is from the good good folks
over at Gundam Planet I had to get my
hands on some more gun domes but you
guys know whenever I am picking up
Gundams head on over to Gundam planet
and I'm sure you guys what I got this
time around oh got that high resolution
wing zero verka are you kidding me this
thing looks beautiful area don't give me
that face Malcolm tell me this doesn't
look good
Mountain likes it to metal build yeah
this is different right area
this is the crossbone Gundam metal build
so this is the highest of quality for
gun domes and man this thing looks dope
and airy
we got another stray this is the turn
red a stray over here but if you guys
are interested in jumping into gunplay
and Gundam and you want to know where
you can buy them you just head on over
to Gundam Planet you guys seem you go
there almost all the time in the real
day in the live videos I love it there
but yeah I'll have them link down below
in the description you get rare stuff
like this oh so good
stop looking at me like that what do we
have over here this is also from the
peel box
who's this from umm you need is e so
this is definitely a phone oh that
teardrop notch I see it already this is
a very is this a case yeah this is a
case this has to be a red phone okay
5150 milliamp hours why can't just like
regular phones have that 5000 like oh
I'll rock with thicker phone like this
okay guys so we had to actually cut real
quick because our camera was getting too
hot and I figured I'd use the air blower
and this thing has an insane amount of
power check this out
it is very powerful so you definitely
might want to put on a nozzle or
something before you turn it on expect a
lot of juice from this but yeah back to
the yummy digi this is a very very nice
looking phone I love the material here
it's like what would you say like a
satin kind of feel to it
it's also got that teardrop notch over
here you know trying to rock the latest
designs with phones these days and in
the back of the box you guys can see all
of the specs so if you're curious about
what it's powering this guy you can see
it right there okay and in the box you
also get a power cable and a power
adapter all right one more box before we
get to this gigantic box over here on
the right Oh firstly USB cables I
remember picking this up so these right
here are just some regular lightning
cables I think this is for that charging
dock that I picked up so we'll be able
to charge a bunch of devices there I got
some small cables to go with it this
right here is a mini keyboard now on
Amazon they always state that you can
email use this to type things like you
know with a computer or whatever but
they're mainly used for televisions so
if you want to type something on your TV
you can use this as like a remote you
can control what you're watching with
play and pause you can skip control the
volume it even has a little trackpad
over here so if you're using this with a
computer and you kind of have everything
you need and of course you have a
full-blown keyboard at the bottom I'm
curious let me know what you guys think
of this I'm gonna be testing it too oh
and here's another charging dock that I
picked up kind of like what I was
talking about before with these little
cables to charge things up so this right
here is a five port charging hub so you
got five USB ports over here and one of
them is quick charge 2.0 and it's got an
interesting look you know but you can
just sit this thing right on your desk
when you need to charge something you
just plug it in right here and the last
thing you've seen it all video we have a
corsair case for a new pc i'm think
about building another one you know i
want to get maybe like two under my belt
but we do want to get a new pc in the
studio so i pick this guy up it looks
like a really good
and let me show you guys what I'm
working with hey check this out guys
so this guy is from Corsair and this
looks dope and what's nice is that it
has like RGB lights in the front so if
you want to you know get your RGB on you
can and it's also got this tempered
glass on the side so of course you can
see everything going on and it looks
like a pretty simple case so that's kind
of what I was going for a simple but the
good-looking case has that little RGB if
I want to turn that on but I like this
but we'll see what we do with this case
in a future video hopefully you guys
enjoyed this massive tech unboxing we
got a lot of stuff from a ton of
different people so huge shout out to
all of the companies who sent something
over and I'll catch you guys in the next
one if you see anything here that you
want to see a future video on leave a
comment down below
but till next one guys travis consumer
