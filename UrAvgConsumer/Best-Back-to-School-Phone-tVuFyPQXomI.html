and today we're gonna be talking about
some of the best smartphones you can get
for back-to-school now first up on our
list is the next bit Robin the next bit
Robin makes a great back-to-school phone
because it has a pretty fun design it's
super lightweight and it comes in some
pretty unique colors we're talking min
midnight blue and even red for some of
you who want something a bit more bold
the next me Robin is primarily made out
of plastic which is actually not a bad
thing here because it gives it a nice
fill in the hand and it's definitely not
as slippery as some of those aluminum
and glass phones that are out there so
if you're walking in a crowded hallway
or on a busy campus no worries about
this phone falling out of your hands if
you happen to bump into someone we're
looking at a tall phone here but that's
because these stereo speakers that we've
got around this 5.2 inch display and
front-facing speakers are quite the
rarity so they're very welcomed here so
if you're taking a break from work
you'll be able to enjoy watching your
favorite shows or movies with a pretty
nice display and some pretty decent
sound quality something I like about
this phone is that it's unique design
tends to be a pretty good conversation
starter in my time out with it I've had
a few people come up and ask me what
phone it is the Robin is running a skin
version of Android but the experience is
still pretty smooth and it offers some
pretty nice features you've got a
fingerprint scanner on the power button
which is really convenient since you can
unlock the phone and get into it really
quickly but I think the biggest selling
point is the cloud storage and for those
of you who tend to kill your storage
with selfies and saving those snap
stories the next bit Robin gives you 100
gigs of free cloud storage so you have a
harder time running out of space and I
like this because unlike other phones
you don't have to spend an extra $100 or
so just so you can have more storage on
your base model and the most important
thing of all is that price we all know
what that student life is like so if you
want a solid phone without having to go
rob a bank you can get this guy for $300
for a phone like this that's a killer
deal and probably one of the best you'll
find for a smart phone today and for
those of you who can't wait to go back
to math class we've got the one plus
three
but in all seriousness the 1+3 is pretty
much a flagship level phone but only
retails for 400 bucks this is $100 more
than the next bit Robin but if you're
really into specs and customization this
is a solid choice for you we're looking
at a very nice 5.5 inch 1080p display
with an all aluminum body which a lot of
smart phones are doing these days
because it helps it to feel like a
premium device without the crazy price
tag there are a ton of color options
available just yet but if you really
want to stand out against your friends
oneplus does offer some very nice and
sleek cases so you can switch up your
style and get a little something more
your taste it's running a pretty stock
version of Android with a few bells and
whistles if you're really crazy about
customizing your phone the 1 plus 3
gives you a lot of options to do that
but if you want to take it a step
further there are quite a few online
communities that are all about robbing
and hacking this thing so you can get
the very most out of it 400 bucks some
seriously awesome specs and a ton of
customization that's pretty much what
Android is all about and last but not
least we've got the iPhone se this is
one of Apple's rare budget-friendly
devices but unlike the iPhone 5c this
one's a bit more premium since it has
the same design as the original iPhone 5
that means you've got something a bit
more compact since you've got that 4
inch display which makes it one of the
only phones today that can be completely
used with one hand a smaller design
means it's easier to travel with since
you can tuck it away in virtually any
pocket or even a backpack compartment
we're essentially looking at an iPhone
6s crammed inside the body of an iPhone
5 and I'm not gonna lie I'm a huge fan
of the iPhone 5s design and I think it's
pretty cool that you're able to get the
latest iPhone inside a much smaller body
not everyone wants a giant phone just so
they can have the latest specs I'm
looking at you ladies but that about
wraps it up for my quick list of the
best smartphones for back-to-school and
if you want to see more back-to-school
content I'll have some we're rolling out
this week till then it's your average
consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
