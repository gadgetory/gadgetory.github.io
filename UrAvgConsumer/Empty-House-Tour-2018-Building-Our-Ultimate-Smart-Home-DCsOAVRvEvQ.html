if we're gonna actually release this
video but when we mentioned its some of
you guys you all said you really wanted
to see it so here we have it you might
notice a couple things are different
than they were when we actually shot the
video you might notice some things with
the walls and whatnot anyway things are
different but before we get to the
actual tour guys I do just want to say
thank you to all of you who have been
supporting over the years none of this
would be possible without you guys
viewing and supporting the channel and
everything that we do so if you shot to
you guys and a big THANK YOU but here we
have the tour hey what's going on guys
today we've got an empty house tour all
right guys right now we are in the foyer
the entrance and that chandelier is
getting replaced I hated that thing the
second she saw it but you'll see that
upgrade in our updated smart home tour
that video is gonna be coming soon so
you got to stay tuned for that we're
gonna put a bunch of tech in this place
but before we go ahead and check it out
and put a bunch of furniture in here I
wanted to show you guys what we're
working with to your right we have our
dining room and to your left we've got
our living room this is like the formal
living room this is the place where I
guess fancy furniture goes and nobody
sits in here that's what I've been told
anyway when my living room was back in
the day we sat on them but I guess
that's not gonna happen here but this is
where we have the formal living room
lots of Windows lots of sunlight comes
in here so that's gonna be great and I
don't you remember what this room used
to look like but I know I probably hated
it but moving on this room right here
this is very similar to that one but
this is going to be our study so in here
we're gonna have some custom built-ins
books are gonna be everywhere we're
probably gonna throw a desk somewhere
maybe like in this corner or maybe that
one I don't know
Erik's gonna figure it out and we've got
some special I got some special thoughts
in terms of the tech that I want to put
in here but we'll see how it all pans
out now I know how
would absolutely kill me if I didn't
show you the only bathroom on this floor
this is the powder room and check this
thing out
here re completely designed this on her
own this was a plain plain bathroom and
these are actually gonna get switched
out because they don't really match the
vibe in here the decor we're going for a
much nicer brighter toilet and a very
very nice sink but she picked the
wallpaper
these wall sconces is that it re all
right but this is a dope dope bathroom I
killed it
and over here we have our family room so
this is the living room area that I'm
used to so this is a two-story family
room lots of space
we're gonna have a nice TV up there I
hope I don't know whatever is gonna let
me do with the tech in here so we'll see
what happens but there's a lot of space
here we've got some we got some actual
paint samples from us trying up trying
to figure out what exactly we want here
to look like we're still not completely
sure of the color yet you guys let us
know with the comment down below if you
think this color works what is the
silver chain look at that I know paints
y'all we actually have a quartzite
fireplace over here this is the same
quartzite that you're gonna see in the
kitchen area
we love this fireplace the fireplace was
actually one of the last things that we
even thought about and it turned out to
be really really nice it came together
very very well we fell in love with this
so I've never had a fireplace before
y'all look a cookie over here what's up
mama you showing you oh you showing off
the house she's like what what do you
want from me I'm trying to live my life
but over here guys we have the kitchen
and just so you guys know there's still
a ton of work that's being done in here
so nothing well a lot of things aren't
final but this is the kitchen we have
our countertops here made out of the
same quartzite that you guys saw with
the fireplace this is a really really
nice
I already did a really good job choosing
so this looks great I'm scared to eat
anything in here honestly guys listen
this whole house is all nice and pretty
I'm not gonna be in I'm just gonna hide
out in the basement where it's my choice
I'm making I'm designing the basement I
know I can live my life down there so
everything up here is just scary but
it's nice looking it's nice to look at
over here we've got our pantry there's
like a bunch of tools and doorknobs in
here because we're still putting things
together in the house but yeah this is
where we're gonna have the snackage this
is gonna be my closet right here and
over here this place wasn't really done
over this is the I guess what do what do
you call this place area the mudroom
dish
I don't know well this is another area
in the house the garage is in here on
this side so we're right in the stores
the garage we got a little closet over
here and on this side we have the
laundry room now the laundry room looks
a mess oh my god and we still have like
the old appliances in here these are
getting swapped out these are got to go
and just so you guys gonna have a peek
at what we were dealing with before we
got here look at the sink the sink says
it all so this thing is getting out of
here at some point you gotta get it has
to go but this is a laundry room it's a
complete complete mess so aside from
that we've got our dining room I am very
excited about the dining room because it
has a completely different vibe in here
it's a bit darker but this is where you
have like the more serious conversations
you're gonna have dinner here you know
this is this is gonna be a really nice
room I'm excited for it this chandelier
right here though this thing has to go
it's it's just it's just got to go we
got to get one that matches this
chandelier out there or at least looks
just as good as it and yeah I'm excited
for you
so back to the foyer now over here in
this little door right here behind this
door actually we've got the basement
that's where the man cave is happening
but we're not gonna get to that just yet
we'll show you guys upstairs and just so
you know this whole thing has to get
painted the staircase isn't completely
done yet we did get it refinished and
stained so now we've got this nice
little banister the nice staircase the
floors are all redone and the entire
house it looks really really good so
over here we have like the wrought irons
for the staircase it looks it looks just
so good so now we're up on the second
floor and you guys can see we can look
over it down on the family room so we
can see all the aunts that'll be down
there watching TV or hanging out and
we've got three bedrooms up here four
bedrooms up here right all right yeah
what am I saying we got four bedrooms up
here three regular and a master and
let's take a look at the rooms that we
have over here now I will say though
guys we did get a little bit of
furniture in so it's not a completely
empty house tour but somewhat empty so
over here we have the first room with
furniture in here let's see can we turn
on some light okay so this is the first
bedroom it's you know what are the
smaller rooms but I like the new
furniture that we got inside of here
this thing has a let's see USB ports two
USB ports so we've got built-in USB
ports as well as a light right where do
we yeah got that light at the bottom
that way you know exactly where you're
going at night even though there's like
nothing else going on over here and
we've got a light over here too right
Harry so right on the headboard you got
that nice little accent you see that
tech baby
alright so and this one's got a closet -
it's a pretty decent-sized closet
dang you still got blinds in here
alright oh but this this is actually
pretty decent sized closet I didn't know
it would end this dude it's not bad and
this is our room where we probably let
the in-laws stay right the in-law suite
it's not really a sweet though but this
is where we're going
have this a bit of a bigger room so we
can accommodate more than one person at
once of the in-laws are like the best
bet but over here oh this is a nice big
yo that goes to show you guys how much I
know this house this closet is big oh
snap
I'm sorry I'm here to get your hype over
my own closet I apologize I'm not trying
to show off or anything I'm just really
genuinely surprised I thought it was the
same size it's the other one and between
the two bedrooms we've got a little
linen closet and there's like a random
assortment of things in here we've got
some pillows some bath mats and towels
paint but we have our bathroom over here
this is the family bath this bathroom
looks great but we need some light and
the lights are really warm so it's like
super yellow in here I won't turn them
all on but yeah this is a really really
nice bathroom airy picked out this guy
right here this is the vanity that has
like a marble top tons and tons of
drawers right there at the bottom so if
you need to store anything you've got
places to do that so this looks really
great daddy picked out the tile that
goes all over here as you can tell she
has a bit of an obsession with marble
not a bit a big obsession but yeah she
picked like she took all of these micro
decisions picking out the handles and
all of that stuff and I was just like
who cares just pick something looking
cook you what you doing over there
come upstairs come on yeah come make the
trip hey what's up but if we come down
the hallway area I got to show you guys
the last bedroom before we get to the
master and this one unfortunately is not
super empty we did get a couple of
pieces of furniture so we have our bed
frame the dresser and a night table and
lamp so it's not super empty but you
know whatever
so in here oh man this is a really good
looking bathroom and I did a good job
now one thing you might notice is that
there aren't any curtains or anything
like that we're actually going to get
glass to like glass shower doors so
we're gonna add that that still hasn't
come in yet but we'll get to that at
some point they got these nice little
nooks over here so that you can you know
put like a bottle of shampoo soap over
here we even got some shelves nice
attention to detail area it did a good
job yeah you get props because you pick
everything I didn't pick anything but
yes you did great this looks like a nice
vanity with the mirror and the little
lights up there almost good Yatta Yatta
props to arey let's get to the master
bedroom
welcome to the to the master bedroom
this is where you know we really fell in
love with the house this is really what
sold this is a pretty big bedroom so I
was very excited to see that over here
we've got like a walk-in closet but it
is a complete mess listen we don't live
here yet you can't judge us we're not
dirty this is just stuff from being
collected from all of the work that's
being done here it's just bad this is
something I think I should be really
proud of so over here we've got the
master bath now this is one of the
things that's so interesting because
right here there's an actual cutout
between the master bath and the master
bedroom so you can pretty much just see
right in everybody who sees it pretty
much turns their heads and like what are
you guys doing cover it up but wait like
nah we like it it's cool unary but yeah
turn on some lights and you can see this
is just a solid job I redid really
really well and you can see
how much she loves marble we got marble
countertops
we've got marble floors we've got marble
around the tub there's just no end to
the marble and of course here also has
heated floors so that's nice so we're
gonna be able to have nice toasty feet
in the winter and here we have a
masterpiece of a shower this is gonna be
awesome so it's a his-and-her shower is
that how I say it isn't her okay
a his in her shower but here we're gonna
have the glass doors as well so yeah I
love this place this is a really really
nice bathroom I did a good job this is
going to be her side she's got all of
this counter space right here and this
is going to be my side with considerably
less counter space but listen as long as
I have the toothbrush and some
toothpaste and water I'm good to go and
over here we have a toilet this is
absolutely going to be upgraded for a
smart toilet of some sort I just got to
figure out where I can get one but now I
can take you guys to the room where I am
going to be myself the most excited the
most me the basement
what well that's where I could live
that's where I could keep my shoes on
without being judged I just wanna make
this a no-shoe house oh but over here is
where we have the chandelier you can see
it from right here I think this is gonna
be really nice when we put in the new
one all right prepare yourselves for the
best ultimate man cave well it's pretty
much just a dungeon right now because
there's nothing in there but this is
where we have the basement aka the UAC
room and all right guys here we have it
so much echo in here because it's so
empty but this is the man cave this is
where it's gonna go down this is where
we're gonna get the actual tech is gonna
be checked out down here
if lots and lots of stuff is gonna go on
over here but what I've done in here
this is where I chose things I picked
the floors so these are like waterproof
vinyl floors I like the gray color I
also went with a grey paint on the walls
what is this one called silver so
Stonington I think whatever that's the
grey that's on the walls don't even I
think it is I've got some really really
big plans for this I think I might
actually make this like my home theater
and over here guys this is where it's
gonna be a bit more man cave ish on the
other side we're gonna have like that
home theater but here's where we're
gonna have like the television we're
gonna have consoles we're gonna have
like a desk set up all that good stuff
is all gonna be happening down here I'm
gonna have like TV here you see my
router I already got the routers in here
I have to have the router since you know
we've Lizzie here so we got to have
decent Wi-Fi we're gonna go for a more
chill modern vibe down here it's not
gonna be as in-your-face and crazy
there's gonna be like just a cool
sophisticated world of tech that's what
I'm going to be going for down here and
I'm very very excited I can't wait
there's like a lot of space to play with
down here if you guys have any
suggestions let me know with a comment
down below it's gonna be crazy y'all but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed the tour
there's gonna be a lot of tech in here
at least I'm going to try to put as much
tech as I possibly can so you guys are
gonna want to see the videos that are
gonna be coming from this house and all
the tech that's implemented in all of
these different rooms but if you enjoyed
