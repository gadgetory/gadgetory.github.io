want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys the Traverse consumer now I've had
the HTC one that's for a couple of weeks
now and I decided that it's fine time to
give you guys my full review so it's not
wasting time let's get right into it
okay so here we are with the HTC One S
and for those of you who aren't too
familiar with it it's packin a 4.3 inch
Super AMOLED qHD display which is really
nice to me I personally really like the
size of the screen it gives you a lot of
real estate using the web browser is
really nice on here because you get to
see you see so much more content and the
qHD display is really nice like I said
in my unboxing of this phone some people
complain about it being a pentile screen
for your average consumer that's not an
issue whatsoever because honestly the
phone looks great in person when you're
using it I guess if you look really
close like put it really close to your
face and practically have your eyeballs
on it sure you'll see some pixels but
then again that can be said about almost
any phone or any display so are the only
people that gets their way if they're
researching and they see is they have a
pentile display or it's a 4.3 inch and
that's scary
it's really great if the size is nice
and honestly depends on this way that's
not even relevant
another thing about having a 4.3 inch
screen is being able to use the
on-screen keyboard with little to no
issues here you can see I can just type
with no problem
our size I have no issues technical
Dropbox there's enough real estate on
the on-screen keyboard to tighten with
no problems and I'm coming from a
physical keyboard so for those of you
who are afraid to jump ship and go to a
full touchscreen keyboard the waters are
safe and you should definitely have no
issues and I think you should jump for
it another nice thing about having this
keyboard is that HCC has put in swipe
light features so then you don't paddle
necessarily use your thumbs or your
fingers whatever you do you can just use
one finger to swipe and write things
like this so that's a really nice
feature swipe has been a big selling
point for a lot of phones and now that
HTC has built that into their keyboard I
think it's a really neat feature for
people who want to type who want to use
it to type really quickly it's also
packing a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor a dual-core Snapdragon
processor sorry which means it's really
fast it's really snappy you can see here
I have um as you can see here I have a
live wallpaper and even then I can go
through everything really quickly with
no issues and I can just pop up anything
I can open an app if I would like or SSC
MBA gametime see it all just happened so
quickly with no issues so it's a really
really fast phone I you you can't
complain about the speed whatsoever on
this phone and it's running Ice Cream
Sandwich with sense for it's a it's
really stable to me I've had no hiccups
like I said before everything just runs
really smoothly a lot of people don't
like the um the bloatware or what they
give a call bloatware that comes with
the phone because you get a lot of like
t-mobile apps
but that's not an issue because you can
just go to the menu and when you manage
your apps you can just go to all and you
can disable all of the t-mobile apps if
you don't want them all you really have
to do is just click click on uninstall
like hit uninstall updates and then
disable will eventually pop up there so
in case you don't like the bloatware
that t-mobile or HTC puts on their on
the phone you can go into the menu
manage it and disable it so that it
doesn't show up in your app drawer also
this phone has 16 gigabytes of internal
storage you really get like about 12 to
2 gigabytes going towards apps and
things of that nature and about 10
gigabytes of just free storage to throw
on whatever you'd like on to the phone
itself now this is a big issue for some
people because there's no expandable
memory but the thing I know about people
is that they like to put a tons of music
onto their phone and usually that's the
number one thing that they want to put
on their phone in which they need you
know a high-capacity memory card to be
inside but with Google now and Android
there are things like play music that
remedies that whole problem right there
because you no longer need the songs to
physically be on your phone in order to
listen to them here you can see I have a
bunch of music all sung to my Google
Play now if you don't know know about
Google Play I mean I'm sorry not Google
Play it's awesome to my play music so if
you don't know about that I would
suggest looking it up and getting your
library sung to it so that you can use
it with your Android phone and you can
sync automatically with your iTunes so
that every time you add a new song to it
it automatically syncs to the Google um
the servers on Google and it goes to
your your account I know they're also
worried about this not having a
removable battery but usually that comes
like that's an issue when you know your
phone is dying quickly that your phone
dies quickly and you want to throw a
spare in there or you want to reboot the
phone now the battery life on the HTC
One S has been is amazing to me I've had
no issues with the battery life I'm the
kind of person who likes to use their
bra their phone on
brightness setting and I've done very
fine with it I'm gonna show you guys a
screenshot here of the battery life I've
had having the phone on automatic
brightness so here's a screenshot of the
kind of battery life I was getting with
the HTC One S here you can see I hit 18
hours and 13 minutes and still had about
30% left if you're not home and ready to
charge your phone by then I don't know
how there's not too many phones out
there that'll make you happy with this
kind of battery life so this was with
pretty much mild blue usage um you know
just going to school using it and you
know going to work as well so it
definitely survives the day for me I've
never had an issue as far as being out
on the go and the phone you know about
to put on me so the removal battery
really isn't an issue because you get
really great battery life from this
phone and if you need to restart it for
whatever reason you can just hold the
power button as well as the top volume
rocker and when you hold it together
after a while you'll see the Menu button
starts to blink and indicate that it's
about to restart now I didn't let it
restart just now because I want to keep
using it for the video but that's all it
takes to restart it if your phone is
acting crazy or something like that also
this is a really thin phone if you guys
haven't seen it up close in person it's
so it's extremely thin it's like I said
in my unboxing it's scary how thin it is
it's so thin that when you have two USB
charger inside they're practically the
same size now this is micro USB and you
can see here that they're about almost
the same amount of width here so that's
just something that lets you guys know
you can see just how thin it is
personally I bought a case for it just
to give us some bulk and because I'm in
fear of breaking it or something this is
a d3o case that t-mobile sells I think
it's about $29.99 now that's very
expensive for a phone case considering
that there's like two dollars or
something on eBay but this seemed like
it had some really good protection on it
I
good things about d3l so I went ahead
and just purchased it and this is what I
use to protect it and give it a little
more you know weight so that it's not
too flimsy out of my like in my hand so
here we have a VGA front-facing camera
as well as a 8 megapixel rear camera
with flash now the camera is really nice
and they have some really great software
on this as well now the only thing I've
had with the camera is that I've had a
hard time auto focusing with it because
I'm not used to I'm not used to cameras
without the little shutter button at the
top on the side of the device so it
definitely takes some getting used to if
you're if you're coming from like a g2
or any phone with really with the side
shutter button but the camera works
really well so now another nice thing
about the camera is that you can take
multiple you can take like these bursts
of shots so that you can make sure you
get the right one so we just so you guys
can see what that's like
I'm gonna show you here now all those
clicks are different shots it's taking
and then when it's done you get to go
through the menu then you get to go
through these images here and really
just select the best one that's you like
just so in case you know you don't miss
a shot so I think that's some really
good really cool feature I would suggest
holding the camera with the flash on the
upper side so when it's like this the
flash illuminates like the whole screen
rather than um when you have like this
it kind of just tends to illuminate the
bottom so I would really suggest holding
it making sure that the flash is at the
top when you're taking pictures so now
another big thing about the HTC One S is
it Beats Audio integration now I've
heard reports online and articles saying
that is really just an equalizer and
it's not really
enhancing the sound but for people who
regularly listen to this it is going to
enhance the sound and it is going to
sound amazing I've used these I've used
the setting and I honestly can't turn it
off because I just it just doesn't sound
as good it sounds perfect with the Beats
Audio and using beads it works with
other headphones as well it's not just
going to be with the beats the other
headphones it also enhances about like
the sound quality so equalizer or not it
sounds amazing with it so one thing I
really do like about the Beats Audio is
that when you get it in you can select
which pair of Beats that you have here
you can see that it shows you the solos
the pros the studios the eye beads and
your beads or other now it doesn't
really have the mixers or the beats
Wireless or the tours but it is nice
that you can select some of them my
favorite is the Beats Studio the Beats
Studio and it just works really well you
can fine-tune it to the exact headphones
that you have now the thing about Beats
Audio is if you have a pair of wireless
headphones or the beats Wireless you
won't hear the enhancement so it only
works with a wired connection so that's
just something to be aware of it doesn't
really take advantage to a bluetooth now
if we're have to talk about the phone
aspect of the cell phone so it's really
just great I've had no issues as far as
you know calls dropping or anything like
that it's all been like fine and dandy
with no issues and the one thing that
surprised me is how good the speaker
come the speaker quality is on this is
actually so loud that I typically have
my in call volume at the all the way up
but because the speaker is so loud I
have to actually turn it down a bit so
that not everyone is hearing my
conversation so they did a really good
job on the speakers and the call quality
is great so as phone itself did get the
job
perfectly so basically that's it guys on
my review for the HTC One S it's an
amazing phone it's my favorite phone
today I mean I've had a happier
experience than best playing with this
phone than I've had with any other phone
previously so I really would recommend
you guys going out there picking it if
you're interested in this get it and
you'll be extremely happy about it so I
definitely think that this would be a
great purchase and I just think it's a
great phone a lot of people don't like
cents but I think they did a really good
job with cents for as it's not too
in-your-face it's really more some and
pretty much that's my review on the HTC
One S guys it's an amazing phone I would
recommend this to anyone looking for a
new phone to purchase
it's got great battery life it looks
good the screen is great and it's really
fast and it's sentence 4 isn't as
intrusive as some people might complain
that it is and it doesn't slow down the
phone in the slightest so I definitely
think that's getting this phone if
you're interested you'll definitely be
happy with it and I'm sure you'll go
home a believer in HTC will in their one
series after using it for even just a
day if you guys want to know about
anything else please feel free to
comment below I will answer all
questions if you guys want me to make
another video about the phone answering
anything in particular I'll be happy to
do that just let me know what you want
to see what you want to know and I'll
get right to that and pretty much that's
it guys there's a great phone go out and
get it if you want it alright this is
