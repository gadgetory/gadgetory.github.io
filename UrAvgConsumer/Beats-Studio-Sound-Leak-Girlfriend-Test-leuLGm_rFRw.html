to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video hey guys it's your average toons
and my girlfriend and this obviously is
your average consumer and this time I
want to leave the ship and do the sound
leak test and we're going to do this on
isolation test ok the girlfriend test
later on ok so this is what the boot the
beats studios and we're gonna first
start off at 50% you ready
Wow yeah I can clearly hear that and
this is a really active 2% yeah a few
percent that's terrible guys like even
though I'm really close to her the fact
that I could hear the lid is perfectly
fine is very very bad
these week a lot these do terrible as
far as Luke Inc is concerned alright and
I'm going to do it now at 75% second
okay
our listening to Nicki Wow you would
think this normally would be someone
else blasting their headphones ions
percent those are just it's it's bad it
was bad at 50% it's terrible terrible at
75% so hundred percent ready I don't
recommend the hundred percent guys I
gotta say this again
100 percent is very very loud I'll put
my hair ready god that's terrible
so as guys when you're wearing two speed
Studios just know you're wearing a boom
box on your head and maybe play music
for everyone not just yourself
I have no bueno okay so now on to the
girlfriend test and this time I'm gonna
hand him back the headphones because I
have to do my part
could you know girlfriends are always
doing something different so this time
I'm gonna be gossiping to him and he
doesn't really like tear gossip so let's
see if these are gonna be useful for him
and defend me against my gossip all
right so I try the side of 50%
wish me luck guys
oh my gosh you will not believe who is
pregnant I got ribs again so I don't
know what's going on whatever so it's
not so good
that's about someone being pregnant did
you hear me
Thanks well I couldn't hear at 50% so
sound isolation perfect
my girlfriend test succeeded at 50%
volume same 5% you probably black out
most things so let's just try it out
anyway let's see what she has to say
or not yeah so she's actually about four
months pregnant and I hear she's keeping
it like I don't know why she's keeping
it because she's just too young for all
that but that's her business
all right so I couldn't hear a thing all
right
naughty well muffin nothing but I had to
return those so these are perfect again
we for sound isolation and keeping your
girlfriend out of your ear
and I don't even want to do 100% after
she's done it but anyway Yolo
that's what happens Wow
I don't even know if I heard music
except this time I talked about a guy
who used the studio is that 100% that's
funny
well guys there you have it these fail
the sound weak test terribly right
terribly at 50% you can clearly hear
lyrics everything so anything upward
from that is just you know like I said
play music for everyone and it did
really well on the sound isolation
though this the noise canceling one of
these are really great they really
blocked out most of what she had to say
for 50% and everything whatsoever at 75%
up so good job isolating sound bad job
leaking it and I'm pretty much that's
all we have guys if you like this video
please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe and we'll be back for the next
sound test until next video guys ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
