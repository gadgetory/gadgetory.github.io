looks nuts so for those of you who
aren't familiar oils customs is a dude
that makes some custom plates for the
Nintendo switch as well as a ton of
other game controllers and whatnot but
he made this custom one to kind of go
with the n64 look this is the ice blue
version so right now I can't put this on
my switch but this is the backplate so I
can just switch out the plate of my
switch to this one oh there's another
one here - this is from Mario this is
like a Mario themed one exactly really
cool so yeah this looks dope okay I'm
trying to get her cleaned already but
this is the joy Kahn's now oh this looks
good yeah check it check out the colors
though so you've got a little teal
buttons up top you got the blue and
the red home button yeah oh this looks
awesome

I can't wait to switch these out but
definitely check him out all the links
down below as well as the links to
everything that you'll see here in this
video will be down below as well oh I
think this was sent to me this is from
ye so we've got a light action camera as
well as a dash camera actually featured
there - camera in a recent video was it
tech under a 100 I think yeah so I guess
we've got another one and they've got an
action camera here - okay so this thing
is tiny so it's like a little GoPro
there it is okay so this is a 4k action
camera that's 4k at 30fps it can even do
240 FPS which is cool use the micro SD
card yadda yadda okay so it's an action
cam we've seen these before so I'm gonna
actually see if I can making the use of
this and see if it's a pretty good so
start out to eat for sending these out
and I think I'll just do a giveaway of
this since I've already got my hands on
one of these so be sure to check out
Instagram if you guys want to get your
hands on one of these look out for that
post and moving on let's see we've got
this big one over here wait a minute is
this from YouTube so it is from YouTube
okay okay alright you two what the
surprise is us now this is this is her
this is from the holidays so this was
pretty much a gift from YouTube where
they surprised me with this framed
picture of myself and a bunch of your
comments so sweet thumbnail one of the
best YouTube's ever
I shouldn't be said I should be studying
for my finals but instead I'm sitting
here watching your videos now but this
is great shout-out to YouTube shot to
all of you guys for making something
like this even possible I got to find a
spot for this is it narcissistic to have
like my own face though up there
somewhere okay I'm just gonna
straight-up cheat right now so this
right here I didn't know what I was
getting this but
I can read dragon ball fighters kit you
guys know I love Dragon Ball Z so I'm
high whoo
seeing that Goku already and this is
actually from my homies over at Xbox so
you guys not I love you break the seal
oh okay
so we got an Xbox one controller oh it
even comes with a stand hello
this one is a rechargeable stand so I
can throw this on there and charge up my
controller which is awesome so this is
the I guess this is the battery pack
that you need to do that
we got a Dragonball Fighters shirt oh we
got hit so I don't know if you guys
watched the anime and Dragon Ball super
but he's one of the new characters
that's actually really strong we have a
collectible pin here so we got a
Dragonball Fighters and we got a Goku
Super Saiyan blue keychain we've got the
day one edition for Dragon Ball fighters
so we're just gonna go in my xbox
immediately cuz it's like a model kit
you know I love me some model kits all
right so uh this is cool this is very
cool
oh man Xbox you guys they listen
somebody said Chad loves model kits so
everybody's got one
okay so this pretty much tells me all
the contents of this package and it
includes a code for a year of Xbox Live
I am that somebody's enjoy it
I am super stoked to play this game I
saw this at e3 and went nuts
I'm definitely opening this upside down
oh okay
I know what this is so this right here
is a camera backpack from peak design
yeah
yeah John yes John had this ball we were
at CES you showed me how cool it was and
instantly made me go out and buy one
he makes me John makes me spend too much
money he makes me jealous all the time
so I had to get this backpack you guys
know I love backpacks and this is a way
better camera backpack than the one that
I currently use it's got a slimmer
profile looks really good so um I'm
excited but yeah
peak design backpack if you're a
photographer videographer you want to
carry a gear around in a nice looking
backpack this looks really good hmm it's
a USB seat clamp hub pro okay so here it
is so I'm not really sure how it works
but it's supposed to clamp oh okay I
guess these little knobs move forward on
the bottom of the iMac to give it a
secure fit and you get access to a USB C
port micro SD card slot SD card slot and
three USB 3 ports so this is actually
pretty cool got a short little cable to
go right to it I like this I wish it
word the color of the iMac Pro hopefully
they come out with the version I'm sure
they will but this is nice to have some
options up front
I'm telling us online sure oh I know
this is so this is oh this is some solid
packaging right here pop all those
suckers suck actually get it out okay so
this is the V this is a crowd develop
computer and this is supposed to be like
a two and one so it's got like a laptop
and a regular laptop feel to it this is
a little on the thicker side but that's
because it's supposed to be a really
beefy battery inside of here which I can
deal with for sure I'll take a little
thickness for some extra battery power
any day so you get the V you get the
stylus as well as a USBC cable and wall
adapter so you also get your keyboard
and then you can just go like this it's
magnetic
of the surface yeah yeah so it's a lot
like the surface but it's a different
take on it so if you guys are interested
in learning more maybe a full video on
this let me know what to comment down
below I want to know what your interest
is like so over here let's see what's
this so this is an interesting Mouse
I've been seeing these kind of designs
quite a bit more where the mouse is like
slanted I guess it's supposed to be for
a comfort and it's got three different
clickers here as well as a bunch of
clickers on the side oh and this thing
moves as well oh you can completely move
and for the sake of comfort I guess oh
and it can go even wider so you can have
a steeper angle I'm gonna I want to
actually mess around with this and see
if this could be way more comfortable
than these typical mice that I'm used to
using this is from our buddies over at
nomads so here we've got a wireless hub
if you got a wireless charging phone
this could be a solution okay oh this
thing's solid so you've got your
wireless charger but this is a pretty
big wireless charger but what's nice is
that right under it you've got three USB
ports as well as a USB type-c port so
this is really cool so this is a USB see
but it supposed to be a fast charge USB
C port so this is by nomads it's
actually not bad-looking so this is a
wall adapter from a company called
travel it's a two-in-one it has the plug
so that you can plug it into your car or
you can just plug it into a regular wall
outlet it's got two USB ports it doesn't
feel very high quality but I guess it
depends on the price and how much
they're charging for it but I'll let you
guys know if it's good you'll see in
another video all right so we're onto
the next box thank you for supporting us
in the past six years has it been that
long
anchor dang happy how okay this is bad
this is the second a Happy Holidays card
that I got in one of these boxes I need
to stop hoarding these boxes for these
videos I'm missing out on a crucial
timing
so we've got another dashcam and it's
got a Sony lens in it and we also have a
five-o
this is the same thing I showed last
time it's the five port USB sea power
delivery hub okay and over here
totally wireless earbuds so I don't know
anchor was even working on this is from
it's a solo though zelos I guess they're
off their side brand these actually
remind me of the Samsung gear X oh
they're a little on the thick side
though okay
the fit is decent how big do they look
big re they do but of course got a charm
out see how they sound so shout out to
anchor thank you for singing these to me
for Christmas and over the holidays so
I'm opening them a month later oh nice
this is a Nintendo switch case that I
ordered this is it guys I don't know how
to exactly say it and I don't want to
butcher it but I'm gonna go with labore
it sounds very wrong but this is a
Nintendo switch case that has a portable
charger built right into it
right this is awesome so yeah exactly so
you can actually just charge it right
here it's got the juice now this is a
bit of a bigger case it's more bulky but
if it can give some juice to my switched
that's awesome
so I'm actually going to be working on a
video about the more Nintendo switch
accessories so be on the lookout for
that what we have here okay so these are
little thumb pads for the Nintendo
switch so you know they have those
little circles instead of an actual
d-pad well with this I guess you can
just throw it on top of that and it'll
give you the feel of a normal D pad okay
and this is by ad pad you add a pad oh
nice I was actually waiting on this this
is called the valet charger now this has
a built-in iPhone
yes this has a built-in Apple watch
charger so it's a portable charger and
it has the built-in Apple watch charger
it's a sixty seven hundred milliamp hour
battery so this can charge your iPhone
and all that other good stuff at least
once this I feel like it's so necessary
because I hate bringing around the app
watch cable Kyle usually like to leave
that by my bed so this this is clutch I
love this oh okay so this is then what
is it called the no mouse by Razer so
this is their new stereo system set so
it has stereo speakers LED lights all
this good stuff oh I saw this as CES I'm
excited I'll show you guys some of the
b-roll that I got from CES just so you
guys get an idea of what it looks like
but I don't want to open it all up
because you know speakers have a bunch
of cables and wires I want to deal with
all that right now but this is cool so
they've got this and it also got a pro
version which has tweeters on top of it
as well as some other cool features and
a subwoofer and all that good stuff
these only go for a hundred bucks I
think 99 dollars is what they're coming
in that yeah they've got LEDs right here
at the bottom so wouldn't be Razer
without some RGB lights going in on it
might I want to see if I could includes
in a setup that would be really cool
what the heck okay what is this oh
alright so what this basically is so
you've got these little I'm not even
sure what you call these but you've got
these little string things here that can
go around cables so your iPhone cable
the lightning cable or any other kind of
cable that you may have your headphones
and this is supposed to basically
protect them interesting they've got all
kinds of cool colors I didn't know what
to expect that first I don't know what
this was but there's actually a really
cool concept all right so we've got
another package here that's like
particularly already open
and oh dang this thing's really beat-up
okay so we have the x-band base by
SanDisk for the iphone iphone all of
them all the iphones that these allow
you to charge your iPhone as well as
back it up it has a built-in SD card
slot so it comes with a 120 gig SD card
so you can plug this into your iPhone
and what it'll do is it'll charge it up
this will act as another storage unit
and backup all your stuff okay so this
is a backpack from Razer this is adding
their stealth backpack they sent me the
smaller version before and I was trying
to make that thing work but it was just
too small you guys come on you know me
I'll carry a lot of stuff so this is
their bigger version and I am a fan this
looks really good screams Razer but I'm
okay with that
okay so vented let's see what they've
got here okay came with a little card
and everything they wanted to send a few
of their latest portable chargers and
cables so I'm all about baby so we've
got a power cell 6010 plus okay cool
so this affordable charger has a
built-in lightning cable which is nice
alright so this feels like a very
durable cable supposed to be tangle free
so this is a lightning cable that looks
good and we've got a nightstand I guess
or a portable charger that will also
works as a stand okay so that's pretty
cool
I'm liking the look of these the quality
so far looks awesome the packaging looks
good thanks so our last product here is
also from the peel box
yes yes finally good go home max awesome
snap look at that whoa this thing is no
joke man so I'm excited to try this out
this is pretty much like the Google home
and the Google home Mini but this is the
max version which is quite a bit larger
quite a bit louder and I supposed to
have a better sound quality but
everything that you can expect from the
Google assistant you're gonna get inside
of here
so huge shout-out to Google for sending
this out
thank you you shout out to all the
companies who sends this stuff out
hopefully you guys enjoyed this unboxing
if you want to see anything in
particular that caught your eye

comment down below but thanks for
