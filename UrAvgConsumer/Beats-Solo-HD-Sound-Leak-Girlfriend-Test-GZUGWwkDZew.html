want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone it's your average consumer and
this is my girlfriend hello and today we
have another sound leak and sound
isolation to us aka the girlfriend test
and today we're gonna be doing this with
the beats by dre the solo HDS and the
new smarty blue and these are exact
headphones that are gonna be given away

rules are and enter the giveaway and
also be sure to check out my unboxing
and my review of these headphones and
yeah all right so we're today we're
gonna start her off at 100% and then
drop it down to 75 and 50% as we got a
suggestion from one of our subscribers
and we're gonna try it out today and see
how it goes
let us know what you think about it if
you don't like it fine if you do then
say that Thanks
alright so now we're gonna start at four
hundred percent right yes alright and I
also don't recommend hundred percent
guys really bad here we go
so we can clearly hear that I'm sure you
guys hear that as well that's really
loud so this would expect from 100%
so now let's drop it down to 75% and see
how bad it leaks though it wasn't really
that loud it's just that I didn't expect
it coming okay so there you go all right
so now let's try it a 75% right yes so
it's clearly leaking quite a bit at 75%
all right so yes 9% it's a pretty good
leakage there and once was surprising
more surprising than I would have
expected um all right so let's try it
out at 50% see how much the leaks there
- all right ready yep
all right so yeah I had 50% it's not bad
at all you actually have to really
really listen in to hear it so 30%
definitely okay but when you get to work
like the 75% and higher you'll
definitely be linking some sound there
alright so you guys are ready for the
girlfriend says yeah I'm ready alright
so I see what she has in store for us
today guys so today with the girlfriend
test I'm going to be video chatting my
sister I'm gonna often do and he's gonna
see if these solo HDS can black out all
of my brilliant banter so let's just
take one moment while I call my sister
up guess what we're doing we're doing
the girlfriend test alright guys so
we're gonna start this one off at 100%
and see if I can cut out the chitchat so
I just called you to show you my newest
purchase look what I bought it's a
Smashbox lip gloss a lipstick and
there's only $38 let me show you how it
looks on my lady yes alright so I don't
understand definitely no sounds came in
at all couldn't hit anything
so definitely what you would expect for
me to percent let's try it on a 75% see
if it does the same yeah so this color
it says be legendary lipstick it's in
honey and it was made in Canada let me
share how looks on my lips I took off
for my lipstick just for you it's so
pretty I love it so much
alright so 75% couldn't hear anything as
well so that's not only a good job there
so let's see 50% see how it goes thanks
I really like it because it's a nice
nude see yeah I like it kind of blends
in but then it also just looks really
clean and like brownish but has a little
bit of paint going on in here so I
really really really like it it's really
cute
alright so 50% um I could hear it I hear
like mumbles can't really make out what
did you think she said so definitely a
good job on the girlfriend test
definitely passed the flying colors
Merrick the sound leak test not so much
as any 5% it was a good amount of
leakage 20% of course you definitely
heard that
50% was pretty good so if you're in the
lower area if you listen comfortably at
the lower volume should definitely be
fine so I think that's it for the sound
leaking some isolation test wait do you
want to tell them um who when they give
away ok so right yeah alright so let's
see I can get this name up here
alright guys carry drum roll please
so the Pete the person who won the
giveaway was psych I'm sorry guys it's
too soon to tell you guys a good way
just yeah just make sure you keep
watching the videos and you'll find out
very soon who the giveaway winner is and
if I got you guys worked up I'm sorry
