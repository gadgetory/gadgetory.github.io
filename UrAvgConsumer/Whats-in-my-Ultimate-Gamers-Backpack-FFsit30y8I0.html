and today we've got another backpack
this is one of our themed backpack
setups and we had said that would be
doing a gamer version and here we have
it you couldn't tell by the logo that's
trapped up here
but let's get into it let's see what
we've got now this is not the most
practical backpack setup but it is the
ultimate gamers backpack so it's a bit
over the top that's how we do things
so let's actually take a look at the
backpack right this is the razer
tactical pro backpack now this guy is a
pretty insane backpack if you couldn't
tell we've got a bunch of compartments
up front which are actually modular
these can come off with these velcro
straps and we've even got these big
pockets on the sides so we've got
throwing things like chargers and all
that good stuff but I really like this
backpack you guys are gonna see why in a
second it's definitely gamer oriented
now for this video we're gonna do things
a little bit differently we're actually
going to start with the main compartment
and you can actually access that right
under this little hood here so we zip
this over and boom now you guys can see
I've got a little headset over here but
we're gonna get to that in a second so
over here in the very front you guys can
see it I'll throw some b-roll in here so
you guys can clearly see we've got a
compartment that houses some of our
portable gaming options so we've got two
over here but this is the ultimate
gaming backpack so not only do we have
two
but we've got three and over here we
have three portable consoles inside of
some of the best cases that I've been
able to find online so we're gonna start
off with this guy probably the least
popular but one of my favorites of all
time the PlayStation Vita so I've got
the PlayStation Vita right here this is
the white version this is the first
generation model with the OLED screen
and everything I don't like the 2000
version the 1000 is where it's at in
white and just taking a look at this
case this case I actually really like it
because it gives you a lot of options in
terms of carrying different games and
whatnot and even a little pouch here
that allows you to put a USB cable so
you can charge it if you still rock your
Vita this is definitely a very nice
option you can carry a ton of games most
of mine are digital so they're not all
up in here but yeah this is what I've
been playing and for those of you who
are curious what kind of games I play I
play a lot of RPGs so you're gonna see a
ton of those I'll throw a bunch of
b-roll in here so you guys can see some
of the games that I own physically and
digitally those are what I like to play
so that's what we have for the
PlayStation Vita Sony I don't know why
you gave up on the Vita just so good PSP
in the Vita man I feel for you guys but
next case this you guys you guys know
what this is since that was the Vita
this is the 3ds XL so this one right
here this is the Pokemon Sun and Moon
version that's got soul gali oh and
loon Allah boom see so see how much I
played that one uh-huh
but this hasn't been charged in a while
but last I played on this was a monster
hunter stories Monster Hunter stories
was actually pretty decent I was
actually liking it but uh that Nintendo
switch got my attention but back to the
case guys this case is actually really
solid just like the Vita case it's
pretty good it has a lot of space a lot
of compartments you guys can see all the
Nintendo 3ds games that I have and a few
regular DS titles in here as well and
there's even a spot for like you know
tables in one minute this is a must-have
this is a USB cable to charge the 3ds a
regular USB cable is way more useful
than carrying around that charger that
they give you we have to plug it into a
wall portable chargers baby this works
with them or even in your computer so
this is a must-have if you play your 3ds
a lot and if you guys are curious about
the games that I play more b-roll magic
so you guys can see which games I have
RPGs all day though but this guy right
here this is the Nintendo switch this is
a travel case that I really really do
enjoy it's got a lot of protection a lot
of space for carrying extra stuff which
you boom so over here the very first
thing you'll see I got a slot to carry
some stuff I actually have some extra
joy Khan's in case I want to switch it
up or maybe want to play with somebody
got some extra joy Khan's this one is
actually the Nintendo classic look that
I got from kala where if you guys are
all about that throwback you know that
this looks really good so I got some
extra joy Khan's here but you can throw
them in cables or whatever you want
right inside of this pouch as well but
when you move that boom baby
that's my Nintendo splits right here and
as you can see color where it got to
this to so it's got that teal and white
with the whole black look going so you
know that's the UAC color theme if
you've never heard of color where you
got to check the link in the description
they do a ton of customization for
gaming stuff so controllers Nintendo
switch ps4s all kinds of goodies you're
gonna want to check them out and if you
haven't joined the switch party just yet
don't worry color wear and I gotcha
all you have to do is make sure you
subscribe to the channel and head on
over to Instagram to see the post where
I'm giving one of these away the winners
gonna be picked in two weeks and the
winner also gets to customize this bully
with all of the colors that they choose
and boom that's all you have to do so
good luck see you guys on the giveaway
just don't bite my colors I'm just
kidding goodbye my colors but uh good
luck so over here in this pocket we've
got a couple of things so first up we've
got this whore east and now this stand
is a way better option than the
kickstand that comes built-in to the
switch now what I like about the stand
is that it has a few different notches
for different viewing angles so you can
play at whatever angle you feel most
comfortable but what's also really nice
about this is that it has a little
cutout so that if you want to charge
your switch you can still plug in no
problem
while you're playing that's one of the
major design flaws with the kickstand
you can't charge and play like that at
the same time and this thing is pretty
inexpensive but it's a nice little boost
and how you play with your switch now
while that's cool I think this accessory
is even cooler so over here we have HDMI
cable and power cable for the switch and
you know it's next you got the dock but
not just a regular dock here we have a
portable one now if you know this which
you know it comes with a much bigger
dock with four back like this it's a
little bit on the bulky side so we got
something that's a lot smaller and this
is actually by JM top I found them on
Amazon but everything you need from the
dock is built right into this so you've
got two USB ports actually three USB
ports a USB type-c port for power and an
HDMI slot now this makes it much easier
to carry around just throw it into a
little pocket and pretty much got your
whole TV set up ready to go with the
switch and it only goes for about thirty
something bucks which is way less than
$80 that you have to pay for a regular
Nintendo switch docks and let's move on
from the switch for a bit and check out
one of the major components of this
backpack and that's our gaming laptop
and over here I have the Razer Blade 14
this is a beast of a laptop and it's a
very good-looking
with a low profile with some insane
specs so for those of you who don't know
this thing has a 14 inch display with a
4k touchscreen which is just
mind-boggling and I'm telling you guys
it looks so good
now it also has a GTX 1060 inside of
here madness if you guys can see how
thin this guy is the fact that there's a
1016 here is nuts and for all of my spec
heads out there these are the specs for
the Razer Blade 14 yeah this is a gaming
laptop of choice I've been able to play
all my Steam games my games from origin
like titanfall to The Witcher 3 all that
kind of stuff with no issues here have
you even been able to play them at 4k
and with this screen it just looks
glorious you got a nice crazy screen RGB
keyboard it all just is very nice only
thing is those fans get kind of crazy
sometimes playing in 4k they kind of
scream you can even go bigger with
something like you raise your blade Pro
which is a 17-inch model or even a
bigger laptop in general like my Acer
predator Helios 300 you can throw that
inside of here with no issues so with
this tactical pro backpack you can fit
pretty much any gaming laptop but for
hours right here for this setup we have
two razor blade 14 and since we've got
some great games even great games with a
great screen you're gonna need some
really good audio to match and for that
we've got this guy right here now with
this backpack you can see it's got this
little mold that can pull out that can
throw your gaming headset on and what we
have right here is the HyperX cloud
alpha now the HyperX cloud line has been
a very very solid line only goes for
about a hundred bucks
this one goes for about a hundred bucks
as well and each earcup has dual
chambers to give it some really dynamic
sound
there's no 7.1 surround sound so if
you're looking for that that's not an
option here but this still sounds really
good and the comfort is insane these are
extremely comfortable these air cushions
the marshmallows baby so these are
really comfortable and actually over
here where you rest the headset
even has a zipper so you can have access
to all of your tables that go with your
headset so you put them inside of here
and you got yourself a nice little
gaming headset set up inside of your
backpack inside of here we had the mic
that goes into the hyper clouds and I'll
do a quick little test for you guys so
you guys can see what it sounds like to
do that right about now
and here's a quick little sample of what
the audio quality sounds like from the
mic on the HyperX cloud Alba's and boom
there you guys go that's what these
sound like and you've got some pretty
standard cables you've got your three
foot cable that works well with any of
these portable systems and even the
laptop and if you need a little bit more
length you have this extender as well
and it comes with a mic input as well as
an audio input if you want to play with
your laptop but for 99 bucks I think
this is a solid buy it looks great and
it's extremely comfortable and it's not
a bad price now here's the thing you're
not gonna always want to use a gaming
headset this size whenever you're
playing your games especially if you're
out in public with these portables
you're gonna want something a bit more
low-key and that's why I have this guy
over here this is my one of my favorite
pair of earbuds these right here are the
shore se215 now what's special about
these is that they've got a little bit
more base than the regular e two 15s so
that's gonna be nice when you're playing
your games I find used to be extremely
comfortable definitely one of my go-to
you don't want to pull out your big
gaming headset this is a very solid
option so you can play on the go now
have actually got some more stuff in the
main compartment here and of course if
we're gaming you know we need
controllers so right here I have the
Nintendo switch pro controller also
customized by color where to match with
my Nintendo switch and you got to have
it if you're gonna use the dock you have
this thing set up in a hotel or wherever
and you want to have more standard
controls than the Joye cons in each hand
boom you got that right there
and sounds we're rocking a gaming laptop
right here it only makes sense to have
an Xbox one controller
now I'm not gonna lie this is my main
way of playing whenever I'm playing my
PC games I gotta have the Xbox
controller I haven't mastered the
keyboard yet I'm not
lie so having this handy definitely
helps to make the experience quite a bit
better so I got the Xbox controller I
also have the wireless adapter so that I
can use this wirelessly with no cables
still with the PC and it's smooth
experience now lastly in terms of
controllers we've got a PlayStation 4
controller they're probably going what
where's the ps4 well you can actually
play the PlayStation 4 on your gaming
laptop with remote play and if you guys
have never seen or done that I'll have
the link down below in the description
so you guys can see the video that I did
where I showed how to set that up but if
I want to play the ps4 that I have at
home on my laptop I can use it with the
PlayStation 4 controller here so uh like
I said ultimate gaming we're hitting all
systems baby all in one backpack it's
over the top and that's what this is all
about you guys asked for it I'm
delivering now this is the bulk of what
makes up the gaming experience but we've
got to have those accessories things
that kind of tie it all in together and
I'm talking about portable chargers baby
you gotta have a portable charger to
keep your stuff all charged up and ready
to go and this is a portable charger by
Omni charge this is the Omni 20 and of
course it can charge up the switch in 10
to 3ds Vita no problem but it can also
charge up the razorblade 14 so it's got
a built-in outlet right here so I can
use the charger from the 14 plug it
inside of here and let it juice up with
no problem
it'll drain the battery pretty quickly
but if you've got to get your game in
you're almost done with your battery and
you're outside somewhere this thing will
definitely make sure you survive until
you need to get the job done and even if
you don't want to use the USB ports to
charge any of these portable systems you
can also use the outlet here to give
them a quicker charge but all that is
possible with this guy this is in the
same portable charger but it's expensive
and of course I have some cables to make
sure all of this stuff has charged up
and good to go and
you have this outlet so this has two USB
ports and a quick chart 3.0 port I like
this because I can charge the Vita the
3dsxl and the Nintendo switch all at
once if I wanted right from this brick I
haven't got the charger for the
razorblade 14 is that it
are we done hoho we are not done we've
got more to go baby
so over here we've got the mouse duh you
got to have a mouse to go with it so
this is the Logitech G 403 this is
actually also customized by kala we're
but this has a gloss finish which I
really really do like but yeah this is
the mouse that goes with this guy and
also got this little portable mousepad
which has actually has a sticky bottom
sticky bottom ah
but this has a sticky bottom here so
that whatever surface you're playing on
you can kind of just throw this on and
you don't have to worry about your
mousepad moving around you probably
aren't supposed to continue using the
plastic that goes with it
well that's time to have this can get
dirty in my back huh so I'm reusing this
thing at the time and oh and I'm just
joking that's it guys we are done that's
about it this is a lot of stuff this is
definitely the ultimate gaming backpack
all thanks to this tactical pro backpack
it carried all of the no problem even
though this thing gets really jam-packed
it doesn't feel heavy it's actually
really comfortable so I like this guy it
does good but hopefully you guys enjoy
be sure to enter that giveaway of the
switch I'll catch you guys in the next
one if you enjoyed this you gotta give
me a thumbs up man
god this thing is crazy but still nice
one guys
