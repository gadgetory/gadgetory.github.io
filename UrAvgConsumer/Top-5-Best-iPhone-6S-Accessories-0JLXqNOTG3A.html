talk about some tech you can use to make
the most out of it and if you don't have
an iPhone you'll want to stick around
till the end of this video so let me ask
you something when was the last time you
have fun watching your phone charge I'll
tell you when never
that is until you've seen this this is
power adds twin one USB cable that also
lights up when you charge it and you'll
never be bored again when you've got the
power of light running through your
cable but all jokes aside this is a
pretty cool cable that's undeniably fun
to watch even though all it's doing is
charging your iPhone and an added bonus
is that it's also a microUSB cable
remove the Lightning adapter and you'll
be able to charge any micro USB device
with of course that lighting effect and
you also don't have to worry about the
adapter getting lost since it's attached
directly to the cable and the cable is
pretty solid and well built so you don't
have to worry about this happening and
next up we've got the Rhino shield crash
guard bumper while this may seem like
your typical bumper for your iPhone it's
actually very durable
now rhino shell wanted to team up and
sponsor today's video so they can show
off exactly what the crash guard can do
I don't normally do drop tests because
just like you don't like my stuff broken
but rhino shield is so confident in
their materials and their protective
honeycomb structure that they sent me an
iPhone 6s to test it out on now instead
of the typical drop test you see on
YouTube I decided I'd hit you guys with
some real-world situations you ever
forget your phone on your lap while
exiting a car I'm ashamed to say it but
I have a couple of times but honestly it
wasn't a big deal with this bumper on
and it came out with no damage now I
know this has happened to some of you
you're jamming out with some headphones
and you move away from your phone and
the thing goes flying the bumper kept it
together here too even with a higher
ledge so now you've got your stuff
packed up ready to leave somewhere and
whoops there goes your phone this thing
smacked the table and proceeded to have
an ugly fall and due to the concrete got
a few light scratches on the bumper but
the phone came out perfectly fine at
this point I'm sold at a real-world
situation won't cause damage to your
phone with
crashguard on but I wanted to test Rimel
shields claim to absorb damage up to
eleven and a half feet and as hard as it
was for me I sent it over this 11 foot
ledge this thing hit the ground directly
on a corner and bounced around and even
hit a wall the bumper got a few
scratches or the phone was completely
fine and I think it's safe to say for a
bumper that's pretty legit I definitely
never expected a bumper to protect the
phone from these kind of Falls but these
have been tested to withstand up to 11
and a half feet falls even those corner
hits the bumpers aren't your style
though they also have the play proof
case that I've been personally rocking
on my success plus it's got the same
thin yet tough design that puts me way
more at ease than the typical Apple pace
they've also got some gear for a ton of
other phones so be sure to hit the links
in the description if you want to check
them out as well as the other products
mentioned in this video like playing
games on your phone while check out the
SteelSeries Nimbus controller when it
comes to gaming on your phone you're
probably not thinking oh let me go grab
my controller but there are some games
on iOS where it makes sense and it's
actually a lot of fun the controller
itself feels very similar to an Xbox one
controller which is a good thing you've
got all the standard controls except for
a clickable joystick buttons and it's
even got pressure-sensitive triggers for
games that take advantage of it it's a
very comfortable feel and when using it
to play games it's surprisingly smooth
and accurate if you're afraid you won't
know which games support the use of a
controller have no fear since the Nimbus
app provides a list of all the games
that are compatible he uses a lightning
cable to charge and offers over 40 hours
battery life and not only can you play
with this on your iPhone but it
functions with all Apple devices like an
iPad iPod Macs and even the Apple TV
honestly this just might make it into my
gadget backpack and you might have
noticed me using this guy to play some
of the games within mingus and this is
the Manfrotto pixie smart while this may
not be I phone specific it's an awesome
stand that iPhone users can take
advantage of in quite a few ways we're
looking at a mount for your phone that
can be attached to this mini tripod in
both landscape or portrait mode of
course this is great for taking time
photos a time-lapse or even if you want
to set the phone down and record a video
it's super adjustable so by pressing the
little button on the front you can move
it around and get all kinds of angles
out of it this thing also comes in handy
when you're out and you want to use it
to prop up your phone and watch some
videos or play some games like you saw
me do and if you want to be a bit more
discreet you can get rid of the tripod
legs and still prop up your phone in
landscape or portrait mode and this last
one here I had to add since I'm such an
audio guy and this is the Sennheiser
clip mic digital this may seem a bit
unconventional but with all the
questions I get about starting YouTube
without tons of crazy gear I often
recommend using your smart phone the
start and if you've got a bit of extra
cash you can pick this guy up for some
pretty sick audio this thing is great
for voiceovers recording interviews or
anything that's dialogue related
honestly this thing has saved me a
couple of times and the good thing about
the clip mic is being able to get solid
audio without having to carry around a
ton of gear and heck you could even use
it to periscope if you're into that but
that about wraps it up for my list of
the best iPhone accessories now if you
don't have an iPhone and this list
doesn't apply to you why not insurance
on my iPhone and LG g4 giveaway so it
can but if you're interested in a chance
to win a brand new phone hit the links
down below in the description so see my
video and find out how to enter but
that's it for this video guys hopefully
you enjoyed and if you did be the cool
guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up until the next one is your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
