today we're doing another favorite tech
of the month and this is a series where
I go over the things that I personally
use on an everyday basis things that you
might not see on the channel but you
know I'm using at home so first thing
we're going to take a look at of course
has to be a portable charger I know you
guys have heard tons and tons about
portable chargers but I actually have a
favorite and that is the Aki 3000
milliamp hour portable charger now this
is an awesome awesome portable charger
because look at the size it's not super
huge not super bulky and it has 30,000
milliamp hours that's a lot and it even
features quick charge 2.0 so if you have
a phone like B Samsung Galaxy s8 you can
charge that sucker really quickly it's
got other cool features like a little
flashlight in case you'll never use that
but it has that anyway so you can do
that if you want to but they actually
have a couple of different
configurations depending on what kind of
phone or mobile device you plan to use
so what I've got in my hand right here
is the version with a USB type-c
connector so I can actually connect a
phone like the Galaxy s8 and use it with
no problem but if you happen to be an
iPhone user you can actually have a
lightning connector so if you have your
lightning cable that's all you want to
carry you can charge a portable charger
with that and your phone so one cable to
carry around with this one cable to
carry on with this and trust me
I have and I've tried a ton a ton of
different portable chargers and those
are my absolute favorite by far over
here we've got something that isn't
exactly what you think of when you hear
tech obviously it's not something you
have a screen there's something that
almost everybody has in their home but
this one in particular is really good
this is a Belkin surge protector now
what's really awesome about this is that
one it has all these different outlets
so you can plug in a ton of different
things so you've got 12 here but what's
also really cool is that it has a couple
of new features first thing being that
it has this swivel so one problem that I
come across a lot is that when you're
plugging in a ton of different things
you get all kinds of different plugs and
outlets look at look at this over here
we have a funky array of different wall
adapters now this is a mess but with
something like this you can easily throw
on something on the side something on
top this way they're not impacting each
other something like this which picks up
a lot of space
can be thrown down here and not become
an issue for the tool over here so this
is super super useful and get this not
only do you have something like that but
when you pop this guy open over here
you've got some cable management so if
you've got a couple of different things
plugged in you want it all to come down
straight to the bottom you put that over
here and you got nice clean cables going
all in one single direction and of
course this will often be a lot better
service protection than something you'll
find in some dollar store I use this in
my studio all over the place I'm
actually getting my hands on quite a few
more because I have to put them in other
places but this is definitely the best
surge protector I've ever used if you're
a techie you should have it too now next
up we've got this guy this is the Astro
850 now I know there are a ton of people
who hate on the Astros honestly you can
find someone on the internet who hates
every gaming headset out there but this
is something that I personally really
love to use now I did do a doper nope
about this where I gave it a note
because there are other gaming headsets
that are less expensive but can still
offer a decent quality instead of these
but if you have and you're willing to
spend the money on these I don't think
you'll be disappointed by the experience
this has been very awesome to use but
what I really do like about it besides
some pretty great sound quality is the
fact that it has this charging base now
with this charging base all you have to
do is wrapping ap fees on there and the
thing starts charging and it actually
sings up to the system that you're using
it with if you have multiple systems and
you want to use it with both you can buy
the charging station separately for the
system you want to add on so something
like the Xbox one I have over here but
if I want to play by my PlayStation 4
all I got to do is drop it over here in
a couple of seconds it'll sync up to my
PlayStation 4 and I can just use it so
that is really awesome no crazy
connections to deal with I don't have to
unplug anything
that's really cool I had some people say
the mic isn't as good as some other mics
that are on other gaming headsets but I
don't party chat with people much anyway
so the experience that I have is always
really good with these definitely good
if you have the money and you're willing
to spend it on this I don't think
anybody who lick their hands on this
will be disappointed with their
experience now you guys got a little
idea some of the tech that I personally
use on a daily basis but something that
you guys don't really see are some of my
apps now one thing I got to show you
guys and this one's interesting
I get asked about this all the time any
video that I show my phone in you guys
asked for this wallpaper so this right
here is the minimum Pro wallpaper now
this is probably the best wallpaper that
I've ever used it's a live wallpaper but
it's the best one that I've ever used on
an Android device
so with this wallpaper you can actually
go into a theme manager and get access
to a ton a ton of different wallpapers
and the thing about this is that you can
go in and create your own as well they
also have an online library where people
go in and save their creation so you
have access to those so there's like an
endless supply of cool wallpapers that
you can go ahead and try out but let's
say you like a certain wallpaper but the
colors aren't really what you're into
you can always go in and customize that
one wallpaper as you guys can see over
here I went and changed this x2 with the
black and red to the one that has field
so you can go in and change certain
colors do what you want to take away
certain things add certain things it's a
paid app I think there is a free version
as well I think maybe this one cost
about a dollar maybe two dollars but
it's well worth it you won't ever need
to look into another wallpaper again
trust me this is definitely the best one
on Android and that was a pretty strong
endorsement so I'll just clear the air
there are no sponsors on this video so
next up we've got the last app now this
is something I've been playing since I
was in college this is called Phoenix HD
this is actually Phoenix HD - this is a
game it's one of those space shooters I
might have mentioned it in another video
but this is one of those space shooters
if you like those kind of games
you've got to get your hands on this
like I said guys I've been playing since
college years is that now I don't know
is well I'm like well over five years of
playing this game it is absolutely
amazing honestly whenever I'm sitting
around I'm bored I pop out this game not
so much lately since I switched over to
the Galaxy s8 but back when I was on iOS
this was the game for me to play all the
time re yeah any right oh my gosh so
annoying annoying always play any still
thinking constantly I do I still got my
iPhone and play this game just to play
it so this is definitely a very fun game
even if your wife or girlfriend calls it
annoying because it sucks you in it's
well worth it
but that's about it for this video guys
just want to let you guys know some of
the cool things that might not really
make it into a video like the Belkin
surge protector which every techie could
really use but it's just not like you
know something with the screen but it's
awesome so hopefully you guys enjoyed a
total next one it's your average
