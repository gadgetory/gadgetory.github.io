consumer and it's been a while since we
talking about Nintendo's switch
accessories so of course with the switch
being one of my favorite systems ever we
got to talk about five must-have
accessories for the switch now first one
being this attachable portable charger
for the switch by an tank now this is
absolutely awesome because I don't know
about you guys but I travel with my
switch everywhere so it is nice to be
able to be on a plane and have some
extra juice without having a cable
dangling to an external portable charger
I just attached this guy right to the
switch and it's actually really easy to
attach it and all you do is you take
your switch you lock it in boom and it's
attached so if you're playing games that
are like really intensive this thing
will more than double your switches
battery life it has 6500 milliamp hours
of battery the switch has like 4300 so
you got a lot more juice here and it's
nice because you also have these little
latches over here so you can change the
position of how you have this when it's
on something like a table you can always
move it the way you want and this is
really cool because let's say you're
tired of playing with the extra weight
you don't want to hold it like this
anymore you can always throw this down
detach enjoy cons and then you're
playing like this so for me this thing
is an absolute must especially if you
have a lot of long commutes and this
really isn't that expensive I believe
it's around 37 bucks actually none of
the accessories that we're talking about
are expensive so you don't have to worry
about your wallet getting killed these
are some pretty awesome things that you
can get for a nice price but there's
some other cool stuff let's say you
don't really like the feel of this you
don't like using the Joye cons or
anything like that you can actually get
something that changes up the feel of
this which entirely so right here we've
got a case from satisfied this is like
their deluxe case with a bunch of
accessories but the highlight here is
this grip so this is the satisfy Pro
gaming grip you can actually throw this
right onto the switch and it changes the
ergonomics of the entire device so
satisficing we don't have the optimal
rif angle when playing on the switch
it's not the most ergonomic so they have
added on this extra piece over here
that we can play with ours at 35 degrees
they say that we're over extending our
thumbs when we're reaching for these
buttons over here Michael I've never
really had much of a complaint in terms
of the button layouts on these but with
this I will say having these extra grips
really does add a bit of comfort to the
switch that I never experienced before
and I also think it's kind of cool how
this thing just stands on its own with
these little feet over here so you can
just always stand it maybe if you're
playing with a pro controller you want
to put this down for a second I don't
know but it is kind of cool that it
stands maybe if you're watching
something there's like YouTube on this
right there you go now you can buy the
grips separately but if you go for the
deluxe case you get this big travel
pouch this is a hardshell case and
inside of it you get some really cool
things that I think are a must-have so
first off being these extra thumb grips
I absolutely have to have thumb grips on
my switch it honestly changes the way I
enjoy this system I don't like the way
that it has like a dome shape to it
that's not super cool to me I like the
whole concave feeling of these thumb
grips so that more than anything if
you've never played with these kinds of
thumb grips I highly highly recommend it
you also get slots to hold all of your
switch games and even comes with a few
cables which are actually pretty high
qualities but this is a nice package I
definitely think you get your money's
worth and being able to play your switch
comfortably even though it is a bit on
the different side I like but now let me
blow your minds a little bit right
position is cool and all but this is
something that the switch should have
had from the beginning here is this
little adapter from home spot that gives
you access to bluetooth guys so this
little adapter you can just plug right
into it with this little add-on you get
the ability to use bluetooth headphones
with your switch so with this on you
could throw on some Bluetooth headphones
like these use them finally listen to
music on your switch without needing to
use a cable that's one of the things I
hated with the most especially when
taking planes I hated the fact that I
needed to have
cable dangling and plugged into this guy
because I'd have to use a different pair
of headphones that aren't my bluetooth
headphones or remember the cable from my
booth has headphones just so that I can
listen to them and not bother the people
sitting next to me this is a dope
because you can use any Bluetooth
headphones you want even air pods for
all you folks out there using air pods I
can't say broke boys anymore because
people don't get the internet joke but
it's fine for those of you who have air
pods you can use them here ah this is
just it's just nice guys it's nice to be
able to use bluetooth headphones with
this and you might notice that there are
two buttons here one for player one
obviously and you can even add a second
player so that you both can share the
audio from the switch with two different
Bluetooth headphones so I think that's
really cool if you're maybe on the plane
like I said you're sharing your switch
one person has one joke on you've got
the other and you're able to both hear
what's going on in the game now I have
another version of these bluetooths
adapted this one is from gold kit or GUI
kit this is from home spot I like this
one a lot because it's so slush within
the system it doesn't take up a lot of
space but this one is cool because it
does something that this one doesn't
this guy also has a USB C port at the
bottom so when you're playing with your
switch you're using it to listen to
music or whatever you can also charge it
at the same time this one essentially
blocks your charging port this one makes
sure that it's still there and this
thing also comes with a few other
accessories if you don't like it
dangling from the bottom here you can
just pop this off throw this little
attachment on if I don't drop it and
then you can throw this thing on into
the back so you still have access to
that Bluetooth but now it's hidden a lot
better but what you give up with this
guy
is the fact that you can't use it with a
second player but the choice is yours
guys but I think both of these options
are really solid and something else that
I use a lot everyday really and it's
always in my gadget backpack are these
cases from I've said it on this channel
before this is a real
heartening to say Lib aware whatever but
this is the protective case that I use
for my switch personally all the time
but this is pretty much what you'd
expect
it's a hardshell case but it does have a
special feature you guys can see down
here this has an LED indicator for the
portable charger that's built right into
it so whenever I'm using my switch or
whenever I'm done using my switch I'll
put it in this guy strap it up make sure
it doesn't go anywhere and then I'll
pull out this little USB cable and then
with this I can charge my device pretty
seamlessly once I plug it in now
this is the first case that I got and
when I went back on Amazon to see if
there's another one it looks like they
updated it this one is a bit bigger but
it also has a bigger battery this one
right here has about 8,000 milliamp
hours and this one has 10,000 milliamp
hours so this is gonna give you a ton of
juice for your switch you absolutely
can't go wrong with it and this one also
has an interesting feature and that it
allows you to prop up your switch just
like this so let me show you guys what
that looks like
now this is not a feature that I
honestly would use that much but it's
there if you want and then you can turn
on the switch and kind of just play with
your joy cons I mean it's cool
unnecessary really but you can't be mad
at extra features right but yeah the
choice is yours
if you want to go with a bigger battery
this newer one is pretty cool with
10,000 milliamp hours but I personally
like the older one a bit because it's
smaller it doesn't take up as much space
in my gadget backpack which I appreciate
since I got to put a bunch of other
stuff in there now the last thing I will
say guys that you gotta have if you're
one of the folks who plays Super Smash
Brothers you gotta have one of these
guys these Nintendo GameCube controllers
right here this will change your life I
think that this can get its own separate
section in this video because there are
so many Smash Bros players it is
absolutely worth it if I want to give
Malcolm some smoke and kick his butt
no Malcolm how many wins do you have let
me show you guys huh I didn't mean to do
this to you in public man on YouTube I
don't mean to do this but I got to show
them how good the controller is oh I
gotta special and wasted it all right
but you got out of there though but you
got out of there though oh oh let's go
oh you see that he's that finally that's
because I always always trash up in this
game all right mom I'll give you this
one but guys that is absolutely the way
to play when you're playing Super Smash
Bros you guys saw it got intense but
that also wraps it up I think this is an
awesome list of accessories if you're
missing any one of them you're not using
your switch to the full potential I'll
have them all linked down below in the
description I am ready to give Malcolm
round two so I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till next time is your average consumer
