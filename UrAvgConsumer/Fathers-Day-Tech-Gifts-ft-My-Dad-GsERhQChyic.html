consumer and this guy this is my pops
throws up pops what's up you do so today
he's going to be helping me check out
some cool products over at the Google
store and Google was actually cool
enough to ship out a couple of their new
stuff so that this guy can have Father's
Day so lucky you yes I don't get
anything but it's all good good you're
not a pop yet not yet all right so it's
not wasting you time let's get right
into it
so first thing we've got is the onhub
router by tp-link so this is a new
router now you've been using the one
that the cable provider has sent in yeah
I think kind of sucks
yeah so now we're going to be using
you're gonna be using this guy mm-hmm
so not what's cool about this is that
the on hub actually makes it really easy
for you to go and manage your router
settings now this makes a lot easier
because there's an app involved you can
just go on your phone and kind of check
out what's going on so let's open this
guy up you see the kind of stuff I'm
wielding on I see we move this hand boom
so now one thing I love about this is
that it's not one of those ugly routers
with a bunch of antennas
there's a little go weird this is a nice
sleek design you can kind of just put it
on your desk and not look bad so this is
actually really cool and you're able to
go into the app you can kind of see
which devices are on your network and
you can even prioritize which devices
can get the most bandwidth you can
actually make sure that your computer
gets all the internet that you need
everybody off gets you know the red but
yours is number one priority so you can
watch some YouTube videos from me
uninterrupted yes that's so right here
you're gonna like this one this is the
Huawei watch now this is a SmartWatch
you see this guy this analog watch all
out with the old in with the new man yes
that's nice right now this is a
SmartWatch this has Android wear so you
can sync this up with your phone and
you'll get all kinds of notifications
you'll be able to interact with it
without actually having to pull out your
phone to do anything but this thing
asleep man is and I like this little bit
band to the out here it's all yours try
it on and not look good yeah okay look
good now one thing that's cool about
these watches is that no matter what
your outfit is you can change the watch
face so it could match up your style so
let's say you're wearing blue that day
continue to blue wearing red changes red
whatever you want you to switch up the
style no matter what this is a gift that
will be good for any dad the chromecast
now you've got one of these yeah I have
one in the living you do now I don't
have one into bed there you go you can
actually go from watching in the living
room from your phone and when you're
done you want to go lay down you can
pause it from your phone take it to the
bedroom and continue
without a hiccup now this is like a
great great Father's Day gift if you're
on a budget
these aren't expensive at all so if
you're looking for something that's well
under 50 bucks it's very solid choice
especially if you're you know father
doesn't have a smart TV this is a really
great option and just being even if they
do have a smart TV it's pretty cool to
be able to control it all from your
smartphone yeah now this guy this is
pretty interesting this is what they
call Google cardboard now I'm sure
you've heard about virtual reality
that's being talked about a lot more
these days so it did that you're trying
to get your dad to step his foot into
the reality reality realm this is a nice
inexpensive way to do it you can go on
the Google store and pick this up this
turns into a virtual reality headset for
your smartphone you pop it open like
this you see that setup complete now all
you need to do is throw a smartphone so
you go like this and it has some
instructions to we're going to put this
over to the side for just a bit and take
a look at something else Before we jump
into this guy we got something that
might help you out of here the next 6p
so this wha this is the latest Nexus
device by Google this is the
top-of-the-line Android device with a
pure Android software running on it so
you know how your phones usually have
like a ton of apps yeah you don't know
what they do there's just a ton of one
you got to swipe through well this gives
you a clean experience so that you can
just get straight to the stuff that you
need and check this out you even got a
fingerprint scanner so when you want to
unlock your phone all you got to just
pick it up don't your finger right on
the back it'll unlock it for you uh-huh
there you go
thorry Singh Rana I'm seeing the Vatican
mask that is they see when they cook nah
