and you know what time it is we got a
bunch of packages over here it is time
for another massive tech unboxing what
number is this one nineteen oh alright
nineteen point Oh guys but you know the
deal grab your snacks your drinks some
eggnog
let's relax and open up some tech all
right J I want you to pick something man
this big guy right here
oh man Jase wasting no time today so
this guy right here is from MSI I don't
know what it is I have no idea I haven't
been in communication with them lately
so let's see what we got alright let's
see here what is this oh phone holder Oh
check this out guys so I don't know if
you're familiar with MSI but their logo
is actually one with a dragon I love
dragons so that's cool oh that's kind of
cool so so the chubby little guy so this
is their phone holder let me see if I
can find my phone and try this thing out
alright so here we go uh-huh that's cool
because it looks like the Dragons just
like holding it up clever clever and I
think we've got two of them
so one fairy oh ho ho
now that's what I'm talking about a
backpack y'all it's a nice little
Christmas gift for me let's open this
thing up and get rid of this guy okay
it's on the bigger side but that just
means like a whole more tech so let's
see we got a little pouch up top oh this
is nice look at this material on the
inside guys all right a little
camouflaged look and it has like a label
thing this is where you put with foam I
love a backpack with some labels tell
you exactly where to put your stuff okay
so you got like bottle holders on the
sides so this thing is a headphone
holder over here you have a hotspot for
your cable
your mouse your tablet your computer
nice nice I love this material on the
inside MSI thank you that's a great
little gift for me right here
weeks all right all right next up next
up what's this guy
oh-ho some stuff from our friends over
at Nomad we got a few things here too
okay so first off we've got a rugged
case now this is actually I guess
they're partnering with moment lens
moment lens make some awesome lens for
smartphones so if you want to switch up
your camera you can and it's kind of
cool to see them partnering with nomads
I would love to see more cases that
support these lenses now it would have
been awesome if this was for the 10s max
that's what I've been using but I'm sure
I can find a nice home for this one okay
we got a pod Pro for iPhone and Apple
watch so this is an Apple watch charger
with a built-in portable charger inside
and it can charge your iPhone and this
is nice and what's this a box maybe a
cable on the inside this is a microUSB
interesting okay so we've got a microUSB
cable and I guess this is how you charge
this guy up Oh
Nomad should have made it like just BC
come on all right so you can actually
put in the Apple watch cable you can
roll it around here and then drop it off
in the center I kind of like that it has
these cutouts so you can pretty much
place down the cable anywhere which
really helps and let's see you also got
a built-in lightning cable so you have
access to that so pretty much what this
is guys is a portable Apple watch
charger that can also charge your iPhone
I think that's pretty cool all right so
right here we've got the Nomad base
station for the Apple watch business
this can't charge air Potts can it no
the air pods case isn't out yet that has
wireless charging built into it so here
it is we got some cables in here
well and this is it guys
this is really nice actually so it got
my nice leather pad right here so you
can place multiple devices here at the
same time and you can also put down your
Apple watch so if you got your iPhone or
something else you can charge two things
and your Apple watch this is dope I like
a quality this is really really nice
instantly gonna be on the desk for me
and it's what's really nice is that you
don't need to have like an Apple watch
cable or anything you just have the one
table or a plug that it comes with plug
that in and then this charging all those
devices
that's clutch usually you got to put in
the Apple watch cable like you guys saw
with that guy so this is really really
cool I like this a lot so thank you
nomads I'm very happy to get my hands on
that and thank you in advance all the
other companies who sent something in
let's get the sky next Unitec oh I
ordered this so this is actually a
charging station so it has a ton of USB
ports over here and you even have some
quick charge ports and a USB type-c port
so if you have multiple devices that you
carry around with you when you get to
wherever you're going you can put them
all down to charge all in one spot and
it even comes with the dividers so I can
just go dropping them in and it's got a
lot of spots so you can pretty much fit
any device that you need in here and
boom nice I'll let you guys know how
good this is but I'm very very excited
this is something I personally wanted
and I'm glad I picked up all right this
is from the peel box never know what's
coming in the PIO box
views the sidewinder macbook charger one
oh oh ho ho oh oh ho ho so you with this
guy you're supposed to be able to put in
your macbook charger and then kind of
use this contraption here to get the
cable all coiled up around this part so
it should make it really easy to
Kawai your cable this is just a lot
bigger than I would have thought this
will take up a lot of real estate in my
backpack all right so what have we got
this guy from FedEx hahaha infinity loop
I know who stays over there so right
here I think we have the first ever
clear iPhone case and this is for the
iPhone 10 R now it makes sense for Apple
to come out with a clear eye phone 10
our case because there are so many
colors to choose from and you want to
show that off instead of just hiding it
is this a silicone case or is it like a
hard shell ok no this is like a hard
plastic that's super hard definitely
some flex here so you can move it around
but it's also very tough so first ever
Apple clear case the key smart Oh Ari
told me about this so guys this right
here is the key smart and this is pretty
much a new way to carry your keys so
instead of having your keys on those
little rings you can have it on this you
kind of pull it out like a Swiss Army
knife I think that's really cool and it
has built-in tile functionality so it's
how you'll be able to locate it using
the app on your phone so if you ever
misplace your keys or you forget them
somewhere you'll know exactly the last
location you had them and I think this
is really cool
and Michael USB charging because oh so
thankfully you could just recharge this
ok here it is
nice ok and there's got a bottle opener
- why not this is actually really really
cool this is one of those things that's
like a game changer it could be a game
changer if it functions well something
else from the peel box
Oh interesting you guys ever heard of
those juice cards chargers these
actually can be used to locate your car
using the app that it has that's usually
useful if you're in a parking lot and
you forget where you park you can just
kind of pull up in the app and find
where your car is exactly oh they'll
just cut the box dang the tough piece of
tape I'm cutting up the box hold on and
do surgery maybe I'm not supposed to
open it that way ok
so you are meant to pull off the sticker
so with that I can just grab the bottom
here here it is the Zeus charger let's
write this out make my car look fancy
let me look at this guy looking lonely
over there
oh man holidays are coming up time for
not a lot of nice gifts to be given boom
$25 apple gift card code boom right
there somebody just got it
Oh BAM another one for Android $25 you
did I was going just like that guys
thanks for watching I love you all
Oh shape light from philips hue this is
different I bought these light strips
from philips hue and I was under the
assumption that these were the regular
light strips that I always buy to put on
my desks and stuff like that but this is
for outdoor so it's different that's a
thick boy right there
ok so this is something completely
different than I expected
I didn't even know that they made this
yo J this could be cool for beer old man
this could be cool so with this guy
you're gonna be able to plug it in and
of course use all kinds of lights and
colors with it it makes a light this is
meant to be outdoor so I guess if you
want to line your deck or patio or porch
whatever it may be if you want to add
some special lights to it or this power
brick though oh I'm actually excited
this is gonna be cool and it does come
with some tools for installation so if
you guys want to line your home with it
or something go nuts another one for the
peel box our 17 pro oh oh this is from a
PO I had no idea this was coming radiant
mist is the color the r17 Pro I don't
think I've even heard of this one shame
on me
Oh has a tear drop much oh the color
though check that oh it's got that
purple and blue does this shift no
purple stays on one side blue stays on
the other side so check this out guys
this is kind of trippy but look at that
guys this has the same teardrop notch
that we saw with the 1 plus 60 good
but hold on let me see what's inside of
them oh it comes with a case kudos to
all the manufacturers phone
manufacturers that include cases inside
of the retail packaging earbuds that
look like air pods with USB type-c and a
charging cable and for those folks out
there who probably want to know what are
the specs of this device I'll throw it
up with some b-roll right now so you
guys can see what's actually powering
this thing since I don't know off the
top of my head but I'm really excited to
try this out three cameras my first new
camera phone cool alright let's go for
this guy oh I've seen this go around re
got one of these - this is from the
lovely folks over at Microsoft ah card
let's see thank you at windows hashtag
windows ugly sweater should eyes wish I
had change J should I do this alright
alright a blue sweater time ok so your
boy is back in an ugly sweater a Windows
ugly sweater shout out to the old
windows logo ah alright let's do the
rest of the video in this sweater keep
the holiday spirits going yeah let's
keep the holiday spirit going $50 Amazon
gift card boom just like that somebody
got that happy holidays
alright let's see what we've got oh my
girl knows it a sweater I'll take it you
should have saw what they gave me last
time it is like a flamingo it's crazy
I'll throw up a picture so you guys can
see ok that box was for home moving on I
think we got this one probe for Xbox one
pro gamer grips so these Wow I think
this is the one time I don't have an
Xbox one controller and I got an Xbox
one controller accessory so let me grab
one of the very few that I have do I
just
throw it in here like this am i doing
this wrong
oh no wait am I now I think I got it
this is more comfortable okay it's cool
enough right here a big boy right here
so this is the SD 7000 from Kensington
and basically what this thing is it's
the dock for the surface pro and it
pretty much makes it feel like a surface
studio now the surface studio has an
amazing design so I am not mad at this
concept okay so real quick let's talk
about the i/o you get a headphone jack a
USB type-c port as well as four USB 3.0
ports Ethernet jack you also get a
display plus plus port HDMI and this is
for power so this uses the mic I forget
what this port is called but it's like I
think it's the surface connect port so
right here you use this a little pour
this is you also where you charge a
surface pro so all you do you take this
and then you dock it in like that and
boom okay so this is like a surface
studio now which I love the design so
let's see how smooth this is oh that's
nice
oh this is this is really cool if you
are a surface user this might be what
you want oh this is nice and you get
access to all of these ports which is
nice because the surface pro could use a
bit more now I just unbox the surface to
do to so I'm a fan of this whole look
and maybe I'll put this near the desk
setup that I have going on over there
all right now this guy right here this
is from B&amp;amp;H I know what this is and
don't judge me all right just don't
judge me we have got two boxes inside
the Halton pot yeah I know I know you're
like why a home pot they sounds really
good you you you gotta admit that these
sounds really good and I'm not gonna use
them for like any crazy smart features
but I got some plans for them in my
basement hmm that I think I really want
to use these for just wait and see
just trust me trust good old Jed all
right - home pods they were on sale I
didn't pay full price because I really
could not pull the trigger but B&amp;amp;H
actually had a sale where each of them
was $100 off so I saved 200 bucks and I
was able to finally pull the trigger so
I got two of these guys you're gonna see
why I bought them in a future video and
last but not least I know you've been
eyeing this giant red box over here this
is from our buddies over at main gear
and if you can't see it got a gaming
chair inside of here so and this is
their one our Aspen and white I've heard

gonna do folks I am going to take this
