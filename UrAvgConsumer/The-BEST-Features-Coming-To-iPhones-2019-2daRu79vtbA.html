consumer and today I was at WWDC and
we're gonna be talking about the best
features coming to iPhones thanks to iOS
13 and first thing we've got is dark
mode now this is a feature tons and tons
of people were really excited about I'm
not super crazy about dark mode but I'm
not gonna lie after seeing it today on
iOS 13 it actually looks pretty good so
I might be giving it a solid try once I
get my hands on iOS 13 but I know a lot
of you guys gonna be happy for this one
and you can't deny the benefit of not
having that blue light hitting your eyes
on a daily basis and next is being able
to swipe the type on the native keyboard
and that's things that Apple's new quick
pass feature I'm gonna type of person
who always uses Google keyboard on their
iPhone because I just love to swipe to
type it's so much faster for me not a
good texture when it comes to normal
typing and having this directly on the
native app it's going to be a
game-changer for me and based on what I
saw with some demos
it looks pretty fast and accurate so I
am excited for this one and next up is
Apple Maps and yes I know that sounds a
bit strange on the best features list
but Apple has actually redone the app
from the ground up the app looks a lot
more polished now and there's this new
feature that they're calling look around
which is pretty much like Street View on
Google Maps and I really like how they
implemented this feature when you're
looking at the map as a single button
you press in the top right corner and it
has the area pop-up right on the top of
the screen and I kind of like the fact
that it doesn't completely knock you off
the map when you open it but once you
actually go and delve into the actual
window you can move across streets very
smoothly and you'll even have labels
marking streets and even stores so you
can jump in and see more information
about them it's gonna be really
interesting to check out can't wait to
see what Apple do with this one now
another big thing that Apple's including
with iOS 13 is increased privacy now
we've all seen apps that allow you to
log in with either Facebook or Google
now the only thing with that is that
when you log into those apps they might
get access to your information from
those two but soon we'll be able to sign
in with Apple that creates this
alternate fake email address that they
can't pull any information from and this
is going to be really great in a world
where Facebook is killing our privacy
and with you being able to sign in with
Apple you can just log on to places now
with base ID instead of having to go
putting your password on these apps
apples legit making a lot of good moves
in terms of privacy so I'm happy to see
them doing this year jumping on this one
hi jumping in here from emojis because I
just love them so there were also some
updates to BMO G's so now with your
emojis you can customize them and add
different piercings placement of teeths
to give like a missing one or gold tooth
you can add that too you can change your
lipstick shades there's a ton more you
can do with MIMO G's which is super
exciting to me but what's really
exciting is the emoji stickers so now
even if you don't even have an iPhone 10
and one of those newer devices you can
still make em emoji in sticker form so
if you have an iPhone 6 or newer
as long as you have an A 9 you can make
these little me emojis makes it looks
just like you and you can use them like
emojis so my favorite moji is the kissy
face emoji but now in the fall I'll be
able to do the kissy face emoji with my
face in cartoon form so that's really
cool and I'm so excited to how that's
actually gonna be executed
supposedly you'll be able to use it of
course an iMessage but other third-party
apps as well fingers crossed it comes to
Instagram and Twitter and now I'm back
because we got to talk about some audio
Apple introduced a new feature we're
gonna be able to share what you're
listening to with someone using ear pods
now Apple handles sharing really well
whatever that's airdrop we're sharing
passwords to Wi-Fi so this is going to
be a cool feature now the idea here is
being able to listen to something and
then just share it with someone nearby
using the air pods so you're no longer
having to take one of them out of your
ear pass it on to someone next to you we
do that way too often on the plane and
now you're going to be able to do that
between air pod users whether it's air
pod one or to empower beats pro users
and it's gonna be interesting to see
whether or not this feature comes to
other devices with an h1 or w1 chip but
so far those are the three devices that
it works with and I'm pumped for now so
long the subject of audio we actually
saw some improvements to home pod now
home pod is gonna be able to distinguish
voices so if you happen to like a
particular kind of music home pod is
going to provide a personalized
experience so if someone else comes
around and asked for some music to play
like area would ask she wouldn't be
hearing my music she get personalized
music for her now the way that ties into
iOS 13 is if you're listening to
something on your iOS device you'll be
able to hand it right
to the home pot so maybe you just got
back home from commuting you'll be able
to continue listening to your music
right from the home pot at home and vice
versa now something else that I'm super
pumped about is being able to have more
options when it comes to editing videos
and photos in iOS 13 now for photos
you're gonna have access to quite a few
more options so if you want to get
really granular with your edits you're
gonna be able to do that hopefully
without a third-party app now what's
different for video is being able to
actually rotate the video or even add
different filters to it there's a few
different changes that we're going to be
seeing to video editing and it is a
welcome change because the video editing
before was a little bit lackluster now
there were a few other features that
Apple announced that they didn't really
spend too much time on but I think we're
really cool like one being able to
identify spam calls and send them
directly to voicemail face ID is also
going to be 30% faster now which to be
is a big deal app downloads are also
gonna be 50% smaller so if you happen to
run out of space a lot and you trying to
get some new apps that's gonna be a good
one
and also apps are gonna open two times
faster
so overall guys we got a lot of nice
improvements coming to iOS 13 and I'm
pretty excited to get my hands on it
think I might do the beta but we can't
stop there
iPad actually has some really cool
announcements now it's been really clear
for a while now that Apple is trying to
push the iPad to become a laptop
replacement and it looks like they're
getting close to that with these new
updates and now they're no longer
calling the software on iPads iOS and is
now iPad OS and one of the biggest
changes I thought that I would never see
on an iPad is being able to pin widgets
right to the home screen apples also
decrease the size of icons so you can
have more on there at once and with
those new widgets it kind of gives you
that desktop feel
apples also made really big changes to
multitasking now we've been able to
slide apps onto others for a while now
but with this new update you'll be able
to have multiple apps at your disposal
and you can even use an app expose to
see all the ones that you have open at
once and now you'll also be able to have
multiple of the same app open at once
side by side which is great because if
you happen to use the Notes app like
myself and you like to be able to go
back and forth between two different
notes this is going to be extremely
helpful and
a lot of planning and script writing in
notes and with the new gesture that
they've introduced is going to make that
process a lot easier
and those features are copy paste cut
and undo and if you need to copy all you
need to do is a three finger gesture
where you just grab the stuff that you
have highlighted you can grab it again
to cut and swipe what is it very kind of
throw it down to paste it it's an
interesting move but you can do that and
you can also swipe with three fingers to
the left to undo and those are really
cool but there are a bunch more other
gestures coming as well so that is gonna
be interesting to look out for and
something that they also improve is
being able to move around the cursor now
it's a lot more fluid and it's easier to
highlight in select text and there are a
few more features coming to the iPad
that are really gonna help you feel like
a laptop experience one of which being
able to use Safari to access desktop
websites you'll also finally have access
to a download manager which is gonna
work great with a new file app that they
have which is a lot more robust than the
past and even the inclusion of being
able to use a thumb drive and connect it
to the iPad to transfer files and not to
stray too far from the original point of
this video but Mac OS is also getting
some cool updates that work with the
iPad that allows it to work as a
secondary screen and they're calling
this sidecar
now with this feature you'll be able to
use something like your macbook pro and
your iPad as a secondary display and
I've seen this thing work in person guys
and it is pretty insane there's really
low latency so pretty much everything
that you do on your iPad it'll be
reflected on the screen of your MacBook
and it's just an awesome experience to
be able to have now multiple screens
even if you aren't home and that pretty
much wraps it up for this video guys and
yes the elephant in the room is of
course the Mac Pro that they announced
trust me that thing looks amazing I got
to see it in person and I cannot wait to
get my hands on it it's crazy crazy
expensive but it's gonna be really
awesome for our workflow but that about
wraps up this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
bro that gives it a thumbs up I'm gonna
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
