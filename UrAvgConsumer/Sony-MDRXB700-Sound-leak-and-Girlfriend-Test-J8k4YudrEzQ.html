want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
Travis consumer and this is my
girlfriend hey everyone and today we're
going to be doing another sound leak and
sound isolation test aka the girlfriend
test and we're going to be using the
sony MDR XB 700 so we're gonna start off
with the silently test and we're going
to try it from 50% volume to 75 and then
100% and thanks to all you guys who gave
us feedback in our last girlfriend test
video letting us know that you prefer it
to be from 50 to 100% we really
appreciate your feedback definitely do
all right so it's not wasting time let's
get right into it we're gonna start off
at 50%
you ready it's a huge it brings us later
alright so sorry 50% right
definitely not bad at all 50% I couldn't
barely hear anything slightly hear that
she's listening to music but nothing at
all really
so definitely not bad so now let's try
it at 75% right yes I can I can pretty
much hear that so it does become a a 75%
not the worst but it definitely does
weak a bit maybe 500 percent yes I'm
ready now I don't recommend this gun to
say it all the time but I'm just
thinking here hurt your hearing so we
need to be very cautious and don't worry
I'll be fine just a couple of seconds
yeah all right and so be funny you can
clearly hear that bit of a leap from 75%
clearly hear that so 100% you know the
sound leaking sort of sound leaking was
pretty mad did leak a good bit at 75%
you got clearly or 90% now let's jump
into the girlfriend test
great so I will take these and you want
to explain me yes so in the girlfriend
test I usually do things that he tries
to see the newest headphones can a
blackout so today I'm going to be
listening to my music on my computer as
I normally do and he's gonna seek these
Sony headphones can block out those
sounds and of course we're going to be
doing this from 50% 75% and then 100% as
well so are you ready yes he's back on
baby coos I'm not doing the job so 50%
was not enough at all I clearly heard
that so we're gonna try it at 75% see if
we get better results ready yes Justin
Bieber on Justin
say so a 35% wasn't that bad really
doing anything and we'll for sake of
consistency we're going to try it out
and super Senate and see how that is so
okay guys 100% the you know these
definitely passed so if you want use
these for the girlfriend
test definitely a good job there nine
fifty percent so you guys got to go a
bit higher if you want to stop things
like that and um yeah definitely not bad
the sound leaking could have been better
the girlfriend tennis was alright at the
higher intervals where it's like 75
percent enough so got decent great off
