consumer and it's time that we looked at
some more awesome tech under 100 bucks
and first up we've got the Logitech MX
master 2's now if you guys know me you
know I'm a huge fan of Logitech Mouse's
and this one's no different the 2s has a
very similar design to the original MX
master but adds a few welcome features
and the biggest of them is called
logitech flow and just like with the MX
master the 2's is able to pair and
switch between three different devices
and when you've got your devices paired
up you can enable flow and with that you
can actually move your mouse between all
different computer screens as you have
paired to it all in one flow now I've
never seen a mouse do this before so
this is really impressive and even more
impressive is the fact that you can
actually copy and paste text images or
even some videos between the different
devices whether that's either Mac OS or
Windows you can actually use it
seamlessly between both operating
systems so if you happen to use both
operating systems maybe one for work one
for home
that's a nice Mouse to have pair up to
both and the twist also has fast
charging Logitech says you'll be able to
get a full day's usage with just three
minutes of charging and a full charge
will get you 70 days of usage but I've
got to address one thing and that's the
color option you get some pretty
standard colors with black and gray but
Logitech decided to spice things up and
include a special midnight seal and let
me tell you guys it's all a lie there is
no peel on this Mouse it is basically a
navy blue much to my disappointment
blodgett art I'm going need you to stop
playing with my heart it's a pretty good
mob stuff and next up we've got the new
Xbox one controller made with design
labs there's no secret I'm a huge fan of
customized text especially controllers
so when Microsoft Societies hooked me up
with one of these I was pretty high now
I don't know if you guys ever went and
tried out Microsoft design labs for the
Xbox controllers but they added a ton of
new colors and options and I was able to
pick the exact combination that would
work with the gamers paradise here and
have it worked perfectly you can
customize the colors pretty much
everywhere on the controller the colors
of the buttons themselves the material
at the d-pad
and you can even add a textured grip to
the back so you can have a more
comfortable gaming experience which i
think is a no-brainer and a must the
Xbox one controller feels even better
with a grip so if you guys want to go
ahead and mess around with this design
labs I'll be sure to have it linked down
below along with everything else within
this video and next up we've got this
mobile photography kit and some of you
may have seen me grab this in the
massive tech haul that I do area and
Best Buy and if you haven't seen that
may I have a link down below but this
was a surprise winner and this kit
should work with any phone with a
headphone jack since some of the
accessories require one and inside the
kit you'll get a flexible tripod to hold
up your phone a blue screen shutter so
you can take pictures without actually
having to press your camera a
directional microphone and LED video
license we all know lighting is
essential for getting the right shot and
even a cable to charge it and you also
get three different lenses you get a
macro lens a wide-angle and even a
fisheye lens you also get a lens clip to
attach it to your phone and the carrying
case to hold all of the accessories and
with the three different lenses you're
able to switch up the look of your
smartphone's camera and get some pretty
interesting shots so I think this is a
pretty nice kit if you're looking to
maybe get some really nice shots for
your Instagram Cage work on your mobile
photography or even start blogging with
this can kind of have all the tools you
need to get a pretty good vlog going on
with just your cell phone but there's a
really nice option but if you want to
make this a bit more high quality to
record audio from your phone then you're
going to want to check out the rode mic
smart lab now I picked this up because I
notice whenever I go live in an area
that's pretty crowded it gets pretty
hard to hear me this lab plugs directly
into your phone using the 3.5 millimeter
jack and boom you instantly have better
audio this thing is somewhere around 60
bucks so it's definitely worth it
especially if you're someone who likes
to go live or maybe you want to start
blogging and using your cell phone and
if you're someone who already has a
pretty decent camera you can still use
this with your phone to record some
pretty good audio instead of relying on
what you get from your camera and next
up we got the logitech pop now I don't
know if you guys have ever heard of this
before but it's pretty much a smart home
switch that you can place anywhere and
it allows you to control your smart home
devices with the push of a button and
with the app you're able to go in and
customize up side three different button
toggles for my first button which is
just a single press it will turn on all
the lights in my game
with the special teal color that I say
and the second button which is a double
tap is simply a way for me to turn on
all of my ceiling lights without turning
on all the other colored lights in your
room you also get a third button which
is a long press but to be honest I'm
pretty set with the two that I have so I
still got that one open and I like these
because they're pretty low profile
unless you go with a special color that
they offer and you're able to pretty
much place them anywhere thanks to the
adhesive that it comes with I just think
that's some pretty cool functionality
for anybody who has some smart devices
especially since there's still low
profile but that about wraps up this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy girl I give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer case</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
