the drivers consumer and this is my wife
Irene hello and today we've got a
special project in front of us here we
have the can old pistol kit now this
should help us learn how to code which
is perfect for us because we are
complete newbies are complete beginners
at coding I'm just hoping out of all of
this I'll learn how to make an app that
I can tell for like a jillion dollars
but all the designers you saw at the can
oh we're sponsoring today's video we're
actually going to make a challenge out
of this we're going to see who can end
up coding the better project here oh
that's up yes and all right guys here we
have it this is the canno pixel kit a
front can see a picture of the pixel
board that we'll be using and the back
you can see the types of animations and
games it's a couple of examples of what
we can name it we have a little booklet
here and some stickers lots of stickers
so this is basically going to be your
guide to getting the whole project done
and actually has all the pieces listed
out right on the side so you know
exactly what you're working with
so you want to let me know what we're
working with here as I pick them all out
sure this 1.5 gigahertz 120 LED pixel
breeze and I'm guessing that's this guy
so this has all of the pixels this is
that board that I was talking about in
the beginning the pixel board and you
can see you've got all the text right
behind I forgot it
there's a mode dial for game visuals and
apps there's also a pixel case the
battery and cable so you have three
hours of playing and then the lanyards
you could bring around with you okay and
then we've got these little pieces here
as I go on the board alright guys so we
have everything we need to get started
here I think this would be pretty fun
right yeah it's kind of why I think
since we've done something like hands
down like this so I'm excited yeah but
we'll show you guys our process of going
through the booklet and figuring out how
to put this all together and it will
come back with our final creations and
you will vote to see who has the best
stuff alright let's get this started
alright
starts off with some super basic
instruction oxidize pick up the brain
turn children this is completely awesome
okay so there's an app you use and that
hopefully will give us the program we
need to make illness super easy in
spirit all right so what's really
actually pretty cool about this is that
you can download it on both Windows and
Mac OS so I'm using Windows right now
while areas over there using Mac OS so
we got the best of both worlds coverage
so my buttons are on this is my joystick
and then okay okay
kind of reminds me of a camera the dial
on the camera so you can get to the
right setting pretty cool alright
battery installed let's make a cake yeah
a six-year-old can definitely do this
now I know I didn't do much but just
looking at this thing missing sorry I
did a lot now let's bring it to life
already
alright time it says bring it to life
there's a power button on the side so
let's do this in three oh well I heard
my sound I mean I could just leave it
just like this so it's kind of not the
built-in mic and fighters here and you
can see that it's picking up every time
I talk like this so there's a game mode
on here so right now we just like
animations and light now there's a game
mode Oh
three two one when you think all this is
awesome like the Milky adays can I just
keep this I'm going to do the coding
part I just want to play you know I'm
right now I can plug this guy right into
my keyboard and I'm good to go
tournament a section called training
where there are some challenges I have
to go through I think before I get to
actually do some courting of my own
makes it so using the app is pretty
simple you have all these different
pieces that make up the code but they
all look like puzzle pieces and you can
kind of just connect them as you want to
add different variables and different
little dimensions to what you're doing
so this is actually really simple easy
to learn and because they're all of
these different colors here you can
easily distinguish what each one is
doing as a different function so when
I'm loving here is that the blocks act
like real code it's just easier to learn
especially right now and next to the
preview of the pixel board you can even
get a glimpse of the actual code in the
JavaScript panel pretty cool so I'm sure
once I master this kind of program when
I go on to more advanced coding I
promise you some some parallels here
like this conditional statement all
right guys so we are all done
are you ready we got to do an unveiling
and got to explain what our projects do
okay you go first
last okay so for me I decided to create
a light show so depending on the sound
that it hears different life will go off
and it will change colors depending on
how loud the volume is of whatever is
hearing so as of right now it hears me
just a tad bit so you see it lighting
them just a bit but if I go really
really loud you can see the whole thing
like that pain is color I think that's
pretty cool
damnit it's okay yeah all right so what
you're looking at yeah that's it okay
are you laughing fine
so here's mine I programmed the
different buttons to do different things
so this is my little critter here and
Lopez can see that so I programmed it so
that when it moves to the right the guy
moves right on the joystick and to left
it moves to the left but it can also
dance the web
planet managers brought character weight
goes dancing yeah it dances and then it
can stop em I press this button that's
all well and good right I use little
characters we had nice program to move
left or right but now it's also piece of
information I use my inspiration was
your little subscriber clock things so
now I can get some information here so
when I press down on the joystick I know
the time the time if I set the location
I know the time and it Scrolls plus 844
I am right now and it is not a 40 let's
go Alexa what time is it the time is
8:49 p.m. Oh ever since it was no I
forgot to press I've represented to the
right words all right yeah but it has
the same thing so that's great you know
the time but then we press up on the
joystick you also know the degrees this
is set to New Jersey Newark New Jersey
and ask the temperature so you got a
multi-functioning little program there
okay okay
set that beeps out my little microphone
light thing I do want to explain the
reason I was able to do like the
location temperature and like the time
is because the program pulls from like
different data feeds so I'm able to say
okay I want to do the temperature and
then program the certain buttons to do
that so it sounds more complicated and
actually is it was super super easy and
I was like easy when he's doing a little
light show it was like the intro thing
it they gave us a little part to show
you guys I knew she was going to have a
little something up her sleeve so I had
it on the up mastery I'm gonna turn this
to number three here get a little too
comfortable
Oh what does that look like who does
that look like Ahri looks like Pikachu
yeah did you yeah how the heck no let me
tell you you know
No yeah you're a cheater I actually
worked at it you build that you caught
that did you create that oh my god I'll
just provide you know it
no you're bidding it for like let me let
me tell you what happened so there's
like this library of creations that
other people build and I just wish
people were so big that no one is you're
done so err okay I think he should just
be disqualified on the clear winner here
you live cheater
all right well can't really argue that
you win thank you let's go through the
pole because that because you deserve
the win for whoever created it shout out
for you guys this has been a super easy
experience if we spent a little bit more
time on I'm subbing to come up with even
greater things this is all done within a
standpoint an hour yeah so we just add
the more complex you can sit there for a
while just like playing around with it
and adding different things but if
you're cool with your Pikachu II just
want a nice little light showed you can
do that these retail for about 80 bucks
and there's other things as well like a
motion sensing kit all kinds of stuff so
we'll have links to everything down
below in the description so be sure to
go check that out but hopefully you guys
enjoyed it you guys know I'm the clear
winner me and whoever made this but
we'll catch you guys in the next one
till then see I was consumer
I won that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
