consumer and today we're switching
things up a bit if you follow me on
social media you might have heard me
mention gearing up for UAC 2.0 and it's
finally here UAC 2.0 is basically the
channel as it is now but turned up a lot
I've listened to a lot of the feedback
you guys have been giving me and I've
been working hard to incorporate it into
UAC 2.0
first off we've got a schedule the
biggest thing I've heard from you all is
you want more you like the videos I put
out but you want more fun and well I'm
no longer a one-man team so you can
expect three to four videos per week I'm
excited to bring back some of the stuff
I started the channel with like reviews
girlfriend tests or wiped us now and
features of cool products and giveaways
I've heard you about the giveaways and
they'll be happening at least once a
month but most likely more so be sure to
follow me on Facebook Twitter Instagram
and even snapchat if you want to know
about that free stuff more is the theme
for UAC 2.0 and I'll be pumping videos
out more and more and I can't wait to
share some of the content I've got lined
up for you guys it's gonna be pretty
epic and this wouldn't be much of a 2.0
without a new logo I'll put more me into
this logo and now we have a fresh new
color scheme for your average consumer
teal is my all-time favorite color and
now we've got some orange complimented
quick challenge see if you can interpret
the logo and I'm gonna be shouting out
the best and closest guesses over on
Twitter so be sure to head on over there
and let me know what you think
now those weekly vlogs either love them
or you hate them but they're here to
stay if you love them great they'll be
here weekly
actually an area and I can't wait to
share some of the clips from our wedding
and honeymoon to Bora Bora as well as
some of the things we have on the
horizon and if you hate them skip them
and come out on Sundays and they're
labeled your average couple so just be
sure to ignore those and wait for the
next tech video and for the most
exciting part a new setup and space for
shooting you might have already noticed
the difference in this video as well as
some of my more recent ones but I have a
whole new spot dedicated solely to
shooting krispie videos it's been in the
works for a while and I'm almost ready
to reveal it in its full glory so you
definitely gotta stay tuned for that and
that's UAC 2.0
drop me a comment down below letting me
know what you're most excited about and
I'll do some shining out over on Twitter
with my favorite ones but I appreciate
you guys sticking with me through the
last four years and here's to another
till the next one guys ravage consumer
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
