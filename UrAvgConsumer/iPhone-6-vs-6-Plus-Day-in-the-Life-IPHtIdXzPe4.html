consumer and today I'm going to give you
some insight into a day in the life with
the iPhone 6 versus the iPhone 6 plus so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
and all right guys the first thing we're
going to talk about is the overall feel
in the hand and using it and just to let
you know I do have pre average-sized
hands but now when we're talking about
the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6 feels very
natural you shouldn't have any issues
reaching for any parts of the screen and
it should be very easy to get used to
this coming from another smartphone 4.7
inches is the sweet spot for a lot of
people and I pretty much have to agree
now the iPhone 6 plus will definitely
take some getting used to
it's quite a large phone due to the 5.5
inch display and the large bezels on the
top and the bottom of the phone and I've
never used a phone this large and to be
honest is getting more and more natural
to me the more I use it now that may be
a product of me wanting to get used to
it but I'm getting used to it
nonetheless because it's larger and has
rounded edges it tends to slip from my
hand more than with the standard 6 since
that one is easier to get a firm grip on
both phones have a feature called reach
ability that allow you to double tap the
home button not press just double tap
and it'll bring the top portion of the
screen down to the middle and I found it
more useful when using the 6 plus it's a
decent feature when you want to reach a
button at the top of the screen but you
just have to remember that it even
exists now I went around and asked a
bunch of people what they thought of the
6 plus and you can actually find a link
to that video down below in the
description but it seems like their
biggest concern was how it was gonna fit
in their pocket I wear pretty average
fit pants so no skinny jeans and I have
no issues getting the 6 plus into my
pocket it's slightly more noticeable to
me in my pockets than compared to other
phones but it hasn't really been a big
deal to me aside from the thought of
bendgate of course but the normal 6 is
barely noticeable to me when in my
pocket so I have no complaints there my
girlfriend doesn't typically put her
phone in her pants pocket and as
expected she wasn't comfortable with
carrying the 6 plus that way and the 6
was better for her but she still prefers
to keep it in her purse neither phones
had any trouble getting into her
smallest purse but of course a good fit
all depends on the size of the purse as
well as the contents inside two ended
texting is pretty comfortable on both
devices
since texting requires using the lower
half of the screen it isn't really an
issue with the 6 plus whatsoever
actually really enjoyed the texting
experience on both the 6 and 6-plus
one-handed use is also pretty good with
the six and manageable with the six plus
one of the bonuses that the 60 Plus has
due to its larger size is the ability to
have more buttons on the screen when in
landscape mode for texting this is
pretty useful since you don't have to
hit multiple buttons to get access to
the punctuation you're looking for
however the special keyboard will only
be found in apps that have been updated
for the iPhone 6 and 6-plus now one of
the biggest concerns with the 6 plus is
how odd it will be to use it when making
a phone call now it's a pretty different
feeling from the 6 because of how tall
it is it'll definitely take up more of
your face when using it I myself don't
have a problem using this Express to
talk on the phone but my girlfriend
found it to be uncomfortable and said it
was pretty awkward to use the standard 6
felt very normal and similar to most
smart phones we use nowadays now
watching videos and playing games is a
great experience on both phones because
of the nice screens there packing and I
do enjoy a bigger screen for these kind
of activities because who doesn't like a
bigger screen for watching videos or
playing games the 6 plus is a bigger
phone to hold while doing these
activities but I honestly don't think
that will impact your experience at all
the 6 plus also features a higher screen
resolution but I also don't think that
the average person will be able to tell
the difference between the two unless
they're pixel hunting the web browsing
experience here hasn't been much
different however the bigger screen on
the 6 plus does make what you're looking
at a bit larger based on my experience
with the 2 you don't see more content
when visiting a site just a larger
version you may find yourself going for
two-handed use with the 6 plus more so
than the 6 especially if you're on a
site that hasn't been built for mobile
use using the cameras on both phones
it's pretty much the same experience
while the 6 plus is a little bit larger
it doesn't make it any more difficult to
take out your pocket and snap a quick
picture or even take a video and because
both these phones have awesome cameras
you're just going to enjoy regardless so
not a problem with either one although
because the 6 is a little bit smaller
you might find it a tiny bit more
comfortable one place that I did find
that I enjoy the size of the 6 plus was
actually in a car using it for GPS
navigation led to a pretty nice
variants being able to see the map a lot
clearer than on a smaller screen and I
definitely think that that's a really
nice place to have that five point five
inch display and that about wraps it up
for my comparison of the iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 plus when using it in your
everyday life and that pretty much wraps
it up for this video if you enjoyed it
be the cool guy that gives this video a
thumbs up and subscribe to the channel

video guys average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
