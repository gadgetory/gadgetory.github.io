consumer and today I got another
comparison video for you guys of the
beats by dre your beats and the beats
tours so in this video we're going to
see if this Beach tours are worth the
extra 50 bucks or if you should save it
and go to your beats so it's not wasting
any time let's get right into it alright
guys here we have the case for the beats
tours and this is the case for the your
beads now I think they're both decent
cases but I must say I got to give it up
to the beats the yer beads for their
case I believe the eye beats also comes
with a case like this by a more fan of
this because of how simple it is to get
your earphones in and out of this
whereas the beach towards case this is
the new version without monster the
previous version was just a round
circular case but now they have this
oval case and it's an alright case um
getting the headphones in is not not a
big deal the zipper is cool so you know
nothing gets loose there's a little
pouch here on the side that you can use
to you know put other accessories like
your clips or other earbuds which is all
pretty fine and dandy you can also put
that all those things in this pouch as
well so it's not a big deal but um it is
a hardshell case so it's pretty you know
good for protection not that it's very
necessary since these are very foldable
and they can be bent around so there's
no big deal so I am but I'm saying I'm a
fan of this a bit more than I am of this
I simply like how easy it is and how
easy it is to UM travel with this it's
very flat even with the headphones in
it's not going to take up much space
only gripe with this is that it's a
little harder to open you can see it's
you know can be a pain to get open but
overall I do like this case a lot more
now that we have the cases aside we have
the two earphones and first thing we're
going to talk about is the design now
I'm very happy with the beat stores in
their design and I'm also very happy
with the urbeats the urbeats does just
give off
feel that it is the smaller version of
the Taurus the Taurus has a very nice
design in that it can go right into the
canal of your ear and really shoot the
music towards it and I'm really a big
fan of this design I do think that it
does very well here beats is pretty
standard earbuds um they just go pretty
straight but I haven't had any issues
with the design of these I do think that
these deliver the sounds very fairly
well and overall I'm very happy with the
look of both of them they both got the
nice B on the sides
I like the tours a bit more that because
they they seem a bit more solid they're
little bigger I do like that um I do
feel that this are just like a more
sturdy pair they've got a thick um
tangle free cable where this has a
slimmer tangle free cable but it's still
that tangle free nonetheless they both
feature inline remotes the urbeats does
have the newer design for the inline
remote all of the current beats
headphones are using this kind of look
for their inline remotes even though the
tours are without monster they're still
sporting the older version of the inline
remote and I think that might just have
to be a thing with the design of the
actual earbuds themselves they've got
the little silver accents around it so
that's that might be why they're keeping
this look but the tours I mean the year
beats you know a ghost's hand in hand
and it does follow the new the newer
look either way they're both fine no
issues they're the only issue with the
design aspect in comparison the beats
tours are because of their thicker cable
much heavier even though they're they're
more sturdy feeling they feel a little
stronger that comes at a price these are
a lot heavier um and what that
translates to is this means that the
weight of the actual cords and all the
inline remote and things like this
little piece right here all of this
comes into play and that means that this
is a much heavier headphone in that it
will fall out of your ear depending on
your situation so if you're walking
around the
and you're moving around quite a bit
there's a higher chance that these will
fall out of your ears then the urbeats
will be your beats are much lighter they
do have the thinner cables and the
little piece that puts them together
here this is much smaller compared to
this thing right here so of course you
know this is going to weigh it down more
than this will now the remedy to you
know the heavier cable is the actual
little clip that comes with the UM the
little clip that comes with the
earphones you can clip it onto your
shirt or anything like that and you
don't really have to worry about that
but if you don't like using that little
clip um there is a chance that these
will fall out of your ear so the design
aspect that is one of the flaws there
the overall look is good but it's just a
bit too heavy when walking around or
having a lot of activity in the newer
version of the beat stores the one
without monster does not include the
little hooks that the monster version
came with and those hooks were really
really great I don't know why they took
them out I don't know if it had
something to do with cost or what but
those hooks were amazing and if I had to
choose between the monster version or
the monster or the one without monster I
definitely go for the monster version if
you have that option so I would really
recommend picking up the monster version
so you can get those hooks that's just
another little added bonus so that if
you're walking around you don't have to
worry about the ear buds falling out or
if you're doing workouts or exercise
that's going to keep them secure as well
the urbeats do not come with that option
whatsoever but overall this is going to
have a better time staying in your ears
than the tours will we spoke a bit about
a durability already these are thicker
and bigger cables so these will in
theory last longer these should be a bit
more durable um I feel like this
material and this material they're both
pretty fine this has a similar feel to
be mixers and this is just plastic
I don't see any problems with the actual
earbud parts themselves so as far as
durability it's really up to just the
cable and because the detours have a
thicker cable I do think that these will
probably last longer I'm more afraid of
the tourists pulling a snag on a you
know a door handle or something like
that then I would be of the tours now
one thing also I guess you can consider
this durability but the cable of the
tour seems to get a little darker with
time then the urbeats does and you know
that I'm not too big a fan of that I do
feel like these shouldn't really turn
dark as fast as they do I'm not sure if
it's because of the kind of clothing I
wear or if it's the case that does it
but I do find that this gets turns into
a darker red then this does so if you
really like that big bright red you
might be you might want to be very
careful with how where you're putting
this or what kind of clothing or
material you're leaning up your tours
against I didn't find that to be quite
as much of an issue with the Year beads
now to speak a bit about comfort as I
mentioned before the tours are a little
bigger so they are going to slip out
your ears which can lead to you know
some pretty uncomfortable times when
you're trying to get the ear buds back
in you're in position in your ear so you
can have that tight seal so you can hear
your music
so that is a big factor but when that's
not an issue like let's say you're using
your clip or something like that or you
know you're not walking around you're
just fascia Neri these will probably be
very very comfortable to you I really
like the design I like how the ear buds
go into an angle so that it goes
directly into your ears arm I'm really a
fan of that the comfort is great when
you're stationary and not moving around
or when you have that clip on but when
you're moving around just can be a
bother it can fall out the ears and it
can get annoying after a while
like I said this wasn't this didn't have
that issue much this was pretty
comfortable to me arm walking around was
no issue these aren't heavy headphones
so they stayed in place they kept the
seal pretty well
I didn't find myself adjusting the ears
too much so I definitely think that
these will probably win in the comfort
department but I do find that when using
this sometimes I do actually feel my
ears rub up against the actual air
earphone part which is a little weird I
can't say it's very uncomfortable or
anything like that but it is weird to
feel that against my ear if at times so
now we've spoken about durability
comfort and design so the last and most
important part is the sound quality now
the beeps both of these have some really
great base for in-ear headphones they're
amazing bass for bass lovers you'll
definitely enjoy both of these um I do
feel though that the beat stores do
offer better sound quality and that's
because you can hear vocals clearer you
can hear instruments clearer so if
you're listening to things outside of
hip-hop and you know all that kind the
genre of music that you know really is
really bass heavy you're going to have a
better time with the tours then you will
with the dealer beats the Europeans have
great bass but they do don't have as
much clarity as the tours so you won't
hear vocals quite as well as you would
with the tours um everything sounds a
bit more muffled than you do on with the
tours but that's not to say that you
sound bad on their own I think that
that's just in comparison to the tours
these will sound like they're not as
good but I think for an overall
experience I do think that the tours are
better for sound quality they're just a
lot clearer and they still offer just as
good a bass um I think the average
consumer that either of these would be
fine so if you're just looking for a lot
of bass nothing too crazy on the urbeats
might be a better choice but I do have
to go to tours on I think the average
consumer won't really see any of these
as a bad pair of earphones on their own
but like I said in comparison you will
see that the tours are better now is it
worth the $50 jump in price between the
urbeats and the tours um is really hard
to say because I do like the Euro beads
and I
do like the tours so I can see someone
living just fine with the urbeats
but is this a better pair of headphones
yeah I do think the chores are better
pair of headphones and pretty much most
of the departments besides ohm comfort
so and that's not to say these are
uncomfortable but these are just you'll
have an easier time with your do your
beads but is it worth the $50 uh it
really depends on you if you really like
the look of the tours and you think
you'd feel a little bit more comfortable
with the thicker cable
yeah the tours would probably be a
better bet I would buy the tours over
the your beats but if you want to save a
little money and you're not too
concerned with you know hearing really
crisp vocals or anything like that you
just want to hear your music you
probably won't know the difference
between you know really loud vocals or
not then you'll probably want to just
say 450 bucks go to your beats but um I
think that overall the tours are a
better price I mean are a better choice
but if you're if you want to save that
fifty bucks I wouldn't deter someone
from just going with your beats and
being okay with that
and overall guys that pretty much wraps
it up as I said before my choices two
tours but I can definitely recommend the
gear beats over the tours if you want to
save a little cash so it's really up to
you what you like in the design and all
the other factors that I've covered
already and that pretty much wraps up
this video guys this has been the
comparison of the tours and the ear
beads if you like this video please feel

I'll catch you guys in the next video
this is your average consumer until the
