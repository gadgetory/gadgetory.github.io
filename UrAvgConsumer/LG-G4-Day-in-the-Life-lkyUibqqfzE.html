consumer and this is the day in the life
with the LG g4 and all right guys here
we have the LG g4 which as you may have
noticed looks somewhat like the LG g3
but I don't think that's a bad thing
it has a nice 5.5 inch quad HD display
which means this is a slightly bigger
phone but not as big as the Nexus 6 or
the iPhone 6 plus it has nice thin
bezels so the sleek phone feels like
it's all screen now if you take a quick
look around the phone you won't find any
buttons except for the ones on the back
the back houses the volume controls as
well as the power button and of course
obviously the camera this is the
metallic gray version but as many of you
probably have seen already it also comes
in a brown or black leather and more
options will be available later on
despite its size the g4 is very
comfortable to hold in the hand and
that's in part due to its curved back
it makes resting in your palm while
using it very easy which makes sense
given the natural curve in our hands
when holding phones all the edges on the
g4 have a slight slant to them which I
find pretty convenient as it gives me
something to grab when holding the phone
in portrait or landscape mode this makes
it easy for one-handed use when texting
or browsing through apps another very
natural feeling part of the d4 is the
set of buttons on the back and to be
honest it's an awesome place for those
buttons I've never thought about
changing the button placement on phones
but after actually using the g4 it makes
perfect sense this is especially useful
during phone calls as our hands
naturally rest along those buttons
increasing and decreasing the volume on
your calls won't be a problem at all and
will actually be quite a bit easier I
found no issues throwing it in my pants
pocket and the curve actually helps it
to not stand out like a sore thumb area
didn't have the same luck though so
ladies you'll have to throw it in your
purse or bag depending on how deep your
pockets are
now as I mentioned earlier this does
have a 5.5 inch quad-hd display not to
be confused with 4k and it looks great
colors are very vivid and I find it
awesome to look at from all angles the
large screen makes it great for media
consumption from browsing your photos to
watching your favorite videos and of
course using your favorite apps and with
such a nice display you get a very nice
gaming experience as well and speaking
of gaming let's talk a bit about the
performance the g4 is packed with a
Snapdragon 808 processor which isn't the
latest but it's no slouch either you
won't find any real performance issues
here but that's what I've come to expect
in 2015 you'll be able to swipe through
open and even jump between apps very
fluidly and I'm pretty confident that
the g4 will be able to handle whatever
you throw at it and that even includes
some multitasking
you can split apps like YouTube and
Gmail without any hiccups whatsoever but
depending on what you're throwing it it
might have an impact on battery life
luckily this is an area the g4 has no
troubles it has a solid 3000 milliamp
battery and unlike any of its main
competitors the g4 s is still removable
I can get a full day's use with about
four hours of screen on time and
considering the quad HD display that's
pretty darn good and I couldn't call
this a day in the life without
mentioning the camera as that is
probably one of my favorite parts about
smartphones the GeForce is definitely
something to talk about it has a 16
megapixel rear camera with a maximum
aperture of 1.8 which means you'll be
able to take in a ton of light and get
some really great bokeh and for those of
you who don't know a bulkhead is its
when you get the really blurry
background and it makes your pictures
look really professional you'll be able
to get some amazing shots with this guy
and for those pros out there you'll be
able to access the manual controls which
is a very nice addition to capable
smartphone cameras like this we saw this
with the galaxy s6 and it's a welcomed
addition here and for the selfie takers
you've got an 8 megapixel front facing
camera and an awesome ability to double
tap the volume down button when the
screen is off and it'll jump right into
the camera and snap a pic and this is
great because we all know how
spontaneous a selfie can be with
maximum aperture of one point a and
optical image stabilization you'll be
able to get off some really great
low-light shots I've been using this
thing in auto mode and everything has
come out pretty impressive
now the g-force camera tends to striping
images quite a bit but I think for the
average person you'll still be really
happy with the results I definitely
think a comparison with the galaxy s6 is
in order it's honestly pretty hard to
say anything bad about this phone
because it does so much so well if
you're trying to pick up a new phone
then I definitely think the g4 should be
on your list of considerations this is
my first time with an lg phone and I've
been pleasantly surprised with my
experience and day to day use and I like
it so much I think I'll give one away to
one of you guys so definitely leave a
thumbs up if you're interested in that
but till the next video guys it's your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
