consumer and today I'm finally giving
you guys the room slash office tour and
you're finally gonna see my setup
everything that I have here all built
out for the channel so I'm finally gonna
be bringing that to you guys
and I'm doing this with my Sony nex-5r
so it's not my t4i so it's not DSLR
quality so I apologize for the bit of a
downgrade in that regard but hey let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it
and alright guys so this is the room
when you first walk in this is what
you'll see and let's just show you guys
around close this door alright so here
on the left side we have my dresser with
all my clothing and whatnot but I call
this like the pending dresser where I
kind of have products that are pending
for a review or haven't been released on
the channel just yet by the time of this
video I'm pretty sure everything on here
will be out but um yeah so here we have
Sennheiser Momentum's on ear and over
here version let's go on here
that's over here but here we have
Logitech products so all kinds of stuff
coming to the channel for sure that
haven't been released just yet at the
time of this video I'm recording this
and over here we have the camera that
makes all the magic happen for me on
YouTube I have an external flash here
that's not really necessary but I have
it on there right now and it's a Canon
t4i and it has a sigma 30 millimeter 1.4
lens attached to it so this is like my
favorite lens right now it's an amazing
lens and this is the tripod and slider
that I use so when I'm doing all those
panning shots where there's like motion
this is how it all happens
um and down here on this little tripod
I have the zoom h1 this is a nice little
handy recorder this works very very well
for me this is where I get all the audio
and this is really really nice for me as
far as the audio goes and down here you
get this little brightness up for you
guys I have the camera backpack and the
gadget backpack you guys are very
familiar with the gadget backpack um
I've done a video on that recently and
over here we have the camera back camera

camera gear in when I'm traveling if I
need to you know use them for any shots
or videos or anything like that I can
carry all my stuff in here if you guys
are interested in a video of how I pack
this thing up let me know and I will
definitely bring that to you guys I
think that'd be a very cool and fun
video and this is a entirely too bright
lamp right now but this is the lamp that
I use for most of my videos it gives you
a lot of lighting it has like five bulbs
on it really good stuff very very much a
fan of that have two of them to make my
room really bright and over here we have
my futon which i think is the best um
the best bet for this kind of room
because the seating area is great for
watching things on the iMac where my
monitors are playing games so being able
to sit and sleep at any time is really
cool and over here we have a cool little
toy that I stole from my little cousin
you can actually put it up and close it
it's really really neat

name or anything but I like that and
over here we have my bookshelf now my

that's why that's only one and over here

different things with NFC I'm gonna have
a video about this coming to them too so
you guys gotta look out for that tons of
good stuff here and I've got these Sony

down here I have one of the speakers to
my surround sound speaker system going
on and I have two tablets here this is
the Nexus 10 and over here we have the
Nexus 7 this is the new Google Nexus 7

those this is a power pack plus the
ravpower Wi-Fi this the playstation
portable charger and a youtube charger
over here so all kinds of good stuff I

much if it's the same system I like the
originals the most square reader a
splitter for headphones here I have the
beats version 2 beats tour version 2 I
have the beats tours the original the
jaybird blue buds x over here drake and
some older RPG games and i have a pair
of your beats speaking of games guys i
have a ton of games here i want to do
more gaming on the channel but I mainly
do RPGs so if you guys are interested in
that with any shape or fashion let me
know I can start doing more videos and
maybe some unboxings of special editions
or something like this right here so let
me guys let me know I kind of want to
jump into that and down here we have a
couple of headphone cases and some
random headphones as well here we have
the PlayStation Wireless some headset
just chilling over here some other
headphones I have my audio technica ws
70s over here
you know the Logitech UE 4000s a bunch
of cases pico Dali so that's what's
really going on here just some random
stuff random cases and I've got some
Nexus 7 and 10 boxes here as well and a
charger for my DSLR battery so that's
all of that and to the right of that is
my degree from Drexel University I am a
college graduate so of course in office
kind of setting I think this is
definitely necessary so I've got going
on over there and oh yeah I had a vlog
where me and my girlfriend picked out
these little pictures so for those of
you who watch the vlog this is where
they are right now
and um yeah so moving on over here we
have my portable station I have my cell
phone which is a galaxy as
four and I have the iPod Touch 5th
generation
I love Android on a phone this is my
phones of choice but I do appreciate iOS
for sure so I always had to have the
latest iPod so that I can be up to date
with both sides of the spectrum really
like them both over here I have a USB
hub it's actually meant for the
PlayStation I don't know if you guys can
see that but it's actually meant for the
PlayStation and over here I have the
Google Nexus 4 I don't really use that
since I do have my Galaxy s4 but it's
nice to have around and just in case and
as a nexus wireless charger here where
it's chilling and of course my PS Vita I
love this thing to death you guys know
that um here I have my 3ds a little
stylus and I have a MacBook Air right
here this is my laptop and yeah this is
like the little portable area where I
can grab any of these things and just
get out and go and be entertained for a
while hmm
and opening up this drawer first thing I
know you'll notice is just pink Nintendo
3ds GDI or DSi I'm sorry and this is for
my girlfriend but I keep it over here we
have the Google G the Google in g1 this
is this mobile phone that started
everything the g1 was the very first
Android device and I still got mine and
it still works I'm very proud to say and
then I have the g2 and over here I have
some storage devices memory cards um
this is the little unboxing knife that
everyone says it's not little
I think it's little it's no big deal but
this is my little unboxing knife but
just use it to unbox stuff of course and
of course here I have a ton of
microfiber cloths that I use to clean my
products I have an addiction to clean
the screens on all of my little pieces
of Technology so that's always being you
just over here I have some of the games
that I'm playing right now for the 3ds
and down here we have cables cables and
cables and cables and they're all in
Ziploc bags if you guys are wondering
what's going on here I have them the
ziplock bags because they're easier to
just grab like this and I know what
cable goes to every product so if it
came with a certain product I know which
product it matches up with so that's
what I have going on over here I just
don't like to deal with the tangles of
having all of these around so that's
what's going on here
and I of course I have the wall adapters
for them all as well so lots and lots of
cables and over here I have my printer
nothing too special but this is the
printer and the subwoofer to my Logitech
what is it the Z 506 but I'll show you
guys that in a second over here I have
my cables that are connected to my
computer and my monitor and my other
stuff that I'll show you guys in a
second it's pretty unsightly but for
where it is nobody really sees it so I
don't think that's a big deal and now to
finally show you guys my setup as far as
my desk goes so this is the desk it's a
pretty big desk so I get a lot of room
to do videos and you know shoot my
product stuff like that so I've got a
lot of space going on here over here I
have a 27-inch iMac
this is a pretty souped-up I think at
least I think it's got a 3.4 gigahertz
um processor core i7 um 32 gigs of ram
pretty much all the stuff you would need
to you know sit here and fix videos and
whatnot so I'm using Final Cut Pro here
and um I know what gets a lot of
attention are these little fishies over
here my wallpaper now I get asked all
the time what this wallpaper is this is
actually only for
Mac OS so it's only for OS 10 and it's
actually called koi pond 3d so if you're
interested in that this is what it's
called you can finally go pick it up but
it does cost like three dollars I think
work to I don't know how much it costs
actually but it has no more than three
dollars and it's a bit of a memory hog
so just want you guys to be aware of
that if you go out and purchase it and
over here I have the logitech speakers
the surround sound speakers that um
these are the Logitech Z 506 I believe
and I have one here another here and
another there and on my pending table I
have a one here and another one on the
bookshelf so I've got a bit of surround
sound going um this is the PlayStation 3
I'm the PlayStation 3d display so I have
this connected to my computer and I'm
running Windows 8 on it this is all
going based on the iMac it's just
connected and um I can actually you know
drag stuff between the two but uh I
typically have like windows open here
just because I think it's cool it's nice
to have Windows and Mac OS running at
the same time not that I really need
Windows but yeah and back behind here I
have the avid studio mic so this is what
I actually used for my voiceovers so
it's a pretty decent microphone I don't
typically use it that often so it's
usually sitting in the back there behind
the iMac I only really pull it out for
reviews that I'm doing voiceovers for so
unless that and of course I have the
Apple Wireless Keyboard Magic Trackpad
and a Apple Magic Mouse and over here I
have a Logitech performance MX mouse I
believe is called and of course I have a
youtube mouse pad so that's what I
going on here and in the back of here I
have a three terabyte Seagate hard drive
so I keep a lot of my own video footage
and whatnot on here so that's what's
going on and I think that's about it for
the actual desk itself for right now now
I'm going to show you guys what I love
about this room the most and that's over
here this is my little setup here that I
made work for me but with my games
assist my game systems a my headphones
all up top to display so this is one
thing I'm really really proud of I love
this thing so over here and this is
where the buzzing is coming from I'm not
sure if you guys can hear that buzzing
but it's coming from this guy I have the
old Xbox 360 here the old ps3 so like I
said you guys I don't really update my
systems because these guys are still
working for me now when I open this up
all you can hear that buzzing that's
because the fans are on like overdrive
right now because I have them all on and
they've been sitting in here while I've
been recording this video
I don't ever leave this closed while you
know during the day I just have a closed
because of the buzzing for this video
but that's what's going on over here one
thing I want to show you guys is they're
all connected
these little wires they're all connected
going down this - and they're all
plugged in and connected to this on
PlayStation 3d monitor also with the
PlayStation 3 I have this little cave
cradle that charges up my controllers
and I'm going to close this because that
noise is ridiculous but that's where I
have all my controllers charging at the
same time while my ps3 is chilling there
so I can charge it up and always be
ready to play whenever I want one thing
you'll notice here as well are those
little lights those are connected um
they're not connected to anything
they're running by battery and it looks
really cool at night and because I can
do video magic here I'm going to show
you guys what it looks like at night
right now
and now we're back so that's what I look
like off I really do like the whole
little vibe that this has it's like
these are all on display now you might
notice that there's an empty spot over
here and that little spot is going to be
for the PlayStation 4 so it is waiting
I'm waiting everyone's waiting I can't
wait so um that's going to be really
nice to have and like I said guys these
are all hooked up to this guy over here
and all I have to do to get them all
running is hit my input so I go over to
the next channel
well yeah go over to the next channel
input and boom here you are so this is
the Xbox 360 and I think the screen
saver thing came on so I'll just pop
that back on really quickly and all
right there we go so here we have the
Xbox 360 running and with this little
HDMI switcher I can actually toggle
between the different systems and I use
this with on this little device back
here not sure if you guys can see but
this little device on Amazon I picked it
up only cost me like 10 bucks and here's
the little receiver for it so it's an
infrared receiver so you guys can see
that there I can just switch between my
different systems at any point
so here's Xbox 360 I can switch to the
oh sorry I can actually switch to the
PlayStation 3 so there goes that and the
Wii U as well so I can switch between
all three of them I can use this monitor
for so many different things and what's
really cool about this is if you turn
off one system it automatically jumps to
the other system that's on so pretty
cool stuff really like this very very
worth the 10 bucks so that's that and um
yeah let's see what else we've got
oh yeah we've got all these headphones
I didn't speak about yet so these are
all the headphones of course I get a ton
of headphones as I you know work on this
channel so here are some of the stuff
that I've collected so far that are
amongst my favorite on my headphone
stands here
so here we have the blue on the beat
studios these are the 2013 version in
white I have the pulse wireless headset
ah amazing and the beats Wireless here
we've got the v-moda m100 over here
we've got the Logitech UE 9000 here
we've got the boom phones phantom over
here we've got the audio technica ath em
50s the monster inspiration active
noise-cancelling version and we've got
the sync by 50 so these are all of the
headphones that I have just kind of
chillin above my desk area so this is
pretty much it guys
this is all what the setup looks like
down here you might also want to note
that I have a Wi-Fi extender due to this
room being a little bit further from the
Wi-Fi then I would like so what am i
router than I would like so I've got
this little extender it's made by
Netgear it's not really the best as far
as functionality goes it doesn't really
work that well but it does the job for
right now until I'm ready to switch onto
something else so that's what I've got
going there on pretty much this is it
guys this is the room this is the setup
this is everything I use um I've got the
camera the desk my little system set up
with headphones my bookshelf with a
couple of random stuff and the pending
area over here and yeah that's about it
