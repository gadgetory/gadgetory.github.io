consumer and as you can see I'm in a
different location but that's because
I'm not home for Thanksgiving and I just
wanted to keep giving you guys two
reviews that you've been waiting for so
without any further ado I'm going to be
reviewing today the monster inspiration
headphones so let's not waste any time
scare right into it here we have
monsters inspiration headphones these
are the active noise-cancelling version
and they retail for about three 49.99
this is one of monsters most popular
headphones and for a good reason but
before we get into the headphones let's
talk a bit about the case that they come
with this is the case that the
inspirations come in this is a very
impressive case both in style and
durability the D shaped carrying case
features a carrying handle as well as a
clip to keep strap to something of your
choosing the case has a great feel to it
when in the hands as well as on the
insides there's definitely a good bit of
padding to keep your inspiration safe
and secure they've also included a pouch
on the inside to hold all of your
headphones and cables that are included
speaking of cables the inspirations come
with three first we have a control chalk
cable that works with all Apple devices
and features a play-in plasma and as
well as volume controls and secondly we
have a control talk here but with only
the plain pause button that's ideal for
Android and of course we have a straight
cable with Noah control talked at all as
we go a little deeper inside the case we
can find the headphones that are stored
inside and on top of the headphones you
can see that I have an extra headband so
you can see that the case can carry
quite a bit of the accessories that come
with the inspirations and speaking of
the headband let's take a closer look at
it as you can see it's got a nice little
finish there and on the bottom you can
see it's pretty smooth and what's great
about this headband is that it's a
magnetic strip that sticks pretty close
to the headband so you don't have to
worry about it falling off and
installation of it it's also very smooth
as you can just plug in the little sides
and feel pretty confident that they
won't be falling out and it's really
cool that the end
operations have so many different
headbands so you can change up the look
of your inspirations to be different
from everyone else so as I've said I'm
pretty happy with this case it's really
soft on the inside and pretty durable on
the outside so definitely a plus for a
case and here we have the star of the
show the inspirations and I must say I
am a fan of the design of these
headphones as they've got that
industrial look going for them with all
the metal accents and the rectangular
ear cups so I'm definitely a fan of the
look and it's really solid and sturdy as
well so I'm definitely glad with the
build quality the head then is very
thick and soft with padding so it's also
going to help with comfort ability as
well as durability
now the inspirations have some very
interesting ear cups as they are
rectangular and it's very different from
what you see nowadays but they do have
some very soft padding which leads to
some great comfort and the ear cups do
rotate quite a bit so it'll fit most
head shapes and of course this is the
active noise-cancelling version so
behind the right ear cup you will find
the switch for that and when you remove
the padding of the ear cup on that side
you'll find the slot for two triple A
batteries what's really impressive with
these headphones is that they don't
require the batteries in order to listen
to your music so you can use them with
or without the active noise-cancelling
unlike the beats studios or executives
I'm also quite happy that the active
noise-cancelling didn't make any hissing
noises with or without my music so
definitely a plus there overall I'm very
happy with the sound quality of the
inspirations they offer some good bass
very nice clarity and vocals were
definitely very clear the bass was good
enough for me as a bass head and it
wasn't loud enough to drown out your
music or speak you sound muddy in any
way so definitely a good thing going
there and I feel like this will be a
great great pair of headphones for the
average consumer although it does not
hit the average consumer price point but
if you're looking to splurge I
definitely do recommend these headphone
and alright guys now time for me to show
you what it looks like when it's on and
here it is around the neck and as you
can see it looks pretty good
and here this one is on there you have
it like I said some pretty nice looking
headphones got a very solid look very
nice feel to it that's about it so
overall I'm very pleased with these
headphones very happy with them good
noise cancellation on the sound is good
it's got some nice decent bass very
clear sound so I definitely would
recommend buying these and that pretty
much wraps up this review guys wanted to
say thanks again to monster for sending
these out to me and hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video and till the next one
guys Travis consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
