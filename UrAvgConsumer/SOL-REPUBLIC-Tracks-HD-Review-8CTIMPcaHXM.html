want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone ad ravage consumer and today I
have my review of the SOL Republic's
tracks HD all right so let's not wasting
the time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the SOL
Republic tracks HD and these are some
pretty decent headphones for their price
these are about one 29.95 plus tax
depending on where you get it and you
know they're pretty good that got a
really nice design it's very you take on
what headphones should look like and how
they function so it's pretty cool
they've got this this really funky um
headband that you can kind of take apart
this is like we have to assemble these
headphones so it's pretty interesting
and you know you have two ear cups the
headband and though this Y cable that
plugs into both ear cups and we kind of
slide the ear cut on to be headband and
it's all very interesting I've never
seen headphones like these that you kind
of have to put together although it
doesn't require much work as you can see
but it's so interesting that you kind of
gotta assemble it this headband they
feed am thin that is like virtually
indestructible um you can kind of twist
it bend it do all kinds of funky stuff
to it so things that you normally really
would not do with your headphones but in
cases as far as like sitting on them
maybe you sit on them and you push them
some way or something like that you
don't have to worry about them breaking
I think these can do a full 180 and
there you have it that it's flat on the
desk a full 180 not very not a very
important feature but it's good to go
that these are durable um this adorable
headband so no one can complain that oh
I snapped my my total public racks
headband and what's cool is that you can
really go out and buy all kinds of
different headbands and kind of and you
know switch up the colors it's all
interchangeable
I think the headbands go for about
thirty dollars on their website so it
can be a little pricey if you really
like the brand and you want to switch it
up all the time it can be pricey if you
wanted to go with different outfits so
but it's still pretty cool that you have
the option of doing that and you know
there's own there's always it's always a
welcome bonus when you can switch up the
style of your headphones so as far as
design goes I think these got a a+ um i
think it's really interesting look I
think the headphones actually look
pretty good so walking outside with
these is going to be a breeze you're
gonna feel confident in you know the
fact that these are nice-looking
headphones um some people who are really
inside phones don't like the band
because it's so thin it looks cheap but
I mean how she can call this when you
see that it's um the durability of it is
so good I think it's interesting that
you can also slide the ear cups up as
far as you want on the headband so it
fits like when you kind of head shape
really if you got like a tiny head going
there or something I don't know the rent
however you want to wear your headphones
you'd be able to do that with these you
can slide the the ear cuffs up to
wherever you want I know what you want
to do but this allows you to get a lot
of customization as far as you know
these headphones so it's pretty cool
so I mean durability I give the A+ on
that because you saw what the band could
do the ear cup seemed to be pretty fine
they're made out of a nice solid
material so overall I think this is a
pretty durable set of headphones
um the thin the the cords are a little
thin when it comes to the ear cups these
are a little thinner than I'm used to
these are like probably standard before
but now usually headphones come with
thicker cables but these are a little
thin at the top but it gets thicker
under the inline room and my remote is
pretty nice the play/pause button works
with Android devices and of course you
get all the features with iPad iPods
iPhones and iPads and even that computer
like Apple computers so you get your the
volume up volume down play pause
fast-forward rewind all that good stuff
you get to use with this in line
remote and overall I really like the
design of these headphones I think
they're pretty cool very durable all
that gets an A+ from me now I know you
guys probably wondering okay how do they
sound well they sound pretty good um I
wasn't too crazy about them at first and
then I compared them to a couple of
other headphones and I realized they
weren't too bad I actually really like
the I really like the sound after using
them for a while guess I needed some
more time to let them burn in and you
know overall they sounded stuck it
starts sounding pretty good to me and
it's a pretty good sound experience for
your average consumer I think that
anybody who tries is out is really going
to enjoy them it has a good amount of
bass it has some pretty good sound on
clarity on some points it did sound a
little muddy to me but um overall I do
think that it's a decent experience
they're better than the solo HD is in my
opinion so I definitely think that this
is a decent sound experience when you
know for your average consumer
especially if you like bass they do
offer some good days and they offer some
decent clarity just like I said
sometimes they get a little money so
overall I'm pretty satisfied with the
with the headphones and especially at
their price range alright guys so that
pretty much wraps up my review of the
SOL Republic tracks HDS and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to show you
guys how it looks around the neck on the
ears and like a profile view so you can
kind of know what it might look like
when someone want to summarize it on
when you might have it on you can
imagine a little bit so here it is
around the neck it all looks like this
and you have the two cords dangling here
so you know it might be a little in the
way maybe who knows but this is what it
looks like around the neck and when you
have it on your head here it goes here
kind of these two little interesting
parts sticking out but um and one thing
you have to make note of is that you
have to make sure that these are that
your curves are exactly symmetrical
because it might look a little funky if
you have a like one leaning too too low
so you got to be mindful of that
and you know dice pretty much this is
the front look and this is it on the
side over I think they're pretty decent
looking headphones can't really complain
I like the way they look so definitely a
little nice thing that these actually
are good looking at phones and pretty
much that's about it for this review
guys overall I think these are a pretty
good pair of headphones especially for
1:30 if if you're on the fence between
these and like solo HDS or something
I wouldn't go against getting these I
would say that these are a pretty good
option against the solo HDS or something
else like that so that pretty much wraps
up this review guys if you enjoyed it
