consumer and I got a lot of boxes again
I let them stack up a bit too much this
time so I've got a lot of stuff to open
here so as usual get your drains get
your snacks
be ready to chill we got some boxes to
open up let's see what we got now let's
be clear guys there are no sponsors on
this video all right
I don't even know why we're over fresh
you get to pick o re with the shadow
okay so this one alright let's see who's
this ha ha no map and we got more cases
let's see that it hey weird um cables
out
alright let's see what we got in terms
of these cases oh oh okay I see what's
going on here so they made these early
they definitely made these early and the
iPhone 8 cases are the iPhone 10 so they
thought the iPhone 10 was gonna be
called iPhone 8 got it so here are all
of the cases we got a couple of card
cases over here a regular leather case
rugged case and some plastic cases with
some little leather prints at the bottom
cool enough I'll have link down below if
you guys are interested all right next
up this guy wears this from Logitech
these are the jaybird freedom twos so
these are brand new I'm not sure if
these even hit the stores yet but these
are the jaybird freedom to us with speed
fit interesting alright so let's see
here so yeah these look a lot like the
originals oh they definitely change the
wingtips so I guess that's what they're
calling speed fit cuz looking at
everything else listed on the box here
there aren't too many things that are
different from the originals so this
second iteration may be the sound
quality might have changed a bit but I
think one of their big things is this
new speed fit for a better fit in the
ear
actually my biggest complaint when I
reviewed the first one that fit was just
not something I was too happy with so
I'm gonna have to test these out and see
if it's a solid change here but I love
j-bird stuff so I'm pretty hyped to try
it out we'll see how it goes now they
actually sent me something else too this
is another one so let's just knock out
all of the j-bird stuff now this is a
bit more interesting
since it's a new product altogether for
them this is the j-bird run now these
are true Wireless sport earbuds so with
these you plug them in your ear - kind
of like air pods for those who aren't
familiar with the true Wireless term I
haven't seen any information about these
so this is gonna be completely new to me
I'm just curious what the battery life
is like for hours so that's pretty
standard sweat proof water resistant
cool let's open them up all right so the
j-bird runs let's see what these look oh
they come in a cool little case oh I
like this well of course the little
earbuds usually come in a charging case
so this is where you charge them up are
they talking all right
okay fully charged yes you are
that's cool oh man okay and they
actually fit pretty easily - very solid
oh I cannot even wear ear pods they
instantly fall out the second I move so
those are for me these might be a better
option how much do these go for I don't
know but I'll have it thrown up
somewhere that's how much they're gonna
cost now these I am really excited about
what do they charge with micro USB all
right whatever it's still cool though
next up we've got some stuff from Amazon
this is rat power
Oh were they sending me some different
Amazon let's see what this is a wall
adapter this is a regular wall and was
this microUSB a break isn't that a
little cable here a braided cable oh I
feel like there are so many products
here that I just have no clue where they
came from hold on we got something else
in here guys
oh okay they did send this to me I
completely forgot about this this is a
wireless charging pad so it has fast
charge enabled so that's why it has this
I just look like a regular fast charging
brick but it's a wireless charger cool
it's a pretty small profile to has a
grip on the top so if your phone
supports fast wireless charging maybe
like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or the s8
you got those options here huh so this
here is a bit faster than your standard
wireless charging
I think Samsung sells an option as well
but this is cool because I really like
the design here very nice and compact I
feel like we're gonna see an explosion
of fast wireless chargers coming in the
future thanks to Apple so let's see here
I don't know why this is the evil one
true wireless headphones more wireless
headphones okay I have no clue who sent
this to me this is what they look like
they're black and gold that's
interesting I have never heard of this
company before we'll see later if it's
any good if it's any good you'll see it
in another video but a evo one okay or
Amazon boxes Oh baby this is what I was
waiting for right here yeah now it's
just a little bit ago but here it is the
sony MDR 1000 knots nice it's got a new
name I think the WH 1000 X mark 2 now
you guys know I called the 1000 the
original 1000 X probably the most
advanced headphones out and they came
out with a new version
does this even come with a case this box
is super small
oh that's come with a case nice oh this
is a very low profile case
I like this like this a lot alright so
here we are so these are the 1000 X mark
- and they do look a bit different so
this is the black version but it's got
more of a silver hinge and outlining
here on the headband still looks pretty
classy I think I think it looks pretty
good still the ear cups might be a
little slightly deeper I can dig it I
can dig it so a couple of the cool
features that this thing has now is that
it can now work with your voice
assistance or whether it's Google
assistant or Siri it should be able to
work with those it also has a quick
charge feature so it'll charge in about
10 minutes and give you about 70 minutes
of music playback and this thing has 30
hours of music playback as a battery
life so that is really really solid
usually you see around 20 21 22 but 30
hours is legit so I'm gonna have to give
these a whirl and see how they sound
but I am hype for these how could do you
upgrade the 1000s it's nice oh my god
man that they suck
and the homies over at Razer sent a
little more goodness what'd you send me
Razer so here we've got a new controller
this is for the Xbox one and Windows 10
this is the Razer Wolverine ultimate huh
that's a big name to live up to can
anybody just call themselves Wolverine
you know let's see the Wolverine
ultimate oh it comes with a nice little
case it kind of reminds me of the Xbox
elite van controller oh this is solid
this looks nice
clicky I like that oh I really like that
so if you're used to having that tactile
feel from your keyboard when you're
playing your PC
games you can expect that from this as
well of course since Razer made it it
makes sense I'm sure there's a ton of
RGB lights on this guy so we'll throw up
some b-roll so that you guys can see it
and over here has like a little quick
control panel so that you can do all
kinds of stuff like you know control
your volume you and a bunch of other
stuff so this is cool it's even got
these nice little triggers in the back
so if you need access to even more
controls boom dang there's like you need
all fingers to play with this and you
can actually remove this part right here
and swap it in for a d-pad if you like
so swappable just like the elite
controller this is cool this might be
what I keep next to the gaming PC if I
ever get that thing back let's see
alright so here we've got a couple of
things that work with the apple homekit
so for those of you who aren't familiar
the iPhones are iPads all those things
have apple homekit enabled so that you
can use smart home accessories with your
device so you don't need an Amazon echo
or a Google home you can just use these
things and your phone so if you guys are
interested in seeing some kind of setup
or figuring out how to actually set up a
smart home just based on your phone let
me know I could give it a shot
see if we can make Siri command the
whole smart home oh so this is from
nomads - I was actually really excited
for these these are USB see cables so
now we've got a couple of different
options you got a universal USB see
pretty similar to what they already have
and I've shown on the channel but this
one is a lot smaller so now you can use
this to keep your portable charger close
to your phone and not have to worry
about a huge cable dangling while you
use it I'm actually really excited for
this this is nice now the other one is a
four and one USBC cable with this you
have a USB adapter so this can plug into
a wall outlet or maybe a computer and
under it USBC so
if you want to cover both ends you know
you got both ends yeah us be seeing us
be a and on this side you got a microUSB
and you've also got a USB type-c it
would have been cool if they had a
lightning adapter on here as well that
way you can use it for fast charging
with the new iPhones but uh you have
these options which is cool enough and
for this guy I cannot believe I waited
so long to unbox this you guys know you
might know I'm a little Gundam crazy so
I got my boy truth Oh a little I got my
boy curio vent or over on instagram to
make another one of those custom builds
for me this guy makes insanely good
stuff with Gundam so if you guys are
interested in custom builds definitely
follow that man I'll have his link down
below in the description but let's see
what I got him to build this time home
hype alright so lets us in a ton of
bubble wrap I forgot and I gotta put
this thing together can we stop the
video for a second talk about
extravagant this thing is insane this is
it is extra is over-the-top but that's
what this guy does you make some insane
stuff this is the new Gundam oh I'm
telling you guys he killed this for any
of you who are familiar with this Gundam
you know it looks nothing like this
typically oh it looks amazing I'm gonna
have to boot somebody out this guy's
getting somebody spot but he's got the
UAC colors going oh he looks awesome
jeez dang that looks dope and not to
mention this thing glows in the dark
yeah he's painted it you can't even tell
but he's painted it in certain areas
where he glows in the dark
octoling some beer also you guys to see
that but that's just what this guy does
he makes some insane stuff I'm so height
this is like the mascot this is gonna be
the mascot for the UAC studio alright so
we just got a few left
I just want to go mess around with that
Gundam some more but the show must go on
let's see this is the last no there's
more Amazon boxes so let's see the heck
is this the cosmo o----
didn't we order this a while back oh my
god okay this is a little robot for a
video that we were going to do we never
got to it okay so what is this you
ordered this right so what is do you
remember
alright well alright well we'll mess
around with it if it's cool you might
see it again in another video
wait this is the how are we ordering
things I'm forgetting oh let's see let's
see yeah you're right you're right so
over here we have this convertible drone
guys it goes from drones art like to a
car once you just swap out these a
little things at the top Wow okay this
listen this happens sometimes you order
stuff for videos and then you lose track
of it because you're working on another
video and then ah but like I said with
the other one if this is cool at all
we'll let you guys know this is giant
box and it was so anticlimactic y'all
come on alright and this last one this
is the last box what is in finally being
I hope we end off with a bang alright
if not we'll cut we'll cut all this out
and on the gun down this I don't have
high hopes guys I don't know what this
is this is the Roku 4
the Roku 4 4k Ultra HD so there's a 4k
version and yeah this is a straight-up
Roku 4 it's right here so there's a 4k
option available for Roku this is a
set-top box I'd guess I've never even
used a Roku before so should be
interesting and that about wraps up our
video guys hopefully you enjoyed
definitely let us know what was the most
interesting what you guys want to see in
a future video again sorry about it
being out of focus
hopefully you stuck around this long but
uh let us know in the comments we'll
catch you guys in the next one until
then it's your average consumer peace
