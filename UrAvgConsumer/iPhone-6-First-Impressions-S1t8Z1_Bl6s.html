consumer and today we're going to be
taking a first look at what could
possibly be the new iPhone 6 now I want
to give a huge shout out to my friend
sunny Dixon who helped me get my hands
on this and if you guys want to check
him out you can find all his links down
below in the description and he's been
pretty spot-on with some information
about Apple products before they've been
released in the past so you guys
definitely might want to check him out
if you want to learn more stuff about
Apple products before they're announced
but let's not waste any time let's get
right into it and all right guys just
want to start off with the disclaimer
that the iPhone 6 is not guaranteed to
look like this
all Apple is very secretive about what
their products will look like until
they're actually announced but Sonny
Dixon has been pretty reliable in the
past with information and scoops on the
new products so hopefully this is really
close to it or this is probably it now
let's take a look at the actual phone
itself now this has a 4.7 inch display
which means a larger screen now the old
iPhone 5 and 5s had a 4-inch display and
this one looks like is going to be 4.7
inches and there might possibly be a 5.5
inch version as well I'm not sure if
that one's actually going to come into
existence that is a pretty large phone
for Apple to come out with so I'd be
very surprised if that one came in to
fruition but this is touting a 4.7 inch
display which means it's going to be a
longer phone and slightly wider but it
still feels very comfortable in the hand
I actually have no problem holding this
and it actually shows a large
resemblance to the iPod Touch 5th
generation now the iPod Touch 5th
generation kind of started the design
trend of having the rounded corners
instead of those sharp edges the iPod
Touch four generation started that and
then it was followed by the iPad Mini
and then the iPad air and iPad Mini 2
and now possibly the iPhone 6 even
looking at the volume buttons you can
see that it no longer has those rounded
buttons with the plus and minus on it
now it has those oval shaped buttons
that are similar to the iPod Touch as
well as the iPad and the iPad Mini and
another interesting move is that the
power button is no longer on the top of
the phone and it is now on the right
side and you'll see this typically with
larger Android devices and that's
because it's just easier to handle that
way when the power button is all the way
at the top is a little harder to reach
and you can see that with the HTC One m8
it actually is a very tall phone and the
power button is at the top and I had
trouble getting to the power button a
couple of times so it's very annoying so
I think Apple's trying to avoid that
altogether since this is a telephone
that and everyone is accustomed to now
speaking about the HTC One m8 if you
take a look at the back of the iPhone 6
it looks very very similar it's actually
very shocking if Apple does follow this
design cue its gonna look very much like
the HTC One m8 and it's gonna be very
very interesting because Apple's usually
like the trendsetter they don't usually
follow design cues from any phone out
there but it looks like it could be a
direct copy to a lot of people's eyes so
it'd be very interesting to see if Apple
does go with this design pattern because
a lot of people will call them copycats
but still at the bottom of the phone
you're gonna find your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack your lightning connector
as well as a speaker it would have been
cool to see Apple introduced stereo
speakers or something but it looks like
it's gonna follow the traditional one
speaker on the iPhone design now I want
to know what you guys think of this
design personally I think it feels
pretty nice in the hand
I like the larger display my only
concern is that it's actually really
thin and it might be a little slippery
similar to the HTC One m8 I have the
iPod Touch 5th generation and I never
like holding that without a case because
it always felt like I could break it or
it would slip right out my hand fall so
my only concern lies there that it might
just be too slippery it doesn't have
those hard edges to actually really hold
on to but we'll see how that actually
goes when Apple comes out with it
overall nice design I think it's a
pretty good look it just really looks
like an iPod Touch 5th generation and
HTC One m8 hybrid so we're gonna see
what Apple does I'm pretty interested
but like I said I want to know what you
guys think of it down below and I'll
catch you guys in the next video if you
enjoyed this be the cool guy that hit
the thumbs up button and subscribe to
the channel for more content from me and
definitely stay tuned for a special
video I have with this mock-up and I'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
