and today we're gonna be taking a look
at the North Face access pack in a new
series I like to call dope or no now
when this guy was first announced I was
super hyped because you guys know how I
feel about backpacks and North Face was
making a tech oriented version which is
really cool because North Face has quite
the history with making backpacks I've
owned a few myself but let's take a look
at the design of this guy if you look
here you'll probably think it looks like
a shelf which you'd be right because
this guy has a built in frame that gives
it this structure as well as a special
way of opening up when you want to get
inside now even though this guy's a bit
on the big side one thing that I do like
about this is that it still looks really
really sleek as you can see there are no
compartments or pockets that you can
seal on this guy which gives it a really
nice sweet look now I'm a big fan of the
design here the size are made out of a
denim material with this ingrained
honeycomb look going for it and you
actually have this ribbed look going in
the front it's all black and of course
they've got the North Face the logo up
here but in the back you've got pretty
much the same thing going on you've got
some of that denim you've got some
padding for your back so it can be very
comfortable and one thing I can say even
though this is big it is comfortable one
thing that you guys might notice is that
without any real side pockets that means
you don't have anything to hold a bottle
of water which to me not really a big
deal since I never really carried water
within my backpacks but I know that's a
big criteria for a lot of you guys so I
know that might be a deal-breaker for a
few of you but enough of that let's take
a look at what makes this guy special
and let's take a look inside now when
you want to open this guy up you're
gonna notice that there's a little latch
at the top and this is where things get
kind of cool you just hit the latch and
watch boom now this is hands down the
coolest feature of the access pack and
then this is where you store everything
so when you're taking a look inside you
see you've got this mustard-colored
lining and it actually has this
it's in the compartments so you can pack
all your tech and a really awesome
feature with the pockets and linings in
here is that they've all got these
little tabs with each tab you can kind
of pull it up problem number one they
don't always work so you're supposed to
be able to just pull it up and then pop
out whatever item is inside of here but
like I said they don't always work some
work better than others
this guy right here as you can see I
just pulled it up
I've access to my phone just like that
that one works but this tablet one not
so much
I always have to just pull out my tablet
whenever I need it it's not prevent
suicide but this is what it's supposed
to do now they've got a couple of parts
two parts to hold some phones one bigger
than the other because some phones are
bigger than others nowadays so you got
two of those which is really cool so
pick and choose which side you want to
use you've also got some slots for your
pens and pencils so you guys go into
school can use these and you've got a
spot for of course books and I of course
have have to have my tech survival kit
so that's with me now I've also got this
little zipper right here
where it doesn't hold much but can take
a couple more pens you can got a little
flash drive that I like to carry around
at the very top where the shell opens up
got a booster board controller and this
little compartment that holds the cables
for whatever devices I might bring
around with me but that's about it don't
really have space for much more than
this you guys know that I typically
carry way more than we're looking at
right here on this desk and that's my
biggest issue with the access pack this
guy is pretty gigantic but that's all
the framing that gives this guide
structure and the ability to do this and
you know little things like that takes
up all the space to really get this
thing as packed as I would like it's
cool that this thing has specific spots
for things like your phone
your tablet but if you're someone who's
not very organized and you just like to
throw your things inside it's very
limiting and it doesn't offer a ton of
space for you to be able to do that
which I have a problem with now another
drawback is that you got two little
pockets over here on the sides and you
can put things like your macbook charger
about or let's see I've got some earbuds
but you've got stuff like this which is
cool but this these pockets actually
take away from the space inside which
was already limited now in the back
where you store your laptop you actually
can open this guy up just from the top
and there's another little tab here but
you can go just like this and you've got
access to your macbook which is a cool
feature yeah but I'm not really sure how
practical it is I can kind of just open
this up all the way and pull it out
without it being a big deal so I mean
it's it's nice to have I guess but it
doesn't really add to the functionality
here you've also got one more little
slot in the back where you can store
something else like a small flash a hard
drive solid-state drive you know I'm
talking about ok so you can do that and
honestly guys that is all that I can
carry in this backpack this is nothing
compared to what I can carry in a
backpack that I got from Amazon for 25
bucks
this guy details for 235 and yes I do
like the fact that it has the structure
that will protect your tech and it gives
it this cool little opening but it
really does take away from what you can
actually do with the backpack so when it
comes to doping though I'm gonna have to
give this guy a nope I don't think it's
worth the money I think that maybe the
next generation if North Face pursues it
can be a lot better there are some
things that they can improve upon I
don't recommend you guys buying it I've
used quite a few backpacks in the past
and I'll have links down below if you
want to check out those backpacks those
are all solid option
this one I can't say it is I was hoping
I would be the next guy backpack but not
so much but that about wraps it up guys
