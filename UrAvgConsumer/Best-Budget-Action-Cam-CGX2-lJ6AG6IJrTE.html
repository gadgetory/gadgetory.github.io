gear reached out to me to let you guys
know that if you're on the market for an
action cam but don't want to break the
bank then look no further now let's
check out the CG x2 we're looking at a
12 megapixel camera with a built-in LCD
screen which is really nice as you won't
always find a built-in screen on cameras
like these this is perfect for watching
playback of your shots to make sure you
nailed it without having to throw your
SD card into a computer it's shooting
with a 180 degree wide angle lens to are
going to be able to fit a lot into the
shot this thing records in 1080p at up
to 60 frames per second and can even go
up to 4k but only at 10 frames per
second it also has built-in Wi-Fi so you
can use its iOS and Android app as a
viewfinder or remote using the phone as
a viewfinder is actually pretty useful
since there's little delay between
what's going on and what's displayed on
the screen and with a range of 30 meters
it can get pretty far without having to
worry about losing your connection
navigating the menus is pretty simple
but I found out with action cams having
so few buttons it's actually useful to
check out the manual to get up to speed
a bit faster this thing isn't just
budget-friendly it's also packed with a
wide range of accessories that'll up
your recording game and this is where
the real value comes in from picking
this up whether you need to record
underwater attach this thing to a bike
or car there's plenty of gear included
so you can get a nice angle and shot you
of course get a waterproof case a 32
gigabyte microSD card which is a nice
inclusion a battery that you can access
by taking off the faceplate of the
camera a wearable remote so you can hit
record or take a picture from a distance
and you also get a bike mount helmet
mount a few adapters and arms and a
couple of buckles to lock it in place
when using the included adhesives
not to mention you'll be able to attach
the quarter inch thread to the base of
the CG x2 which I found to be pretty
useful when using some of the gear I
already own I like that there are so
many accessories that are included as
they usually drive up the over
cost of other action cams and if there's
any particular accessory that you might
need that's not included with this you
can actually pick it up and this is
compatible with many of the accessories
already on the market now let's talk
about actually using this thing you've
got a couple of modes such as the
standard recording a normal camera for
taking pics slow-motion time lapse even
motion detection and a cool diving mode
for those of you who plan to use this
underwater diving mode actually allows
for automatic exposure and white balance
controls so you don't have to worry
about fixing it imposed this is
definitely handy since it's hard to know
what the best settings might be before
you dive on the water but now enough
about how this thing works check out
some real shots I was able to pull off
with this thing
and that about wraps it up for this
video guys as I mentioned before the
siege x2 is a nice budget-friendly
option if you're on the market for an
action cam and you don't want to spend a
ton on a camera or a bunch of
accessories but what do you guys think
of the footage from the CG x2 let me
know in the comments down below and if
you enjoyed this video be the cool guy
that gives it a thumbs up and big things
to Cyclops gear for making this possible
