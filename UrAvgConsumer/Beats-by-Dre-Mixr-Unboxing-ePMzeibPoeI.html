today we have the new beats by dre the
mixer I think these are really new and I
just picked them up from Best Buy
figured I was gonna try and I think this
retails at about two 49.99 and yeah it's
really great I've never actually seen it
in person
so I'm gonna open it up and see it for
the first time I've only seen like a
pictures of it on the website so maybe
I'll give you guys some insight on what
it looks like
now I'm not sure what these are wrong if
they're like the studios or the solos to
be sure they're not like the pros not at
the price frames at 2:49 39 I'm assuming
some between the studios and the solos
okay so the packaging is definitely
different oh well that's interesting
this looks like a soft and easy but it's
actually pretty hard good things as it
rolled off like that and the packaging
is a bit different compared to like
other comes with a black microfiber
cloth I guess is the user guide and
warranty information have some
interesting yeah
just warnings and stuff like that so
pretty basic stuff just slightly
different packaging I guess since it's
newer it has to be on both sides there's
actually good really nice packaging I
really like this we always know that you
know that beat things does well little
package me Wow
well it comes with these headphones
they're like the I think the pros have
something like this like I won't bring
this end up solo things like that it has
a new a new monster a new monster cable
for the headphones with control talk
solve that up and show you guys and your
headphones themselves very interesting
full design I think you can okay thank
you turn it and you can put adjust it
like this very interesting these feel
they're smaller they're much much more
than I expected much smaller and this is
made of an interesting material it's
kind of like as hard as very hard I
don't want to say rock look obviously
it's not rock but it's something really
tough nothing like I've seen the bees
used before kind of feels met maybe a
little like a mesh covered metal or
something I don't know
these actually feel really sturdy I
think they are pretty sturdy um here you
can see the cord hanging out on the side
I think that's like
how they wanted it and these are I guess
obviously these are over here so they'll
kind of be like the solos yeah
definitely it's really tight since these
are so small that's really a tight feel
um
the coding is not that you know it has a
soft coating inside just like you know
most of the headphones have is
definitely a mix between the pros and
this so the studio each that this video
I'm sorry the solo HD ders it's
definitely like it honestly feels like a
hybrid between the two so I don't know
such as far as sound quality and it also
has the two headphone parts I guess so
you can put two headphones in there or I
guess if you want to share with someone
else what you're listening to other
that's a feature that the pros have so
it's very interesting that they you know
brought it down to this this is the new
you still you know still very
monster-like
thick and it's got the right closer and
you can see what like focus all right
there we go so it's very different it
has the little beam back yeah this is
very nice actually there's very nice
cable hmm and it really maxes well with
the the headphones well yeah this is
great you know the other headphones
right here I don't know if this is
exactly like the pros I haven't used the
pros before but what this is like okay
this can be taken off I don't know if
this can be taken off completely I guess
these are meant to be like DJ s
headphone since I guess the UM it's
endorsed by DJ so these are the other
headphones that come with it this one
does not have control talk on it and
it's obviously made to go longer so I'll
definitely have a review up on these bad
boys as soon as possible so you know I
want you guys to stay tuned I'll let you
know how they sound in comparison to the
solos and you know all the other
products that are currently out and if
you guys don't mind just please feel
free to rate comment asking questions

appreciate that and I appreciate any
feedback you guys might have and let me
know if you want to see me

would want to see alright that's javis
