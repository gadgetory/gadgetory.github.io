consumer and today I'm gonna be doing a
review for you guys of the iPad Mini so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
so here we have the iPad Mini Apple's
answer to the 7 inch tablet war although
this tablet is slightly bigger than 7
inches coming in at 7.9 inches but it
still holds true that small form-factor
that all the others have the design of
the meaning is very nice and quite
similar to the fifth-generation iPod
touch this does look a lot like it and
it's pretty much a scaled up version but
this definitely isn't a bad thing as I'm
a fan of the look and feel of both these
devices the edges are pretty comfortable
to hold in one hand but I must warn
those with smaller hands ladies that it
might not be so easy to get in that one
hand the mini features a 5 megapixel
rear camera as well as a FaceTime HD
front-facing camera I am a bit
disappointed that the rear camera
doesn't come with a built in flash
especially since the iPod Touch was able
to come with one although it almost
seems taboo to take pictures with a
tablet the iPad meaning does fairly well
with still shots and recording in 1080p
so you can have confidence there if you
plan to use it one of the greatest
aspects of having the mini instead of
the regular iPad is of course its
portability the smaller size means it's
easier to travel with and simply take
with you around the house it's perfectly
sized for taking to bed and reading or
watching a movie at night you can expect
to have the standard iOS tablet
experience with the mini although
smaller this will still function the
same way as a full-sized iPad this is
often referred to as the smaller version
of the iPad 2 and while that may be true
that doesn't necessarily mean it has
poor performance in regular everyday use
you will probably be very satisfied with
the speed of the mini and even the
screen resolution of course putting in
side by side with one of the newer iPads
will reveal its flaws but outside of
that scenario your average consumer
we'll be just fine with it and probably
won't notice anything wrong with the
minis performance
I found gaming and watching movies to be
quite pleasant despite the lower specs
of this tablet it doesn't come with a
Retina display but I don't think that's
a huge flaw at all considering its size
but if it's something that really
matters to you I'm sure Apple will be
able to implement this in the next
version of the meaning next year that
being said those who don't care about
Retina display or having the latest
processor should feel confident in
purchasing the Mini as it's a great
option and comes in at a much lower cost
and Apple's current iPads although it
does have some big competition with the
Nexus 7 in the value Department overall
I would recommend this as a first tablet
or even an option over the bigger ones
due to the form factor alone the
convenience is having a tablet this size
is something that shouldn't be glanced
over when making your purchasing
decision and that about wraps up my
review for the iPad Mini I hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did please feel
