is the razor phone - this is their
second iteration of their gaming phone
which made quite a splash last year
considering it was their very first
phone ever
design-wise it shares a lot of
similarities to the first one the
overall shape is unchanged and we still
have the same volume buttons on the left
side as well as a fingerprint scanner
and power button on the right it also
still has those massive speaker girls up
front for amazing sound quality from the
speakers packed with dual amplifiers the
razor actually found a way to make this
phone I p67 water-resistant without
taking a hit to their sound quality or
Dolby Atmos certification which is a big
part of the identity of this phone and I
did get a chance to listen to it I gotta
say they did a good job at keeping the
speakers really nice and loud and clear
but of course you guys know we got to do
some real day in the life testing to see
how it stacks up in the real world and
it also still has that 5.7 inch quad HD
display with a 120 Hertz refresh rate
that razor calls their ultra motion
technology and I will tell you guys it
still looks really good this is one of
those features that you hear about you
hear that it sounds good but you don't
really appreciate until you see it in
person not to mention having a display
like this is great for gaming and they
were also able to increase the
brightness of the screen by 50% which is
a pretty drastic change but very
welcomed but now we got to talk about
the showstopper on this phone and that's
in the back so they actually managed to
get the Razer chroma system inside of
the Razer phone too so now it has RGB
lights right under the logo so that it
can be customized to any color you'd
like and even offer some different
effects if you want to switch it up
they've also included this app that
allows you to change all kinds of
settings from the colors to the battery
consumption but I know personally I'm
gonna have that thing at max brightness
breathing teal but they did make this
light useful beyond being able to match
your outfit for the day with colored
notifications so with this the Razer
logo will light up when you get a
notification with a color matching the
corresponding app that it's getting the
notification from so for Gmail the thing
will turn red if it's something like
Facebook blue you get the picture now
you might also notice that the back of
the phone is all glass which allows the
phone to finally have wireless charging
and with Razer being Razer they also
drop an accessory for the phone which is
their first chroma wireless charger and
the lights at the bottom here
cool of course but it matches the same
kind of functionality that you'll see in
the back of the razor phone logo this is
a pretty cool dock in my opinion but I
am an RGB lover so if you're not you can
always turn them off and while we're on
the topic of charging the razor phone
too is packing a 4000 milliamp hour
battery which is pretty much the same as
last year
which had a stellar stellar battery life
of course I always want a bigger and
better battery but this is one speck
that didn't really need any tweaking
especially considering this phone comes
with quick charge for plus that'll get
you from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes
now we've talked a lot about the
physical attributes but let's touch on
some specs this phone is powered by a
Snapdragon a 45 processor which Razer is
claiming will provide a 30% increase in
performance coupled with their new vapor
chamber cooling system this chamber is
supposed to help heat dissipate through
out the body of the phone so that he
isn't concentrated in one area which
allows for better cooling so basically
when gaming or doing anything intensive
we shouldn't be getting any hot spots or
have our games stutter due to throttling
so that's one of those things that we're
gonna have to test in the real world I
happen to play a lot of games on my
phone so you can definitely expect me to
put this phone through its paces they
also introduced this app called Razer
cortex which helps users organize their
games and the settings of those games
this way the phone can determine the
best settings for you or if you want to
go all out in your gaming or maybe even
bring it down enough to conserve on
battery you can have that done here by
choosing which aspects of the game you
want to enhance or sacrifice this could
be pretty cool if you're a really
hardcore mobile gamer and in terms of
other specs we're looking at 8 gigs of
ram 64 gigs of storage with expandable
memory and you also get dual rear
cameras with 12 megapixel shooters and
an 8 megapixel shooter up front now I
gave the original phone some heat for
not having the best camera out there but
the guys at Ranger did tell me that they
re engineered their software from the
ground up as well as change the sensor
from a Samsung sensor over to a Sony
sensor so another one of those things
that we really got a test I'm hoping
they improved it because if they did we
might have a killer phone on our hands
of course there's no longer a headphone
jack but the packaging does include an
adapter with a 24 bit DAC so you can
plug into your headphones
along with that quick charge for plus
wall adapter I feel like Razer came out
the gate swinging with their
phone and is typically hard to keep up
that kind of momentum when you first
come out but they did a good job by
adding some substantial updates here
that I think a lot of people will be
happy with and wireless charging is
definitely a win but you can absolutely
expect to see some fingerprints on that
glass back they will have this
limited-edition version that's going to
have a different material in the back
which is gonna have an anti fingerprint
material but I didn't get to see that
version but it will be coming out this
thing is starting at $7.99 and if you
guys want to learn more I'll have links
down below in the description so you can
check it out but that about wraps it up
for this video guys I think the razor
phone does a really good job at checking
a lot of boxes and I can't wait to get
my hands on it and really see if it
keeps up with all of the claims that
razor made let me know in the comments
down below what you think of the razor
phone but till the next one is your
average consumer case and also those
thumbs up man I need more likes on my
youtube video then I get on Instagram
