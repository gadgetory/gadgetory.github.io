backpack video you might have seen me
mention this guy my tech survival did
I designed this kit to help in any tech
emergency you might come across and just
be a super useful fallback option in a
lot of everyday situations so first
things first we've got everything housed
in this amazonbasics Universal travel
case which has a hard shell that should
protect your stuff inside as well as
provide a bunch of slots and pockets to
help keep everything organized Amazon
sell these for like 10 bucks so it's
pretty inexpensive and I did my best to
keep the cost of every item featured in
this video pretty low mainly under 20
bucks so that this thing can be built up
by anybody who's interested now inside
the cases where we get the actual
goodies in the top left corner here I
have the Belkin surge plus USB swivel
charger now this is a tiny surge
protector that turns one outlet into
three and also includes two 2.1 amp USB
ports and these ports have enough power
to charge your phones or anything else
pretty quickly
another nice bonus of the surge plus is
this swivel that allows you to place it
on an outlet without disrupting anything
else that may already be plugged in this
is perfect if you're like me and carry a
ton of tech in your backpack that may
need to be plugged in but you aren't
somewhere with convenient charging
options like an airport or even a coffee
shop like Starbucks now what if you
don't have access to an outlet don't
worry I got you this aki twelve thousand
milliamp portable charger will give you
juice on the go it has a compact
chocolate bar form factor which makes it
easy to stick in a pocket and two USB
port so you can charge multiple devices
simultaneously and it's cool because
these USB ports can also detect the
fastest capacity your device can charge
at and will output up to 3.4 m/s which
is great but don't get this confused
with quick charge at 12,000 milliamp
you can expect to charge your phone at
least three to five times depending on
your model of course a portable charger
like this is essential to a survival kit
since it's all about keeping your phone
and other gadgets live no matter where
you are and it has a built-in flashlight
because why not who knows when you'll
need it now we've been talking about
keeping your tech alive but you'll need
a solid cable to do this so I've got
this three and one USB cable by smell
ISM sitting in the top right pouch it's
a micro USB Lightning and USB type-c
cable all wrapped in one
is a tangle-free cable with a protective
net over it that adds to its durability
and it also makes it feel quite premium
so no matter what phone you're rocking
or if you're bringing around multiple
devices made by different manufacturers
this thing's got you covered and if
someone asked to borrow a USB cable to
charge their phone you don't have to
worry about what phone they've got sends
you know this will have them covered to
uber drivers take note and you ever
wanted to bum some music or a movie off
of a friend but didn't have anywhere to
put the files well I've got some super
compact flash drives in here with about
64 gigs so you can copy and transfer
files to your heart's content while
these are super useful to have around
you're probably wondering was so special
about carrying compact flash drives well
check this out with the flip of a switch
you can bring out a micro USB that can
be plugged into a device that supports
it like most Android phones so you don't
have to wait till you get home to watch
or listen to that fresh content you just
got and hey if your phone doesn't
support SD cards this is a solid and
really inexpensive way to boost your
phone storage whenever you need it
without adding a ton of bulk and for you
Nexus m1 plus 2 owners I found the tiny
USB type-c option for you as well no
love for Apple though at the bottom here
you've got some basic earbuds from
Amazon and when I say basic I mean basic
but these aren't here so you can have an
all-out jamming session these are more
like emergency earbuds for those times
when you forget your real headphones or
earbuds or maybe you're on a train or
plane and you've got that kid who's
crying or just making too much noise pop
these out and you can be listening to
something much more pleasant it's also
very useful if you're out and you see a
pretty interesting video on your phone
but you're struggling to hear it because
of all the background noise or maybe
you're somewhere really quiet and you
don't want to be the guy that disturbs
everyone I've also included a cheap
headphone splitter if you want to share
whatever you're watching or listening to
with someone you've gotten your by
behind this flap we've got the Google
chromecast and chromecast Audio the most
expensive parts of this kit and that is
saying a lot for those not familiar with
chromecast you can stream videos from
your phone tablet or computer straight
to an HDTV or monitor
use of Wi-Fi these aren't completely
necessary to the kit but I feel like you
should always have some backup
entertainment when you're visiting
somewhere that might not be equipped
with a Smart TV or a set-top box like
the Roku or Apple TV so think grandma's
house or even a hotel room although
hotel rooms are a bit tricky since need
a Wi-Fi connection to get the chromecast
going but there are definitely some ways
to do it this can save you from boredom
or even make it a lot easier to share
something you saw online without having
a bunch of people huddled over your
phone not to mention there's chromecast
Audio which is a nice option to have are
you the man when you have the Aqsa cord
in hand well with this you can be the DJ
that comes to the rescue even if you're
not home all you have to do is plug in
the chromecast Audio to an auxiliary
port on some speakers and can control
the speakers and play your favorite
playlists and tunes and the last piece
to the tech survival kit is this travel
ready microfiber cloth if you know me
you shouldn't be surprised now this can
go on a keychain which I personally
think is an awesome place to put this or
you can keep it in the survival kit
there are plenty of times where I've
needed to clean a screen and by simply
having my keys or the survival kit with
me I've been able to do it microfiber
cloth junkies like me will love having
this around trust me and that's it for
my tech survival kit guys I'll have
links to everything mentioned in this
video down below so you can go out and
make your own survival kit and something
I love about this kit is that if you
decide to make it without the chromecast
it'll cost you less than a hundred bucks
on Amazon and I promise you you'll be
surprised by how often the survival kit
will come in handy but hopefully enjoy
this video if you did be the cool guy or
girl that leaves it a thumbs up and let
me know if you plan on making one to
come
down below till the next one guys
