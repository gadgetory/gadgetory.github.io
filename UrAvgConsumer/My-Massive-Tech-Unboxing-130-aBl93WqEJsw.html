going on guys the Traverse consumer and
today we've got another massive tech
unboxing so you know what time it is
go get your drinks get your snacks let's
chill and open up some tech but before
we get started I got to give a huge
shout out to today's sponsor me though
so what we've got over here guys is the
Mevo plus and if you like to livestream
you're gonna want to pay attention so
this is basically a high quality
portable camera with the ability to give
you pro level production tools right
from your smartphone now I've seen a lot
of products that make big claims like
this before but this thing actually
delivers in a very cool way once you've
got your camera set up and your app
going you'll be able to see your field
of view using the camera's wide-angle
lens now where things get pretty
interesting is when you hop into the app
and you can start controlling your shot
quite a bit more than normal
and whenever you want you can just tap
an area to get a really tight shot of
something and you can move that box
around so that it can pan to another
area which is really nice and when
you're working with faces you can track
the face and it'll allow you to move
around and the camera is going to follow
you as if you had another cameraman and
even when you're done with that you can
always just bring it over to a
wide-angle shot and you can even cut to
any part of this whole wide-angle frame
so it can feel like you have multiple
cameras set up in one spot which is
really cool and with this camera you
could do a few different things with it
from just straight-up recording video to
streaming through a bunch of different
social platforms like Facebook periscope
YouTube you name it it's got it and
something that I like about this little
guy is that it has an internal battery
so if you want to stream or anything you
don't have to have it plugged in but of
course you can use it indefinitely when
it is plugged in and there's also some
accessories that you can use with it to
kind of up your recording experience
whether it's the external battery or
even the stand that you can use so you
can have it at the ideal height or this
travel case it's got a lot of options
and like I said if you love streaming or
even just video production this is
something worth looking into it does way
more than I even mentioned today so if
you want to learn more I of course have
links down below in the description all
right so now Ari
do you want to do the honors
oh you are taking way too long
ari do you want to do the honors this
thing okay a backpack Oh talked in my
language
hmm oh oh okay so it can go from like a
duffel bag to a backpack I guess let's
see it's got some compartments this is
so this is like the straight-up
traveling okay so this looks like a
pretty versatile backpack that can turn
into a duffel bag if you need to go
traveling or something so if you want to
switch it up this thing looks like a
pretty solid option I don't know how
it'll do overtime but school concept
what is this a pocket samurai
interesting so this is it's the last
multi-tool you'll ever need twenty-six
functions
oh there are like a ton of blades inside
of here that I let's get rid of that box
cutter that he has and give him
something properties all right let's go
for it so this right here is the bits
blade you can unscrew it oh wow that
looks really sharp and dangerous and
it's got these little bit so if you want
to use it as a screwdriver you've got
that option that's pretty cool oh no so
this is going to be my unboxing knife
for the rest of the video oh no you know
what I'm not even gonna use this because
I got this pocket samurai right here
this is what I have to use obviously the
anime lover and me would not let me use
this instead so I've got my samurai
blade over here this is cool you can
actually put this thing on your keys so
if you happen to use a lot of box
cutters or you know in your profession
you do that this could be a pretty
helpful thing for me it's gonna be
pretty helpful right now so I'm gonna
try it out obviously
the kids watch you should just get
permission their parents first okay mom
it cut that thing like butter
Obed put the old this is cutting it my
samurai oh that's actually really really
cool okay so what is this a digital
radio bluetooth mp3 player recorded this
looks like a radio okay you know it's
tech all kinds of tech makes it on the
channel but this is probably not
something I would use to be honest so
let's keep it moving
oh nice so this is the Thunderbolt 3
dock that I got from El Gato so with
Thunderbolt 3 you get access to a ton of
different options and controls with one
port you can do a lot and with a dock
here you get access to even more so I'm
really excited to plug this thing up to
my macbook or my lg gram so this is the
dock itself this is the elgato
Thunderbolt 3 dock so as you guys can
see here we've got a USB port you've got
a microphone and headphone jack and you
also have an Ethernet port two USB ports
two Thunderbolt ports a display port and
of course the power port and it's pretty
cool that this thing has a display port
it's something you won't find on a
MacBook or any other laptops you usually
find HDMI so that's kind of cool
so this is something I definitely want
to test out quite a bit I'm super glad I
got my hands on it he shot two Elgato
what's in this little box from Japan oh
no this is too small for a Gundam oh
it's a small just double so these are
these little Gundam kids that I've got I
didn't realize I got this this was a
long time ago it took forever to come I
guess since it's from Japan but
tiny Gundams I think they're pretty cool
okay
Aki now love me some oxy gear okay
there's a couple of things inside of
here over here we have a USBC desktop
charging station with power delivery
okay this one has two ports and one
power delivery port dust that's I a 5
watt wireless charging pad and an 18
watt power delivery charger not bad I
gotta find out the prices if this power
delivery charger is inexpensive this
would be a really good option for those
of you who have an iPhone 8 or 8 plus
you can get this guy and set up the one
Apple sells if it's cheap so I'll have
the price down below so you guys can
find out whether or not to get it so
next up I'm gonna go for this big guy
over here player unknown battlegrounds
Xbox one what'd you send me Xbox all
right here we go
interesting well you know let me not put
it on because there might be something
inside okay I can confirm that it's
empty
oh-ho-ho this is where the goodies are
do it it is like the cool canteens so
that you can throw some water in here
there's some survival stuff from pub G
of G one license plate I dare to put
this on the car get pulled over real
quick
and is this the map yeah this is another
map okay so you got the poster on one
side map on the other so that's and this
but there's there's more what's this guy
okay what oh snap what is this like more
camouflage wow wow what is happening
okay
hopefully this mess up my mic this is
interesting there's a mask I don't know
but it's camouflage
cookie doesn't care at all so I'm
supposed to just go and I did a corner
so good okay so I guess this is
something this is a thing that they use
in pub G I'm assuming I haven't played
pub G enough to really know but I guess
this is something that they use as
camouflage so people don't you know get
him killed real quick
but how you like me guys well that has
been the most interesting unboxing I
have ever done hats off to Xbox for
getting that title ok so this is
supposed to be the ultimate grab it
gadget and let's see if this thing
actually works so right here you can see
the claw and I can just pull on this
little lever down here and with that it
does this so I can let's see try and
grab the samurai blade whole that's
pretty cool and I think this is a magnet
a magnetic piece right here - that's
pretty impressive I'll say can you grab
something bigger though oh my Daleks
going through this hole oh okay that's
nice this one we get crazy with it now
no way this is insane are you serious
but can I get this big old box
you know having this baguette it just
has four little prongs here and when you
pull on the lever it just grabs like
anything so of course the ideal way you
would use this thing is like if you got
something behind the couch that fell and
you want to just grab it and what's
pretty cool is that it's got a little
flashlight here as well so if it's dark
you can kind of see what you're grabbing
maybe you're grabbing something under
the couch this is kind of cool are these
LED strips okay so I've got some extra
LED strips I okay I you guys know I love
me some LED strips I am not mad about
this whatsoever I can never have too
many of these I might line something up
with some LEDs now of my mancave you're
right okay so this is the rabbit charger
now what this thing is supposed to be
able to do is allow you to charge
devices multiple devices at once and you
can plug this into your wall outlet and
kind of hide the cable that you use to
charge your devices and it's supposed to
work with both iPhones and Android
devices
so pretty much this is it this is what
you would plug in and then you charge it
like that and then it's a retractable
cable right here this is 28 inches so
you can just plug in whatever you need
to plug right here there are two micro
USBs and so that's why we have two
lightning adapter is over here so if
you've got I phones
you're gonna tug them up interesting
concept and I guess that's how you bring
it back okay and you know what's also
cool about that the fact that you never
have to worry about where your cable is
it's always right there with the outlet
it's kind of nice oh okay a charged sink
USB key chain so you've got a USB port
over here on one side and then a
lightning adapter on the other so you
know if you pick this on your keys
you'll always have a lightning cable on
you to charge up your phone all right
now I want to get something that I know
is here that you guys can clearly see so
these right here are the Logitech g5 60s
they've got RGB lights on them but
let's open this up so the lights on
these are going to react with the games
that you're playing and the music that
you're playing so that should be a
pretty interesting thing to see in
action okay this is a pretty solid size
it looks pretty good right oh and this
is right here where you're gonna see all
those lights so this so what you're
seeing right here you see this big ol
opening right here this is going to make
it so that it really lights up the
background or the wall of your desktop
so I can imagine the light really
dispersing well with this so let's open
this thing all the way up this is a
really tall sub so you got this this is
your micro USB cable that's gonna go
into your PC and these two will go into
your sub so this is a 240 watt speaker
with DTS X so we're gonna be able to get
some good sound quality out of these
hopefully but I'll probably let you guys
know a bit more about these in a future
video but I gotta say I'm pretty excited
to try these out hopefully they're good
a smart way to keep mosquitoes away
interesting so this thing is a
battery-powered repellent you can just
kind of charge it up and you've got the
little refills right here with this what
it does is it heats up the liquid here
and diffuses it into the air that way
there's no you know liquids to deal with
I kind of like that even though there's
a liquid in here you just put the
cartridge inside it heats up and it does
its thing so this is gonna be
interesting a nice little way to check
out the outdoor area of the house this
is gonna be nice especially with summer
coming around okay this is a nice little
bag right here Bezalel latitude iphone x
case iPhone 10 how dare I say iPhone X
that is but you know that is the first
time i've ever said i phone x
think'll take away my tech reviewer card
Wow okay so here we have the case and
this is a magnetic case and it works
with this wireless charging pod and then
it's also got a stand alright so that's
pretty cool but now on to our last
it's a big old box to this samurai sword
is crazy to come in the edo era of japan
in my nerd sideshow oh right we're right
right right right so this is a charging
station by Belkin now you guys know
there's a lot of devices here things
that need to be charged all the time and
it's always a hassle to try and find a
charger this is really big though it's
massive like this thing needs its own
area oh this could be really cool be
with like laptops and all kinds because
this is not just like USB ports you can
have full-blown like wall adapters and
wall charges that go right into this I
have no idea where I'm putting this
thing though this is this is really big
but that is it guys this is the hall
Microsoft with the camouflage - that was
something
but hopefully enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that gives video a
thumbs up be careful if you get yourself
a samurai blade this thing is Oh total
next one guys Travis consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
