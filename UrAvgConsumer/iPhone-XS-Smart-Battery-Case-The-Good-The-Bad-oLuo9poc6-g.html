iPhone 10s 10s max and 10 R and if you
saw my last massive tech unboxing you
saw I got my hands on the one for the
10s Max and I re immediately picked up
the one for the 10s and we figured we
test it out and spend the day with it
and answer a few burning questions that
we had about it like does it work for
the iPhone 10 or does it fast charge but
I read that this janky unboxing you guys
can check it out so if you saw the
latest massive tech unboxing that you
saw Jed get this you saw him get this a
battery case and actually right there
while we were filming I probably ordered
one for myself and I finally came so
let's open it is also shout out so
people who don't have a camera man
everyday unboxing is tough look at it
there it goes
so this is how it looks you know rubbery
like the last one kind of has some kind
of texture
you just pop this back and put it in
like it's showing here obviously I can't
do that right now because I am actually
filming with my phone but next I will
charge this thing up and then we'll do a
full day and life is so exciting so that
night good morning it was like 3:00 a.m.
he took the phone and put it inside of
the case through that sucker on a fast
charger and put his timer for like 30
minutes just because we wanted to see
how fast it would charge since it
charges both the case and the phone
simultaneously and after about 30
minutes her phone went from thirty five
percent to 77 percent and the case went
from zero to 50 percent which is like
the perfect result but you know of
course we got to see how it held up
throughout the actual day so checking in
it is 1134 and Mike so is 1134 and I'm
still at 100% so my phone's at a hundred
percent and my battery case is actually
at is that 79 percent which is so good
so I have about an hour and 17 minutes
of screen on time I've started my day
around 8:30 I've been on Instagram
tweeting doing a bunch of different
things using the camera app and it's
okay battery case great so those weren't
such bad results for around lunchtime my
10s max case had about 81% while Aerys
had 79 and we were also wondering how
does this thing actually fit with the
iPhone 10 and luckily one of our guys
had a 10 on him so we tried it out and
this is what we saw all right so we got
Malcolm over here and he has an iPhone
10 right 10 you know let's see if the
10s case will work for it if it's like a
glove well yeah yeah this works
perfectly for the 10 all right would you
buy it when 130 bucks 130 yeah I need
y'all to sign the check so you start
from yourself the iPhone 10 does fit in
the 10s case so for you iPhone 10 owners
you don't got to feel salty that you
weren't included it works for you now
question is do you want to shout 130
bucks for it
and surprisingly this case had a couple
of other features that we wanted to try
out see for yourself all right I'll go
423 p.m. if you can't tell by the
sunlight here and we're looking at about
24% battery left on the case my phone's
not 100% so this is accurate this is
almost at the end of a workday and I
still got a fully charged phone so
that's actually really impressive but
one of the new features on this battery
case is wireless charging we have a
wireless charging table over here and
check this out I'll have to do a pencils
down boom it's charging up so one of the
ways we've been checking our battery is
right from the screen of the phone
itself so iOS recognizes that this is
the smart battery case you get the
information right there if it were a
third party case we'd have to look for
the little LED indicators and press a
button to kind of see how much juice
we've got left
we'd have to see like three out of four
notches this one is you know exactly how
much juice you've got its first party
it's Apple it's expensive yes I will
admit that but there are reasons why one
would purchase this over a third party
case okay so another update first though
look at this case it is so dirty dirty
hey no you're making but um this is one
thing to note for girls though I wear
makeup so I touched my face constantly
so that's pretty much what you're seeing
here I think like meets like touching my
face and getting makeup on it and then
also on this so if you wear makeup or
even if you work at a job maybe that
your hands are getting dirty definitely
something to know the white case no but
in terms of the battery it's four
o'clock I'm still at 100% baby and the
case all day I've been on Instagram
non-stop today yeah so screen
multi-screen on time is four hours and
my case has o 17% so I'm about to lose
out on that hundred percent soon enough
but it's nice it's four o'clock back
when I was a teacher my day would be
like wrapping up and I still have a
hundred percent love it and you probably
couldn't tell from that clip but the
white definitely doesn't hold up well
after a couple of hours but the black is
definitely a lot better in hiding some
of that dirt but I will say with the
black though if you got greasy fingers
or anything like that or you having to
get grease on your hands you will
absolutely see that on this case trust
me okay guys so with the phone adding
the level of thickness that it does we
got to see how it works with a car mount
stir that in there actually
that's just fine I thought this was
gonna be a lot more difficult I would be
harder to get into I feel like caramel
it's already so hard to deal with and
work with especially when you have a
case on so yeah now this this thing
definitely it's a little heavy for it
yeah but for the most part it's not
falling out now of course every con I
think that'll be fine because I'm
tapping it and it's fine now I think
every car mount is obviously different
they all have different sizes for the
holders but so the one I have here this
one's pretty fine and with this one
being the size that is I think that
Aries charger in her car will probably
work just as fine
and this is the 10s max so it's a bigger
phone bigger case so that's actually
pretty good to see and you guys can see
that the case is a little bit thick and
it's something that I was complaining
about throughout the entire day but when
we got home she of course pump you fixed
it
all right battery check it is 834 right
now and it is 65% charge that's
excellent I could probably go to bed and
not even be at 30% yet but I have been
missing my pop socket today so I just
put it on this is kind of thick you know
it's kind of hard to deal with so pull
my pops it on and honestly guys
like this I'm good like this feels
perfect at this point alright guys so it
is 9:10 p.m.
my phone is at 80 percent eight eighty
percent so battery case is dead
80% on the phone listen I'm not mad at
all
this is solid for me like this is a two
day battery life kind of stuff but
overall this I could get used to this
it's not aesthetically pleasing I think
some people will say I don't think it
looks that great but it feels fine in
the hand gives me a lot of battery life
get to use my phone more come on how can
you complain so safe to say you get a
full day of usage with this if you saw
my real day in the life with the iPhone
10's max the battery life was okay
there's a little bit more to be desired
especially since that's one of the
bigger phones and with the 10 battery
just being ok this is definitely worth
looking into and the fact that I comes
out for the
ten are that thing already has amazing
battery life adding something like this
to it I wouldn't be surprised if you get
like two days now we did notice a couple
of weird things with the cases two
nights in a row how you didn't wake up
with a full charge I'm not really sure
what that's about it was in the high 90s
and so was the case but it wasn't full
usually overnight you get a full charge
so it was a little weird to see that I
didn't experience that myself I don't
know if her case is defective or what
but that is something we're gonna keep
an eye on I have instance myself which
was a one-off but I wasn't able to
actually get the phone to charge when I
plugged it in was a little weird I ended
up putting it on a wireless charger and
it charged just fine but I try to plug
it in might have been my cable but hey
gotta throw this kind of stuff out there
and my only other complaint is of course
the overall look it isn't the best
looking case honestly yeah I got it
right here
I wish thing just slimmed down the
battery made the entire thing maybe a
little bit thicker I think that would
have been fine and the other thing of
course being the material that it's made
out of I'm a big fan of the silicone
case and I think this one is a little
bit different
definitely behaves a bit if it gets a
little bit more dirty get that grease on
there it's pretty easy to get those
fingerprints but overall though from the
battery life I'll take it being able to
end the workday around five o'clock and
still have 100% battery it's just
mind-blowing so I like having that all
in one system I know I can throw a
portable charger on this guy and get it
charged throughout the day but having it
all in one system one lightning cable to
charge everything up come on we can't
beat that but not about wraps up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guard girl that
gives us video thumbs up I'll catch you
guys in the next one so then it's your
average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
