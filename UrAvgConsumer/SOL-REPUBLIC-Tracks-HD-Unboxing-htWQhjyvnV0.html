want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at your average consumer and
today I have an unboxing for you guys of
the most requested product on what do
you want video the SOL Republic tracks
HD so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the SOL Republic tracks HD now like
I said before this is the most requested
product on the what do you want video
and so I definitely had to get my hands
on these for you guys so you guys can
get my opinion and unboxing and all that
good stuff so just a quick look around
the box you can see that it has this
neat little packaging very slim it says
Soul Republic on the sides see-through
and the back it points out some key
features such as interchangeable
headbands so you can swap out the
headbands of different colors into the
headphones if you like it's supposed to
be virtually indestructible I'm too so
much of a chicken to test that out but
it seems like an interesting feature and
it's supposed to have an incredible
sound so I'll be the judge of that once
I get my hands on these and listening so
let's open it up here you can see it
shows you what you'll get inside you'll
get these two ear cups and these
actually latch on to the headband that
they provide here and it also comes with
a y-shaped
cable with an inline remote that lets
you control your music from your iPod or
iPhone it can even play in pause on
Android devices but you won't be able to
use the volume up and volume down
features and it also comes with a
carrying case so it's pretty interesting
and um alright that's about it for the
Box let's open it up here we're gonna
have some tape at the bottom let's pop
this open so we're gonna pop this open
here and
let's pull it out and then you just pull
on this little tab here alright pretty
simple all right so now we got this open
I believe this out the grave the grape
hair as you can see it's a grey headband
black cushion pretty nice and then here
you also get the two ear cups that you
can attach to the headband and let's see
it's also on this side get a little
table to plug in music in now that we
got this open you get a nice little gray
cable and I must say the color scheme
that they use for their headphones are
pretty nice unbox the Sol Republic
tracks ultras and the blue looks really
great
and I'm pretty impressed by them this
great version as well it's both
aesthetically pleasing so we're just
gonna put these on the side for now
and I'm just gonna show you what else
you get inside the box if you dig a
little deeper on the side you'll get
your traveling pouch and inside this
traveling pouch you'll get these little
manuals and stickers things like that
so we can put these back inside and we
can kind of toss this boxer side and the
count the the pouch is pretty
interesting it reminds me of a tablet
sleev you know those tablets where you
can just throw it in here and you know
this covers it out so it's a very
interesting design for a case I guess
you could put this in your book bag and
lay it flat up against like your stuff
interesting but enough about this case
let me assemble these track eights
tracks
HD does have little stickers on them you
can pull these right off and I will put
this to the side and these have sternum
these both go on certain parts this is
the right Cup
so it'll go on the right side and you
wanted to kind of just go over the Ellen
arse so that can be a nice fit okay it's
very simple even though you have to
assemble these it's a very simple
headphone to assemble it's only got
about four pieces the headband the
tweeter cuffs and a cable so now that
we've done this he's a pretty decent
looking headphones that song let me show
you a close-up of what you get now it's
very interesting that these are great
but DS them the ear cups look kind of
like they're copperish bronze just
feeling um finished to it so it's a
little weird but I mean this are
supposed to be the great ones as you can
see and at the top you have Sol Republic
this is the band a lot of people aren't
too happy with the band they say it
looks cheap but I don't think it looks
that bad I mean one more like one more
could you want from this but I guess if
you want to really have the band this is
not the one for you but it's a pretty
slim very simple design and here of
course is the Y cable this is the inline
remote that you get and of course you
can use to switch your iPod and iPhones
like I said before you got your volume
up volume down play and pause button in
the middle and they also have this nice
little um 3.5 millimeter jack that you
can plug into your devices so it's a
pretty nice little design has the solar
public tracks um logo on there and yeah
it's not bad I kind of do like the solar
public tracks ultra a bit more because
on it has a nicer finish on the ear cups
saw you guys in a comparison video at
some point and now if we take off the
ear cuffs real quick you can see this is
around your cup now these are on ear
headphones so these reviews won't be
going inside because this is you know
too small but it's on your headphones
and the cushions are very plush very
nice and soft so that'll make wearing
these a breeze and also on the band here
you can see that the inside the cushion
you only have this little cushion here
at the top to kind of you know soften it
up at the head so nice little
questioning can't really complain these
parts never really touch your head any
points so not bad with the cushioning
even though they use them small amount
of cushioning it's not bad but yeah
that's about it for this close-up guys
pretty much guys that's it for this
unboxing umm very simple product very
easy to assemble some people don't like
this thin band but I mean it's not so
bad I like it but I'll give you guys a
review let you guys know my thoughts on
how it sounds how it compares to the
Trax ultra and maybe some other
headphones like beads or audio
Technica's 88 750 is if you guys are
interested in that kind of stuff so
that's it for this video guys if you
liked it please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and I'll catch you
guys in the next video till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
