fiance here re and today I have the
unboxing of the brand new 2015 MacBook
and this is face gray so let's not waste
any time let's get right into it
wah wah wah wah wah wah wah ba-bah
ba-bah
okay and let's start off first by just
taking a look at the Box on the front
the box you have a picture of the
MacBook and on the back you have the
specifications this is the base model by
the way and at the top it says MacBook
other than that it's just a pretty plain
white box with a picture of the MacBook
on front so let's talk specifications
this is a 12 inch high-resolution
display with a 1.1 gigahertz dual core
Intel Core M processor which means it's
not the greenest processor for the price
tag
it also has 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs
of onboard flash storage and guys this
is basically the specifications you
could expect from the base model so now
that we've talked about specs let's see
what the back looks like and of course
what would this unboxing be without any
trusty unboxing knife I know some of you
guys get nervous seeing me hold it again
I'm left-handed not my fault let's do a
couple cuts here and this is supposed
this is the lightest and thinnest
MacBook
this is the lightest and thinnest
matchbook it's even thinner and lighter
than the MacBook Air which is saying a
lot and guys here's the beauty it is in
space gray that's so pretty a welcome
change from the silver I almost like
that the Apple logo isn't in white it's
like an ax even darker gray the
compromise with that though is that that
means it won't light up any more so
that's just a little just a little thing
you guys should note um so let's um take
out its plastics some dress this bad boy
all right oh my gosh it's so light one
of the things I said to you our consumer
wouldn't even to go pick this up was I'm
just really surprised at how tiny the
box is it's just so little okay as so
here we go and let's just look at it
it's super super light I can probably do
this with one hand very easily okay so
that I took off as clothing we're gonna
put to the side before we explore it and
examine it a little bit more and let's
see what comes in the box so we have
this little jacket here that says
MacBook and just Quick Start Guide you
expect to get a quick start guide when
you guys get this then you have your
your cable here for the USB port see and
the adapter let's see if there's
anything else something is anything else
in this box nope
now I'm going to clean her up before we
take a closer look at this so I'll clean
up I notice that there are actually
stickers that come with the MacBook as
usual but this time it's in space gray
to match this basically MacBook so if
you have a silver version you can expect
to have white stickers and if you have
the gold version you can probably expect
to have gold stickers
alright so now that we have the stickers
taken care of let's take a look at this
bad boy all right so here we have it us
again super super light I can't get over
how light and thin it is it kind of
reminds me of old school netbooks if you
guys remember those and as I look around
the device I notice a headphone jack
here and really just one USB type-c port
one the compromises Apple had to make
when they did this is that this is where
you also charge your computer so you can
tap at you cannot charge a computer and
also have something hooked up to it
which is kind of disappointing also this
is USB type-c so you have to have an
adapter with it so this is what I'm
talking about this is the USB CT USB
adapter it's the standard one but Apple
sells these but the prices can really
range this is a senator one it's about
$20 but you can buy one that's up to
like 70 something dollars so just
something to consider when purchasing
this is it an extra cost that will be
added to you if you want to hook up any
other devices like an external hard
drive or just anything else that uses a
USB simple USB cable it kind of sucks
that you need adapter on such a small
portable device they see this thing that
get kind of chunky and clunky so it's
just a little unfortunate with you
already have like this beautiful thin
device and you have to add that clump to
it but enough about that let's actually
take a look at what this guy looks like
inside
all right so you have some protection
for the screen and an edge-to-edge
keyboard here so this keyboard goes edge
to edge of the entire MacBook that's how
they were able to fit in the full-size
keyboard which is awesome then you have
the new track pad here and let's take
off this and yes the has very thin
bezels around the edges which is kind of
nice I can imagine what this might look
like once it's actually powered on you
have to imagine let's actually look at
it all right I think you press and
before we actually get it set up I just
want to take note of the fact that it
has a 480p webcam which kind of sucks
for that price tag I would expect
something that was at least HD so that's
just one thing you should also know if
you're something that likes to FaceTime
a lot it's going to not be the best
quality also there is a flat a new
keyboard that Apple has introduced with
this model and there's a flat keyboard
so I'm really interested in seeing how
this feels but man asked me looks good
so it's a really high resolution it's
also a Retina display okay here we go
oh I don't really so much of a
difference the keyboard to be honest I
think if you're pretty good typist or
you can type pretty fast you don't
really feel the difference because
you're just going but yeah the the
keyboard feels feels pretty good to me
it's not a huge difference in my opinion
in terms of like the user experience so
just a quick recap I think this is a
beautiful MacBook the Space Gray is just
gorgeous it's also nice and light and
thin but the webcam sucks and it only
has one USB port and it's type-c so it
means you'll probably need you'll need
an adapter there's also no SD card slot
and no display port which is also which
also is pretty sucky so you can do them
out you can do work on this and it's
very nice and portable but you're just
doing the very basics all right so
that's about it guys I just wanted to
give you a really quick unboxing letting
you know what's in the box when you
first buy this and also give you some my
initial impression
so yes we have to look out for a nice
full review of this bad boy on this
channel your average consumer and I feel
free to follow me on Instagram and
Twitter at your average girlfriend thank
you guys for watching and give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it or if
you'd like to see more of me thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
