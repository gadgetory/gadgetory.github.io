consumer and finally we have the sony
xba-40 n ones in hand and i got to say
these are easily one of my favorite
headphones ever I was super excited when
I saw these our CES I could not wait for
them when I dropped my video a ton of
you guys were crazy interested and since
I know a ton of you went out and bought
the 950 BT based on my recommendation
we're going to compare the two and see
if it's really worth upgrading if you
already have these now the first thing
we're going to talk about guys is the
design now just looking at it it looks
just like the 950 BTS but what's one
major difference now boom you got some
foldable action here so this makes
portability a lot simpler I'm not even
going to lie it's actually really easy
to just keep it flat like this throw it
in the backpack and you're good to go
but it doesn't hurt to have some options
if maybe you want to throw this into a
side pocket or something now you can do
that so this is really really cool and
this is absolutely something I was dying
for on the 950 BT now another change
you'll find with the N ones is that
they've got two new colors green which
you've never seen before and black but
this one isn't really black it's more
like a slate the BP's are also in black
but this one feels a bit different this
feels like a grey or tone to it and it's
also got the textured feel so if you
look at the sides of the ear cups and
the headband itself you got that nice
little texture the BTS itself featured a
deeper black and it also has this little
red accent around the ear cups now I
think these are very solid colors I'm
more of a fan of this black but if you
really like the look of the 950 BTS the
950 B ones which I don't have on the
table have no noise cancelling and they
still feature the old design but in
terms of straight-up looks you still are
on the bigger side guys there's no
denying that you have big headphones so
I'm not really sure how you guys are
going to feel about leaving the house
with these personally I feel like they
sound so good that I don't really care
now in terms of comfort they've still
got those nice super plush supersoft air
cushions so you can wear these forever
and not have a problem I honestly feel
like the bps and these are amongst the
most comfortable headphones I've ever
ever worn so comfort you have got it
no issues here whatsoever you're going
to love it now in terms of features the
kind of things that you'd get with these
headphones first thing you'll notice
over here on the left ear cup is NFC so
if you have an NFC enabled device maybe
a phone tablet whatever it may be all
you have to do is tap them together and
you get the option to pair them pretty
quickly so that's a pretty cool decent
feature not not a big deal to be honest
but it's there and of course you guys
know that these are wireless headphones
so they've got bluetooth connectivity so
you've got all your controls on the
sides of the ear custom whatnot so you
can control your music and your
headphones without having to touch your
device I love headphones like this now
one of the biggest upgrades here on the
n1 is the inclusion of active
noise-cancelling so if you'd like to
travel you can use the active
noise-cancelling to cancel out all the
rumbling from maybe a plane or a train
now I know active noise-cancelling isn't
really something that everyone is
looking for so you can go to the B ones
which don't have that feature but it
still has all the other upgrades and
it's a bit cheaper now I did get a
chance to travel with these or try out
the active noise-cancelling for myself
and I'm not going to lie I was pretty
impressed I tried out some great active
noise-cancelling headphones in the past
and these are definitely no slouch now
features that we all know and love on
these headphones is the bass boost
button if you're looking for bass you
will not find something better than
these I guarantee it but there is a
change that they did with the and ones
design that I really don't like the bass
boost button is now flush within the ear
cup now this is a problem when you're
actually wearing it because we're
looking for the button to press it's
kind of hard to determine where it
actually is the 950 BTS actually had a
little groove that the button had a nice
little indent so you knew when you place
your thumb on it that you'd be pressing
the button there but with these it's
just a little bit harder to know when
you're actually on the button not really
a deal-breaker but it is something they
took away from no reason and one of my
favorite features besides that bass
boost is the new app and the app is
actually pretty simple you've got three
things that you can
control here you've got this surround
effect that gives you this feeling of
being in a concert or an arena or a club
you can actually switch it up depending
on what kind of vibe you're going for
which is actually really really cool but
honestly not something that I would use
that often that's a very specific
feeling that you want to be going for
not something I think is going to really
catch on for a lot of people but what's
important here is that you actually have
the ability to control the bass from the
bass boost button so you can actually
pick it all the way from 10 to negative
10 which is some very awesome control I
personally feel like this is an amazing
addition to the n1 because with the bass
boost button it is possible to have too
much bass yes I know it's hard to
believe but you really can have way too
much bass and I personally like to tone
it down a little bit sometimes when the
song already has a lot of emphasis on
the bass and lastly you can turn off
your active noise-cancelling but there's
a button for that on the headphone so
it's not really a big deal now something
I really like about the N ones is that
they now come with a travel case and
this is awesome I had to find
third-party cases or cases from other
headphones to throw my booties in wasn't
really crazy about that I always said
that song should have included a case
and now they do so you don't have to
worry about this getting scratched stuff
or maybe anything else that could happen
to them you now have a case that you can
put them in they also get a 3.5
millimeter cable if you don't want to
use the bluetooth features you can go in
Wireless no problem
but what's great with the N ones now is
that when you plug these in you still
get access to bass blues now what you've
all been waiting for I know you guys
want to know how do these sound and I
got to say guys sony was actually able
to improve the sound quality now look at
this straight guys these headphones are
made for people who love bass like
really love it but with that in mind
they also don't sound like complete
trash when you're listening to a song
that isn't bass heavy or requires the
vocals to sound good they sounded great
all around but they have that super
emphasis when it comes to bass you can
definitely get away with listening to
something classical and whatnot
especially but the bass boost control
but that's not what you're here for
some boom-boom-boom in the air drums now
we're asking the biggest improvement in
terms of sound quality is when you're
actually using the bass booth feature
now with the 950 bps I actually didn't
like having the basically speaker on
sometimes because it would just be too
much and you definitely took a hit in
sound quality like the vocals or like
the lighter instrument it just really
was not a pleasant experience but they
actually changed that with the BTS I was
able to tolerate having maximum based
maximum volumes and not notice a serious
degrade in sound quality so these sounds
amazing
they're absolutely one my favorite
headphones of all time right now now I
know a lot of you went and got the 950
BTS but are they worth upgrading yes
they are definitely worth the upgrade
because you did in bedded sound quality
you're also getting that noise
cancelling feature if you care about it
and that foldable design so if these are
things that are interesting to you I
definitely think they're worth it they
also feature 22 hours of battery life
and if you don't use bass boost or the
active noise-cancelling sony says that
you can get even more so that's already
more than you get with the 950 BTS so
like I said guys lots of reasons to
upgrade I definitely think it's worth it
the only issue comes in the fact that
these go for about 250 bucks which I
think they are absolutely well worth but
I know a lot of people got these for
maybe under 100 bucks maybe for 100
bucks that was one of the best selling
points of the 950 BCS but I still don't
care I think these are worth the 250 you
pay for it and maybe these will follow
in the footsteps of the BTS get some
creative discounts over time but either
way they're worth the price I love these
well hopefully enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives this
video thumbs up links but everything
will be in the description I'll catch
you guys in the next one
till then is your Avex consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
