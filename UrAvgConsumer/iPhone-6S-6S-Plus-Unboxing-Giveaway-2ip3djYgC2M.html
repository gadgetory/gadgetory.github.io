and this is my fiance Harry and today we
are unboxing the brand new iPhone 6s and
the 6s plus basically you're gonna get
two-for-one deal you're welcome okay so
let's not waste any time just get right
into it the last time I said back
all right so I'm excited I'm ready to
open it up yes I'm - I'm really excited
because I have the brand new color the
rose gold which is super super pretty I
was so happy finally came out with Wendy
sympathy not happy but they call it rose
gold like why even bother it's pink but
I've got a pretty regular Space Gray six
plus I'm definitely not opting for a
rose gold but um yeah you're ready open
them up okay so I've got the unboxing
right I just can't
what's really nice about this Rose Bowl
is that like it's a nice pink that you
could like always react tell you it's
like a hot like those hot pink with this
iPhone see it's just too much
yeah ooh loud look how you hold it like
every time let's use your night hashtag
let's go sweetheart
I don't know I feel like this kind of
color though you won't really even see
it because you're gonna put in a case
you're probably right but I know it's
there
yeah that's all that matters okay ready
yeah I want to go first go for okay so
let's do a quick drumroll because
there's a new color show some respect
Oh God he's drumroll Oh
see she came I'm still not used to
having this like white bezel yeah yeah I
like that little no she said buzz
vessels guys you know the back oh yeah
that's peak that is really catch I don't
think most guys are gonna be picking
this up I love it it's really pretty
so that's rapidly what's around us my
sounds people love that sound so
what do you think I mean he's beautiful
it's clean too bad I'm gonna put a piece
on this thing
Yeah right all right well let me open up
mine mine is gonna be pretty boring
because this is the same thing that I
got last year ah but yeah this is pretty
much a standard Space Gray iPhone
six-plus the same as last year I'm
pretty sure the color is the same but
what's different now is that it at least
has an S at the bottom this is right
under the tramp stamp it's a good
binding so let me get this plastic off
and that is a very very satisfying
alright so here we have them together
now spaced very similar to last year's
well it's exactly like last year's but
the rose gold isn't you and you know she
seems to like it
oh yeah this thing is so gorgeous and it
is definitely still in the show right
now since it is so new and his is kind
of way small okay well this is also gold
and silver options as well yeah what's
really nice about that is that you can
pick one of those four colors for our
giveaway we are doing giveaway of the
iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s plus mm so
you guys all you got to do it enter that
giveaway is subscribe to the channel and
leave a comment down below and that's
about it now this is an unboxing so
we're gonna have to go with the rest of
this box so let's see what else we've
got
Oh same as last year so we've got a
lightning cable and we've got a wall
adapter and we've got earbuds
yeah and I'm even gonna bother
disturbing mind since I have all of
these things for my phone from hurshe :
before I pack it all away I forgot the
most important thing out of this entire
unboxing
Snickers Oh whack I thousand get rose
rose gold sticker it's only the
disappointment only the new MacBook has
the match I smell something to show off
like ever I got rose gold ticket and I
feel
so that's the most important thing and
let's see what else we've got here with
the actual phone so now I'm ready to
turn this thing on let's do it
boom Apple logo all day oh you got it
boom Apple logo on it so time scamp we
went instead of our phones now time to
let you guys know what's actually
different with the S version of the new
iPhones yeah that was like the biggest
question I got all day today and I was
telling people that was the new iPhone
they were just like what's the
difference between the a semi-regular
not much so to start to stop first thing
that's different is the a9 processor
basically is the new chip that they add
every year it's gonna be a bit faster
can hand a little bit more nothing
special to be honest it's going to
perform better but you know what same
thing in the end it really that's to be
expected
Payne yeah my shiny pointy you're
upgrading it should be better right and
secondly we have an upgrade on the
camera now the rear facing camera has 12
megapixels so you should definitely have
some high quality photos
it also has 4k video recording which
think that Apple for doing this because
yeah now you're keeping up with the
times the 4k recording it's a thing now
and now you even have a cool feature for
the front-facing camera when when you're
taking your pictures like your selfies
you get a nice little light that goes
off that kind of emulate some flash kind
of like what they do with the mac books
or the imax how's that photobooth right
yes a photobooth so it's kind of the
same thought process right there I'm
gonna love that so the last thing is now
3d types so basically what you can do is
you can press your screen and with a
little pressure you'd be able to pull up
menus on different items within the
operating system so if you press
something like Instagram you'll be able
to make a post or do stuff like that so
pretty cool stuff
uh pretty much it feels like a right
foot you can think of it as it's going
to show you that you can think of it as
a right click and really the dis title
of features that come with iOS 9 but in
terms of the actual phone's that's the
only thing that's different
oh and they're also built with a new
grade of aluminum it's aluminum 7000
series or something like that and the
story that's it that's the new stuff
with the iPhones that's all you got but
yeah we've also got some Docs though so
they've got Docs in all different colors
there's rose gold Space Gray gold and
silver so with this you actually just
throw your iPhone on top and you have a
little spot so that you can throw your
lightning cable into Silicon charges as
well as plug in some headphones or
speakers so that you guys can listen to
music while your iPhone is uh going have
some weight to it for sure yeah that's
that's good because then it'll keep it
on if you put on your
it's not gonna fly off oh that's clean
yeah I like this yeah but that about
wraps it up for this video guys like I
said not much has changed in terms of
the experience of new phones but there
are some cool little additions so if you
