consumer and it's time for another real
dandy life this time with the Google
pixel excel now with a real day in the
life video you guys are gonna see me
spend a full day with the phone while
I'm testing things out like the battery
life camera performance and the cool
features that each phone might have and
since we're using the Google pixel you
know I gotta try out that Google
assistant and see how it actually works
in the real world so here's how we spent
the day alright guys so we've got the
pixel excel in hand and it's got a full
charge battery 100% so we're gonna see
how that battery does but we're gonna be
starting today off with the LA Auto Show
so I figured this would be a pretty good
spot to try out the camera take some
pictures in some pretty cool cars
alright guys so we're inside the LA Auto
Show so I think we're gonna take a
couple of pictures of this and see what
the quality of the pixel xl's camera
looks like so right now we're actually
recording with the pixel I've got the
pixel XL over here that I'm going to be
taking some pictures with but you can
judge the video quality with what you're
seeing right now so we're going to take
a picture and see what we can get this
looks pretty cool name damn that's sharp
too so I'm able to zoom in and still see
a lot of detail still really sharp and
you can even see all the stickers that
are on here with all the feature names
but so far the quality looks really nice
it does look a tad bit warmer than I'm
seeing in real life but so far still
looks really good
so I've been using the pixel excel and
the regular pixel and I gotta say I
prefer typing on the smaller pixel this
one's a bit more has to be two-handed
since it's a bigger phone not really
crazy about the feel in the hand with
this guy after using the pixel I like it
a bit more but
texting is okay it's fine I've been able
to do my email with some problem all
right guys so we just wrapped up from
inside the Auto Show and it looks like
I've got about 78 percent battery left
we've got a wild Morrison in the back
and 70 percent battery not bad because
we do it we did a lot of camera stuff
and you know cameras drain the battery I
got almost an hour a screen on time and
to be at 78% that's pretty good so I'm
expecting maybe we'll end off around
four to five hours we'll see so we just
took a selfie with the front-facing
camera obviously but we took a selfie
and it is actually really good quality
you can see it's got some pretty good
dynamic range that sky doesn't look
blown out our faces look pretty well lit
all right this is the Disney IG camera
man yeah it's the new IG camera I'm
telling you right now we're gonna go to
CVS but I'm in LA I have no idea where
CBS's so we're gonna use Google Maps and
how does one point four miles away we're
gonna walk there nine minutes
are you can manage right that's right
all right so let's go some more taxing
stuff for the bad
so we're walking in the street and we
saw someone who acts that looks familiar
looks like someone from a show so we're
gonna see if we can find them
okay Google dad from Arrested
Development this guy Michael the second
oh yes Wow okay so there you go
so the end of the Kim to you not really
that guy was Korean all right looks like
we made it so iris had the pharmacy so I
figured I might as well play some
Pokemon go to kill some time and unlike
the LGV 20 this one runs super smooth
and even with the lgb 20th game
optimization setting turned off this
still runs way way better complete those
guys this wallpaper is awesome this
thing is so sick look at Max's my
clothes and it matches the phone if
you're wondering it's this cool app
right here called minima pro so check
that out if you guys want to get some
really cool customizable live wallpapers
so it's about 5:00 p.m. now and I've got
about 54% battery that's really good I
think in terms of screen on time I'm
looking at
a little more than two hours so so far
so good like I like I said I'm probably
going to hit that four hour maybe five
hour mark we'll see what happens all
right guys so we just hit up the Grove
but check this out on the phone you can
actually see a map directory pop up so
it shows us every store that's in here
just by being in the same vicinity so we
can see all the spots that they've got
over here and that's just pretty awesome
that's a very very useful feature right
all right so I found me a Nike store got
a new hat
got a new hoodie now I have to
compromise and go to Sephora makeup
store where area it's on violin so why
Larry does her shopping I'm gonna catch
up with some Dragon Ball super and I
gotta say guys having an AMOLED panel is
awesome on the pixel because colors are
super super vibrant they look great and
this thing is just sharp there's a quad
HD display just looks really really good
I doubt that the camera is gonna do it
any real justice but trust me when I say
I am loving the quality of the screen
this definitely feels like a premium
device for sure just off the screen
alone so there's another feature where
you're able to swipe down on the
fingerprint scanner and you get your
notifications swipe up and they go away
sounds awesome right except your finger
naturally rests on the fingerprint
scanner side so when you're walking
around or you're using it you might
happen to give it a little nudge and the
notification drop down and you got a
swipe back up to get rid of it happens
way more frequently than I would like so
it's a little sensitive and I don't know
I just think I have to keep the feature
off because it's becoming a pain so
we're going to ask Google to find the
nearest coal stone because
if you know us from this channel you
know we love cold stone but what's cool
is that we can activate the Google
assistant without having to turn on the
phone or go into the phone so ok Google
where's the nearest cold stone there we
go and quick update it's now 7:00 p.m.
and we've got 39% battery left so so far
so good I'd say would be we're doing
pretty all right
let's see what that screen on time says
about almost 3 hours 2 minutes 2 hours
and 46 minutes so almost there
I'm pretty confident we'll hit 4 hours
not so sure about 5 but this is still
really really good 7 p.m. 39% it's all
day battery all right guys so somehow we
ended up in Dave &amp;amp; Buster's IRAs never
been I've never been here so I'm having
a great time there's a cool machine over
here that rocks as you ride it so we're
going to try to image stabilization on
the camera and see how it works
so we just wrapped up at Dave &amp;amp; Buster's
I think we walked away with some goodies
I got re some plush toys we had some
winnings from our game tickets so we did
decent and in terms of the Google pixel
let's see 9 o'clock right now and we're
looking at 31% battery and screen on
time over 3 hours 3 hours of 7 minutes
so there's still some life left in this
guy and the day is over for me really
so we'll probably get some ice cream and
see what else we can do so right now I'm
just catching up on social media since
I've been pretty busy today and I gotta
say I don't know if it's because I'm
using this without a case but I'm really
not crazy about the pixel excels feel in
the hand it just feels a little big it's
not the biggest one I've ever used
either but something about it just feels
a bit uncomfortable but when it comes to
the actual pixel this bill is like it
feels just right it feels perfect
he lose out on a better display this has
a higher resolution on Excel but
honestly it just looks like a smaller
screen you can't really see a different
quality but this feels right it
definitely does but maybe a case might
change that but right now in the hand
pixel feels better all right guys so
we're back at the hotel and let's do a
final check-in it is about 12 19 so
let's see Emma's battery we've got left
10% and screen on time 4 hours and 21
minutes which is solid not quite five
hours and I'm sure we can get a bit more
juice out of this since it's got 10% but
uh yeah I think got some really solid
battery life not only give you guys my
final wrap-up overall I was really
pleased with my experience with the
pixel excel the LA Auto Show was the
perfect place to showcase the new camera
even outside the Auto Show the cameras
photos were really impressive but to be
honest I wasn't too thrilled with the
video quality it gets a pass but it
definitely doesn't win any awards in my
book and that AMOLED display very nice
it's super vibrant sharp and easy to use
indoors and even in direct sunlight and
the performance is exactly where I had
expected with a Snapdragon 820 1
processor the thing doesn't lag at all
and it's super quick very snappy and
since I'm still in that Pokemon go train
I've been playing that a lot and it's
been super smooth which I can't say
about some other phones so in terms of
performance I've got no complaints the
pixel gets a big thumbs up and it better
with that price range now when it comes
to the feel in the hand I wasn't too
crazy about the pixel XL I did find the
pixel far more comfortable but I gotta
say surprisingly after throwing a case
on the XL it got a lot more comfortable
in the hand and just having some of the
baked in features really makes owning
the pixel worth it I like being able to
pull up Google assistant and have it
work something out for me and there's
even that cool little feature with the
fingerprint scanner where you can pull
down your notifications like I said in
theory that sounds really cool but your
finger naturally rests on the back there
so I can see people setting it off by
mistake like myself and I can really get
frustrating to me the pixels really
deliver on what they're meant to
which is the next level of Nexus devices
but it's gonna really suck to see those
low price tags go away as these are now
premium devices I think they're worth
the money but it does suck to see the
Nexus lineup just kind of go away but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys I listen to your feedback and I'm
glad you liked the format so this will
be continuing but till the next one is
