consumer you know arey hello and today
we're gonna be talking about what we
think is one of the best vlogging
cameras that you can get right now and
if you are an OG subscriber you might
remember that lease to vlog on this
channel a lot so it's only right we do
this intro of vlog style and if you
don't remember here are a couple clips
of what we used to do back in the day
and yes you saw that right we've logged
during our wedding we were pretty
committed to the whole blogging thing
definitely so today we're gonna be
talking about the camera that we use and
pretty much all of the vlogs for years
and years and years
definitely the rx100 now sony was cool
enough to sponsor today's video and this
is gonna be like the easiest video in
the world to make because we are so
familiar with this camera would you like
all the different models today we're
gonna talk about the mark-5 which is
exciting but I'm gonna take it out and
show you guys in the real world what
it's like to actually use it and
honestly guys I just love recommending
the rx100 for anyone who asks about a
camera that can help them start their
vlogging or doing whatever they want to
do in terms of photos and videos this
has great quality in a really
lightweight compact body and I love that
because you've got a high quality camera
that could fit in your backpack or even
your pocket which is great for traveling
since vlogs typically happen all over
the place now a few of the other nice
things I like about the body of this
camera is that it has a flip-out screen
as well as a ring dial in the front so
that you can change things like the
aperture or even zoom into shots if you
need to you've got a lot of control with
this camera which is going to be
essential if this is going to be your
main camera that you take everywhere
with you now of course when you're
vlogging or just working with video in
general you got to think about the audio
as well back in the day we used to use
the internal mics on the camera to
record our stuff and that was fine in
the beginning I definitely need for a
beginner the internal mics will get just
fine but you might want to consider an
external recorder if you really want to
make sure your audios crisp I personally
do it with all of my cameras and I'll
have some good options link down below
in the description and not only is the
rx100 great for video but it takes
awesome photos so if you're looking to
take a picture for social media you can
just grab it go like this boom and just
like that I've got a really awesome shot
of some french fries what's great is
that there's also an app that goes along
with this so whenever you want to go
ahead and post it on Instagram or
Facebook or whatever there's just a
single button you hit you hit send this
image it creates a Wi-Fi network and
makes it very very simple to go ahead
and transfer your photos and look guys
just like that items were copied and now
I can just go right here and boom there
my french fries it's super simple and I
don't have to go ahead and take my SD
card out put it into a computer try to
transfer or to send it over email use an
app and you've got all your stuff right
on your phone now one of the absolute
best things about the rx100 line is the
fact that it has a pop-up screen so
there's no guesswork in setting up your
shot because vlogging is first-person so
you want to be the guy Manning your
camera and knowing what it looks like
when you're shooting and with that
feature you know exactly what you're
getting from your screen because you can
see it right there but I want you guys
try not to look at the screen because
then you're not looking at the camera
you're not paying attention to your
audience Harry used to do this all of
the time she messed up a lot of shots
okay but it definitely is useful to have
now in terms of the specs we've got a 24
to 70 lens with the aperture of f-18
which is really great if you're looking
for some nice depth of field especially
low-light photos or a low-light shooting
you're gonna be able to take in a lot of
light get some great quality and right
now what you guys are seeing is the
quality directly from the camera no
editing no colors this is exactly what
you can expect and even without any
editing or coloring I think it looks
pretty good and of course you can shoot
an HD and you even have access to 4k
with the mark 4 and Mark 5 versions of
this camera and if you're looking for
some variety in your shooting you even
have slow motion as an option so you've
got your high frame rate mode that
allows you to shoot at 240 P and all the
way up to 960 which is incredibly slow
but one thing you want to keep in mind
is that you're gonna need a lot of good
light to make sure these shots are nice
and exposed but overall guys I think the
rx100 is a great option if you want to
take your vlogging as well as your
social media pages very seriously you
get that great video quality as well as
picture quality and with that flip up
screen that means you're not gonna need
an extra camera man to help you compose
your shots you'll be able to see
everything that's going on right from
the camera and you also get the
PlayMemories app which allows you to
share your photos wirelessly and very
quickly whenever you want to post your
social media pages and while everyone
may not think $1000 is inexpensive it's
definitely worth the investment if you
want to take your video series
but they still do have the previous
models available as well so you can save
some money there and still get really
great quality I really think that the
quality and convenience that you're
getting from this camera in this form
factor is a great value especially when
you start comparing it to things like
DSLRs that the prices can change quite
drastically me and I have been using a
sense 2013 to do our vlogs and we can't
recommend it enough but hopefully this
helps you guys if you want to start
vlogging I'll have some recommendations
down below in the description two other
things that would help you along with
the rx100 if you want to start your
vlogging game but hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video if you did be the
cool guy girl that gives it a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys to the next one so
then a traveler's consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
