consumer and today I've got a video that
pretty much opens the floor for
audiophiles to make recommendations to
the average consumer and all right let's
not wasting Italian let's get right into
it and just as I said before guys I'm
opening the floor to audio files so that
they can make recommendations to the
average consumer because whether you
like it or not
audiophile grade headphones aren't
marketed to the average consumer as much
as things like Beats or soles or
whatever other headphones so I'd like
for audiophiles who typically jump on
other videos and you know make their
recommendations here I like everyone to
just hone in and start throwing the
recommendations on this video or what I
can do is have a series of videos where
we can kind of list out some genres or
maybe some different kinds of sounds
that the average consumer might look for
maybe you want something that's really
crisp sounds real good you can hear all
the instruments things that are for like
classical music who knows or if you want
that based heavy music that still sounds
good and have um you know for hip hop
dubstep all that kind of stuff or maybe
you want a combination of both so we can
have different videos there where we
separate them and all the comments and
recommendations will be based on that
one sound quality that one type of sound
that's described in that video and we
can do this for as many videos as you
guys would like to see or we can have
them all just down below where the
recommendations are down down below in
the comments in this video and also a
brief description of what kind of music
it's good for or you know what kind of
sounds you can expect to get out of it
and with this you guys can let me know
how you want to see these
recommendations laid out the three
videos or multiple videos however you
guys want to separate them or all the
recommendations down here with I guess
deeper descriptions with the comment and
recommendation so you guys pick I'm
going to go looking into the comments
and pay attention to what you guys want
and we'll go from there and I'm really
doing this because even though my target
audience is the average consumer audio
files will always be drawn into the
videos that are based on headphones
because that's what they like and that's
definitely understandable
so regardless of whether or not my
target audience is just the average
consumer I realized that my audience is
the average consumer and audio files
whether it's positive or negative on the
audiophile end but nonetheless audio
files are my audience as we see in lots
of comments so this is pretty much why
I'm trying to open the floor on audio
files I'm not ignoring your voice
definitely hearing your points you guys
want to make recommendations I see that
you guys really want to educate
regardless of how you some of you go
about it that's totally fine I'm all for
the average consumer so if you guys have
recommendations please let me know what
they are let everyone know what they are
and I know I know typically audio files
aren't happy with my headphone
selections for this channel but I really
just go by the request that I get
whatever is frequently requested is what
I look into purchasing and providing a
review for you guys on that but I know
they know a ton of different brands out
there that they probably want to have
exposed more to the Irish consumer so
definitely want that to happen here and
also for you average consumers who just
want to get the best sounding headphones
for your buck and don't know what the
best is this is what this video or video
series can be all about so hopefully we
get some good stuff going here so I'll
see what kind of video format you guys
want based on the comments and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to change the
description if I notice a lot of people
want it to be broken out into different
videos I'm going to change the
description of this video to say that so
you will see that before you guys go and
rush and throw recommendations down
there I'll put it in the description
whether or not a lot of people want to
see it broken up or down on this video
so you guys don't
your time and pretty much that's it guys
I wanted to give the audio files a
chance to make their recommendations to
the average consumer hopefully this
won't start a war kind of trying to
merge the two because the to definitely
do clash and um hey let's see if we get
some good things going here guys
um drivers consumer I'll catch you guys
in the next video until then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
