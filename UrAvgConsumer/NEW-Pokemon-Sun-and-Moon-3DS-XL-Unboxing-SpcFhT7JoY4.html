with another boxing for you guys and of
course I'm a boxing 1/3 yes of course
that's all he lets me a box and it's
Pokemon version again but I am excited
for this because it is the version for
Sun and Moon if you guys do not know Sun
and Moon is coming out on November 18th
and this 3ds is to honor that so let's
get right stand boxing as you'll notice
when we see this media it has the
legendaries on the front so that's
exciting and we're going to get to those
edges in a second now one thing you'll
notice is we emptied everything out of
the box but there's no charger so you
have to just purchase your own charger
it's like $10 or $15 so it's not that
expensive but it is something to
consider if you're thinking about
purchasing one and here we go
it's gonna take us out of here and there
it is on the back just like with X&amp;amp;Y you
have the shadow of the legendaries right
here and oh that is so pretty and here's
a front you have the legendaries and
this first one is called Silva Leo and I
really really wish I was getting this
one um Jen was yes James look at selfish
and he guilt trips me into making him
insulating him half son so then I chose
moon we like to get the opposite one so
that because there's certain Pokemon
specific to a certain version and then
we catch them in train so that's so
Kaleo and this is one Alison I'll
beginning and I just have to get used to
it so in first glance this is really
nice there's really not much going on
with it it's just a black with the
legendaries on the front and there's
silhouettes on the back but it's nice
it's simple understated but it's still
kind of fancy let's let's see how the
inside looks okay so really no surprise
there you just have the black continues
inside and let's try it on and I have to
say I'm feeling a bit jealous right now
this is really really pretty and I'm
looking at it just so pretty but it's
not mine so you saw my snapchat a couple
weeks ago your average girlfriend go
follow if he's like on blue sky so I
unboxed the galaxy style 3d yes
actually we were playing the demo for
studded mood we noticed that mine was a
little bit slower than his since it was
the older 3dsxl so we wouldn't picked up
a new one for me only to find
just two days ago hope weeks later this
guy was in Walmart so I missed out on
this and Judd got it because he needed
new one as well and I'm hating so hard
but was really nice is that wound to
Japan a couple weeks ago and I was able
to put some Pokemon Center and pick up a
case with easy on it I don't know if you
guys can tell but I'm obsessed with a V
and Aleutians it's just my thing so this
kind of makes this thing a little bit
less and it's pink so it's a bonus but
then about wraps up this unboxing of the
Pokemon Sun and Moon version of a three
s XL it is limited edition so if you do
want to find this you can watch some
Walmart makes you rush out and get it if
we find any leaks I'll link them down
below and if you are getting Pokemon Sun
or moon let me know down below if you're
getting moon please make sure you
mention that just so I can feel a bit
better because I should really get so
will you I just I wish I had woke up my
son but trying to be a good wife that's
all y'all let me know how you guys like
this video and be the cool guy or girl
to give this video a thumbs up now catch
you guys the next one if you let's me
about something different
