and it's just about time to go back to
school
selects for some me but it's a good
excuse to pick up some awesome tech so
we've got some awesome tech for
back-to-school this times the baller
Edition and for some of you who may
think you aren't ballers we're just
watching the video anyway but there's a
budget edition that I'd also did then
I'll have a link down below in the
description but don't worry these items
won't completely break the bank and
we're going to be starting off with this
guy one of my favorite backpacks little
brother if you guys saw my what's my
guy's a backpack 5.0 video you know the
incase icon is my favorite backpack of
all time currently so this is a little
brother and I think this is a very good
option if you want to save a little cash
and take something awesome to school so
over here we have a ton of compartment a
very stylish backpack and you don't
really find that with a lot of tech
backpack so this is great
so first up in a very first compartment
we've got what you think cables so over
here we've got no man cables now these
are really really awesome cables because
they're extremely durable and they make
them for just about any phone that
you're using so you've got your
lightning cable options you also have a
universal version that has a bunch of
adapters so if you want to use micro USB
you can do that or if you need USB
type-c or lightning
you got those options as well and you
still of course have the same design and
the nice little type organization so
Nomad cables don't it probably might go
to cables where we mean personally
they're a little bit more expensive but
definitely worth it and over here in the
next compartment we got a few things so
first thing you'll notice though is that
a cable just fell out so we've got a
bunch of pockets for things like pens
and whatever you want to put in here so
you got your pens whatever you can use
those for school or you need to write
but you also have this guy now this is
something that I am really really
digging this is a portable charger by
ravpower but it's not your typical court
of the charger you have your standard
USB port and even
USB type-c port but over here on this
flap you get an outlet and this is
awesome if you're on campus and
everyone's using up all the outlets you
want your own you have your own this is
probably one of the best things you can
put on a portable charger the ability to
charge a laptop and it has about 20,000
milliamp hours so you'll be able to
juice up your laptop with no problem
juice up your phone this is just great
it does come with a proprietary charging
cable but you can't beat the convenience
of having something like this if it
comes with its own cable deal with it
it's good this one goes for about 150
though so it's a big one the expensive
side this is the baller edition but the
ability to charge a laptop wherever you
are to something a student will
definitely enjoy but if I had this in
college oh man
Facebook call me RadioShack in college
because I had a bunch of tech with me
all the time the guy's a backpack black
was real that the readership we saw
prehistoric right now and right next to
our slot to the portable charger we've
got our external storage and it's inside
of a case because we want to keep it
safe this is an external hard drive by P
gate right here in this compact body
you've got 2 terabytes of storage use
USB 3.0 to get really fat there transfer
speed and I think this is a great option
for student so you can have everything
you need for your entire like let's say
your entire college career you can have
it all on this unless you're downloading
loads and loads oh please do so unless
you're down a ton and ton of videos
you'll be able to use this I think
throughout your entire college career
with no problem you'll have all your
documents on here photos throughout
college you can definitely take
advantage of this and not worry about
filling it up and this goes for about 70
bucks which isn't too bad since you're
getting two terabytes of storage but
since this is a mechanical hard drive
it's not like a solid state you want a
nice little case to protect it you know
how it is with kids and you know going
to school you drop your book bag you
throw your book bag
the place you don't want to get risking
my step so we got a nice little case in
there to protect it just in case you
know accidents happen well that's what
we've got going on over there up top
let's see we've got some ear buds now
these right here are a longtime favorite
of mine these are the shore XD to 15m
Plus now the M plus stands for mobile
I'm assuming because it comes with an
inline remote which these don't
typically come with but these are an
awesome pair of earbuds they fit really
really well in the rear so if you need a
really comfortable pair of ear buds you
can throw these in and what I really
like about these is that they have a
pretty flat design when they're inside
of your ears so it's very well inside
and because it's so flat if you're doing
something like taking a nap which
happens a lot in college you can
actually do that with these on even
though parsley put ear buds in your ears
but if it happens you don't have to
worry about this really hurting the ears
or digging into hard these are probably
the safest ear about to fall asleep in
with so I definitely can get great sound
quality great comfort and the ability to
take a nap screen college students this
is a great option and this also has some
compartments on the side but I only have
something in the right one microfiber
cloth keep your stuff clean stop playing
around but that's about it that's all
it's all inside of here and by the way
if you guys are interested in image of
stuff mentioned here links will be down
below in the description for all of it
now let's check out the main section and
this is where things differ a bit from
the main icon backpack so over here you
have your laptop compartment and as well
as other spaces for books and all the
things you needed to carry around so
here I've got a little book and you can
put a Pino textbook and all that kind of
stuff in here as well
and this right here is probably a slot
for tablets but instead of a tablet I
have a pair of headphones so this right
here are the ath mxr sevens now this is
by Audio Technica
and these are our solid pair of
headphones they've got some nice build
quality as well as a very very
comfortable fit so if you're on your
community or going to school or you're
you know going back home whatever these
are going to be very nice and
comfortable to wear and they sound great
this gives you access to high res audio
and there's also a noise canceling
version so if you're studying is you
want to focus on your whatever you're
studying and your music you can also get
that as well that's also an option I
have this guy engine noise canceling
version link down below there's
something you probably wouldn't expect
to see here is this guy the Amazon
echoes dot now hear me out everyone's
probably heard of echo dot but I think
that this is a really good option for
students
why because you can ask it a ton of
questions so if you're working on your
homework or you're doing a project you
need a quick question answered you can
just ask Alexa and then she'll get right
to it and I like the dot for this
because it's small you can kind of keep
it right there so I definitely suggest
picking one of these up if you don't
already have one and last but not least
in our laptop compartment I've got the
surfaced laptop now I know a lot of
people have mixed feelings about this
laptop but I think it's pretty awesome
this is the baller Edition so price is
less of an issue in this video so if you
want a pretty decent laptop that's very
compact very well built and designed
this is a great option this keyboard is
easily the best typing experience that
I've ever had on any laptop period and
Microsoft offers a bunch of different
spec options so you can configure this
to meet whatever your needs are but I
think this is a really good option if
you want something that compact has a
great screen its touchscreen a very
comfortable to use looks good and of
course you can definitely check out
things like the MacBook Pro I personally
use a macbook pro at my main computer
lot
up so that's something you can pick up
as well and there's also things like the
Dell XPS 15 so if you want something
that's a bit more powerful something
that has maybe a 4k screen there's also
that option as well so you're not
limited to just this surface laptop I
think for people who have a bigger
budget to spend on a laptop those are
some pretty good options out there but
that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it these are some
really great options to take to school
like I said one of my favorites is the
echo dot for the dorm line so if you
enjoyed it beautiful guys grow like is
it a thumbs up and I'll catch you in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
