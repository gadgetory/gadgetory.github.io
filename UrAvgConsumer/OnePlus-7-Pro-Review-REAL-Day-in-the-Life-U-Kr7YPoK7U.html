consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day-in-the-life with the
1 plus 7 pro and for those of you who
have never seen one of my real dating
life videos you're pretty much gonna be
spending a day with me and the phone as
we test out all kinds of things like
that new display battery live
performance and of course the new
cameras but let's check out how it did
today's actually launch date for the 1
plus 7 pro so we are headed over to the
event I'll snap a few pictures with some
other youtubers that will be there test
out the camera quality and we'll see how
it goes
and over here is where all the press and
media are going to grab their phones
thankfully I already got it
so I don't have to go and fight amongst
all the people but there's a cool little
spot full artwork over here I'll
probably grab some pictures and fill
them up and let you guys know what I
think all right guys so we are wrapping
up the oneplus event and now some that
has home but check out but I check out
in front of me it is kind of crazy to
check this out
the clouds are insane right now but the
dynamic range on this camera is pretty
legit
so you can see all those clouds very
clearly but I'm scared that it's going
to start pouring so I got to get back to
the studio alright guys so I am finally
back from the event it was pretty solid
um I got a chance to see a ton of you
guys over there and I decided why not
try out B front-facing camera there were
a lot of weird lighting conditions over
there
but the phone actually did pretty well I
was actually pretty happy with all the
selfies that I got and huge shots all of
you guys who came and said what's up
but front-facing camera and definitely
solid but we've got to talk about this
design guys I absolutely love the design
here I love the screen it being a 90
Hertz display we're gonna play some
games and see how much that impacts the
gameplay but like I said in my previous
video I just don't like these edges to
infinity edges I wish it was just
straight-up flat surface but it does
help it to look you know cool and
futuristic although I do wish it didn't
have it and just a quick battery update
for you guys we are at 68% now I've been
using it a lot to tweet
take all those selfies and do some video
so I used it quite a bit let's see what
the actual screen on time though is okay
so we got an hour and 28 minutes of
usage so that's a little bit less than I
expected but we're gonna see how it
lasts throughout the day hopefully we
want to use that warp charging alright
guys so right now about to have some
lunch I am watching black clover
is a really good show now I like the
screen a lot it's a good-looking screen
it gets pretty bright colors look really
good on it but like I don't want to harp
on these edges but it's just not
enjoyable to see the glare come in from
the top of and the bottom of the screen
come check this out
I can just see all of the light getting
picked up at the top of the screen to me
it just it creates this experience
that's just not ideal when you're
sitting down and watching something it's
been one of my biggest complaints about
Galaxy phones so don't think that I'm
just coming for one plus for this it
just sucks because it's a really good
screen it's just kind of distracting
with how deep these these edges are so
the 1 + 7 Pro has three new cameras we
have the standard lens over here as well
as a telephoto and a wide-angle I might
be pointing to the wrong ones
but either way there are those three
different lenses standard telephoto
wide-angle so we're gonna try that all
out but before we do that can we for a
second talk about how you get into the
phone so we all know this thing has that
pop-out camera so if you have the
feature on and you hit the power button
you'll see the front-facing camera pops
up so that it can do a face unlock and
it's actually really quick so I turn it
off turn it back on them kind of gets in
not as instantaneous as previous
versions that already had the
front-facing camera out but you know
I'll take it I don't mind seeing that
little camera pop up it's just really
fun I don't know if I'd get tired of
that I like it and it also has a
built-in fingerprint scanner or
fingerprint sensor people get kind of
crazy about that but all you do is press
that and your end and you can see that's
actually faster than those 60 which also
had this fingerprint sensor and I'm
actually really happy about that so both
ways to get into the phone whether it's
your fingerprint or your face the
biometrics on this are pretty quick just
came from Google i/o so we got these
little robots so we'll take a couple
shots of these boom one with a regular
lens get that and let's do wide where we
could even see the little buddy
so with the
standard lens I mean this is a super
clean photo the death is actually pretty
solid here this is with the telephoto
lens also very nice now the colors seem
a bit more muted I would definitely have
to do some editing to get a little bit
more color in here yeah and let's make
it seem like it's a bit darker than the
actual prop so for me personally it
looks plenty sharp but I would have to
mess around with the colors a bit if I
wanted to post any of this on social
media now I have to use my absolute
favorite feature when it comes to any
smartphone and that is portrait mode so
I'm gonna take a picture of this guy now
this is not an easy subject because it
has all these tears in the cape alright
so now we got the depth effect in place
now that should be interesting
his fins look like they got cut off a
bit oh but after it processed it
detected it just fine okay
not bad so I gotta say the depth effect
is very subtle and I'm gonna take a
picture a normal picture and see how
different it is the depth effect is a
lot more apparent now that I've seen
what a regular shot looks like so for me
personally this camera wouldn't replace
the picture for me especially since I
used portrait mode a lot and I do think
the colors are a bit better now one
thing about this front-facing camera is
that it's a lot more durable than you'd
expect you see this little thing pop out
you think it's a little dinky and weak
but one plus actually showed a video
today where they strapped a 47 pound
cement block to the camera and let it
dangle and it did not break it is
extremely impressive and check out this
drop test okay you saw that guys the
camera retracted as soon as it felt that
it was falling that yeah yeah I barely
let it go so you don't have to worry if
this thing Falls while the camera is out
it'll automatically retract and protect
the camera okay guys so I'm back home
now and it's pretty late it's 11 26 I've
got about 12 percent battery left and in
terms of the screen on time I'm looking
at
four hours and 32 minutes which I will
say is pretty surprising I definitely
thought this thing would last a lot
longer than that and I feel like I've
been using it a lot longer than that
not what I expected at the end of the
day but at least I get to try out that
work charge 30 so we'll see how fast
this thing charges now one thing that I
didn't really touch on is the overall
feel in the hand it's a nice feeling
phone but like this material right here
it's just gonna be a bit more slippery
it's kind of sucky to cover this up but
it is also scary to use this thing
without a case because it's a pretty
slippery phone if you guys can see right
here and what we've got right here guys
is a beautiful six point six seven inch
display huge display and what's nice
about it is that it is a full display no
bezels no nothing no not it just looks
absolutely gorgeous and it's a ninety
Hertz refresh rate so what that means is
it's going to be really smooth now you
might not notice it through the video
it's not very easy to see over video but
in person you'll see that this thing is
a lot smoother when you're navigating
the home screen or even playing some
games it is just a really really nice
touch now I do have games that take
advantage of that and that is let's see
this guy right here drag all your lost
playing games with the 90 Hertz refresh
rate is awesome it's not quite as good
as the 120 that we see with the razor
phone - or any of the other razor phones
but I will say guys it is nice to have
it here because the content just looks a
lot nicer this thing's got a Snapdragon
855 processor so that means it's going
to be really fast it's going to be able
to handle quite a bit so playing my
games and everything hasn't been an
issue that stupid garbage can always
opens up by itself
anyway playing games on this guy has not
been an issue whatsoever what's
interesting is being able to play games
and charge the phone
supposedly without it getting really hot
alright yeah so we got 10% and it's 1138
right now so we're gonna plug in this
work
charger and don't mind the fact that
this is the warp charger from the one
+16 McClaren edition it's still warped
arch dirty so it should charge the same
way but we'll see how long it takes for
this guy to charge okay guys so I got a
bit distracted so 15 minutes later and
whoa we're at 46% okay that's pretty
legit in terms of the heat this still
feels pretty warm maybe not as hot as
some devices would get but it doesn't
completely eliminate any heat or
anything so now we're playing a game
where I experienced the most throttling
when playing after the game gets hot and
that is sonic forces so we are going to
see how this thing deals with this extra
heat here oh are you kidding me
no all right whatever either way though
the performance on this was solid if
this were my iPhone and I was charging
it while playing this thing would
definitely slow down quite a bit
so at least it's good that this thing
can still keep the performance up even
though it's in the middle of charging
and look at this now we're at 56% so
even while playing this thing got a nice
boost in battery life all right
it is late I can't believe my phone is
halfway charged already but it is time
for me to go to bed put this thing to
rest but whatever we'll talk about the
whole thing in the wrap-up and that
about wrapped up today guys now it
wasn't crazy adventurous because my day
was pretty busy I actually had a lot of
work to do in the studio that's why you
guys saw it get so late for me but I
will say it was awesome seeing all of
you guys at the oneplus event huge shout
out to everyone who came up to me and
say what's up now I gotta say guys I
absolutely enjoyed using this phone it
is a beauty to look at is one of the
best looking phones on the market
besides those edges on the display I
have talked about that enough you guys
know how I feel about it I just wish it
was a flat display but nonetheless
it looks amazing and being in ninety
Hertz and being able to play games that
support it is it's just a overall good
experience
not to mention that nebula blue in the
back yeah it is a great looking phone I
absolutely love it now let's cut right
into it and talk about whether or not
this phone is a good buy I personally
think it checks off a lot of boxes
certain features are missing like
wireless charging official water
resistance or proofing or a rating for
that there's also no headphone jack but
2019 we're also missing a micro SD card
slot but those are pretty much all of
the major compromises this is an amazing
looking phone with amazing performance
this thing is super fast and smooth to
use the only thing that was a bit of a
disappointment to me was the battery
life now I only got about four hours of
screen on time which was really baffling
to me I kept it at 90 Hertz the entire
time if I brought that down to maybe 60
Hertz I'd probably get a little bit more
battery life out of it and also if I
maybe just kept it on full HD or HD plus
it probably would have saved some more
but I want the full thing when I'm using
my phone so it was kind of unfortunate
that it didn't last a bit longer oneplus
usually knocks battery life out of the
park but we do have a bigger display
here and with all those bells and
whistles like the 90 Hertz it is gonna
be impacted now to me the camera was a
bit hit or miss I was able to pull off
some really nice shots but I feel like
the characteristic of most of my photos
were just like Baelish they just seemed
kind of washed out with some photo
editing absolutely not a problem I can
fix that but I know most people average
people who pick this up might not be
doing any photo editing at all so that's
something to look out for camera quality
could be a bit better but I am 100%
happy with the fact that they included a
wide-angle lens
I think that this is the direction most
phone manufacturers are going nowadays
so it is a good thing to see it adopted
here now I do wish I was able to access
that wide-angle lens during video mode
that would be really cool but for some
reason I wasn't able to if you guys know
how leave a comment down below but I
couldn't figure that out and I wish I
could now this is this phone worth of
the buy at like six hundred and seventy
bucks absolutely it's amazing that this
thing even cost six hundred and seventy
bucks I know someone plus owners are
upset that one cos keeps pushing the
envelope when it comes to the price and
just adding a little bit more but
they're making the phones a bit better
and better every year so you got to
understand improvements do come at a
cost but at least they aren't charging a
thousand bucks this could have easily
been an $800 phone for another company
so I'm very happy with the pricing and
what the kind of specs that you can get
with this phone for the price that it is
this flagship quality guys so I highly
recommend this phone unless camera is a
huge deal to you then you might want to
be looking at something like the pixel
or even one of the Samsung Galaxy phones
but I do think that anyone picking this
up that's not super crazy about the
camera will absolutely enjoy their
purchase but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up is the 1
plus 7 Pro on your radar let me know
with a comment down below and I'm gonna
catch you guys in the next one so then
it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
