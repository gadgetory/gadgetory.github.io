to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video what's going on everyone is
Travers consumer and today I'm pretty
excited to be doing this video because I
finally got a review unit from one of
the companies that I reached out to and
I reached out to audio technica and they
sent me one of their new solid base
headphones and these are the 88 WS 70s
so I just want to give a big THANK YOU
to Audio Technica for sending me this
unit to unbox and review for you guys
and let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the 80 HW s 70s and these are part
of audio Technica's newer solid bass
line and what they're advertising with
these headphones is and it has
overwhelming bass and it has a pretty
nice um feature his double air chamber
system and with that what that means is
that it's um supposed to really help to
deliver a nice rich bass expression so
I'm definitely looking forward to trying
to bees out um pretty quick look around
the box it's a pretty nice simple box
shows you the headphones up front here
and of course it will give you some some
specifications in the back and here you
have the specifications in case you're
interested
so now let's jump into this unboxing so
let's see here right I think we can just
pop open the top and the first thing
we'll see here is we have some
instructions I'm sure like a user guide
like that so yeah this will definitely
tell you about how to use your
headphones and things like that so let's
put this aside for now and try and get
these out so
inside the box is pretty simple there's
nothing nothing in here really and first
things first we get the headphones and
it's pretty simple in boxing because all
you get here are the headphones here you
have two little plastic gun or these
little metal twist knees that you want
to untwist to get the headphones plastic
and then one holding down the headphone
cable
I'm very impressed at how sleep didn't
work all right so now that that's all
off Wow I must say I really do like
these this definitely feels really nice
and I liked a little nice little
all-metal feeling it has here definitely
feel I got a nice quality headphone hmm
let me give you guys a close-up of what
I'm seeing here so here we have the 88
WS 70s up close and the first thing
you'll notice is that these are some
really nice-looking ear cups they're
definitely very sleek and I like having
having a little bit of a metal feeling
on out on the outside of the ear cups so
that really makes it seem like some a
really nice quality um pair of
headphones and above the ear cups you
can see the adjusters here which seem
pretty simple easy to maneuver by just
pulling and pulling pulling up and
pulling down on the little switch here
which is pretty nice and you have a nice
little small bit of padding at the top
so very interesting the ear cuffs feel
pretty soft on the inside as you can see
this has on pretty circular ear cups so
I'm gonna see how well these work has
over here or if they're gonna fit
like on here headphones so we'll see
about that so alright guys that pretty
much wraps up this unboxing um there's
not much to what you get inside you get
the headphones of course and you get
some instructions and tips so that's
about it for the box I'm really
interested in seeing how these are gonna
perform
I'm definitely used to having a lot of
bass in my headphones so really looking
forward to seeing how how these compared
to what I'm used to already so that's
pretty much it guys
