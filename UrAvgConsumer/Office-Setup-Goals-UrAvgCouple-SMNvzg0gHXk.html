shooting location and Pete this is in
New York and this spot is so dope it is
amazing
this is my little setup here I've got
the FS 5 and the FS 7 and I'm going to
be shooting another backpack video so if
you want to look out for that that is
not the backpack that is just a stand-in
that's it right there but um yeah so you
guys can kind of get a look here at the
shooting location it's just ah I'm in
love with this place I would love to
have this app as an office or something
cuz oh man spiders dope anything gots
its rules come on now this right here
guys is goals for an office set up for
myself to me this is perfect
absolutely perfect whenever I get my own
office outside of my apartment this is
what I will be using as a reference cuz
I love it I want one and of course I
forgot something in the car so I gotta
go to back to this parking garage and
pick it up
I left the s7 that I've been using so
I'm gonna run down and get it I was
gonna take a while so just got a kid
pedal my 15 minutes but would it be so
bad if I wasn't working on a limited
amount of time I had a reservation from
8:00 to about 11:30 and it is 9:30 right
now so times against me I gotta kill
this video really quick still getting
used to juggling two phones I grab one
then automatically think I'm good to go

gonna come out very soon I cannot wait
everything was so gorgeous if you guys
ever need a space whether it's to do
work or a shoot a video or photography
or either has a bunch of awesome spots
you can use the app at the app is how I
found out about them you can use it have
to find the different locations they're
in a bunch of different cities so
they're in New York obviously since I'm
here they're also in Boston Toronto I
think San Francisco as well don't quote
me on that one but they're in a few
different places and it's pretty simple
all you got to just jump on the app find
a location that you like they have
pictures and whatnot and then you can
just reserve a spot like a time frame
that you want to be in there so it's
pretty cool pretty inexpensive too
