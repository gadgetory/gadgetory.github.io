consumer and it's time for another round
of ask you a see what kind of video have
you really wanted to do but are afraid
of what we might think all right now
this is an easy one you guys are seeing
that I've been doing these gaming PC
setup build if you're familiar with the
videos on my channel you know I have
this obsession with Gundams and Gunpla
and while I would love to make a whole
build based on Gundam
I don't think it's mainstream enough to
actually do well I think people might be
Gundams not know what it is and skip
over it so that's kind of the video that
I want to do but I'm not too sure how
you guys would feel about it what is a
piece of tech you never wanted to give
up now I'm not sure if you meant never
wanted to give up and had to or don't
want to currently give up but I'll
answer both now a device that I never
wanted to give up that I had to has to
be the Nexus 10
I love the form factor the feel in the
hand I just thought it was a great
device a ton of mexican obelisk came out
after it and I still went back to the
Nexus 10
it was absolutely my favorite but if not
getting the latest versions of Android
no updates together a little bit slower
had to give it up even though I loved it
now as for a device that I don't want to
currently give up I'm going to say the
PlayStation Vita the player can be that
is still getting some titles gaming
there but it doesn't have a ton of
support in games like the Nintendo 3ds
so while I still really really want the
Vita to do well and still come out a
couple of games I know it's not going to
happen but I'm keeping localized what
was your first Android phone I'm very
proud to say that my first Android phone
one is the first Android phone the
t-mobile g1 I actually still have it
it's in great condition I even have some
custom roms on there so that guy holds a
special place in my heart what is your
favorite food do you like Korean or
Japanese food which ones from each
favorite food of all time has to be
Pizza pretty unoriginal but things so
darn good so I definitely say pizza but
in terms of Japanese and Korean I love
Japanese food well meaning I went to
Japan a few months ago we beat on curry
and ramen so there's some really great
ramen spots in Japan
still trying to find a good one in
America but when it comes to Korean food
I can't say I've tried too many dishes
if you guys have any recommendations
that I must have let me know it's a
comment down below I know a couple of
spots that I can hit up if you guys give
me some good recommendations so let me
know favourite supercar now I am by no
means a car guy until I saw that BMW i8
now I've done enough research on the i8
to hear that car enthusiasts don't
really think of it as a supercar but I
don't care I love that thing it's a
supercar to me so if I ever can scrounge
up enough money one day that would be
the supercar that I get how do you like
your eggs I like them scrambled with
American cheese that simple when are you
announcing the Nintendo switch giveaway
I'm actually going to be announcing the
winner over on Twitter Saturday March
18th so be sure to check my page on that
day you might want to follow me so you
can keep up to date but definitely check
it out oh yeah it's true you don't know
about this which giveaway which you
probably do but if you haven't go check
it out I'll link to that video down
below
besides Gundam what other mecha anime or
just anime in general do you like hmm
other enemies with mechs I'd have just
have to say Joyce Joyce is what I
started with when I was much younger
definitely definitely enjoyed that next
with a animal robots type of deal it was
a great show as some markets that I want
to build on though when I will but I
have some of those but another one was
Eureka Seven actually really enjoyed
that one I'll have the names down below
in the description if you guys want to
check those out but I'd say those two in
terms of enemies outside of mechs I
really like anything with some real
competition whether it's awesome fight
scenes or maybe Battle of the minds or
even skills like shokugeki no souma
Kogi's there's a lot of mind games there
some awesome animes out like I said I
have links and names all down below
what's your favorite under $3,000 camera
and lens
whoa but this one I think I'd have to
say this only a 65 hundred with a meta
bones adapter and the Sigma 18 to 35 1.8
lens that lens is my absolute favorite
of all time I've been using it for years
and I'm using it right now in this video
gives you that nice shallow depth of
field Lemmon focus the backgrounds all
blurred out so I think that's an awesome
lend the a 6500 has some great 4k it's
pretty inexpensive it's under I think
it's like 1,300 bucks so I think
together they make a pretty decent combo
you probably get it for all together for
less than two grand so I say that did I
always like tech games in Pokemon or was
it because of you mmm what do you say
I'll take it
what do you think of the Nintendo switch
at the moment as the only best game
right now is Zelda breath of the wild I
am in love with the switch she'll
probably hear that from anybody who's
using it I think it's an amazing system
if Nintendo really really goes hard at
this I think it could be a game changer
I really think the switch could be
something awesome if they treat it like
they do the Nintendo 3ds and not like
the Wii U so I'm keeping hope alive but
this is going to be an awesome system
but so far I am in love with it best
choice for your death setups
Master Grade or perfect grade now that's
a Gunpla question and I'm going to have
to say Master Grade because they take up
less space perfect grades are pretty big
and they might not really stand too well
on a desk whereas a Master Grade has a
nice little stand trust me
Master Grade the way to go what camera
do you use to record your videos so many
ff7 for the body Sigma 18 to 35
millimeter for the lens if you weren't a
tech youtuber what kind of youtuber
would you have been I'm going to take
the easy way out here and say a couple
channel those things grow so bad nobody
cares a buck of quality so I would
definitely say that but that's about it
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
girl that gives this video thumbs
I'll count you guys to the next one
until then it's your average consumer
