consumer and October is going to be a
crazy month for tech so we're gonna
start off with Microsoft's a new surface
lineup and starting it off we're looking
at the brand new surface pro six now
first things first guys things in matte
black now everybody loves them that
black product this thing looks amazing
now the changes don't only come with the
whole new matte black body but we also
saw some changes with this display so
now the display has a better contrast
ratio and it also gets quite a bit
brighter so if you like to have a nice
bright display you're gonna be able to
do that here and this thing is packing
in cells eighth generation processor so
you're getting the latest chipset as
well as a claim of thirteen and a half
hours of battery life and this is also a
quad core processor and they actually
changed up the thermals and improve the
cooling so that it can handle all that
power and not get bogged down hopefully
we don't have to put this thing in a
freezer and it's crazy to see the kind
of power that we're getting from a 1.7
pound laptop tablet hybrid so this
surface pro 6 the best in the lineup I
definitely can't wait to do some tests
and the base model comes in at 899 with
an i5 processor and if you guys want to
preorder one it actually starts today
and while this thing has a lot going for
it guys one thing that it doesn't have
going for it is a USB C port there's
just none to be found anywhere on this
thing and that is a very very big
disappointment the surface go has it and
this doesn't so it's a little confusing
to be honest I really just don't know
when USB C's coming to this guy and the
surface pro 6 is dope but we also have
the brand new surface laptop 2 now this
thing also comes in that new matte black
design and guys this thing looks kohli
now this is an awesome looking laptop
and then it also has that all comes hard
fabric on the keyboard so it's nice and
smooth and with it being black you
really don't have to worry as much when
it comes to the durability of this guy
I'm not gonna lie I'm actually really
excited for this and they even improve
the internals here this thing is
supposed to be 85% faster so it is
rocking into eighth generation
processors as well so we're seeing the
spec bumps a lot of people said that
this was underpowered when it first came
out and Microsoft seems to have listened
here and increase the power
quite a bit and this guy supposed to get
14 and a half hours of battery life
which is just insane I can't wait to put
this thing to its paces and actually
test it out and really see if it gets
that much battery with everyday usage
but unfortunately guys this too is
missing a USBC connector so Microsoft
was actually really stoked at the fact
that this is supposed to be the finished
LCD touch display on a laptop and this
thing really is a gorgeous display one
thing that I really do like about the
surface laptop as a whole is the
keyboard typing experience on the first
surface pro laptop it was the best
keyboard that I've ever used on a laptop
period it feels like it's got the same
thing going on over here
this feels extremely nice to use so with
the surface pro 6 and the new surface
laptop 2 we're seeing improvements with
specs as well as the design with the new
matte black color but Microsoft actually
dropped a bomb on us with new surface
headphones and here we have them guys
these are the new surface headphones and
I didn't see this coming at all now when
I tried these on I was really surprised
at how comfortable they feel these
actually filled with jibt but what makes
these headphones special is the fact
that it has sliders on the ear cups now
on this side the right side control
regular stuff like your volume that's
pretty normal but on the left side you
can actually control the noise canceling
so you can control the level of noise
canceling that you have on this
sometimes noise cancelling can be a lot
so you can actually dial it down just by
turning the knob and if you turn it all
the way down you go into an ambient
noise mode but the ambient noise mode
you'll be able to hear their
surroundings while still listening to
your music so it uses the microphone
inside of the headphones to pick up the
things going on around you so you're not
completely unaware of what's happening
now with the right side of the ear cup
you also give touch controls so one tab
will play and pause your audio 2 taps
will skip to the next track 3 taps to go
back so just like you would have with an
inline
no you get all the same functionality
right here and what's kind of crazy
about these headphones guys which I've
never seen before on a pair of
headphones is you can connect it to 10
devices that is a lot of devices to have
on one pair of headphones usually the
max is like two I always think it's a
big deal if it can connect your laptop
and your phone at the same time but
being able to connect up to 10 that's a
game-changer this thing also uses a USB
type-c port to charge and with five
minutes of charging you get one hour of
battery life so you get one hour of
listening with just five minutes of
charging which is really really nice and
you guys know me I am a huge headphone
guy so I am extremely excited to try
these out and right here guys we've got
the surface studio 2 this is Microsoft's
all-in-one and with this this is pretty
much made for creators and the design
guys looks amazing as usual but what's
special about this thing is check this
out it can be tilted all the way down so
for those artists out there you can use
the surface pen and you know do your
drawing do whatever it is you do with
the pen but what's really special about
it this time around is that they've
updated the internals as well as the
actual display and with this new display
it can get 38 percent brighter which
means 500 nits of brightness so that is
quite a drastic difference here and you
can also get 22% more contrast out of it
so there's a lot of things here of
course with the Creator in mind who
doesn't want a nice beautiful screen to
look at and I'm telling you guys this
thing looks amazing now in terms of
internals we're looking at an Intel
seventh generation i7 processor I
definitely would have liked to see an
8th gen processor in here since this is
new but we've got some ginger but what's
actually pretty exciting is that in
terms of graphics they up the power here
as well so with a new Nvidia chip with
the Pascal architecture we're getting
about 50% more graphical power here and
what's also nice that you're gonna be
able to get an Nvidia 1060 or 1070
option depending on which one you choose
but that is nice because now we can
actually start gaming on the studio and
now it also has a 2 terabyte SSD so you
get those crazy speeds and a lot of
storage all in one it's an all the one
that makes you know kind of it works it
works and so you guys know the base
model for this guy comes in at 30
500 bucks so if your creator and you do
illustrations and graphic work you know
this thing is going to be a joy to use
and I've used the first one for it but
and it's definitely enjoyable but if you
want to learn more about this one I'll
have it linked down below in the
description but that about wraps it up
for this video guys tons of new stuff
from Microsoft a lot of things I wasn't
even expecting but that surface studio
really has my attention as well as the
map layout they all have my attention
Who am I kidding they all look really
really good I can't wait to try them out
you guys gotta let me know what you
think of them down below in the comments
section but I'll catch you guys in the
next one like I said
October's gonna be nuts so stay tuned
for a lot more new tech so then is your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
