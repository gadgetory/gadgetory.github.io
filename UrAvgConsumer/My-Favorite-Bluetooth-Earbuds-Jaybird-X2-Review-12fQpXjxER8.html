an awesome pair of Bluetooth earbuds and
the successor to the extremely popular
jaybird blue buds ex one of my favorite
ear buds of all time and I wanna give a
big shout-out to youtube for sponsoring
this video for its awesome stuff week
today's theme is Tuesday reviews day
when you get your hands on these you'll
find quite a few things inside the box
as you open it up you're greeted with
six different pairs of ear tips a
carrying case to hold your X twos and
any accessories you want to bring with
you a flat USB charging cable and a
pouch containing three pairs of
different sized ear fins and three cord
clips but we'll talk about those in a
second as for the x2 themselves not much
has changed in terms of the design from
the blue buds X but there are some
subtle differences like the rubberized
texture on the body of the earbuds and
they also come in quite a few colors
ranging from fire as you see here
charged midnight storm alpha and ice
pretty interesting set of color names
but you've got a few options to choose
from to match your style now as I
mentioned these are Bluetooth earbuds so
there's no long cable dangling to your
device which is one of my favorite
things about these it's tiny compact
design makes it unobtrusive and great
for travel and since it has a tangle
free cable if you choose to throw these
in your pocket or its case you won't
have to worry about any tangles or knots
when you pull them out and it's this
kind of portability that makes you one
of my favorite things to grab when
leaving the house the x2.is have a very
solid build quality and if these hold up
anything like the blue Bud's X you can
count on having them for a few years I
can throw them in my pocket or backpack
with no real fear that something's going
to happen to them but if you want to
make sure these will last you as long as
possible you should use the included
carrying case now when it comes to
comfort I have no problems with these at
all however everyone has different shape
here so comfort is a bit subjective
Jaber does offer quite a few different
options to help with that though
as I mentioned earlier you get six
different ear tips the standard silicon
tips that come in small medium and large
as well as some compliment it's that
come in two three sizes as well the
comple phone tips are new here with the
x2 and they're pretty awesome when
pressed you can see how the shape is
altered which is great when getting this
in your ear canal as it will conform to
the shape of your ear and help you get a
better fit and while talking about good
fit it's super important to use the
right sized ear tips with any air bud to
make sure you have a good seal so you
can get the best possible sound quality
j-bert also offers a few more things to
help in the comfort department like the
air fins I mentioned earlier which uses
the ridges in your ears to keep them in
place even if you're moving around quite
a bit
you also get cable clips which will help
decrease the size of the cable if you
want a tighter fit the excuse also
feature an inline remote so you can
control your music right from your buds
without having to take your device out
you have the standard play and pause in
the middle volume up above it and below
it volume down and I'm happy to report
the volume button is no longer make a
beat that interrupts your music when
you're adjusting it you can also use the
volume up to go back a track and the
volume down to skip to the next the
inline remote also has a built-in mic so
you can answer calls and have phone
conversations right from your ex twos if
you're big on working out you can feel
safe and knowing that these are sweat
proof so you can go hard for those gains
and not worry about damaging news and if
you are worried about these dying on you
during your workout session
don't these awkward eight hours of
battery-life so you'll definitely get a
few days worth of workout sessions with
these and if that isn't enough you can
pop open the flap on the right earbud
and charge them with a micro USB cable
they charge really quickly so you can be
up and running in no time
now of course we've got to talk about
the sound quality the ex tools are great
performers if you're looking for rich
punchy sound you'll be very happy with
these vocals are crisp and it has some
very solid bass so I don't work for a
wide range of genres I was really happy
with the sound from the blue buds x and
x 2.is definitely live up to the
reputation
and as far as recommendations go I
highly recommend the x2s but if they're
out of your price range the blue Bud's X
are still a very excellent option if
you're looking to save a little bit of
cash but I think the X twos are worth
saving up for and if you guys are
interested in picking it up YouTube's
got an awesome new shoppable feature
that allows you to get your hands on
these right from the video just look for
the eye on the top right and you're good
