consumer and this is the latest and
greatest from v-moda the v-moda
crossfade wireless - now these
officially come out today but I've had
them for a little while it's no secret
that I love V Motors line of headphones
with my favorite being the M 100 as you
can tell by the name crossfade Wireless
- these are v-moda second iteration into
their Wireless lineup and while I love
the performance of the first one it
didn't beat out that M 100 for me due to
the form factor the originals didn't
fold up like the m1 hundreds but these
do and with that I finally have the best
of both worlds if you need evidence on
how much more of a compact form factor
this is remoter pretty much switch from
their larger case from version one back
to the ones from the m1 hundreds which
were a lot smaller the only difference
here is these removable tabs that allow
your headphones to breathe after you've
used them for a workout or maybe an
intense DJing session now let's talk
design these here are the rose gold
version but they also come in a stealthy
matte black and white but the key
difference between all of these is that
the rose gold version features a
Qualcomm aptX audio codec which pretty
much means you'll get near CV Lite audio
quality when using bluetooth serious
audio files tend to complain that
Bluetooth quality doesn't sound as good
as wired so this edition is something
that should please them that has never
really been my complaint but hey it's
good to have now in terms of comfort
I've had some pretty smooth listening
sessions with these the new ear cushions
are improved from the previous model and
are larger and deeper which makes these
the most comfortable v motives right out
of the box so there's no real need to go
out and get XL ear cushions however if
they do come out with some for these I'm
not going to be mad at that another
improvement we're seeing comes from the
battery life you're going to get 14
hours of playback with this guy which is
an increase of 15% compared to the
originals so you should be able to use
these for a couple of long listening
sessions but if the battery does happen
to die on you you can always use a 3.5
millimeter cable that's included unless
you use an iPhone
seven but I know you guys all want to
know how these sound and I got to say
these live up to the v-moda sound
signature now these offer some great
clarity and amazing bass and if I'm not
the only bass level out there be sure to
hit that thumbs up button and compared
to the original crossfade
I feel like they even improved on the
vocals and if we're going on straight-up
specs they actually improve the sound
quality when these are wide as well I
just love the wavy sound if you're
looking for a solid pair of headphones
that have some awesome bass without
sacrificing things like vocals and
everything else
these are definitely where you want to
look I would love to see the addition of
the Qualcomm appx codec on the other two
models since I personally opted for a
more stealthy look but at least those
versions cost a bit less overall I love
that v-moda improved on an already
awesome set of headphones by making them
foldable and improving on the sound
quality I'm always battling between the
bose qc25 sports portability or the sony
MDR 1000x for its sound and features but
now the Crossgate Wireless to make it
that much harder for me to pick a
headphone for when I leave the house I
would have loved to see the price be a
little bit more consumer-friendly but
these are a solid pair of headphones and
a nice step away from the typical large
headphone branch that we always talk
about it's cool that v-moda offers some
nice customization for these as well so
whether you want some 3d printed shield
plates or maybe a custom logo on your
shield or a different color dream o2
offers that option which is something
you don't typically see and is in very
nice touch but that about wraps it up
for this guy's hopefully you enjoyed
this video if you did be the cool guy or
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
