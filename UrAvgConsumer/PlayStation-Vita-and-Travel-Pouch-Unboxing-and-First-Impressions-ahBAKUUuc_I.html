want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone
today is February 22nd which means is
the release day of the PlayStation Vita
so I decided why not do an unboxing
video for you guys alright let's check
it out alright so what I have here is
the PlayStation Vita itself I just got
one game marvel's ultimate armors capcom
3 and a travel pouch they seemed like
the best case for it as I don't really
plan to have anything on the Vita itself
it's just something to strike at throw
it at my bag and I picked up an 8 gig
memory card I'll probably replace this
with a 32 gig but those seem to be a
little hard to find right now I guess
more people are purchasing them then I
would have expected but this is what I
have right now and let's open it up
all right so now we finally got that
open arrow looks like I'm not really
sure these are the protection plan and
they are play cards not sure what these
are but well then we'll get back to this
in a bit
you have your Quick Start Guide Quick
Start Guide in French here you have the
Vita you have your USB cable and racy AC
adapter as well as some safety
instructions and that's pretty much it
for the Box well I don't plan on reading
any of these to you guys
so I'm going to put some of this stuff
back and here we have the data norito
looks feels pretty flat
oh this is a lot bigger than I thought
a lot a lot wider go since has the five
inch display the joystick feel pretty
nice here you have the camera it's
really nice it feels pretty solid it's
what you would expect I can already tell
that this is going to be a fingerprint
magnet the rear touch panel look feels
like it also be a fingerprint magnet I
wished it came with a microfiber cloth
look microfiber cloth like the old PSP
used to come with all right I'm not sure
if it has any power but let's turn it on
see what what happens okay so it does
come with some juice when you first get
it okay so it's directing me to swipe
this down nice little thing is it going
it doesn't seem like you can navigate
using any of the buttons as of yet I
guess it just they want you to use the
touch display to set it up so I think
I'll probably skip some of this stuff in
the video and I'll jump right to the
regular screen okay and here we have the
home screen gave a little introduction
video not too long ago and before you
guys set up your PlayStation account I
want you to update the firmware but so
far this is it um you can't seem to use
any buttons for the regular home screen
you can see that they do nothing here I
guess they just want you to use your
finger for this
all right this is pretty much it
alright so this is it I gotta keep the
video too long I just kind of wanted to
show you guys the travel pouch as well
in case any of you were interested in
purchasing it and just give you guys a
little look inside see will show you to
see what you get but I do like about the
packaging for the accessories is that
you kind of get an idea of what's inside
the material and how to use it so I
think that's pretty cool and here we are
seems like a very with pouch comes with
this filling here okay so it comes with
okay so the material is pretty some mesh
material this is I guess to hold your
game cards so you have four slots here
these two can hold on I guess to other
accessories I think I'll be putting my
charge well I would have liked to put my
charger but this is a little too big it
can at least take the adapter but I'm
going to find something to do it this
see how the PS Vita goes inside
this well seems like it'd be pretty
protected in here so I will actually
wouldn't mind using this all the time
and pretty much that's it guys you got
to look inside the travel pouch and the
Vita itself if you guys want to see any
other videos about the Vita feel free to
leave comments and ask me as many
questions as you want then I'll be sure
to get back to you as soon as I see them
alright guys just your average consumer
thanks for watching please feel free to
rate subscribe comment like and I'd
appreciate it
alright peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
