consumer and today we're going to be
spending a real day in the life with the
LG stylo 3 plus a phone that cost less
than $200 now if you've never seen one
of my real games of life videos this is
where I take you on a full day of usage
with the phone so I could let you know
how it holds up in the real world a huge
shout out to MetroPCS for not only
sponsoring today's video but putting
this phone on my radar but they asked
for a real day in the life test so here
we go
alright guys so right now we are at the
park and I got to test out the camera
first and foremost it's one of the most
important features on a phone to me so
I've got my dog cookie here we're going
to take a bunch of pictures with her and
see how it goes
oh ho you see that all right cook up you
want it all right we got one shot sit I
contact over here yeah yeah got a couple
of shots deadly good girl you deserve it
so let's actually take a look at one of
those pictures so not bad look at her
she's cute it actually looks really
sharp ok cookie you ready
kiss I missed it cookie
kiss kiss let's see if I got it let's
see if I got it
woo there we go alright so the selfie we
took really not that bad but once you
zoom in you can kind of start seeing the
imperfections here like some artifacting
so it does look a little weird when you
zoom in really really close but for the
most part it's not bad for the price God
keep that in mind this is actually
pretty solid so feature I'm really happy
to see on this phone is the fingerprint
scanner so I just tapped my finger right
here and it turns it on really quickly I
don't even have to press the button so
that is awesome definitely happy to see
that here alright guys so right now
we're headed to GPS store we got to
return some dresses that Ari didn't want
so let's go do this
so while I was taking care of that on a
person Pokemon go see there's anything
interesting around there's actually
pokey stuff out there I have to leave
her for a bit and go check that out
all right so that pokey top was kind of
far but I got me a little poliwag over
here now I know everybody's like a
Pokemon goes dead but you know me I
don't care who caught it haha
alright so I haven't had a chance to
check out the data speeds on MetroPCS so
I want to know where I'm merging with
throughout the day so I got speed test
open let's see what we've got
so it's testing the ping oh oh what this
thing was hitting thirties okay so looks
like we're capping out of Oh cut that
about 29 megabits so that is really
impressive little well of it in 29
before too so we got to see what that
upload is like it's not one-sided Oh
what Oh what the heck he'll come from
behind win let's try that again
let's see you can't just do one you know
that download speed is impressive 30 yo
it's like Jonah oh okay
37 down uploads what
that's quite dirty nah that's not well I
don't know I'm in New Jersey so he
speeds all right over here wow that is
crazy good alright so I think it's safe
to say we'll do all that for the rest of
the day about that I was insane
so hours angry to somebody's account
there
well right now we're using the GPS as oh
well we're using the phone as a GPS
because we're going to go get some ramen
some Japanese curry and we are super
height but we also have been putting
this battery through its paces
we've been playing Pokemon I've been
playing Pokemon girl I've been using it
as a GPS here and we took a bunch of
photos and videos worth cooking yeah
we've got 20 minute car right oh yeah
yeah yeah so we'll be using it for a
while what's it out right now can you
see 73%
we're a good chunk of the way in in
terms of the day so not bad this has a
3000 milliamp hour battery I think it's
3050 milliamp hours so it's a pretty
sizable battery should last throughout
the whole day hopefully all right well
as you guys can see we are at Gundam
Planet had to make a quick pit stop
before we got some ramen but we have
about 66% left and how long overdrive
was up that's 25 minutes 25 minutes so a
lot of GPS battery definitely took a hit
but we'll see how long it lasts
throughout the rest of the day all right
so right now we're done the planet so
this is the perfect place for some
indoor shots and there's just so much
goodness around but instead of a Gundam
limping picture of this little tiny Goku
over here so we could get from this not
bad well no absolutely
mmm a little soft I'd say the center is
fine but it looks like around the edges
it gets really soft well maybe because
he's further back it might just be a
traditional thing let's see if I move
him closer okay it was actually just out
of focus now let's try this again okay
so this is the newer one let's see
Goku sharp he looks good yeah piccolo
was just out of focus before not bad
Instagram where D I'd say yeah so he has
been known to take hours shopping for
Gunpla and I'm not interested in that at
all so I figure I'll catch up on the
mcclure twins they these are my favorite
little things to watch they're so cute
imma to myself I know if you guys know
that but I am and I just see me my
sister and I'm so much
cute but this is a perfect time to look
at the display and talk about a little
bit so wait a 5.7 inch display here
which is pretty nice it's nice and big
perfect for watching YouTube videos and
we have a 1080p display as well so it
looks really really good I'm liking the
thin bezel at the top and the bottom but
yeah definitely complacence from the
display it's nice and bright colorful
what it is guys so here is the food and
it looks amazing I'm so excited so I got
to take some pictures let's see how the
new camera does with a some food shot
off it so they're the ramen though let's
see oh the pictures are good Wow these
will be really good like hi I'm really
surprised this really honestly does not
feel like a budget phone battery life is
pretty good so far - I've got 49% and
I'm over 2 hours of screen on time so
it's looking really solid for about one
hundred nine bucks
alright guys so we finished eating food
we're actually recording this section of
the video with the LG silo but this
camera records in 1080p so you're
getting 1080p footage you're also
getting the audio from the camera so
this is what you can expect it to sound
like look like okay that's not what you
think
alright guys so we're back home got the
phone in hand first off do you guys see
this desk do you see how things have
changed already we got a bigger desk and
a date through a bunch of makeup on here
but I can't complain I have my own set
ups in other places so you know she's
doing okay we either way this is the LG
stylo plus 3 right as we've been talking
about and the reason why it has that
name is actually because right here you
got a stylus and as you can see you get
a couple of different little menu items
over here you can just drag this thing
put it wherever you want and get access
to these little items so pretty much
this is good for like writing notes
let's say you want to jot something down
really quickly or maybe even do a screen
capture let's say no to that and then
add something to here so let's say I
want to highlight this boom so you can
easily do something like this whenever
you want so you know cool little
features honestly I've never been much
of a guy who uses the stylus much in the
phone so like in your note series
something like this I'll probably don't
see myself using it that much but it is
super useful when you have to sign
documents and send stuff like that over
which I have to do a lot so I there is
some use for it so if you like that kind
of feature it's available here I got to
say that I just found a pretty cool
feature of this little pop lens right
here you can actually use this and drag
around the this little magnifying glass
which could make it a lot easier to tap
things that are typically small on a
screen like this so like small text you
can go ahead and grab this make it that
much easier to click I think that's
actually pretty cool so right now it's
like the crack of dawn it's like 255 in
the morning I spent a lot of the day
working on this video that I have coming
up so doing a few videos at once had
this one in this other video that shot
but besides that I really wasn't on the
phone to the end of the day I still got
about 17 percent left and we're looking
at almost four hours of screen on time
so three hours and 54 minutes and I
gotta say this thing was pretty much a
trooper we beat it down with a ton a ton
of GPS stuff from home on go to using
the GPS to get home and back from the
ramen spot we really put it to work in
terms of battery life so three hours and
almost four hours of screaming on time
seems pretty good to me I'm really
really too surprised that this phone as
a whole I really didn't expect it to be
much of an experience because it's
it's 180 bucks at this price claim the
quality that you're getting here is very
surprising so job to LG for putting out
a really good phone this is something
that I can see myself recommending to
like older family members who don't
really care for all the bells and
whistles we'll want a good phone that
they can see easily on since I have a
huge screen and just performs well a
pretty good battery life and it's waffle
bowl - yeah so you can even swap out the
battery lots of good stuff going for
this phone now something I've told you
guys before I'm not a fan of the LG
homescreen that does not have an app
door because it can just get super
cluttered some people really don't care
but for me I don't really like this
because I just don't like having my apps
everywhere but there is a solution of
being able to use the homescreen with an
app drawer and unlike the LG G 6 this
one looks a lot cleaner so here you can
see it I can just access the app drawer
right there and I've got everything that
I need right there instead of having it
all over the screen and of course you
can always go with the Google now
launcher or something like that - so you
can switch it up however you want but I
am liking the fact that the version with
the app drawer looks nice and clean now
in terms of performance I'll be honest
with you guys I haven't had any issues
you guys saw me playing pokemon go
earlier and right now I'm just playing
some Mario run I really haven't
encountered any games that could slow me
down and all the basic stuff like
snapchat and Instagram Twitter all that
stuff runs completely fine whoa what
happened there
anywho everything runs completely fine
so like I said no issues honestly it's
just really really surprising the kind
of quality and performance you can get
out of a sub $200 phone this is
definitely one to look into if you're on
a budget so there you guys have it we
spent a full day with the phone and I of
course spent some more time with the
after that
give you guys a better formulated
opinion but I got to say I was
completely blown away by what you can
get for less than $200 but this phone is
imperfect it has a really solid 5.7 inch
1080p display which is huge and I was
able to watch all of my favorite things
with no problem but I got to say it the
speaker placement is pretty weak and
it's got all the features you come to
expect like a fingerprint scanner micro
SD card slot for expandable storage on
top of the 32 gigs it comes with a
stylus for those of you who are
interested in that as well as the almost
extinct replaceable battery and speaking
of the battery this one has a pretty
decent one as you guys saw it lasted
throughout the day with a bunch of GPS
activities and camera tests now the
camera is what I do think the pricing
shows a bit my issues with the camera is
that unless you have a steady hand it
seems like you can run into some issues
with blurry or soft pictures this
definitely isn't the camera you want to
take own photography or video seriously
with but if you're just looking for
something to throw some pictures on
social media or maybe just capture a
moment this will definitely do the trick
performance wise I didn't feel limited
at all since I was able to do all of my
daily activities with no problem now we
all know that this isn't going to
compete with the galaxy s 8 of the world
but if you have or maybe you're
interested in metro pcs
they do offer the galaxy s 8 as well as
a bunch of other premium devices but
that's about it for this video guys this
is a great budget phone that I honestly
didn't know is this good so if you're
looking for something under $200 this
should definitely be on your list and if
you're interested in me looking at more
phones at this lower price range and
kind of weeding out which ones are the
good one
let me know if or comment down below but
if you enjoyed the video be the cool guy
or girl that gives it a thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
