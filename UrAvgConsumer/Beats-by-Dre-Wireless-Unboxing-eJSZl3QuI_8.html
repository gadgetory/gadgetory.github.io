want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey guys the Sierra
consumer and today we have the beats by
dre the Bluetooth wireless headphones so
here's what the beats Wireless and
they're pretty much like the solos I
believe the solo HDS but Wireless works
group without the wires no cables
involved and VA let's give it a let's
check it out well of course standard
piece packaging seems to be a little
flap right here much oh okay okay so I
guess that's just a little flat for some
other languages here and let's get this
out okay a little different from the
solos but they look like solo like solo
packaging company same kind of carrying
case I mean the books like a non-user
guys uh still comes with a cord I guess
I guess beats they changed up their
their cables now they have a bit of a
new design here and if you see it well
but it's a little more just a little
more rounded you can kind of see a
little red inside as if the cable is
going through this it's pretty cool I
like this
on microfiber cloth so more beads
products information on my shoulders
hoping might be a sticker pretty cool
stuff
there was packaged this up nicely now
let's get to the back was this is a
little different than the solos I can
see already as it has like a little red
zipper the soles are all black very
shiny OD Thunder exactly like so you're
very back you do a pretty different the
cushion is a lot wider the hole is
smaller you see I have supposed to do
some solos here so here we have the
solos as you can see yeah this comes so
this is considerably well not
considerably but this is definitely
greater than the solos and yeah the cup
size is also very different they have
the general feel of the solos but where
I said these are definitely a bit bigger
so I'm not sure how that that goes as
far as output goes for that I don't know
if it performs better than solos but
we'll see here we have some stickers on
here basically like just some
explanation it's got to play next back
volume volume up and down some pairing
how to pair the power button up there on
this side you know if you have any
problem got customer service numbers
here um but yeah that's pretty much it
really everything else seems pretty solo
HD ish besides the new new cable that
comes with it I guys if you feel like
putting in the cable this should be this
would be something else there okay the
charger and so yeah and inside the pouch
you dig a little dig find the charger
put that right in here on the side and
has the USB plug it in and it is
Bluetooth so you know have you recharge
a battery inside and guess you just plug
in here hmm seems a little cramped spot
for it to get this in but it works
yeah so it's pretty cool I'm gonna have
a review up for you guys about this and
um so that I can so it was pretty cool
I'm gonna test it out with um an iPod
touch as well as an Android phone other
devices my macbook as well I was gonna
let you guys know how I see it in
comparison to as always these the tour
is the funny thing you guys let me know
if you want any kind of comparison if I
don't have the studio so I can't compare
to that or the pros by definitely mixers
be solo HDS in the tour so if you guys
have any questions feel free to ask them
and I'll have a video for you guys
totally ok that's about it so if you
guys feel feel free to comment message
