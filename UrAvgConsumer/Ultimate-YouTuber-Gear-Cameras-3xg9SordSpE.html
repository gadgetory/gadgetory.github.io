and I get a lot of questions asking what
kind of camera or mic that I use so I
decided I'd make a little series where I
talk about all of the equipment I use to
make my youtube videos and today we're
gonna be starting off with video so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it and alright guys I just want to
start off by saying you won't need the
level of equipment that you see in these
videos to start your own YouTube channel
but this is what I required over time to
reach a certain level of quality but
with that said let's talk about the most
important part of video making the
camera I used to so many fs7 and it is a
beast of a camera I was invested in one
of these when I was making my jump to 4k
and it records 4k internally all the way
up to 60 frames per second and it
couldn't even shoot 1080p at 180 frames
per second for some super buttery smooth
slow motion it produces some amazing
image quality shout-out to Team crispy
and it gives me more than enough room to
mess with my clips when it comes to
color correcting or any other
post-production it's a little bit on the
larger side but it is made for running
gun you can throw it up on your shoulder
and use that extended arm control to
kind of get a good stabilized shot out
of it and so far I'm loving the fs7 it's
everything I've wanted in a camera I'm
very pleased now you might have noticed
the giant monitor attached to my fs7 and
that is the animal Shogun it's an
external 4k recorder that allows you to
record in 4k to an SSD now that's
actually one of the biggest reasons I
use it for K can take a ton of space and
being able to strap it onto a one
terabyte SSD makes running out of space
a non-existent issue not to mention it's
an awesome giant display with tons of
great tools to help me see what I'm
recording super clearly and of course
with the camera like the FS Evan you've
got to have some decent lens options I
keep around a Sony 16 to 70 millimeter
constant f4 zoom lens so I can get those
really sharp and close-up shots of
products as well as a Rokinon 24
millimeter F 1 point 5 prime cinema lens
which is a dope lens with a manual
pitcher rain and shout out to Jon from
TLD for putting me onto that lens and my
absolute favorite lens of all time the
Sigma 18 a 35 millimeter constant F 1.8
lens whoo I used to rock this guy with
my Canon t4i as well as my Canon 70d and
I've been in love ever since it's got
really nice sharp images and it's got
ton of bokeh not as much as that Rokinon
but it is amazing and it's super sharp
so I am in love with that lens highly
recommended and for those of you who
watch the vlogs and always asked what
I'm recording with I use the Sony rx100
Mark three and this is an amazing little
pocket camera with some crazy image
quality now I'm not sure if it's the
best camera for vlogging due to some
pretty slow autofocus during video but
it's been working out pretty well for me
and you guys seem to really like the 60
frames per second we typically shoot
them in one of the major selling points
for me with this camera was the swivel
screen so I can make sure I was in focus
while recording and some of you have
seen my articulating arm and pistol grip
combination
pretty much a homemade selfie stick for
my vlog but they do it for the vlog and
this is what I pretty much use to get my
vlog images but that's pretty much the
hardware side of what I use to capture
video but now let's talk about some of
the stuff that I used to actually edit
I'm on the final cut pro 10 bandwagon
and it's one of the first real video
editing software's I've used besides
Windows Movie Maker
but it's been a great experience for me
so far and it was actually really really
simple to pick up it didn't have a crazy
learning curve re picked it up also so
it's actually really nice and simple
while it still offers a ton of great
tools I haven't found any tools missing
from it to accomplish what I needed for
all of my videos so I've been very
contented with it now you're not gonna
get anything crazy from it like Adobe
After Effects but I've never needed to
stray away from Final Cut Pro it's been
a very smooth experience and that's
where I do all my video editing super
simple even good for beginners now I
know a lot of you watching who want to
make video are wondering how do I make
my videos look better or seem more
professional well if you haven't heard
of graphic stock it's definitely
somewhere you want to start they offer
unlimited downloads from a library
of over 250,000 graphics and that
includes high-res vectors infographics

stocks entire library start off with
some free graphics sounds good to me but
that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it so today we
started off with the video side of
things next time we'll jump into audio
and accessories and if you guys want to
