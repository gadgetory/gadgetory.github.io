consumer and today I'm going to be doing
a bit of a speaker volume test on the
iPhone 5 so that's not wasting time
let's get right into it so I took to
Twitter and asked you guys what kind of
iPhone 5 videos would you guys like to
see and I got a good amount of responses
some people wanted to hear about the
audio quality of the speaker on iphone 5
so I figured why not do a series of
tests in different environments to kind
of give you guys an average consumer
experience something it's you know some
test where typically you'd find yourself
in that situation using these speakers
so here's the first one I tried it out
indoors and this is what we got
oh yeah who is this oh I like the
wireless but we were told on who are you
and how'd you get my number alright so I
guess you guys heard that pretty clearly
um I was fairly surprised at how good
the actual speaker was indoors it's got
some good volume on here I my first
iPhone so I don't really I don't know if
the previous iPhones had great speakers
but this one definitely surprised me
indoors so I took it outside try to see
how it sounds with like you know people
around that cars going by and here's
what we got
hey B what's going on man nothing much
I'm actually making a video right now
testing the speaker on the iPhone 5 well
I mean the iPhone 5 just came out and
there's tons of people interested in it
on YouTube I mean that might be true but
I mean I
some people like iOS and some people
like I think that was going um overall I
think that the speaker was pretty loud
outside definitely good
I was definitely heard by the people
around me um overall I don't know if you
guys were able to really pick up on what
he was saying but it was really clear in
person so you go by my word that it's
very loud and like I said the speaker's
really projects so definitely a good job
outdoors as well as indoors so now I
wanted to give another you know average
consumer kind of scenario and I figured
a lot of times when you're using speaker
either indoors outdoors or inside a car
so I did a test inside of a car while
moving it's kind of so you guys can see
your phone you know how it sounds well
side there so here that is right now
hey are you ready yeah we're about to be
there right now
um can you bring me a bottle of water
too please yeah I think I think one is
fine
should be good no I'm good thanks and
there you have it guys all three tests I
think the iPhone 5 performs really well
as far as the speakers go these are
probably the best speakers I've ever
heard from a phone
I thought the HTC One S was really loud
but this has really really loud speakers
definitely variant very impressed by the
iPhone 5 speaker definitely did a good
job very happy with the quality of it
and I don't think that you guys should
have that as a concern if going on and
purchasing the iPhone 5 so I hope you
guys enjoyed this test if you guys enjoy
these average consumer scenarios where I
test products and you know scenarios
like that then please feel free to give
this video a thumbs up so I know and let
me know down in the comments below as
well and I'll continue to try and do
these real-life scenario situations
where you're using products so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you liked
it please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe and I'll catch you guys in the
next video
till then there's your average consumer
