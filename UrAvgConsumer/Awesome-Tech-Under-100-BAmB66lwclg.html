consumer today we're going to be talking
about some of the best tech you can find
under $100 let's start off with the
Logitech g600 Wireless Gaming Mouse it's
got a very ergonomic design and feels
great in the hand but what really stands
out about this mouse is the multitude of
buttons available you get six macro
buttons on the left side which is easily
accessible by your thumb and you also
have two additional buttons on the side
of your main two with the companion
software you can map keyboard shortcuts
to each button on the mouse which is
great for gaming since you can link your
most-used
actions right to one of the buttons now
while this is a gaming mouse I've got to
be honest I found that a lot of its
gaming aspects are really useful when it
comes to my video editing only drawback
with this mouse is the need for a dongle
and two double-a batteries but luckily I
haven't had to change the battery and
forever so no worries there I know
everyone lives by the performance MX or
the MX master but this is personally my
favorite mouse as its super comfortable
to use and offers a ton more
functionality next up we've got the
audio technica ath m4 DX this is the
little brother to the m50x and if you
don't quite want to spend the cash on
the m50 s this is where you should be
looking it features a very similar look
with its over-ear design although it is
slightly slimmer and lighter it's got a
sturdy build but it's still pretty
flexible and can be folded down to a
very compact size which makes it nice
for traveling the ear cups are large and
since this is an over air design they're
quite comfortable although admittedly
the RS office the m50x but should still
be fun for long listening sessions the
ear cups can also rotate quite a bit but
they don't have the full rotation of the
m50 s but honestly I don't think that
matters at all unless you have some
really specific rotation needs the m4 DX
also comes with two detachable cables a
three meter coiled cable as well as a
straight one now when it comes to sound
quality these things are quite
surprising considering the price you can
find them for we offer some pretty nice
clarity and although they aren't very
bass heavy they still do the trick to be
completely honest they sound very close
to the m50x and with a slightly slimmer
body I think this makes the m4 TX a must
grab if you're looking for something
like the M 50s but don't
I want to shell out the cash for them
now for something you can use outside of
the office
we've got the IATA easy OneTouch car
mount this is an awesome car mount
because it has a ton of flexibility and
you can get just about any kind of
positioning you can think of with this
thing this car mom's grips are
adjustable so it can support just about
any phone out right now
large or small it's easy to open up the
grips and simply placing the phone into
the cradle and it'll press the button on
the back that'll lock it in place and
you're pretty much good to go there are
tons of adjustable knobs so you can
tweak the placement of your phone so you
can get the perfect positioning in your
car and to be honest I was really
surprised with just how adjustable this
thing is and that's because you can
change the angle of the arm up to 180
degrees and even extend it if you'd like
to get the phone a bit closer to you the
cradle itself can be rotated and locked
into place so your phone can be set into
portrait or landscape mode but one of
the biggest features of this car mount
is the ability to wirelessly charge your
phone if it supports qi wireless
charging plug in the mount with the
included car charger and you just throw
your phone into it and it'll immediately
start charging and if your phone doesn't
support wireless charging you can always
use the regular cabled method if you're
looking for a sturdy and flexible Karmel
this is definitely the way to go
next we've got another computer
accessory from Logitech and that's the
Logitech k-8 11 easy switch keyboard
this keyboard has been my go-to for
quite some time now and this version is
for the Mac so it has the typical Mac
shortcuts at the top but there is a
Windows version available with Windows
specific keys as well it's biggest
feature is the ability to easily switch
between three different devices with the
push of a button using bluetooth and it
does this super quickly
that's the name easy switch but that
isn't the only reason I like this is
also easy on the eyes with its glossy
and aluminum finish which lets it easily
fit in with my current setup and it's
backlit so working in the dark is of
course no problem and it's also Wireless
which is pretty much a must for me it's
rechargeable using a micro USB so no
need to keep any batteries on deck if
it's running low on juice you can just
plug it in and continue using it or let
it charge it's also got a very slim
profile so it's pretty compact and even
works well if you decide to use it while
traveling the keys are nice and tactile
and it's very comfortable to type on
which makes it one of my favorite
keyboards to
right now and last but not least we've
got the Amazon fire 7-inch tablet now
this is a $50 tablet let's let that sink
in for a second it's a $50 tablet now of
course you should be expecting iPad or
Galaxy Tab quality from this guy but
this is an amazing price point for a
super entry level tablet now we aren't
going to go into specs because they
aren't impressive and at this price
point you shouldn't expect them to be
but after spending some time with it I
think it's safe to say that this is
perfect for kids or anyone who is into
tech savvy one thing I will mention is
that it has 8 gigs of storage but it
does have a micro SD card slot so you
can easily expand that up to 128 gigs
it's also got a pretty sturdy build so
giving it to a kid shouldn't be too
stressful and it even has a built-in
rear and front facing camera although
you probably shouldn't expect much from
them with this you're getting Amazon's
version of Android which doesn't give
you access to the full Play Store with
all of the Android apps but Amazon does
have an app store with a bunch of the
most popular apps and then some so you
won't be missing out on too much and if
you're a Prime member you get access to
quite a bit of content as well and even
though it doesn't have the best specs it
still performs fairly well I was able to
use it without any issues and if your
expectations are in the right place this
will feel like an easy investment entry
level or not it's pretty amazing that
Amazon is able to sell smart device like
this for as low as they are but that
about wraps it up for this list guys if
you enjoyed these past few videos of my
tech recommendations under a certain
price range be the cool guy or girl who
leaves this video a thumbs up and a
comment down below if you want to see
more videos like this or even if you
want to see some a different price
ranges if you haven't seen my other
bunch of videos I'll throw links down
below in the description but total next
one guys at your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
