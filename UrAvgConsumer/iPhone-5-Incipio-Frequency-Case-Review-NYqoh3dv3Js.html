consumer and today I have another review
for you guys of the incipio frequency
case for the iPhone 5 so let's not waste
any time let's get right into it here I
have everything included in the
packaging laid out to the left we have
the packaging that the case comes in
itself then the actual case here and I
must say I'm a huge fan of the design
also if you take a close look you'll
notice that the iPhone has a screen
protector the screen protector was also
included with this case moving on we
have the microfiber cloth that was
provided and it's not that great but it
does the job and we also have a little
kickstand for keeping your phone in
landscape orientation and it doesn't
really take much to put this thing
together and can sometimes come quite in
handy this little kickstand is pretty
cool and ideal for watching movies
during a short break or on a small
surface we've got some unbox tool
playing here and as you can see it gives
us a pretty good angle for watching some
dudes get beat downs now it's time to
take an actual look at the case as I
mentioned before I'm quite a fan of its
design it's pretty slim and doesn't add
any real bulk to the iPhone which was a
pretty big criteria for me as many cases
were just too bulky and took away from
the iPhone slim design this case also
allows the iPhone to lay on a table on
its face without fear of scratches due
to the raged edges as you saw there
moving on to the back of the case you'll
see my favorite part the design reminds
me of a honeycomb and I typically don't
like designs on my cases but this one
actually looks pretty good in hand the
case of course has a cutout for the
camera and flash it also has this long
indent going to the right and I haven't
quite figured out what the purpose of
this was outside of the design but
there's no harm done in having it there
I found the buttons very easy to press
which was another important factor in
picking the right case you get good
feedback when pressing them so you don't
have to worry about needing too much
pressure
the me switch is also easy to access
from the cutout and I had no issues
using it at all the power button is also
quite easy to press and as you can see
here I have no difficulty using it to
turn the phone on and off rather quickly
towards the bottom of the phone we can
see the cutout for the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack lightning connector and
speakers using the headphone jack and
lightning cable is also very easy with
these cutouts as you can see here I'm
using an l-shape headphone cable with no
problem and moving it around is also
easy despite being very close to the
case itself so that's always a bonus
overall I'm very happy with in scipios
frequency case it doesn't offer as much
protection as an otterbox but it keeps
the slim form factor of the iPhone 5 I
definitely recommend this case as it
will still protect your iPhone from
light impact and scratches while still
being visually pleasing and that pretty
much wraps up my review of the incipio
frequency case for the iPhone 5 if you

for watching this is your average
consumer and till the next one guys
