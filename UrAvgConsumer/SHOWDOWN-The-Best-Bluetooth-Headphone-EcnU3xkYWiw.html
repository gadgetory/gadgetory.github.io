good luck what's going on guys to
drivers consumer and today we've got a
showdown of some of the best noise
cancelling headphones on the market and
in our lineup we've got the sony MDR
1000x the bose QC 3 5s and the
sennheiser PXE 550 s now we're gonna
compare these in a few different
categories and see which one comes out
on top so as we go on and we rank these
I'm going to be assigning them points
third place will get one point second
place will get to and first place will
get three so that's going to be an easy
way to tally it up at the end and see
which one actually comes out on top so
the first thing we're going to do is
compare the design now looks as
subjective but I'll give you guys my
opinion anyway and we're going to start
off with the Sennheiser pxc 550 s now
I'm starting off with these because
they're pretty much my least favorite
now these aren't bad looking headphones
whatsoever but I gotta say I'm not a fan
of the egg-shape ear cups but everything
else about it is pretty standard you got
a standard headband they stretch out
just as much as you would want them to
some ties are also able to minimize the
buttons on the 550's by including a
touch panel on the right ear cup that
you can swipe up and down for volume
controls double tap or play and pause
all those kind of things which is a
really awesome feature that we're going
to touch on a little bit later now
second up we've got the both QC 35 s now
for the standard version I would put
that in second place but what you're
seeing right here is one of
kind and these are actually customized
by color we're so in terms of the color
you've got my logo and this little teal
accent at the top this is all custom
made by color where they can change a
ton of different gear so from headphones
two keyboards PlayStation 4s all kinds
of cool stuff you can actually get them
to customize it now when it comes to the
regular QC 35s and not this beauty I had
to rank it in second place while it
doesn't have a touch panel like the
Sennheiser's I do like to overall shape
a bit better and it actually leads to
better comfort which is our next
category but I just think that these
look a bit cleaner and have a better
shape than Sennheiser's and in first
place if you couldn't tell we've got the
sony MDR 1000x now I like these because
they've got a really really sleek design
and just like the Sennheiser this has a
touch panel so you can control all your
music right from the side of the air cup
without having a ton of buttons and the
buttons that are here are pretty flush
so it gives it a nice discreet look and
one thing that's cool about all of these
headphones is that they're all foldable
which makes packing and carrying them a
lot easier and they can all be folded
flat on a desk which is also a very nice
feature next category is Comfort and
this is gonna be pretty quick but in
third place I'm gonna have to go again
with these Sennheiser's now these are
really nice ear cups don't get me wrong
they do have a nice little egg shape
which is pretty cool because it'll get
your ear in there but I did find that
it's a pretty tight fit so my ears ended
up touching the cushions quite a bit and
with that you can get ear fatigue after
using these for a long period of time
very comfortable when you initially put
them on but it is a bit of a tighter
feel next up I'm gonna have to go with
the sony MDR 1000x
now the reason why I'm going with this
for second place is that it's got some
good spacing on the ear cups the only
thing though is that it doesn't have a
lot of padding so this one isn't quite
as comfortable as the QC 35 s nothing
wrong with the design here but I really
do think that the design of the ear cups
on the QC 35 are just great these have
amazing ear cups very very plush I can
wear these for a long period of time out
feeling like I'm getting
ear fatigue or listening fatigue this is
a very awesome pair of headphones in
terms of comfort which is why these are
our favorite for travelers now let's
move on to the next category which is
features now these are all premium
headphones and something they have in
common is noise cancelling and that
their bluetooth headphones you guys know
I'm a sucker for bluetooth but when it
comes to features I'm gonna have to put
this guy in third place this really
doesn't have many features besides the
fact that it has noise cancellation it
does its job really well but it's pretty
much a one-trick pony
you've got that active noise canceling
but it doesn't add anything new to the
table now in terms of features second
place is going to the Sennheiser's and
as I already mentioned this thing has a
touch panel on the side so you can
control your music just by swiping left
and right you can skip between tracks
and songs volume controls are up and
down so that's a really really nice
bonus we've seen touch panels on other
Bluetooth headphones before but it's
really cool that Sennheiser is
implementing it into there's the
Sennheiser's also have this little
button here so you can switch between
different effects modes so depending on
what you're watching or listening to you
can actually switch up the sound quality
of the headphones in the different
effect modes that has is club movie
speech and off so you can swap between
those depending on what you're listening
to now a really cool feature the
Sennheiser's are introducing is the
ability to turn on the headphones simply
by putting them in this position
so when you go like this that means
you're ready to put them on and when you
want to put them away lay them down flat
that's turning them off now while that's
a really cool feature and I love the
implementation I do wish they kept the
power button somewhere on the headphones
so that even if I wanted to keep them
like this I can turn them off there's
also this cool little LCD screen at the
bottom so that you can see how much
battery you've got left when you use
these and number one in terms of
features definitely has to go to the
Sony's now sony has introduced a lot of
cool stuff here it also has that touch
panel like I mentioned before just like
the Sennheiser all the same controls so
you're swiping for your music and all
that good stuff now one of the coolest
features on this headphone is called
ambient sound now when you press this
button you're able to hear the ambient
sound around you while your music is
playing now this thing is useful for
multiple reasons so me personally in my
everyday life
love to listen to my headphones when I'm
at home and Ari sometimes calls me and I
have no idea because I've got the noise
cancelling on I've got the headphones
covering my ears I can't hear at all and
she gets upset she gives me the angry
wife face and I'm like oh my bad what'd
you say so with this feature I'm able to
hear her yelling at me mom listen to my
music
thanks Sony now song is able to do that
because they include some mics at the
top of the ear cups so these are taking
in the sounds that are around you the
people that are speaking to you and that
is traveling into the headphones so you
got that heightened sound now imagine
someone speaking to you and you don't
want to take off your headphones a
really cool feature that's implemented
here is being able to cup the right ear
cup and the music fades down and outside
noises are amplified so you're able to
hear that person speaking to you or
whatever's going on in your area without
having to actually take off your
headphones and once you're done all you
have to do is remove your hand
and you're back to listening to your
music however you were before
now another cool new feature that Sony's
introducing here it's called a noise
canceling optimizer so what it does here
is by pressing the noise canceling
button and holding it down it'll analyze
all kinds of things like your head shape
whether you're wearing glasses even the
style of your hair and tailor it to a
different kind of noise canceling
experience for whoever is wearing it so
as you can see Sony's innovating with a
lot of cool new features that I
personally haven't seen on any other
pair of headphones so this is why it's
number one one thing that this is
missing though is the easy ability to
pair to more than one device these two
can actually do that pretty well so I
can pair this with my phone and my
computer with no problem and switch
between the two with no issues
whatsoever but it wasn't that easy of a
job to do with the Sony's but it's still
all the cool new features makes a number
one now it's time to judge the actual
noise cancelling from my experience I
gotta say these two pretty much tied in
my book and that says a lot I was
extremely extremely impressed with the
bose qc25 noise cancelling features i've
never heard anything like this in my
life
and to have the Sennheiser's come in and
pretty much do some comparable work I
was truly impressed but I gotta say guys
Sony's doing something crazy over there
in those labs cuz this out of even
better now even though the Sony's are
better than these two let's get this
straight
these are all very good noise cancelling
headphones they're all really amazing at
what they do
but since this is a comparison I got to
give this up to the Sony's but if you
buy any of these you're not going to be
disappointed
whatsoever now when it comes to
straight-up sound which is probably the
most important category I think I'm
going to start off with the bose qc25
now this does have some pretty good
sound quality I'm not super thrilled
with it but it definitely gets the job
done since it performs well in the noise
cancelling department but in terms of
like actual sound quality and all the
things that you can expect from it I
wouldn't put this at the top of the list
I'd say second place would have to go to
the Sennheiser's for me this had a
little bit more bass which I personally
am a fan of and the overall sound just
sounded really good
I didn't feel like anything was missing
so I had a nice full sound
but I gotta say guys for me they don't
know Sony's killing the game right now
with these pair of headphones the MDR
1000x
had a really full sound I felt like it
was just a lot more dynamic I could hear
quite a bit more it just felt like I had
a more full range of sound bass is
pretty good vocals were clear I have
actually no complaints with this now if
you've been following the ranking and we
tally up all the points you'll see that
the Sennheiser's came in in a third
place with eight points this is probably
my least favorite I think that's pretty
accurate it does some things well but I
probably wouldn't pick it over the
others now the Bose QC 3 fives these are
$50 less than less than the Sennheiser's
and they still are a lot more
comfortable to me
they provide pretty decent sound and the
noise cancelling is just as good so I
have no problem going with these but the
overall winner here guys is the sony MDR
1000x
these finished with 14 points that's a
pretty big gap but sony's doing a lot of
things with this headphone they retail
for 400 bucks which is $50 more than the
Bose so it's personal preference on how
much you want to spend but I honestly
think it's worth it 400 Oz is too much
money for headphones to be honest but if
you're looking into these high quality
headphones then this is definitely the
one you want to go with but hopefully
you guys enjoyed this showdown between
the top three noise cancelling
headphones I'm sure there are more out
there but that was between these so far
hopefully you guys enjoyed it I'll catch
you in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
