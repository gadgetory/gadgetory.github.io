consumer and this is my wife Harry hello
and today we're doing something a little
bit different yeah some of you guys have
asked me on Twitter for tech that
specifically geared towards women and
jet took on a challenge challenge
accepted baby it's I decided to find a
bunch of cool tech that I think you know
women or girls or anybody would
appreciate that's definitely not to say
that the tech that he showcases every
other day isn't for women I think people
wanted something that was like
specifically geared towards like women's
everyday likes yeah I used Ari as my
base so these are things that I would
get her and hopefully it helps you come
up with some ideas but first huge shout
out to iHome for sponsoring today's
video and this right here guys is the
iHome I abs 16 so just like the Amazon
echo echo dot and all the other trillion
echos that are now out this one has the
Alexa built into it so now you can speak
to it and have it do all the commands
that you would with the Amazon echo and
this P is pretty cool because it has
some information on it that you can look
at at a glance so you've got your
weather temperature time date all the
stuff that you'd want to know right when
you wake up in the morning and we're
actually jamming out to this earlier so
I think what my favorite things about
this is how loud the speaker goes I
guess the crazier it gets way louder
than the Amazon echo yeah yeah
play helpless Hamilton soundtrack just
so you guys can hear how loud it is this
is like halfway right now so you guys
see this thing gets plenty loud oh
forgot to mention you can actually play
songs right from Spotify for my heart
radio so there are options definitely
there in terms of like personalizing
from your music you've also got some
buttons up top so that if you want to go
ahead and program some of these for
specific features you can go ahead and
do that with a couple of the buttons
here so if you guys are interested I'll
of course have links to this down below
in the description but now let's get to
that list yeah you ready for it yeah by
the way guys I haven't seen any of these
things so we will see how well he did so
she's gonna let us know if you guys
could go pick it up for whoever I'm not
gonna be nice to you
you better be so this right here is
called the brain stream SOI I believe
okay
it's a handbag or purse light so with
this if there's throw it in your handbag
throw it in your purse and when it
detects movement like this or something
or you touch it lights come up you're
always digging in your purse looking for
something I am I really all always
always all the time okay yeah well what
do you think of it and I think it's a
cool concept I like it I just want to
see like if it actually functions the
way that I would want it to you should
go ahead let's test it out so here's
your purse yes all right so I would just
throw this in here anyway it's a mess in
that purse guy it's so bad guys like
it's so bad ah it's like lit up like
it's hard to see it well we'll throw in
some b-roll so you guys can see it in
action
what I like is that it's not like a
super bright light it's just bright
enough so I can see some oh that's
really cute yeah yeah alright a links
down below in the description you guys
to find everything we're talking about
down below alright next up we've got
this guy now this is the techie and me
and you guys know portable chargers but
I like you know I like this one a lot
because there's a lot of variety it's
pretty small and compact
right yes and you know I think it looks
pretty decent yeah how many million so
this one has 10,000 milliamp hours yeah
for something this size but here's what
I really like about this right it has
built-in cables oh so you don't have to
worry about you know carrying anything
extra you just use the cables that it
comes with yeah clearly spaced in my
purse is limited so yeah exactly right
so it has a bunch of different cables
actually has a lightning cable for
iPhones it has a micro USB for older
phones and it also comes with an extra
USB type-c cable so you can swap them
out so it'll cover any phone that you
may have and if you hang out with a
bunch of friends who use iPhones too you
can change the micro USB to a lightning
cable with this adapter that's included
and it comes with this little travel
pouch this guy right here is called the
HP sprocket that's not like something
out of the Jetsons now you're probably
wondering what the heck is that
well it's a portable little printer that
prints little pictures so if you have
like Instagram pictures or pictures on
your camera roll you go ahead and send
it right through the app into the
printer and then it'll print out a small
little picture that's really cute
right now yes so we're gonna go cute
we're gonna get the app on her phone
we're gonna try it out and then we'll
print some pictures alright alright guys
so we downloaded the app IRAs been
setting it up and messing with it like
crazy I'm telling you she's already
falling in love I won't give it my
approval oh I want to see what the
quality is like but it's really cool
because it can take stuff directly from
your camera roll or you can link your
Instagram account and it takes your
pictures from Instagram or Facebook or
Google it's so cool you know what I'm
gonna do with this one of me and you oh
you can edit it cool very cool so yeah
you gonna add a bunch of stuff to it
actually all right let me I'm not gonna
put any filters on it we don't need that
I think we're good no filter life
alright guys so I finally picked the
picture and it's using bluetooth to
connect to the phone and the phone sends
over the pictures to the printer
now there's printing it out as we speak
which is nice and it's so cool so it's
like a nice little portable printer see
if I were still in high school I would
just print a bunch of these put all over
my binders so cute I love this oh there
you go
let's see oh this is so cute you guys
can't see what we'll put some b-roll I
decorated it with a little filter little
filter and see what you do doing see
through sorry that's so cute I could
really see like a real younger girl
loving this so much I think this is my
favorite 2 foot 2 3 4 3 oh alright so
score that's another one for me I know
to get for the ladies what can I say and
next up we've got gloomy case and this
for those of you who don't know is a
case for your iPhone 7 or maybe even
your iPhone 8 this one works for both
but I think they make cases for other
phones as well supposed to be really
good for selfies yeah it's supposed to
be good for selfies because it has these
built-in LEDs on each side of it so when
you have your selfie camera going you
press the button in the back and you got
those this light going on right yeah
let's actually put your iPhone 8 in this
whoa this thing is big why yeah
yes I mean I can't speak because I used
to use the Apple battery case but like
this feels so good okay so this one this
one's a little bit wider than your
typical case for your phone but it's got
those LEDs on the sides you know that's
the kind of sacrifice you make for
alright so the true test is to see how
it actually works when she's taking a
selfie with all these lights it's not
really gonna be that beneficial so hey
Google turn off game room
sure 13:13 wines off okay so go ahead
it's myself yeah okay so this is without
it and this is with it okay
so what are your thoughts I don't really
see a difference yeah see I'm not gonna
lie guys I don't really see that much of
a difference either yeah I'm gonna have
to give you a feel for this one all
right whatever it's just one I'll take
it whatever alright so for this next one
I pretty much cheated I know she's gonna
be I know she's gonna like this because
this actually hers but this is you want
to solve this yeah it's a mirror manatee
mirror for you so when you're applying
makeup or if you're like your
eyebrows or something so this is a
trifle bear and there are three mirrors
so you can you know see all your
different angles make sure your face is
looking right but I bought this one in
particular because I don't do a makeup
in the morning while he's sleeping I'm
considerate and I don't wanna wake him
up so you just power it on and as you
can see there's lights that can like
illuminate your face in the dark and you
can even press and hold it to dim it a
little bit if it's too bright and turn
it off I think this is cool because
since it uses a microwave speed you're
able to actually have it like at your
desk yeah so you can connect it's like
your computer have it there I feel like
there is a tech element here with micro
USB I think it makes sense with the
light that's dimmable yeah
and last but not least we've got some
air pods now IRAs been using these for a
while now so I know that this is a sure
thing also uh-huh but what's special
about these is that they're actually
customized by color where now you can go
ahead and if you're getting it as a gift
for someone you can pick whatever colors
you like and I went with this purple and
paint combo done teal but I'm the same
yeah I really think people like all
people boys and girls or men and women
would actually really like this because
they she's like a custom gift but
personally for me I
zero zero interest in earpods until
color would put up their ad on twitter
with this I need those exactly so I feel
like that makes this a solid gift even
if they don't listen to a lot of music
you can use it for watching videos on
your phone
getting on phone calls there's a lot of
good options but the fact that you can
color and customize it to whatever the
person likes I think that makes it a lot
cooler but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
let me know what you guys think ladies
let me know what you think about
recommendations and guys don't think
that just because this is like a girl's
tech video or something you can't pick
up some of the stuff that portable chart
is legit but yeah that's about it guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that cuz this video
thumbs up I will catch you guys in the
next one
until then is your average consumer and
this one piece
