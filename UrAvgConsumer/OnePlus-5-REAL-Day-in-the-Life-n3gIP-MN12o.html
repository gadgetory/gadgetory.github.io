and today we're going to be spending a
real danda life with a one plus five now
if you've never seen one of my real band
of live videos you're going to watch me
spend an entire day with this phone and
test out things like that new camera
battery life performance and see how it
stacks up in the real world so let's see
how it did all right so right now you're
actually looked up to my phone holder to
my car for GPS but I decided why not
test out the video on the phone shooting
in 4k the car is going to be a little
bumpy since I'm driving the road so you
can expect the optical image change that
you can expect the optical image
stabilization to be kicking in here but
we'll see how that goes but I'm right
now I'm headed over to the studio I have
listen I have a lot to do in this video
it looks like a hot mess looks like
garbage I promise you so a lot of
cleaning to do a lot of setting up to do
for different parts of the studio but
we're going to see in just a second I
might show you may be either one of the
cars myself so guys I spent a good chunk
of my morning talking to my mom on
hangouts so famous say hi MA so yeah
I've been talking to my mom for a good
bit on hangout and so far she says the
video quality on my end has been super
clear so it's like voice chatting or
video chatting you don't have to worry
about that front-facing camera doing the
wrong mama seal of approval go your
average mom okay
alright so one of the first things I
want to do is kind of talk about the
design of this phone
first off hats off to one plus because
this is probably their best looking
phone yet the one plus five looks really
really good but some people say it looks
a lot like the iPhone and they share a
lot of similarities let's not even
sugarcoat things but I do think that it
does give a different vibe than the
iPhone
I just don't know it feels a lot sleeker
it's rounder on the edges then the
iPhone is iPhones a bit more square of
course it has the
- camera stuff up there they look
similar undeniable but um I don't know I
feel like oneplus has their own take on
the design and it works I like it but I
am a reviewer they sent me a reviewers
package so I got a couple more things to
look at like these cases and I got to
say oneplus is pretty awesome in terms
of like the cases that they provide I
really like the way these look and fit
there's carbon fiber one right here this
is what I've been using on the oneplus
for a bit I actually really like that
but I also like this one which has like
a grippy texture to it
they're phones used to have this kind of
design I forget what it's called but it
makes the phone really really easy to
hold in the hand you'd never really have
to worry about slipping and over here we
have the oneplus backpack I don't know
if they're trying to butter me up or
somethin sending me a backpack you guys
know I have a weakness for that but I'm
just joking they sent the backpacks to a
bunch of other reviewers as well but
this is cool that they really are
getting into like the accessory gain
stuff outside of just the phones so uh a
backpack this backpack is better than
what they sent me last year I could
actually see myself using this but guys
check out the current state of the
living room ish area of the studio it is
an absolute mess so I've got to clean
this up it was far worse but I did some
cleaning the other day
this is kind of what it looks like right
now I got to make this into a setup that
one's pretty fine the way it is I got to
clean up some of those things around the
corner though but for the most part
we're going to be changing this into a
full-blown area for shooting still needs
a lot of work though but uh yeah it's
getting kind of crazy now one thing I
love about the oneplus and I'm sure we
all do is the fact that it's running
pretty much stock Android we'd be
ability to customize a few things and
what that pretty much translates into is
a super buttery smooth experience so you
can just jump into apps with no problem
it's super quick and those customization
settings are nice too
so as you see here when you jump into
the settings it actually has its own
little section here
for customization so you can change the
littler slider your buttons your
on-screen buttons or physical buttons
down there gestures status bar so those
are the nice little bonuses that you get
for having a one plus it's kind of like
having a Nexus device with the ability
to fine tune it to the way you want it
all right so it doesn't get any realer
than this I actually forgot to charge my
phone last night I noticed a few minutes
ago was that 52% which is way lower than
it should be at this time so I went
ahead and went into the settings and saw
that it's been off the charger for more
than a day so that's what we're dealing
with right now which I'm sure happens to
a lot of people in the real world so I'm
gonna use the suckers till it's dead and
gone and then I'm going to use its -
charger because that thing is pretty
amazing you know we're just going to see
how much this helps if you're in the
situation and don't worry I know you
guys like to know the screen on time and
how the battery treated me throughout
the day but what I'm going to do is in
my wrap-up where I usually give my whole
opinion on the phone as a whole at the
end of the video you guys will know how
it works since I'll be using it for more
than a single day so I'll give you guys
my experience then so looks like the
bulb for my little Salt Rock ramp over
there
has finally blown so I'm going to have
to hit up a store and get a replacement
for it hopefully I can find a store
nearby and get this thing going place
really quickly alright guys so I looked
up on Walgreens and I might have to look
up a hardware store around here but you
know that's just what comes with the job
sometimes putting out the world's
smallest fire and getting a new tiny
bulb so behind me is a pretty cool
little castle-like structure so I
figured now that's a better time to me
start taking some pictures
alright guys so I just snapped this shot
and I think it looks amazing it is a bit
more saturated so you're seeing a lot
more color than there actually is this
is way bluer than the skies that I'm
seeing right now but I really feel like
that I'm a huge fan of like you know
vibra shots and this gave me that with
no problem this is awesome
alright so we've got some flowers over
here so we might as well get a nice
macro shot and for those of you don't
know what macro shot is it's pretty much
a shot that's really close to its
subject let's see how this turns out so
far I got to say this this camera looks
really clean so I just got a pretty
time-sensitive email and I'm done
putting out the world's smallest fire so
I figured you know what why not respond
to this right now while I'm out and
about and let you guys know what the
typing experience is like when you're
using the phone just on a regular
everyday basis so let me finish this
email
I almost you guys know for sure how it
is to write in pipe on this the yeah
guys in terms of typing on this thing
not a problem things actually really
comfortable in the hand very easy to
hold and actually I think if I even went
one handed this is not an issue at all
either so this is really good in terms
of comfort holding the phone with one
hand doing your typing whatever you need
to do sending out an email
I'm personally liking it this isn't too
big of a phone so very very comfortable
alright guys so I'm having some lunch I
decided to watch the latest episode of
Barbuto and I gotta say this display
looks very very good now this is a 5.5
inch display it's 1080p now I know a lot
of people will knock it for not having
like a 1440p display but honestly I'm
one of those people who doesn't think
the 1440p display looks is that
different from a 1080p display when it
comes to mobile devices I'm sure if
you're pixel peeping you'll probably be
able to find some differences maybe but
honestly I I don't think the average
person is going to be able to tell the
difference by any means
in this benefit to having a 1080p
display rather than a higher resolution
one like a 1440p that being being able
to say battery when you're playing games
it's not going to stutter as much
because it's not pushing more pixels
it's a pretty good trade-off especially
when you get more battery and better
performance what the cat dragged in
it's messing Yeager's shown here yeah
yeah yeah I told him it's messy but yeah
this one has been out and about at the
mall not working just chillaxing
shopping getting some makeup anyway some
of us have to work here I will know that
he's back she can hold the camera I'm
actually going to be charging this guy
does not have nineteen percent so we're
going to see if this bathroom is worth
its money
why did solo wise once a little eyes
only 19% at 90% I forgot sorry last
night oh my god I have to say like that
is really poor batteries I hate so just
has a 3300 milliamp hour battery so it
should be pretty fun it's a 1080p
display so it's not like it's getting a
ton of juice left out of it but we'll
see how long it takes to charge all
right guys so it's been 30 minutes
I had a 19% let's see what I've got now
okay
79% that's insane
30 minutes now I've used another person
on screen - charging in action but still
I think this is my main phone for like a
one plus one of my main phone for a
while and that's charging so legit
that's like one of the best features on
here okay so since we have outta here we
might as well check out the front-facing
camera yes I'm selfie time
i unsee
very rarely do people get on the first
try but I did oh yeah I like this
actually
remember the essay I wasn't really too
fond of it but I feel like the color is
good on this oh yeah it's nice and clear
too
so this actually has no what is it I
think there's 16-megapixel something
from camera wow I really do like it yeah
I didn't think I was going to be some
really partial to my iPhone front-facing
camera and I did not like the f8 that
much this is I I like this I would
totally just like use experiencing every
chicken alright so you know I gotta give
my opinion too there's actually really
good oh she's like legit it really is
come in let me get one with you alright
the last game so when you zoom in you
can see a little artifacting stuff like
that but lies on its own just looking at
like this it looks really really good
alright guys so while I have her here I
might as well try out the rear camera
for those of you who don't know we've
got dual cameras a 16 megapixel
wide-angle lens and a 20 megapixel
telephoto lens
so we'll try those out see if we can
make that look okay you Cuba whatever
that looks really good actually
now there's also a portrait mode kind of
like the one Apple has so we're going to
give that one a shot - ready for this
babe oh this is a very very soft photo
let's give it one more shot
oh that one came out much better what do
what do you thought I liked it I really
liked the camera you know yeah I really
do front facing cameras a 1 and the rear
camera is really good too so good stuff
one plus
right five stars one plus five don't
look 5g5 sir
good job six now you guys got to see a
pretty real day with me and the phone
and of course I spend some more time
with two after that before I got to this
part of the video so I could give you
guys my final thoughts overall one plus
five did not disappoint pretty happy
with both of the cameras if you couldn't
tell me and aeri would both really
pleased with the front-facing camera and
the rear facing camera I was able to get
some really really awesome shots I did
find that in portrait mode feature to be
a bit on the soft side but it still got
the overall job done now where I do wish
things were a bit different is that
instead of a telephoto lens
I do wish we got a really wide angle
lens I find those to be a bit more
useful if you want to get more into the
shot so you know you can always do
digital zoom to get a closer shot if you
want honestly that's the only thing I'd
really change I personally really really
like to display it's not going to get a
ton of credit because it's 1080p in
world of 1440p displays but I actually
think it does really well there's
honestly not that much difference
between this and its routines display
besides a reading mode and a wider color
gamut but after coming from the s8 and
still being able to enjoy this display
that says a lot
now battery life for me has been pretty
average I was able to get between 4 to 5
hours of screen on time and even though
this has a smaller battery capacity than
the 3 T it has a new Snapdragon 835 chip
which is better at power consumption so
it's able to still keep up with a phone
like that however when you're locking a
1080p display instead of some of the
higher spec displays you kind of want
battery life to be a bit better than
average because you're making that
sacrifice but honestly battery life
becomes way less of a concern when
you've got stuff like - charging the
most confusing thing for me is
justifying that price hike oneplus
phones have been considered flagship
killers for a while now because they can
do some of the covered features from
higher-end phones at a lower price point
but the 1+5 doesn't quite do that other
than the new cameras everything else
like the battery display even the
performance are pretty much in line with
what we've seen in previous models and
it kind of sucks to see that it's
missing what we're starting to call
standard features like
water resistance and even an SD card
slot all in all though if you're looking
for a phone with a bomb camera reliable
performance and denounce range then this
is the phone for you but I don't know if
it's really upgrade worthy if you're
coming from one of the more recent
flagships but that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did leave the pool guy grow that
give this video a thumbs up if you plan
on getting be one plus five let me know
with a comment down below let me know
how you like it if you already have it
but I'll catch you guys for the next one
till then it's your average consumer
