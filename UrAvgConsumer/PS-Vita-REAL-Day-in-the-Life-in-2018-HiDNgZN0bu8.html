today we're gonna be spending a real day
in the life with the PlayStation Vita
now I know that this is an older
handheld system but I wanted to see how
it would fare in 2018 especially when
there are systems out like the Nintendo
switch so let's see how it does in the
real world after six years so a lot of
you guys know I love my PlayStation Vita
that is always always in my backpack
right here inside of its travel case but
honestly while I love taking this
practically everywhere with me
I don't necessarily play it that much so
I'm gonna see what it's like to actually
turn this guy on it hasn't gotten much
action from me in a very long time I've
actually charged it last night and it's
been a while since I even turned it on
so I'm curious to see what the screen
looks like to me after using the
Nintendo switch for so long so here I
got it's crazy that I'm saying this this
is a 5-inch display right here
but it feels small the Nintendo switch
has my mind warp the Nintendo switch has
a 7-inch display this has a 5-inch
display and this does seem considerably
smaller but I will say though this does
feel a bit nicer to hold in the hand
this is got the grooves in the back made
for your fingers the buttons feel nice
you got the joysticks on the left and
right side this feels like a really
really nice experience and I know what
it's like to actually use it but it's
just been so long so it's a little
nostalgic for me right now and what
we've got right here is deep I guess
Vita 1000 this is the first iteration of
it Sony did come out with a second one I
personally didn't like it because they
took away the OLED display the OLED
display looks so good on this and I've
tried the second one I didn't really
like the colors just didn't seem as
high-quality as the first one did so
I've always stuck around with the first
one but they're essentially the same
thing just slightly different design but
this is the way to go now one thing
you'd expect with a six-year-old
handheld is probably some pretty bad
graphics but the PlayStation Vita
actually surprised me even today so I am
playing
Davida right now we're sitting in
staples actually waiting for area to
finish printing something so I just
decided to jump on here and this one of
the nice things about portable systems
taking it wherever you are and one thing
I wanted to take a look at was just the
graphics so this thing has a 960 by 540
for a resolution which is a quarter of
Full HD but to be honest on such a small
screen it's not that bad this looks just
like HD I was really worried that it was
going to look worse than I remember but
um it actually looks just fine
some Street Fighter vs Tekken over here
definitely a bit older you can tell it
looks a bit more dated but you can still
get away with playing this with no
problem it's not a bad experience for
sure but it does show its age lower
resolution aside the screen is still
small enough that games look really good
on it back in the day they were saying
that this is like having a PlayStation 3
right inside of your pocket and I'm not
gonna lie that sounds pretty accurate in
terms of graphics to me one of the
biggest benefits with the Vita is this
portability especially when you compared
to something like the switch now when it
comes to portability you got to be able
to put your portable system right into
your pocket and the Vita can do that
fairly well it's not the best but I can
definitely get the job done these aren't
the biggest pants in the world but I can
throw my Vita in without an issue so
taking it around with me no big deal
that couldn't happen with the switch
whatsoever but you guys know me this is
not how I roll I don't really put the
Vita in my pocket everything goes inside
of a case so I can carry a few more
things like my cables and even some more
games so this is how I roll can't throw
this in my pocket but the Vita itself is
portable enough to throw inside now I
feel like we've got a good idea of the
hardware what it's like to actually hold
the system what it looks like to
actually play games but what about the
games what games are available what's
coming out is there still any hope for
the Vita in 2018 here's what I found all
right guys so we've got the Vita in hand
and it's been a while since the Vita has
been really relevant so we got to stop
by none other than Game Stop to see if
there are any good games coming out for
it or that have been announced recently
I just rekindled my love
for the Vita so I wanna know what if you
guys have got anything new or you know
things that I've been recently released
or anything new coming out oh is that is
that what you're telling your aunt is
dead huh so we just asked guys looks
like the Vita this looks like there's
not much hope for it so we'll see how it
goes
alright guys I'm not really sure how
much of that conversation you heard but
basically what the game stock employee
told me is it's not looking too good
there were some new RPGs that he
mentioned but they didn't really look
that good if you actually take a look at
the Vita section it was very barren I
had a hard time even finding it so right
now it looks like gaming on the Vita in
terms of new games isn't really going to
be something you can look forward to so
what I'm gonna do right now is basically
go back home look online and see if
there's any gems worth picking up so I'm
not completely satisfied with what we
heard over at Gamestop so I want to see
online if there are any PS Vita titles
that are coming out since it seems like
there were no options at Gamestop and
right now I just see gift cards and
memory cards how much are these memory
what I can't wait
32 gigs for 70 bucks pre-owned that is
that is horrible
what 54in gigs for 130 pre-owned and
refurbished no hold on you go to Amazon
64 gigs for 89 97 still way too much
money but much cheaper than Game Stop 32
gigs for 60 bucks
are you serious yes so the state of
memory cards for the Vita in 2018 still
absolute trash no memory card should
cost as much not at this age this is
crazy anyway let's keep looking for some
new games okay so based on what IG n has
here there are a couple of games coming
out and these look like a lot of it
looks like just a lot of indie games
nothing you know backed by any big
publishers or developers so if your
insert indie titles then you know these
are gonna be your options and where
maybe some really lackluster RPGs but in
terms of games coming off a Vita I guess
that games top guy was pretty right it's
not looking too good okay guys so we
checked in the game stop we checked
online for games coming out but I wanted
to hit up the actual PlayStation Store
that's on the Vita to see what games are
available for download like right now oh
yeah there are a few things that caught
my eye surprisingly like seek Secret of
Mana this Digimon Story Dragon Ball Z
God Eater all pretty good titles and
they're currently top downloads which
makes sense I don't own any of these but
if I were to pick up some more games
right now these would probably be some
of them just being in the store it kind
of reminded me that this thing has more
than just games so you can watch videos
as well if you want it has this whole
store so that you can watch movies TV
shows all that stuff and it even has
apps so if you want to get something
like crunchyroll twitch hulu netflix you
got access to all of those in
applications as well so you know there
are a few options a few things you can
still do with the Vita so uh you know
it's not completely dead and worthless
still have some good stuff going for it
now when talking about
consul's something you really have to
consider is the current gaming library
and in particular what gems are
available now the PlayStation Vita has
quite a few gems in my opinion that I
know that I have to get to one being
persona 4 golden trust me I know that I
need to play this game my cousin has
been telling me about it for years
I picked it up I just need to sit down
and actually play it those are the kind
of things you want to keep in mind when
you're picking up a new system whether
it's old or new so the state of games
for the Vita not looking so great there
are still some titles out there and like
I said there are tons of gems to go back
and play but if you're looking for
future titles new upcoming things to get
your hopes up for nope you're pretty
much gotta look at the library that
currently exists now I didn't get to
actually take advantage of this feature
during the day in the life but one thing
that we cannot forget is the amazing
ability to access remote play where you
can play your PlayStation 4 right from
the Vita even if you aren't close to it
alright so one of my absolute favorite
features on the PlayStation Vita is this
remote play right now I'm playing dragon
ball fighters and this is on the Vita
it's not out for the Vita but I'm able
to play here PlayStation 4 is over there
and when you look at my actual TV boom
dragon ball fighters right there so I
can play I can pretty much control my
ps4 mi TV right from my PlayStation Vita
which is absolutely insane
now while this feature is awesome and
it's probably my favorite thing on the
Vita it's not all good staying does lag
quite a bit so as I'm playing you guys
see those drop frames are crazy so
you're putting a fast-paced game like
dragging that fighters if you're playing
someone good that's not going to cut it
at all now of course the solution to
that is get a better Wi-Fi signal but
the Vita has been behaving very oddly
I've been putting it on all of the
connections that I possibly could and it
just kept saying the connection was too
slow to actually use remote play which
is kind of absurd since we have pretty
good Wi-Fi signal in here I even checked
some forums online and everybody's been
saying that the koala
of remote place has been dropping so
maybe that's an effect of it being older
I don't know it's been really weird I
don't know firmware updates are doing it
but it's not so hot
now do I recommend actually picking up
the Vita today in 2018 for over 200
bucks it's hard to recommend it really
is even though I personally really like
the system I don't really recommend
getting it unless you're okay with going
back to those past games like I said and
playing the best things that were
available for the system I really don't
think it's worth it at this point
hopefully Sony does work on something
after they see what's going on with the
switch and all of the growth that that
thing is having I would love to see a
PlayStation Vita 3 or whatever they call
it at this point but brand new at over
200 bucks definitely save your coins
I'll go with something like the Nintendo
switch instead at least there are gonna
be good games coming out for that in the
future but what do you guys think are
you even considering picking up
education Vita at this point or another
question for my PlayStation Vita owners
how many titles did you actually love on
the system I'm curious to know if there
are a slew of games that some people
enjoy it or if they're just like one or
two titles that they like but let me
know what's comment down below hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
be the cool guy or girl I give this
video a thumbs up and I'm gonna catch
you guys in the next one until then it's
your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
