want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video he was going on
everyone at your average consumer today
I'm going to be doing an unboxing of the
brand new google nexus 7 all right let's
not wasting time let's get right into it
alright and here we have the nexus 7 box
and I think really Google was really
clever in putting the tablet picture
here and making the bezel show a 7 on
the UM on the box so that's really a
little neat thing they did there and
here you just have some you know regular
information shows you that it's made for
google play shows you it's a
full-fledged android tablet that means
no TouchWiz no HTC skins or anything on
it is pure Google and it says right here
so this is as stock as it gets doc
meaning it's completely naked it comes
this comes simply with the Android
interface no special things added to it
but enough about that let's jump right
into this now I know this on this box
seems to have a quite the reputation
right now for being notorious to open so
I see this blow black tape has been
getting a lot of people you got to kind
of cut that I'm going to use these
scissors here so there we go finally got
this off and now another tricky part is
getting it out alright cool so hopefully
guy didn't take too long right here and
here you have it the 7-inch google nexus
so next 27 is pretty
alright so and I can tell you already
this this is a very small tablet
definitely smaller than the ipad here
you can see a comparison this barely
covers be built in tyler nexus 7 barely
um gets the screen of the ipad i think
it jeske it just hits it so this is
definitely something a lot smaller then
you'd be used to if you're coming from
an ipad and inside the box see what else
we have this big little box here and
included you will find warranty
information on shore quick start guide
and wanted to information here you have
your USB cable and this uses a micro USB
so a lot of your cell phones cell phone
charges would probably be able to charge
this up and I'm sure what's remaining is
just the actual charger for your outlet
and here you have it and this is 0 this
is made by asus by the way so here on
the on the Charter you can see that ace
the Asus logo on here and if you can't
see it I'm just show you and here you
can see the asus charger on it it's
pretty nice charger seems like you can
be really easy to put in I like the
design of this chart are actually really
nice a fan of this and now let's get
back to the tablet so now that we
figured out what's inside I'm just going
to pull out just USB cable all right so
it's unboxed let's see if this has
enough juice to have its first boot pull
them off the plastic here
and this just feels remarkably small I'm
not used to a 7-inch on me I'm not used
to a 7-inch form factor so this is
definitely going to take some getting
used to but this is ideal for like
watching HD videos due to the simple
fact that it's like a 16 by 9 ratio and
pretty much that means it's the
widescreen format so like your
widescreen television things like that
this kind of mirrors that image alright
guys so up here you have your 1.2
megapixel front facing camera and you
will notice is that there is no back
camera Google decided to leave that out
and just opted for the front facing
camera I believe because taking pictures
with tablets really isn't the most
convenient thing so they probably just
wanted to ask that idea and here you can
see that it's got the nexus logo here as
well as it has an Asus logo as there's
no one to manufacture this and down here
you'll also find the big speaker grill
and I believe this is the power button
on the right side as well as your volume
rocker at the top you can find the
microphone and also on the right or the
left side there's another microphone as
well probably one is used for to cancel
out background noise when you're on I
guess video calls or something like that
and also at the bottom you'll find your
3.5 millimeter jack and you have your
micro USB port right here so that you
can charge the device and pretty much
that's it guys pretty simple design 7 is
form factor now let's see if we can
power this thing on it alright so this
is the first boot let's see what it's
like
alright so I'm greeted by the google
logo of course this the nexus sign
and pretty much that's it guys and I
believe this is the welcome screen and
you get to set up and do all that fancy
stuff so I can get your account on there
and all that good stuff alright guys i'm
going to go to set this thing up and hmm
i just noticed on the left side there's
a little something here let me show you
guys a close-up here you can see these
four little golden pins or something i'm
not sure what you would call these at
all but you um this would most likely be
for a doc so i guess you can expect a
doc in the future and this is small
enough for a doc so I believe it and it
be in landscape mode so i guess for
movie watching so it can be charging
while you're watching movie or something
like that so that's something to look
forward to I'm not sure if Google
already has a doc out there but it
should be interesting to see it come out
and see how that goes alright guys so
that's about it for this unboxing if you
enjoyed this video please feel free to
rate comment and subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video this has been
your average consumer with the nexus 7
total next video guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
