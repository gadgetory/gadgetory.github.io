consumer and today I was able to go to
Google's pixel event where they revealed
a new pixel and pixel to excel and I
gotta say after playing around with them
for a while today I'm pretty excited for
these phones and when it comes to specs
and software we're pretty much looking
at the same thing where you're gonna
really see a difference is the hardware
and design so first let's talk about the
pixel to the pixel tool has a 5-inch
1080p P OLED display and a needless to
say it looks great but to be honest like
the iPhone 8 I'm a little disappointed
that we don't feat an edge-to-edge
display here since that's been the trend
for phones this year if you want that
you're gonna want to look at the XL
version but we'll get to that in a
second the display maintains that
regular 16 by 9 aspect ratio that we're
used to seeing which is a plus for those
of you who aren't too fond of the 18 by
9 ratio that we've been seeing on a lot
of this year's phones and the design is
pretty similar to that of the first
pixel but I gotta say this one is a lot
thinner and quite a bit lighter same
with the XL it's a little smaller and no
longer has that antenna going through
the back which is a nice touch now we've
got a couple of different colors and
they've got some interesting names
we've got just black clearly white and
kind of blue which it is and I could be
wrong but I think the kind of blue
version is exclusive to Verizon
customers since when I try to get my
pre-order in it was only available with
Verizon but let's talk about that pixel
to excel since that's the one I'm a bit
more excited for the XL has a 6 inch Pio
LED quad HD plus display and yes we have
an edge-to-edge display here the bezels
aren't super thin they're a little
thicker than some of the other phones
that we're seeing with this kind of
design but it still gets the job done
screen looks plenty big I love that the
XL is not over the top flashy but really
good-looking in its own right and
speaking of sticking with the trends the
XL will have an 18 by 9 aspect ratio
like the LG G 6 the LGB 30 the galaxy s
8 no date the list goes on but instead
of having the same three color lineup as
the regular pixel the color offerings we
have for the XL are just black and black
and white which is fitting since both
phones come with Android Oreo and a
display of something called a colorizer
which allows you to easily use it even
when you're wearing sunglasses and it's
VR ready but now let's talk about some
of the things that both depicts
share that plan to give it an edge over
its competition and both phones have
that snappy Snapdragon 835 processor
that we've been seeing in most of the
flagships this year so you'll have no
problem doing your everyday things and
both phones also happen to be dust and
water resistant and luckily at the event
I was able to play around with that 8
megapixel front-facing camera as well as
that 12 megapixel rear camera and I got
to say guys I was impressed Google has
done it again they have got awesome
cameras in these phones and what these
phones were actually seeing features
that were used to seeing on the iPhone
heck they even have a straight up
portrait mode that gives you that same
blurred out background effect but it's
doing it here with a single lens no dual
lens system here but you're still
getting the same effect which is
actually surprisingly good the quality
from the blur effects were actually very
impressive you can actually swipe
between the to see the difference and
its major what I'm really liking about
the portrait mode here is that it
doesn't require a ton of light in order
to get this shot off
when I'm using my iPhone it says you
know you got to get more light got to
move away from your subject all this
kind of stuff but when I was using these
two phones I didn't have any messages
pop up saying I couldn't get the effect
off it was just snap and go it was
really responsive really impressive and
it did a great job you can also take
photos with motion kind of like we have
the live photos on the iPhone so if
you're into that you can do that there
there's also a cool google lens feature
that allows you to take a picture that
you've already taken scan it and it'll
let you know exactly what you scanned
with a Google search I personally cannot
wait to put this phone through its paces
really test out that camera cameras are
a big deal for me and I'm really excited
the fact that Google can actually pull
off something so great with just one
lens and with both phones we have stereo
front-facing speakers thank you I love
when companies do this because honestly
that's the way it should be
front-facing stereo speakers no if ands
or buts and one thing I should know guys
is the removal of the headphone jack
looks like bluetooth headphones are
going to become more and more prevalent
and more important so if you haven't
made the jump yet you probably should
soon but thankfully both have bluetooth
5.0 so you're gonna get better
connectivity a longer range you know
will start seeing better sound quality
all that kind of stuff
so that's one good thing and we all know
the Google assistant can do a ton but I
think two of the most noteworthy ways
that it's used with the Google pixel is
one with that always-on display
and we've seen the always-on display
with multiple devices that use OLED
displays and what it does is it
basically shows you the time your email
notifications and reminders all without
having to unlock your phone but now
it'll also show you what song is playing
in your environment without you having
to even ask and honestly I think this is
amazing
usually what I'm hearing a song I'm
enjoying it and then I'm thinking oh I
better find out what song this is and
you got a fumble and run for your voice
assistant and ask it hey what song is
this then it has to listen it's just too
much with this now all you got to do is
look down at your phone and it's already
telling you what song it is and all you
do is double tap it and you have options
to go in and see whether there's a music
video play it from a music streaming
service that you may have and a bunch
more you'll even feel lyrics all kinds
of stuff I honestly think that's a
really great feature it's less work for
the user to do and it just gives you the
information that you want right when you
want it and that second way is actually
activating it by squeezing your phone
very new way to interact with your phone
but it was oddly satisfying as long as
you don't hit the buttons on the sides I
ran into that issue a little bit but
overall it was a pretty smooth
experience and in terms of battery life
the pixel tool is rocking a 2700
milliamp hour battery while the XL has
eight thirty five hundred twenty
milliamp hour battery which is really
good one little drawback is the fact
that we don't see wireless charging here
but I feel like they made up for that by
allowing some insanely fast charging
where you get seven hours of usage with
just 15 minutes of charging that blew my
mind I mean he says they kind of brushed
over that really quickly into during the
event and I was just like wait a minute
seven hours of usage fifteen minutes of
charging that's some next-level stuff
that I can't wait to really try that out
in the real world but overall guys I
gotta say I am extremely excited for
both of these phones especially that
pixel to excel but let me know what you
guys think I'm also gonna have a future
video where we go over some of that
Google home stuff that they talked about
there got some news things then you guys
know that's right
my ally but that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and I'll
catch you in the next one till then it's
your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
