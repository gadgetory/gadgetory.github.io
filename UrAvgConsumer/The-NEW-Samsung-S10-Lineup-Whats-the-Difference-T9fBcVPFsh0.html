consumer and it is that time of year
again
Samsung has announced their new line of
Galaxy devices and this year we're
looking at three new devices and there's
actually a fourth special one which we
will talk about a little bit more later
but of course we've got the s10 the s10
plus and the s10 II now most of us are
familiar with the s10 and the s10 plus
but the s10 II is the newest to the line
and it's for those folks looking for
something with similar power to the 10
and 10 plus but who want a smaller form
factor now in terms of power were
looking at a snapdragon 845 damn this
often the thing is the galaxy has 10 is
pretty cool guys now now that is jetan
are pretty cool because he likes green
phones and he likes green issues that
green let's go a little bit on the green
side I could do some color corrector and
as I was saying before I was wonderfully
interrupted by my buddy Austin each
phone is gonna have a Snapdragon 855
processor as well starting with 6 gigs
of ram with the s10 II all the way up to
12 gigs of ram for the one terabyte s10
plus so depending on the model that you
get you're gonna get from 6 gigs of ram
all the way to 12 which is just insane
and we're also getting 128 gigs of ram
on all models as the base which is
awesome because now we're out of that
double digit territory now in triple
digits 128 is the standard for samsung
devices that's a lot of storage guys and
you even get expandable memory with a
microSD card slot now in terms of colors
they're gonna be quite a few options
we got prism black prism white prism
blue and flamingo pink in the US and
internationally you're gonna have that
prism green and yellow and the matter
what size phone you're looking for the
line cover is pretty much all of the
bases the s10 he has a 5.8 inch display
while the normal s10 has a 6.1 and the
s10 Plus has a 6.4 inch display and it's
going to be this pretty exclusive
ceramic white and black for the highest
capacity of the s10 plus a big kudos to
Samsung for staying strong and keeping
the headphone jack now let's talk about
the specs but let's talk about what
makes the phone actually special so
first off Samsung now has the front
facing cameras in this small little
cutout right in the top right corner
and they do this to that you can have a
much larger display so of course consume
your content and I've seen this online
wasn't really sure what to think of it
but after seeing it in person I'm a lot
less worried about it now of course
you've got a much bigger display but
they're actually changing up the display
before it used to be super amoled but
now I believe they're calling a dynamic
AMOLED that's gonna allow you to watch
HDR content right on your phone have it
look great Samsung this place always
look really good so I'm very excited for
this but what's also new is that they've
got this blue light reduction feature
where it decreases the blue light
emitted from the screen by 42% and this
isn't a filter or anything that you have
to turn on this is built into the actual
display which is great because that's
gonna do less harm to our eyes when
using the phone especially at night and
I believe there's an actual feature
where if you want that filter on it
actually eliminates the blue light by 99
percent some crazy number but it almost
completely eliminates that blue light so
that it has no damage on our eyes which
i think is very forward-thinking and
awesome now it's great is that 42
percent doesn't actually damage the
color representation on the phone it
still has a very color accurate display
without having to worry about a strange
color shift now it's also awesome about
this display is that it has a built-in
fingerprint scanner and they're calling
this their ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner there's actually pretty fast so
I'm I've got high hopes from what I've
seen in the demos so as of right now it
looks pretty promising
now what I really like about this
fingerprint scanner is that it works
even if the display is off so as soon as
you pick up your phone your finger goes
right to it powers on the display which
is great now of course we've got to talk
about the camera and that Samsung
actually added a new one in the back so
instead of the typical two we now have
three so they added an ultra wide-angle
camera which has a 123 degree field of
view which is the same as human eyesight
so that should be great I think every
smartphone should have an ultra
wide-angle camera on it it just makes
sense and you still have your typical
wide-angle and your telephoto and what's
great as well you can manually press the
jump into each of the different lenses
you can't just use the zoom feature to
go between all three lenses very
smoothly now on the video side of things
you're of course going to be able to
record all the way up to 4k but with
nicest now we have the ability to record
HDR content
so you're gonna get that HDR 10 plus
content right from your phone which is
great because a lot of people don't have
access to an HDR camera and this will
probably be the first one a lot of
consumers use now Samson also claims
that you're gonna be able to record
extremely stable footage and with that
wide-angle camera this could be
something that combats GoPros where you
won't even need one anymore since your
camera phone is gonna be able to do it
so that is something I'm extremely
interested in testing now front we've
got a 10 megapixel front facing camera
and this thing is gonna be able to also
record in 4k which is a first for front
facing cameras but the quality here is
supposed to be something that rivals the
rear camera so that one's gonna be
interesting I definitely have to have
Eric tested out with some selfies now
unfortunately I didn't get any footage
to show you guys but there's this cool
feature with the cameras where it's
going to have a shot suggestion where
you're going to be able to use the
camera to help frame up your shot so for
those of you who have a little trouble
getting your framing right maybe you
always have the phone a little bit
crooked you can't always get it right
this thing should help you get the
perfect shot I don't know how great is
gonna be but I can't wait to try that
out as well and of course you still get
access to those gestures with the
front-facing camera so you can just kind
of close your hand and have it take a
selfie for you and you can see that
working with the little ring around the
front-facing camera now there's another
cool feature with the new galaxy line
that I absolutely love and that's the
wireless power share feature basically
what it does is it turns the phone into
a wireless charging pad so if you have
one of the new iPhones or any device
that charges wirelessly like the new
galaxy bud you can throw that right on
top of the phone and it'll charge it
with no problem inserting the feature on
is pretty simple you just go into the
notification center hit the button and
boom your wirelessly charged in whatever
you want now I think this is pretty cool
because I know a lot of couples out
there who one person has an Android
device and the other has an iPhone or
even if it's not the iPhone any other
device if you want to share the love
maybe a partner or your spouse does not
have enough juice and you want to charge
their phone for them and there's no
cables necessary all you got to do is
put the phone on top of the other and
boom your wirelessly charging you don't
have to worry about your phone
completely dying from using this feature
it'll stop charging once it hits 30
percent so it'll leave you with at least
30 for the rest of the
now there's actually gonna be one more
model of the s10 and that one is going
to have 5g so we all know 5g is coming
very soon and this phone is going to be
able to support it and this one's a bit
different from the rest it's going to
have a six point seven inch display
which is just absolutely massive but
it's gonna be within the same footprint
as the Galaxy Note 9 and it's of course
gonna have the same specs but it's also
going to have a 4500 milliamp hour
battery now in terms of getting your
hands on these devices for the 5g phone
is going to be exclusive to Verizon for
the first half of the year I believe and
then the second half it'll come to the
rest of the carriers like t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and I think also Xfinity mobile
now pre-orders for everything starts on
February 21st and they're going to be
officially available on March 8th now in
terms of pricing the s10 II is going to
start off at 7 $49.99 and the s10 is
going to be $8.99
while the s10 plus we'll start at $9.99
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it I
want to know what you guys think of the
new s10 lineup are there any features
that really draw your attention is the
pricing okay let me know what the
comment down below and I'll catch you
guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
real day in the life coming soon base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
