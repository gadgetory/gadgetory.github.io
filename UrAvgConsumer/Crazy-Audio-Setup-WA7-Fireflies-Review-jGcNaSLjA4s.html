consumer and you guys might have notice
in some of my older videos that had an
interesting cubed object on the left
side of my desk
well that's whoo audios wa7 fireflies
and I think it's about time that I
reviewed it for you guys so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
all right guys here we have root audios
wa7 fireflies a USB DAC and tube amp
combo and amps are great because some
headphones require quite a bit more
juice to get the full depth of sound
quality that you want from them as for
DAX they're also known as digital to
analog converters and to those who
aren't sure what a DAC does in the
simplest terms I can provide it converts
digital signals to analog and through
your amp it'll improve your sound
quality and volume output of whatever
you're listening to now the acts are
found in just about every music playing
device like your computer phone or even
iPod if you still use one of those but
they aren't that great in quality this
is where something like the wa7 comes in
the wa7 has a very compact footprint in
the world of high-end heavy-duty docks
and it features a cube design in a
brushed aluminum body with a pure glass
top encasing the tubes for protection
which also adds quite a bit of heft to
it although small this thing is by no
means light which is good as it'll stand
firmly wherever you place it one of my
favorite things about its design and its
aluminum body is how perfectly it fits
with other products that I currently
have on my best like my iMac another
neat little touch is the slight glow you
get from the tubes when it's powered on
and it even looks pretty cool with the
lights off now let's talk about the
inputs and switches you'll find on this
the front is pretty simple with a large
volume valve a 3.5 millimeter and
quarter-inch headphone jack in the back
you'll have your USB and RCA inputs a
source switch on the right and below
you'll have a high and low switch to
determine how much juice is used to
power your headphones you're also gonna
have a power adapter input and of course
your on and off switch now this thing is
a high end amp so it'll be able to power
just about any headphones you come
across
now outside of being aesthetically
pleasing this thing is quite a beast in
the performance Department during my
testing I got to try this out with the
Sennheiser HD 700 and let me tell you
this is some next-level listening the
hd7 hundreds are open-back headphones
and this was my first experience with
open-back headphones and I've got to say
I was very surprised and impressed the
surprise came from these actually being
open to sound and what I mean by that is
these aren't meant to isolate sound from
the outside or keep the sound from the
headphones inside either now what this
does is create an amazing soundstage
when listening and for the folks not
familiar with the term soundstage the
soundstage will give you the ability to
visualize the placement of musical
instruments and vocalists and any sound
you'd hear in your music that feeling of
being at a concert or a live band is
definitely achievable with these the
best way I could describe it is if I
were listening to music with other
headphones with these I felt like I was
actually in it now because of this I
feel like I have to go get a pair of
open-back headphones to add to my
collection
for some home listening of course now
back to the performance of the wa7
paired with the HD 700 it really did
feel like I was at a concert when
listening to certain tracks and the wa7
provides really clean audio with
virtually no background noise and of
course for something like the HD 700
focal and instrumental separation is
pretty damn good
now the wa7 isn't only going super
high-end headphones like the 700s I've
tried them with a few of my favorites as
well like the v-moda crossfade em 100's
and even some in here's like the r IH
8010 Ives and I found that I had an
awesome listening experience with
whatever I threw at them
now the wa7 isn't something that'll be
picked up by your average person this is
some pretty hardcore audiophile gear but
if you take sound very seriously this is
definitely a good investment from a
looks and performance perspective now if
you guys are interested in these I'll of
course have links down below in the
description for you guys to check them
out now I have to let you guys know that
this is my first experience with a
really high-end DAC
and amp so I'm not really sure how it
compares to others in its category but
it's absolutely safe for me to say that
these have been a nice upgrade from my
regular listening experience but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy that gives it a thumbs up
and subscribe to the channel for more
content from me and I'll catch you guys
in the next video till then it's your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
