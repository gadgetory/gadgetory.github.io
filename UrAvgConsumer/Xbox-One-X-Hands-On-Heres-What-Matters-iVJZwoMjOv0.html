and today I've got a behind the scene
look at the new Xbox one X and I just
got to say it guys
this thing is tiny insane I'm about
y'all but I'm pretty excited but now
that it's officially been announced
here's what matters
the Xbox one X was created with the idea
of bringing a powerful tool for kick
gaming machine to gamers so instead of
just bringing 4k resolution we're also
getting detailed 4k textures that makes
everything look so good on PC right onto
our TVs so if you have a 4k TV you'll be
able to finally game the way you're
supposed to but if you don't something
called super sampling will allow all the
latest games to still look amazing on
1080p TV use microsoft claims is the
most powerful console ever and judging
by all the impressive specs under the
hood it's pretty safe to say that's true
building to handle all that power is a
vapor chamber for liquid cooling in a
centrifugal fan which will allow the
machine to not overheat quickly and
minimize the amount of noise you hear
and how they were able to cram all the
crazy specs inside of this guy I have no
idea but they did a really good job and
let's not forget to mention that it has
HDR a super wide color gamut 4k UHD
blu-ray playback and even Dolby Atmos
for some games and for you oh gee Xbox
lovers they announced some backwards
compatibility for the Xbox one family so
that is going to be really awesome to
see we're looking for the full crazy
spec breakdown of course check the links
down below if you're one of the few
people wondering where does the disk go
you put it right here this is such a
small seamless body that it's kind of
hard to see where you put in something
so simple now in terms of ventilation
you got your intakes on the sides and
the back is the eggs off so everything
comes out from the back everything comes
in from the side so that's how you
cooling the system not to mention that
vapor cooling chamber and a little
something nice for all of the Xbox one
owners already is that you can upgrade
to this with no worries all of the Xbox
one games and the Xbox 360 backward
compatible titles will all be playable
on the Xbox one X and they'll all be
improved in some way thanks to the new
hardware
whether that 4k resolution or even
better textures and of course all of the
accessories will work here as well and
something you'll notice is that all of
the i/o in the back is the same like the
Xbox one s so if you plan to upgrade all
you have to do is unplug everything from
the back of your One S instead of this
guy in its spot and plug them right back
in super seamless really easy and that's
something that I could definitely
appreciate so it's pretty safe to sell
your Xbox one or Xbox one s and still
keep your accessories if you're looking
at upgrade to the One X now something
that's interesting is that Microsoft
crammed in so much tech and power into
this console that it's smaller than the
1s but it's actually two pounds heavier
and there were some great games that
were announced 42 of them were actually
confirmed for the 1 X 22 being console
exclusive I'm pretty excited for 4 is a
7 that new game anthem looks really
awesome and I'm definitely super high
for Dragon Ball Z fighter but this is
going to be available later this year
November 7th so be sure to mark your
calendar and is going to be coming in at
$4.99 so that's your price point but
that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you want to
learn more about all the crazy specs and
everything powering this guy I'll have
links down below in the description for
you to check it out
but if you enjoyed the video be the cool
guy or girl that gives us VL thumbs up
and definitely stay tuned for some more
III coverage I'll catch you guys to the
next one is your average consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
