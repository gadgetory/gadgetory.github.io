consumer and today I've got a bit of a
channel update for you guys and this
goes out to all of my subscribers my
Everidge consumers so let's not wasting
time let's get right into it and all
right guys you might have noticed by now
but I haven't been posting much to the
channel lately and that's all about to
change very soon but before we get into
that I do want to say sorry for the lack
of content especially for some of you
who are waiting on reviews I definitely
apologize for not getting those videos
out to you sooner but like I said all
that is going to change I'm actually
going to be bringing a schedule to the
channel now I've always tried to be
careful when it comes to schedules in
etas
because I don't want to get any hopes up
or breaking promises and I think at this
point you guys deserve it there are
quite a few of you watching now so I
definitely think that a schedule stream
of content is definitely what you guys
deserve and I'm happy to bring that to
you guys now I'm going to be bringing a
new schedule of three videos a week
three tech related videos and of course
that one vlog on Sundays now there's
gonna be a video released on Monday
Wednesday and Friday and the vlog on
Sunday and that's only the minimum
that's the bare minimum if I can I'll
put out more videos during a week so
you'll get three or maybe four videos a
week if you want to count the vlog so
that's gonna be the schedule from now on
and if there's a certain video that I
can't wait to get out to you guys you
can definitely see that on a Tuesday
Thursday or even Saturday it doesn't
matter but you'll get a minimum of three
guaranteed videos on Monday Wednesday
Friday and the vlog now for some of you
who aren't crazy about the vlogs I'm
hoping that this can definitely pacify
you I think three videos a week isn't a
bad deal whatsoever
and you can always ignore the vlog
and/or the notification you might get if
it's a Sunday and I think three videos
isn't bad but let me know what you guys
think because this is what's gonna be
coming to the channel if you think
that's too frequent be sure to let me
know I definitely don't want to spam you
guys with any videos but I'm leaving the
comments down below letting me know what
you think of that schedule and I'm
pretty sure that's what I'm gonna be
going for also I know a lot of you guys
wait for my review
I tend to take some time when it comes
to doing the review process but I think
I'm gonna be changing that as well I
think I'm gonna schedule a review after
about seven days of unboxing a product
seven to ten days I think that gives me
a good enough window to get to know the
product and put a review out to you guys
of course I can't give you any long-term
judgments but I definitely think that
that is enough time and I can always
revisit that product if you guys want to
know how its held up after some real use
so if you guys see me unbox a product
and about a week and change you can
expect to see the full review and any
other videos that might follow of course
there will be some products that I don't
have an unboxing for so you might see
the random review of a product without
any warning of an unboxing of some sort
so definitely stay tuned for those as
well and I'm actually planning to bring
back to your average budget segment to
this channel now a lot of you guys like
to know about like some of the cheaper
items that are available that you just
might not know about that might not be
on your radar so I'm gonna be bringing
that back to you guys I know a lot of
you say that I have really expensive
items on the channel so your average
budget is here to handle that I think I
did like one year average budget video
before but I'm definitely going to be
doing more of those and I'm thinking I'm
gonna do that on a scheduled basis as
well maybe like one every two weeks
where I feature one item that I think is
really cool that's not expensive at all
and it's definitely worth your time and
checking out so thumbs up for your
average budget coming back and also if
you guys use any products that aren't
expensive at all that should be on my
radar and you know feature on the
channel let me know as well I can't
really focus on all the smaller products
because there are so many big products I
got to get my hands on so if there's
something that you say you think that I
should really be showing off to everyone
else something that has helped you out a
lot but isn't expensive let me know
definitely bring that to the channel I'm
sure you guys would love to get some
inexpensive items in your hands and a
big shout out to you guys who watch the
vlogs and left comments about
suggestions for new videos and a big
project that I'm bringing to the channel
I think a lot of you liked the idea of
me taking up my living room so you can
definitely expect to see something
happening there within the next couple
of weeks
so definitely shout out to you guys you
guys are awesome
all the things that were suggested
definitely took a note of and you can
expect to see some of those things
coming to the channel pretty soon and
pretty much that wraps up this video on
all the changes that are coming through
the channel just a quick recap I'm
adding a schedule to the channel so you
can expect to see at least three tech
videos every week so that's Monday
Wednesday and Friday and of course if I
have more content I'll be publishing
them between those days and also a
weekly vlog on Sundays
I'm also increasing the speed and which
reviews are released so between seven
and ten days after an unboxing you can
expect to see the full review and of
course the return of your average budget
segment for those of you who say I
feature too many expensive products I'm
definitely gonna have some more
affordable stuff coming to the channel
so thumbs up for that and pretty much
that wraps it up for this whole video
guys hopefully you like some of the
changes that are coming if you don't let
me know down below I always appreciate
your feedback
you guys are my average consumers my
subs the guys who make this happen and
that's about it guys I better get to
making some of these videos now that I'm
on a time crunch and I'll catch you guys
in the next video till then it's your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
