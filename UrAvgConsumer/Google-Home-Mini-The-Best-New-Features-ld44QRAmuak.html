what's going on guys to drivers consumer
and today we've got a fun video ahead
we're gonna be checking out the brand
new Google home mini but huge shout out
to Google for the paid partnership we've
got a lot of cool new features to show
you so first things first let's see
what's in the box and what do you get
inside of course the little mini oh this
is kind of Awesome I like this there's a
very nice clean design oh this thing is
super smooth so this is the talk version
there's also a coral and a charcoal
version as well so we get the mini and
under that we've got your Quick Start
Guide as well as your USB cable or your
power cable to plug this guy in well
since this is all there is to it we
might as well get this thing plugged in
let's get started and for those of you
who aren't familiar the Google home Mini
is a smaller version of the original
Google home they pretty much get all the
same things but it comes in a smaller
less expensive body so just like you
guys saw me commanded in the beginning
of the video to turn all the lights on I
can do the same here okay google turn
off video mode you got it turning 13
lights off boom and you guys know we
couldn't do this video without comparing
it to the Amazon echo dot I think about
a year ago I compared the bigger
brothers of the to the Google home
compared to the Amazon echo it's almost
been a year it's nuts
two million views later and in that
video there were a few areas where the
Google home fell a bit short compared to
the echo for me okay Google remind me to
buy eggs tomorrow at 4 p.m. sorry I
can't set reminders here so we're gonna
see if the new updates that rolled out
kind of fix those issues
Alexa remind me to call my mom at 7 p.m.
ok I'll remind you at 7 p.m.
simple enough now for the mini hey
Google remind me to call my mom at 7
p.m. you'll reminder call mom for today
at 7 p.m. is ready do you want to save
it yes ok reminder save boom
there you go and now the Google home has
voice recognition technology so if you
have multiple people in the household
who like to use your Google home it can
now distinguish who the person is that's
speaking to it
so we're gonna try this out with
something simple hey Google what's my
name
your name is Jagger boom and obviously
since I real is with me she has her
voice enabled too
so hey you give it a shot your name is
Arielle boom got it but so you didn't
say it right you can actually change the
way she speaks to you too so you want to
go ahead and switch that up you'd like
me to call you Arielle yes okay got it
better than the re alright your name is
Arielle and is that simplest you just
have to tell her what her name was and
how she wanted it pronounced and Google
can actually change that it was just
insane now all of that is pretty cool
but now I've got to go and set this guy
up somewhere and see how it fits into my
daily life since you guys know I've got
that gamers paradise video coming up I
gotta see if we could be able to fit in
here hey Google show me some tech
survival kit videos
okay playing tech survival kit videos
from YouTube on game runecast what's
going on guys Travis can seem right hey
Google what's on my calendar for today
there are three events today the first
one is at 11:30 a.m. and its title is
work on the gamers backpack video the
second is at 4:00 p.m. with the title
gaming holiday showcase the third one
follows at 7:00 p.m. with the title
dinner with Sean and grace sure here's a
Google Play Music station called
chillwave and one of the cool things
about the Google home and the home Mini
having that voice matching feature is
the fact that it can also make phone
calls
so it'll listen to who's asking it to
make the call and go down that person's
contact with us
so if I ask it hey Google call mom it's
gonna call my mom calling mom other hey
MA I do it you're on you're on a video
say hello alright ma I'm gonna call you
later okay okay alright bye hey Google
hang up I'm sure I'm sure she heard you
okay now I'm gonna call my mom then
obviously it'll call my mom and not his
hey Google call mom calling mom mobile
Jerry
hello hi mommy
hi nothing you're on YouTube say hi
YouTube hi your phone hello
mother-in-law alright thanks mama we're
gonna talk to you later
okay bye bye hey Google hang up but
there you have it guys I think that is
an insanely awesome feature you don't
even have to give it any special
commands so Aries mom or my mom those
are voices that isn't thing it's like
actually speaking to someone it's crazy
but that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed and again huge
shout out to Google for the paid
partnership hopefully you learned a lot
