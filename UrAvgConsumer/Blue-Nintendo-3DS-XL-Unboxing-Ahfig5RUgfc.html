want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone is your average consumer today
I'm going to be doing the unboxing of
the newly released 3dsxl so let's not
wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the 3dsxl
this is the blue version the blue and
black version and I could have gotten
the red one but I wanted something a
little more subtle so I picked this off
of course around the box it's going to
advertise that it has 90% of larger
screens so it's a considerable amount
bigger than the standard 3d s and I'll
show you guys comparison between the two
and pretty much around the box you know
has some little information shows you
little applications that it comes with
all that kind of stuff but let's jump
right into this unboxing so I'm gonna
cut the tape first well this is going to
cut the tape on yeah alright so I'm
going to cut the tape oh and if our two
pieces of tape here all right so now all
I gotta do is pop this open unless you
want me I'm really hoping this comes
with a stand I feel like I heard that it
doesn't like all the charging dock the
3s camera charging dock and I really
like that so top we're going to have a
our cards some gamer manuals and stuff
like that all that reading stuff is in
here and of course let's see we have our
charger we all know what the chargers
look like pretty standard charger for
the 30s and yep so all we get is the 3ds
no charging dock or engine like that
which is unfortunate but this what it is
so let's put these things aside here and
let's unwrap the 3ds so let's see here
and this I must say is a lot bigger than
the 3ds
and it feels actually it's pretty sleep
um for something that's so much bigger
they didn't they kept the UM the size
down so it should feel the pretty pretty
same in in the hand when as to using the
3ds so it's pretty nice let's open this
up nice I really do like how it um how
it feels here this is a huge screen guys
well let me give you guys a close-up of
course alright guys so here we have the
3ds as you can see it's a nice little
blue 3 yes pretty nice here you have
your stylus and here you have the SD
card slot and I believe this is supposed
to come with a more memory let's see
what it comes with here so now we get a
4 gigabyte hard on SD card so before I
came with 2 gigabytes now it comes with
4 and here you have the volume control
you can see the volume control you just
slide it up and down and this is for the
wireless there's love wireless which is
right here and now you have these actual
dedicated buttons for the Select home
and start but um buttons so now you can
actually press them rather than have
that one unified button that you kind of
just feel out so I really like this
instead of the UM regular dresses
version of course you have the 3d switch
here and this is pretty much it guys
this is what it looks like in the back
pretty nice stuff let me show you guys
what the 3d s look like compared to it
alright guys so here you can pretty much
see what it looks like in comparison to
the 3ds it's a much larger screen much
much larger as I can't imagine how its
ninety percent but it's bigger
nonetheless this is supposed to rival
the Vita screen I believe let's see here
let's compare so here we've got the
screen for the PS Vita and the 3ds XL so
it is pretty large definitely comparable
definitely I don't know if I'm getting
all this in here but as you can see
they're both really large screens so
that's going to be really interesting to
see and play this is what it looks like
when you're playing it all right so it's
just really nice guys definitely
interested in seeing how this is going
to run my 3ds games all right so while
we're here we might as well
power go and see if it has any juice and
thus seems to have some kind of juice
the blue light came on see what the
first boot is like and it's unfortunate
that this has the same resolution as the
3ds but it actually looks pretty fine
alright guys so that's pretty much it
flips unboxing just wanted to get a
little hands-on and I'll show you guys
what you'll get inside the box of course
I'm gonna have I'm gonna try to get a
review for this out pretty soon I do
like the fact that when you um you're
using it it doesn't look fuzzy and
pixelated even though it's running the
same resolution as the regular 3ds so
it's definitely very nice I was
expecting it to be a little weird
because of a bigger screen but they
definitely get a decent job from what I
seen so far but alright guys it's pretty
much it for this unboxing I'll let you
guys know how it is in the review as far
as battery life goes and you know
responsiveness how it feels to hold it
all that good stuff and yeah pretty much
that's that so guys thanks for watching
