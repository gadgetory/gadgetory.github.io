pretty fun video for you guys it is the
$300 gadget backpack challenge now a
couple weeks ago one of you asked us to
do a 540 dollar character backpack
challenge but I know not everyone is
working with $500 so I slashed the
budget by 200 and made it to 300 dollars
now one of my favorite parts of this is
probably the backpack this is a really
cool backpack it looks like a typical
backpack at first but it has two really
cool features that were gonna get into
later so we have our regular pockets and
small pocket up front a larger pocket
here with some compartments and then the
largest pocket for your laptop your
cloths and all those other bigger items
you wanna carry with you at the size you
should be able to carry some border
bottles here but let's check it to make
sure so if we station yes I mean it's a
pretty tight fit but awarded bottle will
fit on this side and the other side as
well
so one of the awesome features is the
slot at the top you can set your own
combination and make sure all of your
belongings are super secure I really
like this because this backpack doesn't
have a separate laptop compartment so
the laptop has to go inside here so then
you can just block it to make sure all
as well and the second really cool
feature is this built in USB port how
cool is that I have never seen that on
the backpack before on the inside of the
USB cable that you can just plug into
your portable charger and then on the
other side here you plug in your cable
for your phone so this is really cool
because if anyone has ever used a
portable charger before then you know
the heading of having to carry a
portable charger or having to put it
your pocket and have it like stick out
in a weird way so really this was a
selling feature for me once I saw that I
just had to get it because I know how
I'm going to do techies love to keep
yourself nice and charged but this
allows you do it in like a nice
inconspicuously and the best part about
all of this was that was only thirty
dollars so at that point I still had 270
plus to spend so let's see what I got so
in this smaller pocket we have just a
simple pair of headphones the Sony
step-up TX I really like them they
sounded pretty good to me I mean I'm no
audio file or anything and if you're
looking for audio files quality stuff
this is definitely not it
but it was definitely fine for your
average person and the best part they
only cost me 20 bucks so as we go to the
clack-clack you'll see that my goal here
was to just find something that was
really affordable but pretty good
quality I kind of thought as like your
starter gadget
fact that you can add on to an upgrade
leader in this larger pocket we just
have a couple of things first is some
stores you definitely need to have some
of that this with Kingston USB flash
drive there's a USB end and a USB type-c
end and if you watch judge videos you
know he has mentioned this in the past
and it's pretty inexpensive and pretty
good now next up I really like this tool
it's a pen every backpack should have a
pen you always want to make sure you
have a writing utensil on you but it's
about your average pen it has all haha
looks whatever in addition to being a
ready pencil it also has six other uses
so it's a bottle opener a ruler a
flathead and Phillips screwdriver
they also have a stylus and oddly enough
it's a phone thing pretty cool but even
though this was 1199 I'd splurge because
I know you guys could use this the
stylus is clutch and also having a float
or flat-head screwdriver on hand could
definitely be useful for you techies out
there and we know no gadget backpack
could be complete on this channel
without a trusty microfiber cloth you
guys know how obsessed he is with
microfiber cloth so I had to include it
we have two spuds microfiber cloth right
here it's pretty cute all I do is pull
out pull it out just like this dude pull
it out and there you go you can clean
your device with it when I get Mudge's
and finger prints on them so the fact is
not jam-packed with ton of stuff but
these are definitely essentials let's go
up to the top so in this top part up
here we have the incre power line plus
lightning cable now I decide to splurge
a little bit and get this anchor cable
because you want to make sure your
tables are high quality you don't have
to constantly buy them I could have
definitely gotten one that was super
cheap on Amazon but this is the way to
go it is durable it also comes in micro
USB USB type-c
I don't have a links in the description
so you should be able to find that and
get the one that works phew it's also
ten feet which is insane love it now of
course to go with this awesome backpack
and met with most of the cool features
we have to have a portable charger
to a trick to the bed and this one is
biopsy and it has 12 thousand milliamp
hours so that should be enough to charge
of devices a couple of times over and it
also has two USB ports you can charge
two devices simultaneously
so put your frame will charge up you can
also let just hook up let them charge
and I haven't had to do this much at all
but it also has a flashlight that you
can use if you ever find them YouTube
pretty cool so Salah backpacks good has
phone storage all of this at $125 which
might seem like a lot but honestly do
you think about it these are all good
quality items
so you shouldn't be having to repurchase
them anytime soon and with that I only
had one hundred seventy-five dollars
left to spend and I still need a laptop
now Joe was telling me I couldn't find a
simple high quality laptop for that much
money and he was right but I still got a
lot so we have here in the Lenovo
IdeaPad now I like this laptop I mean if
you're the kind of person like me who
uses your laptop just for watching
youtube videos maybe you have to write a
paper through here and there then this
will be perfect for you you're
definitely not getting any super crazy
gaming out of this or anything at all
times but Rick the are any video editing
but it is basic it is good I think for
for students or for like preaching so if
you open up on the inside you see I'm 11
inch screen which really isn't that big
but doable and a webcam which is pretty
decent but on the side you have a power
port USB 3.0 and HDMI port and a micro
SD slot so if you're a broke college
student with that HDMI you can still
have a chance at hooking your laptop up
to a TV or something and on the other
side we have two more USB ports and a
headphone jack - a pretty full
functioning laptop here almost with
Windows 10 so if you're really
struggling in on a budget you can spring
for this it was only a hundred $51.90
but if you have a little extra to spend
you can also opt for a better specs
chromebook i don't want to do that
because i did not want to fail this
challenge and i want to stay within
budget
now the laptops taken care of I had 20
296 left to spend and I thought what
better thing to spend my money on than a
portable speaker so I found this
portable speaker on Amazon it was only
$19.99
in a variety of colors it sounded pretty
good again not audiophile but I think
it's pretty good for the average person
especially for those of you who want to
listen to your music on something better
than like your phone's speakers or
something I also found the Logitech X
100 which just featured in a different
video I think it was touch on between
five yes
okay so tech under twenty five and this
is cool if you want to hang your speaker
off your backpack to listen to music
that way and it's not a smaller amount a
little bit cheaper so this is an option
for you there so that pretty much
completes the three hundred dollars
backpack challenge I include the chorus
sticker my calculations so I have two
dollars and 97 cents left over I
probably like a pack of gum or something
but I think Jen has enough of these so
we're actually going to take this whole
thing and give it away to one of you
