consumer and today I've gotten in boxing
for you guys of the brand new google
nexus 7 and this is the new 2013 version
so let's not waste any time scare right
into it all right guys here we have
google's latest tablet the newest Nexus
7 now just taking a quick look around
the box there's not much information
here it does say 16 gigabyte here that's
the version that I have and it does say
Nexus 7 and really that's all there is
to the box so let's open this up and
underneath you'll get a white Nexus I'm
your white box and as you can see we've
got some tape here and I'm going to use
my little unboxing knife or what I call
a little unboxing knife get that open
there and then we can just pull this out
and boom here we have it now the Nexus 7
well first off then this thing is Finn
really thin I really like that this
looks really good but um we'll put this
down for right now and let's take a look
at what's inside the box so of course
we've got a wall adapter we've got some
booklets and we've got a USB cable so
that goes here so of course we've got
warranty safety same thing in another
language and we've got some I guess a
quick start guide so to show you what
you have to do nothing too special here
so going on to the tablet now these are
pretty standard I don't think I need to
show you guys these so we'll put that to
the side so going on to the tablet here
we have it and we're going to peel off
this plastic and here we have it guys
and I must say this is a huge
improvement as far as the field goes in
comparison to the first one this feels a
lot more premium so this is really nice
some of the specs that this thing has
this is a 1200 x 1920 display so it's
kind of it's HD it's higher than 1080p
arm and what's great about this display
is that it's kind of like the retina
display for the ipad but on this tablet
it's even better so they're supposed to
have a really really great screen and i
believe it has a quad-core processor
snapdragon s4 pro clocked at 1.5
gigahertz and for all my average
consumers that really just means it's
going to be really fast and snappy so
I'm really looking forward to that up
front we've got a 1.2 megapixel front
facing camera and in the back we have a
5 megapixel camera so that's pretty good
and I'm taking a look around the actual
tablet let's see what we've got so here
you guys can see we've got a power
button on top and the volume controls
and this looks like we've got a little
microphone over here as well and at the
bottom we've got our USB for a micro USB
and two speakers here and another
speaker up top so we've got that stereo
sound and up top we've got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and yeah
that's pretty much it we've got the Asus
logo here at the bottom and of course it
says Nexus down here so that's that and
let's see if this thing has any juice
try and boot it up for the first time
and all right of course it does have the
google logo coming up and then it'll
probably followed by a nexus logo so
this is supposed to be a really great
tablet guys I'm really excited to check
it out I'll give you guys a full review
all that good stuff but let's see if I
can jump right on to the home screen for
you guys after this of course is going
to ask me to set it up and all that good
stuff and of course guys once you power
it on it seems to ask you for a 4.3
system update so right out the box
you're going to get this little update
and it's going to go through that and
now i'm going to show you guys what the
home screen looks like so now it's on
all set up so on the home screen and i
must say this thing looks pretty nice
the screen looks great and of course
it'll give
little tips when you first turn it on so
far seems pretty snappy um yeah alright
guys this is pretty much it um I'm gonna
have a full review for you guys let you
know how it runs how I like it all that
good stuff and i'll be sure to get a
review out to you guys soon you and if
