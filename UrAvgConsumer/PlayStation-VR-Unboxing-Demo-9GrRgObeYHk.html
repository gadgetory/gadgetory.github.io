today we're unboxing the PlayStation VR
bundle now this is the launch bundle so
it comes with a couple of things that
you can use to get yourself all ready
for PlayStation VR and I think this
retails for about five hundred bucks
which is still cheaper than some of the
other alternatives out like oculus and
the HTC vive over here on this side you
can see some extra additional
accessories that are going to be coming
out this playstation headset this is the
Platinum and I called it after the gold
one came out platinum is the new one and
I'm guy I've got it pre-ordered so you
guys can expect the video on that and
got my unboxing left over here so we're
going to cut this tape alright so here
it is here's the first box now I'm sure
this is the smaller one so it probably
has like controllers and stuff and we've
also got this larger box and this one
has like the seal and everything so this
is going to be to make the actual
headset I'm sure and let's go with the
small one first see what we have in here
okay cool
so like I said this game with a game and
it comes with two controllers so this is
it this is kind of let you have an
experience and see what the VR is all
about so you get a PlayStation VR worlds
and a demo discs so you can get your
full idea of what PlayStation VR will
bring to the table this is the handle
bar for the camera so this is for the
camera so you can angle it however you
need to and now we got cables gotta love
it
you've got the move controllers which
are known for the spears that light up
oh microfiber cloths if you guys know me
you know I love microfiber cloth so of
course this makes sense because um you
can use this to clean the inside of the
VR headset we've got booklets that you
know we're not going to read we've also
got a camera
now for this camera I'm not sure what
the difference is between this and the
old camera that they used to sell so now
there is a new design and it's got a
bunch of holes and microphones and
whatnot but the old one did as well so
I'm not sure what the huge difference is
I'll try it out and test it for myself
but yeah new camera pretty much that's
it guys
these are the things that you get in the
bundle true and let's see you pull this
out got this giant booklet my god that's
in here ok so these are basically giant
setup instructions with giant pictures
PlayStation VR for dummies so power
cable power cable even more cables
headsets power adapters a source break
so you can plug in your HDMI cables in
here of more cables yay now we got to
that set here it is this is it this is
the Sony PlayStation VR so we've got
quite a bit of stuff here that connect
your headset to your Playstation 4 and
it even comes with a little pair of
earbuds so you can use with the headset
now in case you guys didn't know this I
got a big old head so I'm gonna see how
well this can fit with me this is strap
it in like this alright a big ol head is
fine so this looks pretty good now this
is nothing without actually turning the
guy on so what I'm gonna do guys after I
take this thing off my goblin yeah
alright all this would be nothing
without an actual demo so I'm gonna set
this up give you guys a quick demo of
what you can expect or what the
experience might be like let's write it
up alright guys so after seeing all the
cables I kind of understand why they
have this a PlayStation VR for dummies
booklet so I'm going to go through this
try to get this all hooked up it's got
quite a few steps but hopefully it
shouldn't take too long so right now I'm
setting up one of the move controllers
awesome there's no real setup process
for the headset so I guess it's time for
me to just throw it on wish me luck
so let's pull this out going into the
matrix here and I've got an update so
that's awesome
okay so a fairly simple setup process
guys uh there's a lot of updating and
installing but we're past that now and
I'm just going to look for something
that seems interesting back-kitchen
why not Oh mature seventeen I hope you
guys are all 17 and older okay
so right now it looks like I'm in a
really messed up kitchen
this place looks dark there's a camera
in front of me
so naturally I feel right at home here
Oh back up bro
oh shoot whoa okay that's not cool all
right so I just found a game that I can
play with the Move controllers check
this out
so this is pretty cool
grab one of these grab one of these
oh so it's a shooting range well if I'm
a pro at this already who needs actual
shooting range Oh can't forget anything
else up oh okay mmm ah did I mess that
up
going first
yoyoyo you know oh you have got to be
kidding
Wow I'm doing donut at the finish line
vr sucks alright guys so first
impressions I gotta say this seems like
it's pretty cool now it is low
resolution in comparison to something
like the oculus but it is a smooth
experience especially for being on the
PlayStation 4 and the Move controller
seems to work pretty well as well as the
regular standard controller but
hopefully you guys enjoyed this if you
want a full in-depth review let me know
in the comments down below I'll catch
you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
