50 bt an awesome pair of bluetooth
headphones and bass lovers you want to
play close attention here now let's
start off with the looks and feel of
this guy the 950 bt features a larger
design mostly because it has some pretty
big ear cups but it's still surprisingly
light it's mainly built out of nice
plastic a metal headband and some
leather cushioning as a pretty cool
black design and some nice red accents i
wouldn't say these feel premium but they
are quite solid even considered a
lighter plastic build i've got no
complaints as far as durability goes as
these seem pretty tough and have no
fragile points and that's probably due
to the fact that these are unfolded
I prefer foldable headphones as they're
quite a bit more portable but I'm glad
that these at least have a swivel on the
ear cups so that they can be laid flat
down on the surface and they work well
when packed away in a book bag you guys
might have seen that these are what I
carry in my tech travel backpack video
and if you haven't I'll have a link down
below to it this doesn't come with a
travel case like I featured in that
video which was one of my gripes when I
picked this up but based on its design
something probably intended for this to
be mainly used indoors at first I was a
bit apprehensive about picking these up
because I don't like to wear large
headphones when I go out but I did get a
chance to test them out at B&amp;amp;H and after
having tried them I couldn't resist
getting a pair
although the ear cuffs are large they're
super comfortable
they have plush leather cushions and are
quite deep so your ears will be
completely sealed inside and I'm pretty
sure they'll fit about any ear size I've
been able to wear these for hours with
no problem and as you'll find on most
bluetooth headphones there are quite a
few controlled around the ear cups on
the right side you'll find a play and
pause button that's also a slider that
lets you hit rewind or fast-forward when
you slide the button to the left or
right and you've also got your volume
control switch and on that air cup
you'll also notice the NFC symbol which
means you'll be able to easily pair this
through bluetooth with an NFC enabled
device by tapping the two together the
left side is packing a mic for voice
related operations like answering a call
or using voice assistance like Siri
you'll also find a 3.5 millimeter input
jack if you decide to use these with the
included rigid cable which is awesome if
you run out of battery or just prefer
audio from the cable rather than
bluetooth now you've got a microUSB port
so you can charge this up it does run
for 20 hours on a charge but it's a nice
choice to have I love when Bluetooth
headphones don't force you to need power
in order to use them and of course a
power button when you want to turn these
on or off now you might have noticed
that there's a special button here this
is the bass boost and this does exactly
what it says and man does it pack a
punch but we'll get into that in just a
second because I know you guys want the
scoop on sound quality this is a base
level extreme pair of headphones and one
should keep in mind that that's exactly
who Sony's catering to would be is they
are part of the XP line which stands for
extra bass in its standard listening
mode you can expect clear vocals along
with some great bass even though the
focus is on the low end you can still
enjoy music that isn't bass heavy so you
aren't limited to genres like EDM or
hip-hop but I gotta say for those of you
who aren't too crazy about the head
rattling the bass is pretty present when
listening to most songs so you might
want to look elsewhere if that's not
your thing
while the bass is already insane sony
allows you to kick it up a notch with
bass freaking boost if you're looking to
have an earthquake simulator on your
head you've come to the right place
this feature reminds me of month but
love that song a Paul's wireless headset
as it takes things to a whole new level
in terms of bass and you guys know how
much I love the pulse to be completely
honest though depending on the song that
the bass was can be a bit much
even from me at times and I end up
having to turn it off
I found that sound quality also takes a
slight hit when you use this feature so
you'll definitely want to use it at your
discretion one thing to keep in mind is
that this feature is only available when
using bluetooth but the standard
listening mode has more than enough bass
to keep you happy
even without the boost now do I
recommend these absolutely I know a ton
of you guys have the same taste as me so
you'll definitely want to get your hands
on these Sony hit this one out of the
park and I just wish it was a bit more
portable they typically go for 200 bucks
but I've seen them as low as a hundred
bucks on Amazon and I think you can get
them now for about 150 even at $200 I'm
super happy with the purchase if you
pick these up definitely tweet me a pic
or tag me on Instagram so I see you
rocking it and I'll catch you guys in
the next one
till then it's your average consumer
