consumer and today I've got a review of
the much requested and much-anticipated
bloom foams phantom so let's not wasting
any time
scare right into it alright guys so here
we have the boom phones and they're
trying to get into the headphone game by
sporting a new feature where you can
share your music by playing it out loud
with the speakers that are on the
outside of the ear cups of these
headphones and this is a pretty cool
feature that no other headphones have
unless you want to count the beats
Studios that bleep just as bad as the
speaker plays music but either way it's
a really cool new feature that they're
going for and it's definitely something
new and I'm sure that's why there's a
lot of buzz with the whole boom phone
craze right now and you guys don't know
I like to take a look at the case this
comes with a nice hard shell case and
it's pretty cool because it has the
little imprints of the logo the eyes of
it anyway and it's pretty cool I do like
that it's like velcro inside so you can
take this little pouch in and off or in
and out depending on what you want to do
with it you can leave it in there so it
can hold all of your cables and little
accessories there what I think is pretty
cool and overall it's just a nice case
it has these little two side straps so
that you can either hold it in your hand
or use the clip here and overall so
pretty decent case regular hardshell
case but I do like the look of it and
take a quick look at the cable you'll
see that it has somewhat of an inline
remote that it has a play and pause
button as well as a volume slider so you
can actually use this little slider to
control the volume of the actual
headphones not the device that you're
listening to music from but the actual
headphones themselves and this is pretty
cool if you want to control the volume
using like an Android device that
typically doesn't have volume control
buttons from you know on other headphone
remotes so this is pretty cool you can
max out the volume on your device and
then control it with the inline remote
here I was very impressed by the style
of the headphones when I first unboxed
it and overall I'm very happy with the
look of it
it's a little bigger than some people
might like
I guess I've seen so many headphones now
that I'm okay with the bigger ones but
back in the day I probably wouldn't like
something this big but I've gotten used
to these kinds of sizes and overall I
really do like to look but if you're
looking for a smaller pair of headphones
these might not be the size you're
looking for and I think will really want
me over in the looks of these headphones
is the matte finish it's a nice black
matte finish and you can see around the
ear cup where the speaker is that it
says boom phones all over and it's
surrounded by that matte finish and
what's really cool about these ear cups
is that when you hit the on switch
you'll see that the boom phones turn on
and they go into this amplified mode and
that's represented by this white LED
light on the outside of the ear cups
around the logo and when you press the
little logo inside it'll turn red the
LED lights will turn red and you'll see
that you're in the boom box speaker mode
so these little lights are pretty cool
in my opinion they make it have some
style to it so definitely a fan of that
and not only does it look pretty nice
but I gotta say these aren't very
comfortable the headband is made of a
really nice cushion and the ear cups
have the same cushioning as well now the
only thing with the ear cups is that
it's not really deep so you can feel
your ears pressing against the ear cup
so some of you might not like that it
might bother some people after long
listening periods but overall it's very
comfortable the band and the ear cups
are very soft so there's no real
problems there at all in my opinion but
it will bother those who don't like
their ears to be touched with the ear
cups now you'll also see that this takes
a USB so you can charge these you don't
have to put in any double-a batteries or
triple-a whatever you can discharge
these into your outlet and they'd be
good to go definitely thumbs up for them
in making this a rechargeable battery
and overall I think the battery life is
pretty decent I can't recall off the top
exactly how long
at last but it's definitely lasted me
long enough to not really have to worry
about it definitely can go a couple of
days without charging it easily all
right so now you're probably wondering
how do the boom phone sound I think for
your average consumer anybody will enjoy
the boom phones they'll probably see no
real issues with it for anyone who has
experienced with other high-end
headphones or anything in that range or
in its price range you'll probably be a
little bit disappointed I personally
don't think it was the clearest pair of
headphones I've tried it didn't impress
me when I first tried them on and I had
to give them some burn in time let them
run a bit see if I can loosen up the
drivers a bit which are the speakers
inside the ear cups for those of you who
don't know but I gave them some time to
burn in try to listen to it see if it
got any better didn't really make a
difference in my opinion so I wasn't
thrilled with the sound quality do I
think the average consumer would be just
fine with it most likely the average
consumer would probably just be okay
with it but for anyone who considers
themselves a bit above the average
consumer when it comes to headphones
like these you probably won't be
interested in the boom phones themselves
but the boom phone also has other things
going for it like its speaker now how
does the speaker sound the speaker
sounds okay as long as you don't put the
volume all the way up which kind of
defeats the purpose you if you want
boombox or you know exterior speakers
you want to be able to crank the volume
and it still sounds good at those
volumes it definitely does lose its
sound quality as you turn up the volume
quite a bit and hey let's test it out
and see what you guys think and all
right guys so now we're gonna play some
music at 50% 75% and 100% so you guys
can kind of get an idea of how the sound
quality decreases once you get to 100%
so here it is starting off at 50%
and this isn't necessarily really loud
this is pretty normal value and for
speaker it's okay
but let's crank it up 75% and there is a
75% that's right on our 100 I'm
definitely not sure whether or not the
camera or my recording device here
picked up the sound quality that well
but at a hundred percent it definitely
distorts a lot the you definitely won't
even feel comfortable listening at a
hundred percent volume because it's
gonna sound pretty bad there's a lot of
distortion so the speaker quality at 1/2
percent definitely not what you want it
to be which is really unfortunate
because the whole point is to blaster
music and share it and all that stuff so
pretty unfortunate there but that's
about it for the speaker and the sound
quality and actually that pretty much
wraps up the review guys I hope I didn't
burst too many bubbles out there for all
those boom phone lovers but um hey
that's about it I'll catch you guys in
the next video until then is your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
