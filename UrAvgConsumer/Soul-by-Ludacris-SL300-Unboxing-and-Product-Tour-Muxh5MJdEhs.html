want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video it was going on guys
drivers consumer now I've done a couple
of videos on headphones endorsed by
artists like 50 cent dr. Dre so I
figured why leave Ludacris out of the
mix so I picked up the SL 300 the solo
by guru Chris and I'm going to do an
unboxing video for you guys today
all right so let's not wasting time
let's get right into it so here we have
the soul by Lucas let me give you guys a
quick tour around the box up front you
have you know your preview of this
headphones themselves on the sides you
have the contents everything that comes
inside the box as well as letting you
know it has the inline remote control
that works for the iPod iPhone and iPad
in the back here you have a picture of
Ludacris and his statement on what music
should sound like through your
headphones as well as a list of features
on the left side of the box and the
bottom goes on to show us every single
device that it is capable of working
with as far as the inline remote control
mainly it's a bunch of Apple products
they're all iPads and iPhones and iPads
so pretty much this guarantee to almost
work with any iPod you have or any
pretty much any Apple product
alright so enough of the box toy let's
see what's inside
alright so let's pull off the top
and here we are with the headphones
deserve a case they come with its a
pretty large case I'm glad it's a case
at least though I unboxed the the street
by 50 cent and they only came with the
pouch I'm getting this because their
design isn't foldable but I'm glad this
came with a hard case at least so I can
be thrown into a book bag or something
with no issues here we have a box of
accessories you can pop this open
alright so this comes with double-a
battery
I'm triple a batteries I'm sorry umm
this is your tangle free cable 3.5
millimeter cable um it comes with your
airline adapter as well as a small
microfiber cloth nothing fancy about the
microfiber cloth and this is your tangle
free cable with the inline control the
control talk as well as some user
manuals and things of that nature so I'm
going to want the one with the inline
control and I can put away the rest now
I didn't know these came with triple-a
batteries I didn't really do my research
on me is too much but it I'm not too
much of a fan of headphones that require
batteries I'm gonna test out to see if
they need it to run as you guys know I
don't have the studios and the use of
batteries is the main reason why I don't
have those and I'm not interested but
let's put these away
all right put this on the side all right
so let's open this up I like that
there's a little clip here so that you
can just attach it select I guess the
end of your book bag or something like
that I don't know if you want to do that
I personally do do that with my beats so
let's see what we get inside all right
so here we have the headphones there's a
little side pouch here with nothing but
some silica gel I'm guessing you can
throw in your cables and things like
that it's a pretty large pouch and it
has um this little things that I just
stays in there so that's pretty good you
won't have anything flying around wet
inside and with that aside let's pull up
the headphones and here they are okay
these feel very light these are really
really light um we'll see how they are
with the batteries inside of them but my
initial impression is that this is very
light um I honestly can't say this feels
like something of high quality but um
feels really plastic II can see I'm
impressed too much by the initial first
look has a lot of this attracts
fingerprints like crazy already
mind-boggling I barely touched it but um
okay let's put in the headphone I mean D
batteries and give this thing some juice
all right so now we have the batteries
put in let me give you guys a quick tour
around the headphones all right guys so
here we have a bit of a close-up of the
headphones and on the left side you'll
see that right under here we have the
input for the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack as
well as a on and off switch for the
noise canceling when you flip it on
you'll see it emits this light blue
light and also on the left side of the
ear cups you'll see a little button here
that when you press it it emits a nice
little glow from the soles the sole
labels on the sides and it's like a
little blue light let me see if I can
show you guys it for a moment so real
quick here's what it looks like when you
press that little button and on the left
side of the ear cup and also on the
right side you'll see the there's
nothing too fancy on the right side but
under the sole logo you can flip it and
you'll find the batteries and you'll
also find a high low level output level
switch so as you can see here let me see
if I can get the reflection right but
anyway here's the switch you can use
this to change the output levels and
pretty much that's all for I saw the
little fancy features on the headphones
themselves the inside of the band is
this nice stitched coating and it's
actually really soft and it definitely
seems like it's going to be a
comfortable fit on the head it's it's
the best feeling cushion I felt so far
on a pair of headphones and um up top
here you'll see it says the sole by
Ludacris as all the other headphones are
branded up top and pretty much that's
all there is to it for the UM for the
headphones there's not that much else
going on with it here so here we have
the cable for the sole SL 300s on this
side it says sole as well as the other
side on the 3.5 milimeter jacks they
both have sole printed on them now this
this cable is a flat tangle-free design
similar to the beats tours and they're
pretty decent length and here you can
see the inline remote control this is
for your play and pause and skipping
tracks etc button and you have the
volume up and volume down buttons as
well the buttons feel pretty good to
supress they give some decent feedback
and here on the back you can also see
the mic for when you're talking on the
phone and you know recording or whatever
it also comes with this little adapter
for I guess like DJ use and things like
that alright and that pretty much wraps
up this unboxing guys so like I said
before these are decent feeling hand
phones alright so that pretty much wraps
up to some boxing guys so this has been
the sold by Ludacris the SL 300
comes with a nice little case here and
on some decent feeling headphones like I
said I'm not too impressed by the build
quality but I'm gonna give it a test run
and see how they sound how to sound
feels cuz it looks good it just doesn't
feel that great nothing it doesn't feel
like a $300 pair of headphones but you
know it looks good the colors are great
less where I'm going to test out the
sound I'll let you guys know how that
how that goes and pretty much that's it
