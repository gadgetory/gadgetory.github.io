using this guy's a little weird but this
is cool alright guys so right now we are
in Washington Square Park on the booster
board Aries behind me dog park but yeah
this thing is fun I'm enjoying it
Aries being very careful because she
doesn't want to hurt herself like last
time but she's getting it she's getting
it so this is definitely something I'm
gonna be running timing you guys know I
love Electric skateboards area is having
the hardest arms going down this super
slight Hill
we're gonna reach over my head alright
Irish so thoughts one of the shovels I
want you guys to see what this visit
told my I liked it yeah yeah I thought a
lot of fun day what it was a success
because I did fall yes good I think I
definitely get more used to it I bumped
into a guy can't stop the guys I get
your girl mister can't be fill people
out guys like I'm so sorry it was it was
a way I'm not the master this blow the
next one you guys I see me just zip it
down the sheets viewers yeah right sure
the boss
sorry but yeah I liked it too I got to
put it through its paces and then
probably work on a review for you guys
actually pretty fun I was at the Z war
to to come comparison oh you know yeah
yeah whatever
anyway it was fun go Sunday with Harry
in Alta around a bunch of makeup it's
not a new thing this is a part of this
phase happen how many times was before
this is the second coming of this day's
second coming well it's okay cuz his um
his Gundam is you surfacing again so
yeah I guess just testing them out guys
oh my feet I feel like this place is a
laboratory we've got all kinds of
chemicals and some cautions here and
guess what the customers are the lab
rats
so I'll sound Irish needs to hurry up
and make her YouTube channel I have one
well you've got one yeah but I sort of
like what I would do this makeup stuff
man I'm sure the ladies who watch this
channel maybe we'll probably subscribe
for fun well that's how you have to
start off with a channel like you got to
do it for fun and then everything else
is later yeah because if you go in
thinking I'm gonna be super successful
and have this crazy big channel you're
setting yourself up for disappointment
it just kind of happens yeah you
definitely just started I get it forget
just the kids maybe I think so it's
important so finally free and it happens
to be snowing now
see re climate unchanged while we were
in there all kinds of crazy things and
now we're in target there is not a
single part left oh snap not one card
that's insane
it's not like we're here for food anyway
she wants a cart to carry all her makeup
so luckily target has a text section and
this is where I peace out later
deuces on to my section oh this is Jen
this looks awesome a carrying case for
the 30s and this is a Zelda thing so
it's got the Triforce on there I think I
might get this selling like 20 bucks so
I'm for it
so plot twist she's not in the makeup
section which is really surprising I
don't know what out where else she could
be there must be a second makeup section
somewhere
that's the only way to explain it there
you go
what's up you got your own cart so airy
insists on using Google Maps from the
browser no idea why when she has the
actual app on her phone but she defaults
ur browser every time
explain yourself game lady I have no
explanation I should be ashamed of this
I'm glad you know
