want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone it's your average consumer and
today I'm a comparison video for you
guys of the SOL Republic's tracks HD
versus the SOL Republic tracks ultra so
let's not wasting time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have this whole public Tracks HD
and boom the solar public tracks ultra
now there's not much to compare as far
as the design of these headphones go
they're exactly the same headphones
there's really nothing different about
them aesthetically aside from the ear
cups and I'm going to show you guys a
close-up of what the ear clubs look like
okay guys so here we have the two ear
cups now these are that your cuts for
the SOL Republic tracks HD and these are
the ultras right here you know I do
think the ultras look better because of
this um aluminum finish and has like
this little spin feature on there and it
feels real nice but my only problem with
that is that these get dirty pretty
quickly and like a scratch like this can
um I'm not sure if okay I'm sure you
guys can see it a little bit but stuff
like that shows up all the time on these
and you kind of have to like you know
rub it out so it can go away so that can
be a bit of an annoyance whereas this is
just like a solid surface still feels
pretty good but it's a solid service so
you don't have to worry about it looking
a little funky or anything like these
can like little things can get in the
crevice of these like the little spin
here so it can look dirty
while these will won't look dirty for
any reason unless you actually get
something on it so that's just something
these were just normal use as you can
see here smudging up a bit that's not so
cool not too happy about that
but overall I do like design more but
that is a kit that is a deal breaker for
me that it can look dirty I don't my
headphones looking dirty when I'm
outside and pretty much that's about it
for the difference between these two
headphones guys this is about the only
difference I've seen between them so far
as far as aesthetics alright so that's
pretty much
the difference between the headphones as
far as you know Lois durability they're
the same thing they both can do a 180
turn I mean I what I gave explicit so
they both have like the whole durability
aspect involved in both of them so
that's always pretty cool as you can see
I can kind of just bend them all the way
out and it just be fine
so you know exact same headphones guys
I'm guessing there's just different
drivers that are on these drivers being
the actual ear cups so those are sought
the only difference between them and so
now let's just talk about the sound
quality because that's what that's all
one places difference now when it came
to sound quality it's actually pretty
surprising to me that I like this the
tracks HD is more than I did the ultras
um these seem to sound a bit louder
these had a bit more bass to them than
these did I don't know maybe these were
just supposed to be a bit more a bit
flatter I don't know but I had to really
really listen in to see what the
difference was and when at the end of it
I realized that these just had a bit
more bass and these just didn't sound
know it's not as punchy as these did so
um I'm honestly I don't know why these
cost $50 more maybe this may be
something that audio files can pick up
some people who have like you know
fine-tuned hearing that can pick up but
your average consumer will not hear a
difference outside of just the bass so
if you don't if you want a little more
bass you know go for these I mean in
they're cheaper these are 130 compared
to about 180 so it's $50 difference and
these seem to offer a bit more if you
want to pay the extra to lose a little
bass I mean go with these I'm not sure
why one would do that unless you really
just don't like bass or something but
honestly I think the H these are a
better pick if I had to choose between
the two I really do like the color of
the ultras and I do like the fact that
it has this own little spin finish like
I said a candle of dirty and stuff so
I still think with I would go as far as
sound quality goes with the tracks HD
and that pretty much it's solely this
that's all I can compare guys there's
not much else to it I tried to do some
research and see what the difference is
but everyone just says that this has
like the v12 engine versus the v10 and
that this is just supposed to sound a
lot better honestly guys average
consumer style you won't notice the
difference outside of the base so pretty
much that say I'd go with the tracks
eight steel for the ultras um another
bad thing about the ultras is I don't
think they have too many colors yet and
this white can get a bit dirty where I
sneeze you know they have like the black
options all a whole bunch of different
kinds of boxes so we have your choices
there these are only in white and blue
these white um cushions can get dirty so
that's another little negative about
these compared to the HD and that pretty
much wraps up this comparison guys I
know it's pretty short but there's not
much - there's not much difference
between these headphones outside the
sound quality and you know the sound
quality is in favor of the HDS compared
to the ultras in my opinion so if you
guys have any different different ideas
