consumer and today we're going to be
taking a closer look at the sony MDR
1000x
probably one of the most feature packed
Bluetooth headphones that I've used to
date and I know a lot of you guys saw on
my massive Tech unboxing that I picked
up an extra one of these guys to give
away here on the channel and if you want
to chance with that all you have to do
is make sure you subscribe to the
channel leave a comment down below and
boom your intern doesn't have to leave a
like as well but let's talk about these
headphones first off we've got to talk
about the design personally I'm a huge
fan of the design of the 1000x
it's low profile and has a classy feel
with his leather like ear cups and it's
all black finish now in terms of storage
we've got a couple of options these are
a foldable pair of headphones so you can
fold them as normal or if you'd like you
can lay them down completely flat which
is a nice way to save space if you're
throwing them in something like a
backpack the overall freedom of these
headphones is pretty slim especially in
the headband area and it is completely
made out of plastic but you don't walk
away feeling like this is cheap it still
feels like a high quality product and
durability wise it feels pretty solid so
we can make some pretty out-there
looking headphones but I feel like they
hit the nail on the head in terms of a
nice overall classy looking design here
which also gets all the check marks in
terms of portability durability and
overall size the only thing I'd knock
about these headphones in terms of their
design are the air cuts not having a
more comfortable cushion someone
definitely only has some way more
comfortable headphones out there like
the 950 BTS or 950 N ones or even be
Wireless here on headphones those are
all extremely comfortable this one's not
so bad but songs done better in the past
let's talk about that sound quality
these sounds amazing the reason I often
choose bezel to pick you see 35 lately
is that it just sounds better
the 1000x does an amazing job delivering
impressive punchy bass without messing
up the sound quality it has great
clarity and a nice dynamic range which
allows it to work well with a lot of
genres of music I think you've got to be
really critical to find the issues with
the sound of the 1000x I think anybody
who tries it out will walk away with a
really good impression of these great
sound and some awesome noise cancelling
usually leads to a pretty good
experience
and speaking of noise-canceling that's
one of the many features that makes this
guy great for travelers commuters or
anyone just looking to black out their
outside sounds and I've compared this to
some of the best like the bose qc25 the
sennheiser pxc 550 s and it is still on
top and when you've got these on it
really helps to tune out everything
around you so it's great if you really
want to focus on your music or maybe
just have a smooth commute and as I said
before is this thing is feature packed
so noise cancelling aside it still has a
ton of features and first up we've got
NFC so if you have an NFC enabled device
when you want to initially pair these
headphones all you got to do is tap it
to the device and boom you're good to go
and I like that because it just takes
the hassle out of having to hold the
power button for a bunch of seconds and
then find it in your Settings app it's a
lot easier with NFC I'm glad we have you
here now we've also got this very
interesting feature called ambient sound
now when you turn this on the normal
mode will allow you to hear things that
are going on around you
while still having on the headphones and
listening to music there's also a second
ambient mode called ambient voice now
this is the feature that I use the most
this feature lets only voices come in
when you're listening to your music so
all other ambient sounds are pretty much
canceled I personally like this feature
because when I'm home
I like to listen to my headphones a lot
and when I was trying to get my
attention I don't have to completely
shut her out I'm still able to hear her
and that saves me a lot of trouble now
let's say you're not using one of the
ambient features but you still want to
know what's going on around you instead
of having to take off your headphones
all you have to do is cut the right ear
cup and it brings everything that you're
listening to down to a mute so with that
you're able to know what's going on
without having to take off your
headphones which is a very nice touch
and since these are a pair of Bluetooth
wireless headphones you would expect to
see some audio control somewhere on the
ear cups but instead we have no physical
buttons but we do have gesture controls
all built into the right ear cup so if
you want to skip forward a track or
maybe go back all you have to do is
swipe right or left and if you want to
control your volume swipe up or down and
boom you have access to all those
controls and of course you even have
access to play and pause by double
tapping the ear cup now I personally
like having gesture controls instead of
physical buttons because some blue
phones tend to suffer from having way
too many buttons and you kind of lose
track of where the buttons are you have
to hunt them down with this everyone
knows where the right ear cup is and add
access to their controls and we're able
to have the awesome noise canceling and
ambient sound features because of the
mics that are built into the top of the
left and right ear cup and with these
it's able to take in the sounds that are
going on around you and bring them into
the headphones when you're using the
ambient sound feature and it's able to
tell the headphones exactly what to
cancel out when you're using noise
cancelling and so on has even
implemented a crazy noise canceling
optimizer feature which we can access by
holding the most tempting button and
what this does is it scans your head for
glasses hair your head shape all kinds
of information and the stuff going on
around you and it tailors the noise
canceling experience to fit whatever it
scans which is just nuts this thing also
packs a pretty standard 20 hours of
battery life but with that you
definitely won't be running to charge
this after a couple of listening
sessions and if your battery does happen
to die you can still use the wired cable
that it comes with to continue your
listening now overall I think these are
an amazing pair of headphones but what
is probably the biggest flaw here is the
price tag these used to retail for about
400 bucks which is expensive but now you
can find them for around 350 which is
the same price as the bose qc25 so if
you're trying to decide between the two
this one's a clear winner but there's
still a lot of money well I guess that's
the price you pay for great sound
features noise cancelling a good design
you really can't complain here you're
getting a high quality pair of
headphones here definitely one of my
favorites for sure but it is expensive
but I do think that it's absolutely
worth it and definitely worth the
investment
luckily enough for one of you guys you
don't have to pick one up you're going
to be able to win one here so be sure to
insert the giveaway hopefully you guys
enjoy this video if you're on the fence
about these hopefully this helps you out
if it did be the cool guy or girl that
gives it a thumbs up I'll catch you guys
in the next video till then is your
average consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
