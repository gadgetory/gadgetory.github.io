today we are finally talking about
backpacks again this time we've got
about six of them it's supposed to be a
top five but these are six awesome
backpacks under a hundred bucks that'll
be great whether you want to make a
gadget backpack or you're looking for
something a bit more low-key
but first let's get rid of them and give
you a huge shout out to today's sponsor
LastPass now I don't know if you guys
have ever heard of LastPass but they're
one of my favorite companies to work
with because I've been using them for
years before I even made the channel but
for those of you who have never heard of
LastPass it's a password manager that
allows you to securely store your
passwords and credentials so you don't
have to go writing them down have a hard
time remembering them you're not to do
any of that just let LastPass do it and
what's awesome about LastPass is once
you've created an account it'll pretty
much work on any platform you sign into
so your desktop Android iOS doesn't
matter you have access to all of your
passwords and all of your credentials in
one place now for me this thing is an
absolute must on any device I use I go
to a website or I try to use a certain
app and it auto fills everything that I
need to and what's great about that is
because now I don't need to have the
same password for each and every account
that I use just so I can remember them
it makes it a lot more secure so you're
not using the same password over and
over and over I know a ton of you out
there doing it I'm putting everybody I
know everybody's doing it and what's
awesome is that last pass gives you
unlimited password storage as well as
password breach alert so if someone
tries to get your password and hack in
they're gonna let you know so of course
if you guys want to learn more about
LastPass and I definitely think you
should check it out hit the links down
below in the description it is
absolutely worth having on the computer
poor fellows but all right guys now it
is time for us to talk about these
backpacks
malcom hit me with the first one alright
so this guy right here is from eBags now
i've heard of this backpack before
seeing a couple of videos on them but I
never really got my hands on it and I
will say guys this one I think it might
be the next gadget backpack I know you
guys are waiting for that video but wow
I was really floored when I got my hands
on it it goes for a hundred bucks but I
think it is well worth it now it's got a
pretty uncommon
internal design it has a zipper up front
that gives you access to all of these
pouches now this guys is all a lot so
you have all these different pouches and
zippers and you can just throw a ton of
stuff inside of here this right here is
what got me so this is awesome you also
have a zipper down here where you can
put things like glasses or anything that
you think is important that you don't
want to get damaged because this is a
hard shell so it'll protect whatever it
is inside of it and you of course also
get a little pouch over here so if you
have to have your water bottle or
anything you of course have that covered
but now it doesn't stop there
you also have way way more so you have
access to this side right here so you
can throw something in like a laptop or
rather a tablet and anything else you
can fit inside of here and you guys can
see right here that you have a little
border to kind of separate that
hardshell compartment and if you want to
have something that stays right here you
can do that as well and not only that
you also got a spot right here where you
can throw in your clothing books
whatever it may be and even your laptop
now you might have noticed that the
straps are not how and that's because
you can actually use this as a briefcase
I like this kind of flexibility it's one
of those things you didn't know you
needed until you got it so I think
that's really cool and you can also just
take out the straps and use it like a
normal backpack so you don't have to
worry about that listen guys this
backpack right here I am loving and it
is worth the hunted but I'm all for this
I don't know if you guys can tell but
there's a lot of snow falling behind me
right now and it is kind of crazy next
here we have the ghost tech NRG bag too
now let's get right to it this thing
doesn't have a ton of compartments it's
got one big pouch up front you also get
a little area to store a drink or
something and you also have the
big pouch where you have a couple of
dividers in as well now I will say this
this isn't a backpack that has a ton of
space so if you don't walk around with a
lot this will probably be just fine but
if you do happen to have a ton of things
that you need to carry with you every
day this isn't ideal for that purpose
but what's nice is that underneath all
of this you have another slot for your
laptop but the way it's designed its
anti-theft so if someone tries to get
your laptop they just have no way it has
these flaps that kind of hide the zipper
so there is no way for anyone to get
access to your laptop but let's talk
about the tech features inside of this
guy so first and foremost this thing has
a built-in portable charger if I
remember correctly it's sixteen thousand
milliamp hours so that is going to
charge plenty of smart phones and even
tablets so it's built in - here you can
feel it right here and it's removable so
if you need to take it out maybe you're
getting on a plane or something and
they've got strict rules about that it
is removable so you can do that and then
you also have a USB port right here on
the side so all you have to do is take
out whatever device you need plug it
into here and boom you are charging
which is nice because you can just walk
around charging your device without
having a portable charger in your pocket
or anything like that is just very
convenient here now this thing has a
built-in portable charger but what's
great is that right here under this
little flap you have a micro USB port
and this is where you charge the
backpack but the cherry on top is this
guy right here on the shoulder strap so
with this you have a little cutout with
an LED indicator to let you know just
how much charge you've got left in that
portable charger this is a backpack that
I've talked about a couple of times on
the channel already but it absolutely
has to make lists especially if you're a
tech lover so this backpack right here
is actually it's one of those Amazon
backpacks where you don't really know
the company behind it it's got some it's
funny FAIL a never heard
before but this is actually a pretty
cool backpack it's very very lightweight
it's not big at all I wouldn't even try
to put a 15-inch laptop into this guy
but if you have a smaller laptop maybe
like a MacBook Air or maybe a netbook
that book last time someone uses a
netbook this one's very very inexpensive
I think this one went for around
30-something bucks but what's nice about
this is that it also has a built-in USB
port on the side as well as a headphone
jack now like I said this is a pretty
compact backpack you get a little slot
up front you also have another
compartment up front where you can store
a few things and this guy will hold your
smaller laptop as well as anything else
you need and you also got some
compartments over here as well and
what's cool about this is that it also
has built-in security so you can
actually just put in a passcode and get
access to your backpack you can just
have the zipper handles come right to
the center open up the lock and boom you
got a very secure backpack that nobody
is gonna be able to open up until they
mess around with this so I like this
it's smaller low key if you don't want
to walk around with a giant laptop bag
this is a really nice inexpensive one
with some cool security features now
we've got another one of those backpacks
right here but what I like about this
one is that it's basically a larger
version of what we had before but with
more compartments and as you can see a
completely different design now this one
also goes for around 30 bucks and I will
say I think this one is an absolute
steal you can also put a portable
charger inside of this guy it doesn't
come with one built into it neither does
the last one but what's nice about this
bag is that it's inexpensive has a lot
of space as you guys can see it is one
of the taller backpacks and look at this
you have a ton of compartments here as
well yeah spots for a giant laptop a
tablet and even some more things on the
other side but what's also great is that
you get compartments up front as well so
you can have pencils whatever
you want notebooks all inside of here
and I think it looks pretty good for the
price 30 bucks or so I really like this
one so this guy over here is from
JanSport now I don't know how popular
JanSport is these days back when I was
growing up JanSport was like the brand
to have you had to have a chance for it
now you're not gonna see external USB
ports or anything like that this is not
that kind of backpack but it does have a
few spots you have a little compartment
up front to store whatever you want you
have another one above that and what's
cool about this thing is that it also
has these little labels so it'll tell
you what JanSport intended these pockets
to be used for and above that you have
even more compartments you see that's
how you win me over you give me a lot of
compartments so I can choose how I use
the backpack and this one does that but
right here with the main compartment if
you're someone who likes to take gym
clothes with them or maybe some sneakers
that'll definitely fit inside of here
alongside a laptop or whatever other
device you're going to be bringing with
you and this one actually has a label
for a power cable so you can throw those
in here as well you can do whatever you
want but it's always nice when backpacks
come with labels in my opinion so you
can have an idea of how you want to
organize your backpack while you can
store your laptop inside of that main
compartment there's a dedicated spot for
it here so if you want to put your
laptop or tablet there's an actual
dedicated spot for it and this thing
only goes for about 80 bucks so this is
a really good price for a very solid
backpack I really like this one so right
here we have a backpack from Tiger knew
these are all brands from Amazon they're
the ones who really pushed the whole
external USB port I'm completely okay
with that I love this feature so the
very front you have access to all the
typical things that you'd see regular
pockets but it's got a pretty big space
and over here you've got a ton more but
this thing has pretty much like what
looks like a grid of pockets so that you
can organize this the way you want
what's also nice is that you have
another compartment right here
the side so if you want to use it from
the side or access something from the
side you can kind of just take it pull
it over your shoulder
zip down and dig inside and get what you
need this one's also about 30-something
bucks so a lot of inexpensive options
for you to choose from but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl I give this video a
thumbs up I of course have everything
linked down below in the description for
you to check out but till the next video
guys your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
