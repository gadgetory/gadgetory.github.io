consumer and it's time for another ask
you AC but Before we jump into all of
the questions I did wanna let you guys
know that it is officially the
anniversary of the surface Pro and
Microsoft sent over five surface pros
for me to give away to you guys and of
course I'm gonna be giving one away in
this video and all you have to do is
make sure you're subscribed to the
channel hit that like button and leave a
comment down below and boom you entered
to win I'm also going to be giving one
away on Instagram and another on Twitter
so be sure to follow me and look out for
those posts and you do have to be in the
u.s. to enter but for all of you who do
good luck when is the next tag team
video I'm assuming you mean with Ari but
I don't know Ari when is the next tag
team video right who knows when she'll
be ready thinking about getting a 2d s
or 3ds XL are they still worth it in
2018 well if you haven't played any of
the games in the 2d sdds library then it
is definitely worth it if you don't mind
going back to some of the older great
games that are already out in terms of
new games coming out in the future I
don't really see that happening so if
you're okay playing the older games
definitely get it there are lots of fun
games to play but looking for new
content I wouldn't go for it
what are those cool light changing wall
lights that you show in your videos the
lights are talking about are the Aurora
Nano leaves they're like a light panel
that you can put together and make your
own crazy design and have it light up in
all these different colors because
they're RGB lights and they're great for
decorating a room I personally really
like them they're a little expensive but
if you're looking to spruce up your
setup or maybe you just want to add nice
decorations to a modern space those are
a really nice option and I love them
what about a what's in my gadget
backpack 6.0 I actually already did that
video and if you haven't seen it I'll of
course have the link down below in the
description for you guys to check it out
Goku or Vegeta I've always liked Goku a
bit more in Dragon Ball Z but in the new
super ones the guys they made him really
dumb I don't know what happened
but I'm not a fan of the Dragon Ball
super Goku so I'm on Team Vegeta for a
super but anything before that
definitely go do you think the pixel
three is going to be the camera King
this year or do you think this year
somebody else is going to catch up
unless manufacturers start copying some
of the software that the pix
who uses I think the pixel three has a
really good chance at being the king
still that doesn't mean that other
phones won't have amazing cameras but I
don't know pixels two for two right now
do you use an emoji much which one is
your favorite mmm
can't say I use it much but I do like
the pig it's pretty expressive do you
still get excited opening packages of
course you guys have seen my massive
tech unboxing videos I love opening up
new products and I'm a tech lover so any
new product that I opened up for the
first time is gonna be fun which item in
your setup do you cherish the most I
think right now the one item I cherish
the most in my setup has to be the iMac
Pro being able to chop up videos and
have it handled that with no problem ah
it's a lifesaver it stays on time it
allows more flexibility with the videos
I just love it you can handle red
footage it's a win-win that is an
expensive computer but it's so good for
what I do anyway where did you go to
school and when did you get married I
went to college in Drexel University in
Philadelphia and I studied business
marketing as for getting married I got
married I knew you were gonna say that
but I got married in summer
I know it's July but I'm gonna say
summer of 2016 we did a video you
getting me in trouble thanks a lot video
- that the video - the wedding is down
below how much is too much to pay for
quality Bluetooth headphones I'd say
some of the best Bluetooth headphones
I've found have been around the 350
dollar range 400 if it's really worth it
that's like the max but if we're talking
anything more than $400 no way unless
you just really really love them I think
400 is the absolute max well your
average cookie ever get a companion dog
so err he's been barking up that tree
for a while now but I don't want another
dog cookies enough
which feature would you like to see the
most on the galaxy s 9 or note 9
Samsung's actually pretty good about
putting features into their phones they
tend to add more than take away so I
really like that about Samsung so
there's not really anything that it's
missing I think in terms of adding
features that were you've seen from
other phones right now the only thing is
a really fast facial recognition
software or maybe the iris scanner being
a lot faster than it currently is I also
take an all-day battery Samsung I know
you're scared but all day battery that
would be amazing
are you excited for the red hydrogen
phone that's coming out and will you do
a real day in the life video on the
phone itself
I am excited for the camera that's gonna
be on that phone I don't know about the
phone itself it looks a little big I
don't know how it's gonna function all
that good stuff so I've never seen it I
don't know but I have high high hopes
for the camera so that's something
that's a real big winner for me in terms
of phones so I'm excited and we'll a
real day in the life be coming yes it
will I have one pre-ordered already so
once I get my hands on it you guys will
know what it's like to use it for a day
and more what is the best voice
assistant in your opinion as of right
now I would have to go with the Google
assistant I feel like it's a bit smarter
answers more questions if I have a
really complex question that's my go-to
assistant that's where I would ask
rather than Alexa or Siri stop listening
but yeah definitely Google assistant how
many days do you think you could survive
with absolutely no technology I think at
max I could survive about one day I
think one get out of here I think one
day would be enough to make me lose my
mind
I think one day would be refreshing I'd
be like all right off the phone I'm see
what life's all about
and then I'd be like okay what did
everyone talk about yesterday what was
being tweeted but what did the articles
saying about tech what's going on I'd be
I'd be losing my mind by day two for
sure what do you think of Xenoblade
Chronicles - I absolutely love that game
that is a really really good game on the
switch if you want you for something
with a good story good characters good
gameplay I definitely
we definitely recommend it I'm enjoying
it I'm only on chapter 7 right now I
don't know how many chapters there are
but I'm really enjoying my time I spent
a ton of hours playing so far where is
the good baseline start a gaming office
or room that both functions for media
and gaming well that's a very good
question my friend because I have a
video coming out that answers just that
it's a really basic room that would turn
into a nice smart room for gaming and
watching TV so definitely check that out
when it comes out I'll have a link down
below once it drops so you guys can find
that but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
