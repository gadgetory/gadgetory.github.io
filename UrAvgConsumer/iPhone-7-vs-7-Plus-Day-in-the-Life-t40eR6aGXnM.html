consumer and the iPhone 7 and 7 plus are
now out and it's safe to say Apple has
changed things up quite a bit so we're
gonna see what it's like to live a day
in the life with the new iPhone 7 or 7
plus so first up we're gonna talk about
the feel in the hand when you're
actually using one of these now the
colors are mostly the same with the
addition of black and jet black which
replace space grey and to be honest the
feel in the hand feels exactly the same
as with the 6 or 6s with all of the
colors except for jet black with its
glass back melted with aluminum jet
black feels more premium than it's
aluminum counterparts and it's actually
more grippy than the rest of them
this makes texting or talking on the
phone without a case a lot less scary
even though I would never recommend it
if you care to keep your phone in good
condition at all I could see the jet
black being a stressor unless you have
some protection on it but when a
straight up comes to the 7 or 7 plus
you'll have an easier time working with
the 7 for everyday things like texting
or even taking selfies but I do feel
like anyone could get used to the 7
pluses size over time I may be the only
one but I still like to use the reach
ability feature on the 7 plus so I can
have access to those hard-to-reach
buttons now I'm not gonna lie to you the
home button did take some getting used
to the haptic feedback isn't a solid
replacement for the actual pressing of a
button but of course we get used to it
it's just what happens now when it comes
to traveling with the new phones it's as
you'd expect the 7 is no big deal since
its small enough to go in your pocket
and you not even notice but the 7 plus
does take some getting used to senses a
bit on the bigger side but regardless of
color you're gonna want to stay away
from putting the jet black bear butt in
your pocket because if you so much as
look at jet black the wrong way you're
gonna get scratches fingerprints and all
kinds of Nick's on it which pretty much
sucks
now ladies for some reason your pockets
are much shallower than ours so the
phone's had some trouble storing the
iPhone 7 in her pants was just not an
option for air II it poked out of her
back pocket about an inch or so which
makes her open to being pickpocketed or
even breaking the phone and she sat on
it and the front pockets were even worse
more than half the phone poked out it
was not safe there whatsoever
now if the seven gave that much trouble
then it goes without saying that the
seven-plus was worse still storing both
phones in her typical purses big or
small was no issue at all I don't know
about you guys but I've got a ton of
headphones and I loved using them with
my iPhone unless you jump ship and go
the Bluetooth route you're either stuck
using the Lightning earpods they include
in the box or you'll have to use an
adapter while waiting until some
companies come out with new headphones
for the Lightning port I personally
don't think you'll be waiting long
especially since some companies have
already put some out now I haven't
really been impacted since I'm already
on that Bluetooth train but IRA had to
use the adapter and she found it very
annoying the adapter is just an extra
step and it's easy to forget or misplace
when you're not using them now I know
bluetooth is pretty annoying and people
don't want to go through that pairing
process but I would highly recommend
checking out a pair of headphones that
have apples w1 chip since it makes
pairing super simple by just turning it
on and it just makes life much easier
with the phone now when it comes to
media consumption whether that's photos
videos or even social media you'll
notice some nice improvements with the
25% brighter display better colors and
stereo speakers watching videos and
playing games is a step up from the 6s
when comparing the 7 and the 7 plus the
7 plus wins hands down for the most
enjoyable experience nothing compares to
a bigger screen and longer battery life
when playing video games were watching
your favorite video the cameras also
seen some nice improvements and men
taking pictures on an iPhone has never
been better the cameras are great for
taking photos even in low-light and when
it comes to video they both have optical
image stabilization so you're going to
get a smooth and nice video whenever you
need it and if you decide to go with the
7 plus you get access to that telephoto
lens so you get that 2 times zoom
without losing any quality now while
this might not change much for most
people for those of you who
unfortunately live a clumsy lifestyle
this has water resistance so this means
if you spill your drink or drop it in a
puddle you'll be ok
now one of the most important things
that impact your day-to-day use with
this is the performance and I got to say
the new 7 and 7 plus are beasts your
interactions with the phone when you're
jumping through apps or even loading in
certain games are going to be way way
quicker my buddy Austin dropped a cool
video
doing a speed test with the new iPhone
so if you want to see how well it can
perform I have links to that video down
below in the description now all these
features and great performance would
mean nothing without great battery life
and I'm happy to say that Apple has
improved it here with the 7 you get 2
more hours than last year's model
and with the 7 plus you get a single
hour but that's ok because the 7 plus
can go all day all night and in all
seriousness the battery life is much
improved owners of the 7 plus will have
no complaints and if you're a 7 owner
and you don't like it you can always get
that smart battery case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
