consumer and in the past few videos you
guys are seeing me rocking some custom
painted gear thanks for the guys over at
Cola wear and I think it was in my
massive tech unboxing you guys thought
I'm going to get a little bit height
when I saw some of these for the first
time in person
yo so today we're going to be taking a
closer look at how color was trying to
change at the game now you might be able
to get your hands on some of this gear
but first up we've got these bad boys my
custom ps4 and Xbox one elite controller
now what's awesome about color wear is
that you can design this gear yourself
and they bring it to life and on their
site you're able to pick between a ton
of solid or metallic colors and even a
matte or gloss finish and I don't know
if you guys noticed but I kinda like the
color teal and I based my gamers
paradise around it and I customized
these controls to fit with that theme I
figured a nice white base with black and
teal accents would embody the vibe of
this room and I got to say I think I
have a nail on the head but what I love
about these controllers is that this
doesn't look like some cheap paint job
if I showed you this in person you can
just came directly from Microsoft or
Sony it's really that good and if you
just look at the elite controller you
can see that they pretty much let you
pick the colors for almost every nook
and cranny of this thing even under the
joysticks which is nuts if you've got a
themed gaming setup or maybe you're on
Twitch and you want a controller that
will grab everyone's attention
especially in person this is absolutely
the way to go
now if you want a chance to win one of
these stick around to the end of the
video next up we've got this custom
painted retro ps4 pro now what they did
here it's beautiful
this is the most powerful PlayStation
yet outfitted to look like the classic
ps1 a bunch of us grew up on you can see
the colors are directly taken from the
original PlayStation and they're
implemented really well even on the
controller
they're both marked like the player one
and three slots found on the original
with the exact same color and fire
you'll also notice that the Sony and ps4
logo are the same group
in blue colors as the PSone power and
open button even the logo on top matches
the original color of the PlayStation
logo and it's been rotated to match the
orientation of the ps1 and lucky for me
the one I have here is one of 25 and
while all the limited edition numbered
consoles are gone they actually did a
rerelease without the numbers and of
course they also offer customization for
the Xbox one a now while you have a lot
of options for gaming hardware they also
paint tech like headphones Apple
accessories even IMAX in NZXT cases but
just go ahead and check out their site
I'll of course have a link down below
you can see everything that they offer
and last but not least here's the first
piece of custom gear that I got from
color where the bose qc25 now just like
the controller i was able to pick all
the colors on these but what's special
here is that color wear was able to add
my logo right onto the headphone and
there's just something about being able
to have your own logo on one of your
favorite pieces of text they just give
it a nice personal feeling the logo or
not the fact that color offers what
seems like an endless amount of
customization is what I think makes me
pretty special but on to the good stuff
I am teaming up with colorways to give
away a custom ps4 and custom Xbox one
elite controller control of you guys and
all you'll have to do is follow both
co-heir and me over on Twitter and I'll
of course have links to our accounts

controller take a screenshot and then
