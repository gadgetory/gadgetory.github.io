consumer and today we're gonna be
checking out my favorite tech of the
month for the month of January and for
those of you guys who've never seen one
my favorite a go-to month videos I'm
pretty much gonna be talking about the
tech I've been really enjoying for the
past month whether it's old or new and
the first thing is actually pretty new
it's the Apple smart battery case now I
know that everyone is crazy about this
case one because it's pretty expensive
it's a hundred and thirty bucks and two
because of the look but I will say this
guys this thing is a game changer when
it comes to just using your phone and
not having to worry about the battery
life now I've always had the bigger
iPhones and we never got a chance to
have a smart battery case as usually the
smaller ones that got it so I never got
to really enjoy the extra battery life
unless I was using one of my millions of
portable chargers but when you have it
built into the actual case and it being
a first-party case it is leagues better
with this battery case I can easily get
more than a day's worth of usage I think
I woke up this morning after using it
for a full day yesterday with about 24%
left come on guys I could get through
till the middle of the day with 24% but
one of the reasons why I like this being
a first-party case is when you go over
to the I guess left of your home screen
you can see how much percentage your
phone has the battery case in each other
Apple products that you have synced to
it and that's something you don't really
see with other battery cases usually you
have to like press a button somewhere on
the case and see how many little of the
LEDs light up this one I straight up
know that I have 38% and I love that and
trust me I know you can get like a $20
portable charger and just use that to
charge up your phone all day nobody
needs to tell me about portable chargers
trust me but something about being able
to just charge once and get that extra
battery life man it is a very very
different experience not having to find
a cable and a portable charger to plug
into this guy it's very very convenient
and another one of the cool features
with a new case that we didn't see
before is wireless charging so you can
just
on a charging pad and boom now it's
charging up the actual case so that to
me you get everything that you would
with a regular
even think it does some fast charging
I'm now don't quote me on that but it's
charged really quickly whenever I used a
fast charge with it but yeah enough
about the case but let's actually talk
about what I'm actually using to charge
it here this is the Nomad charging
station and this is I think the Apple
watch Edition so you can charge your
iPhone as well as your Apple watch all
in one spot I think this is really cool
because one not only does this thing
look really good it's got some nice like
leather material over here this is one
of the best Apple watch charges that
I've seen that's not proprietary to
Apple because you don't need to put in
another Apple watch charging cable
inside of it it's actually all built
right in and you're only using a single
cable to power this whole device but yes
I really like this thing because it
looks great it functions really well
only Dillon with one cable is nice so
this is something that I'm probably
gonna have on my next end next to my bed
in my master bedroom so this thing
definitely gets my recommendation is
also a little pricey I think it might
cost like 100 bucks but honestly if
you're someone who hates having to put
in an Apple watch charger inside of a
base or something this is gonna be a
nice solution that looks really good and
feels premium now you guys might have
seen that I had my Apple watch sitting
on that wireless charger because what
I've been wearing a lot lately is this
watch from g-shock this was a Christmas
gift for me and I think it's called the
g-shot G steel bluetooth watch it's got
a funky model number I'll have it linked
down below in the description of course
for you guys to check it out now the
reason why I'm even including this on
the list is because it does have some
tech inside of it it is bluetooth
enabled so you can connect this to your
smart phone and it gives you a couple of
cool features one being is that it uses
the Bluetooth and Internet to always
give you the right time so even if you
travel abroad with this thing once it
connects to your phone is going to know
what proper time it should be on and
automatically adjust itself not only
that it also has a
fine button which is the number one
reason why I use any SmartWatch and with
this fine button I can press it and then
all of a sudden my phone will go off
with this annoying ringtone that makes
it very very easy to locate it you can
also use the app to set alarms and
timers so that kind of functionality you
get as well and aside from that this is
just a cool g-shock watch that I feel
like as an adult I can wear with no
problem it has the rubber bands here on
the side so I can also change that out
for a metal band but you also get all of
the cool functionality that a g-shock
watch has so like that shock resistance
it can actually charge using solar
energy and it's actually a stronger kind
of solar charging it can pick up the
light emissions from things like light
bulbs so if you want to charge this
thing indoors you can do that as well
you don't have to really worry about
this thing dying and needing to put it
in the Sun so that is also a really nice
bonus and you of course get that extreme
durability it can go into water with no
issues so for me this was a must-have
I'm very glad that I got it for
Christmas she shot out to Anna for
getting it for me but I've been very
happy with this and it's worth checking
out if you want a more mature g-shock
watch that has some functionality with
your phone and last but not least is
something that's changed the way I use
my keys on a daily basis and you might
have seen this in massive tech unboxing
number 19 but that's this guy right here
the key smart Pro now the key smart pro
is basically a Swiss Army knife but for
your keys so check this out I can go
ahead and just pull out any of the keys
that I need to just like this you get
access to all of them and I can even add
a couple more but one thing I will say
guys while this I think is really cool
and a very functional way to put your
keys on ice instead of these little key
rings it was a complete pain to set this
up the very first time it was actually a
nightmarish experience but the end
result is what matters and I am very
happy with this and it has a couple of
cool tech features as well now you might
notice that there are two buttons here
one is actually a little flashlight
now this is really cool because if
you're opening up the door in the dark
maybe you can't really see the keyhole
you have a little flashlight there that
you can just kind of use so you make
sure you get right into the keyhole and
this is a feature that surprisingly came
in handy for me once so I am pretty sold
on having it here but that other button
this guy right here is the button for
tile so instead of having one of those
tile key rings on your keychain you can
just have this guy and it gives you that
functionality of being able to find your
keys with the app now with the app you
can of course make that little chime go
off so if you happen to misplace them
you can hear that and kind of locate
them you can also press the little tile
button to make your phone go off if you
happen to misplace your phone so it
works both ways it has a rechargeable
battery so you don't have to worry about
this like other tile products that once
they die that's the end of it but man
this thing I love it I just hate needing
to add keys to it or take away keys and
because this thing is very difficult to
get the keys on but I like it
nonetheless
look at this it's made my keys so much
easier to bring around with me but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it I'll have this
link down below in the description as
well as everything else that I mentioned
in today's video and if you enjoyed it
be the cool girl I'll give it a thumbs
up I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
