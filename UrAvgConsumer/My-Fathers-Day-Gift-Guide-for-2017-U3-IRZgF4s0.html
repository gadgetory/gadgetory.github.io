consumer and it's that time of the year
Father's Day is right around the corner
we got a ton of new graduates out there
who are probably getting the apartment
right so congrats to those grounds of
2017 now is able to pick out some of my
favorite stuff from over on Amazon and
shout out to Amazon for sponsoring
today's video but Ari what should I
start with yeah I'll go with this so
we're going to start this off with the
ring video doorbell boom
Pro so this guy is actually a newer
model to what ring has already come out
with they've had some really awesome
doorbells actually gave my father-in-law
one a couple years ago but check this
out they've got some upgrades so now
what you're getting the box is a much
slimmer and more streamlined version of
the ring video doorbell dust the pro and
if you got some cool DIY tools in here
so dad could get this all hooked up by
himself no calling a handyman little
boosters ego oh good you also have but
you've also got a couple of different
finishes so if you're not really feeling
that silver finish that it already comes
with you've got some other ones that
will match whatever home you happen to
be in but I leave something close to it
now what I really like about this new
model is that it has that streamlined
body like I said but it still has all
the cool features of the old one so
you've still got a 1080p camera in here
you got the 2-way talk so you select a
little intercom for whoever rings the
bell you can speak to them without even
getting up and going to the doorbell so
you've got cool features like that of
course can connect to the internet and
send all the footage to the cloud all
kinds of cool stuff in the small tiny
body so if you want your dad to be able
to answer the door whether he's home or
not right from his phone this is a solid
choice to pick up it has a ton of
features something that have not even
mentioned here the app is pretty crazy
so definitely check this out I'm hoping
my father-in-law's on watching because
I'm kind of upgrading with this and next
up we've got the deck om5 router which
is something you can get for your dad
but then we could greatly from yourself
so if you happen to have a big house or
maybe you're in a apartment with really
thick walls you are going to want to get
your hands on something like this
now this router has three pieces so it's
like pretty much three different routers
here but they all use what they call a
mesh network so keep dropping stuff but
they all use a mesh network so if you've
got one of these hooked up as your main
router in the living room connected to
your modem and you can't get any signal
in your bedroom you throw one of these
in there it'll pick up the signal from
the main one and you can spread it all
throughout the house I recently hooked
up a mesh network in my apartment and
some of the dead spots that we have are
all gone like I am completely a believer
now are you know so go ahead and call it
a gift for dad but you can fix your own
problems by picking up one of these so I
definitely think it's worth it of course
you have an app that you can go in and
check out all the system settings
prioritize different devices all this
cool stuff that you can do from one app
so be sure to check these out I don't
know that who wouldn't be happy with one
of these now hope my bad isn't watching
because this is what you get okay this
next up we've got the nest
indoor security cam now you know dad is
concerned about the family and making
sure everybody's safe and he can do that
better with one of these and this thing
has cool features like motion detection
and night vision so if there happens to
be any burglars that is going to get an
alert right to its bones check to see
what's going on and he'll be able to see
if there's any fishy activity happening
there's even cool things like a built-in
speaker so if something's happening in
the kitchen dad wants to like whatever
is in there know about it you can
actually do that right from the app it's
really small inconspicuous you're not
gonna have to worry about it sticking
out like a sore thumb you can just put
this somewhere you can moving
wall-mounted with no problem so you know
dad is going to like this if he likes to
have his eye on everything this will
definitely give him another one and if
we're talking about smart home tech you
know we ought to talk about some smart
lighting I'm a tech youtuber it's like
in our DNA so you guys got to get a life
x-ball now I really really like these I
have a ton of these throughout my entire
studio like one two three
there's a lot tell me that's not fancy
so this is the bulb what's really cool
about this even though this small little
area right here is the actual light you
get a really really bright light that
can do all the colors if you're thinking
about that grad who might not have a ton
of money for fancy furniture or lots of
cool stuff in their apartment a little
lighter to here can change up everything
make it a lot cooler I know a lot of
people walk in and they see these
colored lights everywhere and I'm like
oh man wow this place is it's different
it's high-tech and then you can control
it with your voice with certain things
like the Amazon echo but I do think that
this is an awesome light and whether you
want to use it as a warm or cool light
you can do that
colored lights you have a ton of
flexibility here you can use dimming
controls all the kind of things you want
out of a light this will pretty much do
and of course this would not be a smart
home video without featuring the Amazon
echo now if you guys have been watching
my channel for a while you know I have
these all over the place this is kind of
what runs my entire studio really so if
you're not that familiar with the Amazon
echo you can ask it a ton of questions
you can have it play music you can have
the control smart lights or any smart
products really so just to show off a
couple of cool things that it can do I
got my studio lights on right now but
check this out
turn off game room you can see those
lights disappear there's all there like
that disappeared here too but I have my
recording lights on turn on game room so
we got back my little teal here you
could even ask you things like how old
is yeah Beyonce gnome is 35 years old
house you can up there who is your
average consumer
sorry I'm not sure oh oh it's unbox
therapy unbox therapy is a YouTube
channel that focuses on making videos
about unboxing and reviewing product how
dare you re yeah I'm gonna move one of
you guys making a wiki page please well
even though Alexa just betrayed me I
still love this thing I highly recommend
it and if you really want to get the
most out of having something like the
Amazon echo you're going to want to get
something like a smart plug so over here
we've got the smart Wi-Fi plug by PP
link the matters by tp-link - one time
so if you guys need to start getting
your smart home game up this is the
perfect place to start you grab
something like the Amazon echo you get
some of these smart plugs and you can
turn a regular dated lamp into a smart
lamp by having this Wi-Fi enabled smart
plug speak to Alexa and turn it off
whenever you give the command or even if
you want to jump into the app that it
comes with on your phone you can control
it from there as well and this really
should be the beginning of any smart
home to turn all the things that you're
already have in your home that might not
happen to be smart into something that
is but hopefully you guys enjoyed this
gift guide if it helps Alice like I said
I have all the links down below in the
description let me know what some of
your suggestions are in the comments
down below if you like this video be the
cool guy or girl that gives it a thumbs
up I'll catch you guys in the next one
so Venice your average consumer stead of
for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
