consumer and today we've got another
what's in my gadget backpack video this
is the seventh one been doing this for
seven years which is just insane but
right here we've got the e bags
professional slim laptop bag this is
actually a really awesome bag and I
can't believe it took me so long to find
it but let's cut right to the chase and
see what I've been walking around with
which is a lot less than usual
just so you guys know I've actually
separated my regular fun gadget backpack
from my work bag so I have two bags now
so I'm carrying a little bit less than
normal if you guys are interested in
seeing what tech I bring in my work bag
let me know I'll make a video about that
but the gadget backpack has like my fun
stuff now you guys might have seen me
talk about this bag in my last best tech
backpack video this is the e bag slim it
goes for about a hundred bucks and it
has a ton of compartments which is the
biggest qualifier for a gadget backpack
but let's see what I've been packing so
let's start off with the very first
compartment right here in the front here
I only have my samsung gear icon X now
these are a pair of truly wireless
earbuds they're actually my favorite
truly wireless earbuds because they
actually fit inside of my ears so you
just pop this open and then you have
access to them and just like any truly
wireless pair of earbuds the case
charges them once the battery runs out
and these actually have some pretty
decent battery but I forget the exact
number I'll have a judge says so you'll
know exactly how much listening time you
get with these but I really do enjoy
these they fit in the ear very nicely
for me they're very low profile and
they've got these cool touch panels on
each side so I can play my music I can
swipe to control the volume lots of cool
features and even though they're Samsung
made I can use them with my iPhone
pretty much any Bluetooth device I want
so I really do like these are so worth
the price especially since they're like
I think less than 150 bucks now that's
just the first compartment but what's
really nice is right behind that you get
access to all of this so this is where
you keep a ton of the gadgetry
that you want to walk around with well
this pouch right here at the bottom this
is just where I keep my cables so I've
got a ton of different cables one cable
- worth mentioning here is this chief on
cable it's got a regular USB type a end
and on the other side it has about four
different ends so we've got USB type-c
micro USB and two lightning so if you
have an iPhone and iPad and you want to
charge them both or something you got
two lightning connectors but this pretty
much covers all your bases right here
and it's nice to have this kind of cable
around in case you want to charge any
device you come across of course some
Thunderbolt 3 cables and even a
lightning to USB type-c cable from Apple
so that I can fast charge my iPhone so
yeah these are all the cables that I
have with me I'll have them all linked
down below in the description but their
cables moving on above that right here I
have my moment lenses you guys have seen
me talk about this a ton I've got a ton
of different moment lenses here to go
along with my Google pixel 3xl now I
walk around with two phones but I don't
always use my pixel three I only really
use it when I want to get like a really
nice photo that's when I bust this guy
out and when I want to go a little bit
further with my photo I can pull out
these lenses so that I can get a really
nice shot and just so you guys know what
lenses I'm walking around with I've got
the 18 millimeter wide angle lens which
is probably the one that I use the most
out of everything this is a really
really nice lens because you get a lot
more in the shot and especially when
you're going for that portrait mode shot
it creates a nice cool effect and I also
have the sixty millimeter so the pixel
three doesn't have two lenses it does
everything with a single lens but it
doesn't have a telephoto lens like most
other phones and that's where this guy
comes in if I want to get a tighter shot
and use a telephoto lens now these two
lenses I don't use as often this is a
macro lens so if I want something to
have a lot of detail file really want to
get a really close-up shot this is the
guy I would use to get that shot and
this one is a superfish eye I never
really used super fisheye lenses but
Never Say Never
there might be an opportunity to use one
so I keep it around with me always
but yeah the pixel three with the moment
lens case and these lenses these are
just my glorified camera on the
it's like the smartest camera you can
walk around with it has a whole phone
attached to it but actually that's
something you typically don't see in my
gadget backpack videos I never really
have a phone inside of here because I
keep my phone on me but for my secondary
phone since I'm only using it for photos
I figured the backpack is a better spot
but moving on this little charm over
here this actually got from Japan
I saw these charms when I went out there
it was really cool to pick some up
because they all had like these
different things that they're used for
this one in particular is to I think
have good luck in business and your
professional life so I always got to
keep that around with me since YouTube
is what I do full-time and I'm always on
so this is always nice to have around
with me so I keep this over here always
and of course you guys know me I gotta
walk around with some pencils and some
pens I think and this one I only have
two pencils with me but these are my
go-to kuru toga and this one is Dell
guard these are both high quality
Japanese pencils so I always keep them
around but let's move on to some more
tech and this pocket right here I've got
my mouse now this is the Logitech if it
could come out this is the logitech g930
mer you'll probably really enjoy how
light this mouse is and how quick it is
now it's also nice about this mouse is
that it's an ambidextrous Mouse so that
you can use it with any hand you can
customize the buttons which side you
want them on I have all the buttons on
both sides so I have access to even more
buttons and customization but this mouse
guys it is a dope Mouse and that's what
I use whenever I am on the go and you
got some more pouches over here now
these aren't as exciting I think I have
a portable charger over here this is a
small portable charger from Belkin now
there's one it's kind of cool because
you'll notice that it has a little
charger right here for the Apple watch
so this is about a six thousand I think
six thousand six hundred or maybe just
six thousand milliamp hour battery but
it is enough to charge the Apple watch
plenty times over and if you need to
charge something else it does have a
regular USB port here as well so this is
something I keep around more so for the
Apple watch
and anything now above that nothing too
crazy but I'm my SSD this is the Samsung
t5 now this is a 2 terabyte hard drive
or a solid-state drive and it uses of
course USB type-c now what's interesting
about this guy right here
is not only is this a really cool fast
drive but you might notice that I have
something attached to it this is
something I actually picked up from B&amp;amp;H
it's called a Grippit now with this what
not only does it add protection to your
drive so I can drop this and not really
worry about it because this thing is
absorbing some impact and as you guys
can see here this thing is not budging
no matter how much I move it and it's
really inexpensive this Grippit
attachment super to you I think there's
like seven bucks and you get a couple of
these and you can cut them up and get a
proper fit depending on what the device
is but it is a really really handy thing
if you are worried about something
falling off the table or anything like
that and for the front compartment
that's pretty much it now there's also a
hardshell compartment down here which
houses some of the boring stuff for me
so down here I've got a bunch of
chargers this is a charger to my laptop
so I keep those down there and I also
have a portable charger this is like
what I take around to charge my phone or
anything else this one is from nimble
now this is actually a pretty cool
charger it has two USB ports as well as
a USB type-c port but this supports USB
PD but with USB PD I can not only charge
my iPhone really quickly but I can
charge bigger devices so I can charge up
my iPad even a macbook pro if i needed
to all with this one device and it's
actually really nice because they use
they make this out of like recycled
materials to care about the earth and
this one is about 20,000 milliamp hours
so that's a lot of juice in this form
factor so this is a great portable
charger to keep around and that's pretty
much all I've got down here so if you
want to restore something like glasses
you can put that in here and not worry
about it getting damaged that hardshell
protection
it's nice alright yeah let's see what
else we got this slot right here I got a
couple of things this is when you start
seeing the gaming side come out a bit
more right here I have the Xbox one
elite controller this is
the white version so this is something
that I take around with me now I haven't
I can't say I've mastered the mouse and
keyboard just yet when it comes to
gaming so you know I still rely on this
controller every now and then so this is
something that I have to have with me
especially since I like to take a gaming
laptop with me everywhere I go
so the Xbox one elite controller works
perfectly since Windows now not only
that I've got my Nintendo switch over
here and I think I've shown you guys
this case before but this is actually an
awesome case because it has a built-in
portable charger inside of it so when
you open this up you of course have
access to your switch you have all of
your games up here and a little zipper
compartment so that you can put cables
and all that cool stuff but right here
at the bottom you can see a little
button and LED indicators because you
can actually put let me show you guys
I'm gonna take this little cable right
here plug it into the device and boom
you can charge your switch just like
that I think the case is dead right now
I'll probably haven't charged it in a
while but it is nice to have this
functionality whenever I travel I make
sure this thing is charged up um but
this is my switch I gotta have my switch
everywhere I go doesn't matter where I'm
going got it take this thing with me
because that's where I play all my games
these days and for those of you
interested in the games that I've been
playing lately I'll throw up some b-roll
so you guys can see some of the titles
Smash Bros is probably what's getting
most of my attention these days but I've
been playing a lot more on the switch
since I've gotten it - that's pretty
much it for right here but if I wanted I
could put something else in this little
compartment but let's see let's move on
and I think this is probably like the
last spot and this guy holds my iPad pro
listen if you guys know me you know I
love my iPad pro this is the 12 or
almost 13-inch model but this is an
awesome iPad you can do a lot with it
you can video edit you can watch content
the iPad pro is super versatile I just
have to have it with me at all times
especially when I'm traveling I like to
watch some anime before I go to bed and
this is what I always watch my anime on
right before bed
so this thing has to come with me
everywhere so the iPad pro is an
absolute must
but the laptop that I bring around with
me is this guy this behemoth this is the
MSI I got fingerprints on it already and
this is the msi gs70 5 stealth now this
is a brand new bad boy over here this is
a 17 inch laptop and it features Intel's
8th generation processor as well as an
Nvidia r-tx
2080 graphics card so you've got a lot
of horsepower inside of this guy this
thing is a beast
I think this configuration has like 32
gigs of ram as well so this is no slouch
being able to play whatever titles you
want with high quality graphics it is
really nice to have that flexibility
like I said with my elite controller it
makes for a very nice visual this is
also a 144 Hertz refresh rate 1080p
panel I'm gonna make a full blown review
on this if it's not out already
if it is I'll have a link down below in
the description to it if not keep your
eyes peeled I'm gonna be coming out with
a full blown review but this is an
absolutely awesome laptop and it is like
the king of this backpack here I think
that's every I'm wrong I also have this
charger over here the Satechi charger
has USB PD more charging stuff you guys
know me I got my microfiber cloth over
here I don't know I don't have a spuds
microfiber cloth on me but I am still
covered so don't get it twisted but the
last thing I can't believe I forgot this
thing has so many compartments there are
my headphones so I've got a pair of
earbuds but when I want legitimate
headphones that I can plug in using a
3.5 millimeter jack I can use these guys
right here these are the sony xb9 50 and
ones my favorite pair of headphones of
all time these are amazing they're also
bluetooth but i can use the cable if i
need to like with my switch but these
are amazing if you love bass you'll
absolutely enjoy these watching movies
is great with these listening to hip-hop
whatever you can control the sound on
these lots of flexibility here this
thing is a must-have for
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys this is everything you know
when you see it all sprawled out like
this it's like dang I lied I thought I
did I thought I slimmed it down but
there's still a lot of stuff here but if
you guys know me you know I usually
carry a lot more but surprisingly it all
fits in this eBags professional slim
backpack but you guys let me know what
you think if you're interested in seeing
what I carry in my work bag let me know
with a comment down below maybe give
this video a like links to everything
will be down below in the description
I'll catch you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
