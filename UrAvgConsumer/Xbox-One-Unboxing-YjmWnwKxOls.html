consumer and today I've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the Xbox one now I know
there are tons and tons of Xbox one
unboxings reviews all kinds of Xbox one
videos but you guys did ask to see some
coverage from it just like I did on the
ps4 so I'm gonna bring you guys that now
and I know I'm always talking about how
much I love Sony and the PlayStation and
my Vita all that stuff but I do game on
the Xbox as well I have a 360 I have a
ton of games for it I love playing my
xbox 360 so this is only a matter of
time before I picked it up and hey let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it
sob sob sob and alright guys here we
have the Xbox one and I also got Ryse
son of Rome as my game I'll open that
too maybe later but uh let's get to the
actual Xbox and put that down over there
and just a quick look around the box I'm
sure it's nothing you haven't seen
already I've got my little unboxing
knife in hand already to cut these two
pieces of tape here and it'll pretty
much just show you that the Xbox one has
the Kinect and the Xbox one and the
controller gives you a little preview of
what the screen is going to look like
when you're actually using it on the
sides that it tells you what it includes
Xbox one Kinect Xbox one controller you
get a chat headset HDMI cable wireless
network capability one-year limited
warranty and 500 gig hard drive so
that's all the nitty gritty that's
inside let's open it up unfortunately
this is not a date one edition but for
all the people who are going to buy an
Xbox in the future this is what you're
going to see anyway so let's get this
sliced open it goes one and there goes
another so with those done I'm pretty
much done with the unboxing knife so I
can pop this open and I think I'm going
to lay this down flat give myself a
little more room here and let's pull
this up
and there we go so let's see the first
thing we're greeted by back here is the
Kinect so this is the Kinect sensor and
it's got a little heft to it and we've
got this plastic wrap on top and here we
have them this is a really huge sensor
for something like this but this is
actually quite hefty down here you have
a little screw so you can put it on a
tripod or something if you want so
that's cool has a cute fan in the back I
don't know if you guys can see but this
is a fan I think there are fans on the
sides as well so this thing is going to
be processing a lot of information while
it's watching you when watching you
sleep and eat and talk so it's gonna be
processing a lot of information and it
has to keep cool in order to do all that
so that's the Xbox one Kinect we put
that over here next we've got we headset
so open this thing up now the headset
this is much a much much nicer headset
than what came with the ps4 so hats off
to Microsoft for that thanks 4x the ps4
headset was terrible it wasn't even
worth mentioning
but this is nice really cool I wouldn't
feel like I need to purchase a new
headset with something like this so
that's cool and here when we open this
up this is the part that actually goes
into the controller I would have liked
to see I'm a guess I'm a little spoiled
by the ps4 that you could just take a
headset and plug it into the controller
like a regular headphone or something
but this is a proprietary input so at
least you've got the new button here
volume controls here as well so that's
pretty cool that's a nice little feature
let's see we've got the booklets of
course warranty information all that
good stuff so pretty much the standard
paperwork we're going to throw that in
the back and let's see what's next we've
got let's just do the controller let's
pop this open and the controller is
supposed to be really nice because um
they spent like a million dollars an RD
on it okay but one thing that's really
unfortunate is it has to take double-a
batteries
unless you buy the charging plate kit
that really sucks but first impression
feeling this for the first time it's
actually pretty nice it feels smaller
than the xbox360 controller but I like
this this is pretty nice it goes pretty
fluid I heard that the triggers actually
vibrate up top depending on the
intensity of what you're doing in the
game there's more vibration stuff like
that so that's really cool and I believe
it also comes with some double-a
batteries which we have here some two
Duracell double-a batteries so we're
going to be able to put that into the
controller to get playing but I'll put
those in later so control it to the side
let's see what else we've got we've got
an HDMI cable here and what's cool about
this HDMI cable apparently it's 4k ready
now I'm not sure if that means we're
getting four kids this is going to be
able to put out 4k content I don't know
whether it's games or streaming you know
videos or Netflix things like that but
this is pretty cool if you have a TV
that supports 4k or display just will be
able to support that so regardless of
what whether or not this could do it
it's nice to have this kind of HDMI
cable we've got some more cables here
this is the power cable so this is
what's going to go into the power brick
so these are all really thick cables too
so I wouldn't worry about these the
longevity of these cables so that's
pretty cool and here we've got the power
brick so let's pop this open and here we
have it it's really unfortunate that the
Xbox one needs one of these like an
external one umm this definitely won't
work with my setup but I plan to have
this all in the living room anyway
because of the cable features so I want
this to be with my cable box but it is
pretty unfortunate that distinct
scum with a huge power brick but let's
put that aside and I believe that's
everything up top here so this part is
empty to move it all to the side and
let's get to the main attraction and
here we go this is the Xbox one chunky
little thing uh-huh so socks are on but
let's open this up and yeah whoo so here
it is guys the Xbox one in all of its
glory and finger print attractiveness ah
so this is pretty cool I'm going to give
you guys a quick close-up of some of the
stuff you'll see around the the Xbox one
so guys first we're going to start off
on the side here we've got a USB 3.0
port and here you have a I believe it's
called a binding button so that you can
sync your controllers to the system so
taking a look at the back guys here we
have the power port over here we have
the HDMI out so you'll plug this to your
Xbox one and your TV over here you have
your optical out so you can put your
optical cable here for audio here you
have your HDMI in so if you plan on
getting your cable box inside plugged up
to the Xbox one this is where you going
to put it or you could put whatever
supports an HDMI cable you can put that
in here and kind of use it through the
Xbox one which is a really cool feature
I think and over here you have two USB
3.0 ports as well as the port for your
Kinect here you have an IR out as well
as your Ethernet port so that's the back
here and you have a Kensington lock over
here for those of you who want to secure
your Xbox one and up front here you have
your blu-ray drive so you can just in
place blu-rays you got your eject button
and over here is your touch sensitive
power button so when you press this it
will just power it right on and that's
it that's the close up of the Xbox one
and alright guys that's pretty much it
for this
boxing I've made quite a mess here so
I've got to get all this stuff cleaned
up get my xbox one set up in my living
room I'm looking forward to playing this
let me know what kind of videos you guys
want to see with this system do you want
