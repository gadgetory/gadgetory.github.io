consumer and don't mind the attire today
I have to go to a pretty for our Apple
Store right after work and I had to go
pick up this iPod Touch 5th generation
so I'm gonna be doing an unboxing for
you guys and hey listen always seen time
let's get right into it alright guys and
here we have the iPod Touch 5th
generation and this is a pretty standard
iPod case nothing special about this oh
and before anything shout out to Brandon
at Kop for hooking me up with this I
didn't get it for anything I bought this
but he wanted me to sell him out cuz I
told him about my channel so shout out
to You Brandon but yeah so this is a
pretty standard case and yeah let's just
open it up you got some tape on the
sides of course here you have little
orange to peel it up here we go now I'm
pretty excited about because I did have
the previous iPad iPod Touch and I've
been waiting for them to upgrade it last
year they didn't do anything but come
out with a white one so I'm pretty happy
they just something to it this year so
I'm real happy about this so we're gonna
take this out and put it to the side see
what else they give us of course you
have some ear pods now unlike the iPhone
this doesn't come with a special K like
the full case like as if you bought it
brand new it comes in this little
plastic not plaids it's not plastic at
all it feels almost like styrofoam I
don't know what this does but some weird
material and I guess here you can see it
has the whole ear pods now I'm not gonna
unravel this because I'm not that keen
on these and I don't need them right now
anyway but whatever we'll put that to
the side here we have the new lightning
connector and this is you know because
they change the bottom of the iPod so
they include that
and here we have the what is the ice
trap nut ice trap died something I
forgot I'll put an annotation but this
is it well let me show you guys a
close-up of what this looks like and
this is it it's pretty thin um can't say
I'm too thrilled about it feels a lot
cheaper than I would have expected yeah
there it goes really if it almost feels
like kind of cardboard II like I like
this couldn't have by bends and creases
in it after some time so I'm not really
thrilled about this quality of these
this little strap thing but um alright
yeah this is it guys
and of course they have this little
hello Welcome Packet thing see what we
got in here of course some tips and
whatnot and some more ipod touch info
and some stickers of course so now we're
gonna put all this to the side except
for the strap over to keep the strap out
and here we have the iPod Touch I opted
for the slate-colored version because
it's close to the regular ones I'm not
huge on the whole white iPod or iPhone
thing so that's another one with the
black and here we are nice clean-looking
this thing would just stay down and
there we go this is it and alright here
we have it feels pretty nice to hold it
doesn't feel I like the edges this gives
it them with a more rectangular feel
here here's the previous generation and
it's got that kind of curved side here
so let me show you guys compare a slight
comparison up-close and here you guys
can kind of see it this is a little
glossy back so it's kind of hard but you
can see how it curves while this one
doesn't really have that curve so I'm
pretty happy about that because that'll
make it only easier to hold and another
big change that I'm really happy about
is this aluminum back because look what
happens with the regular kind
and I honestly I've never taken this out
of the case really sometimes I have but
this is with the case on that it gets
this aluminum well not aluminum but this
like mirror finish it I just hated this
hated this and I'm very glad they
finally stepped away from that with this
and I'm looking forward to using it and
here you have the little button so you
can put this around it pretty simple you
can't press it down or anything once
it's in so this is all you get so I
wonder if no it doesn't seem too easy to
just slip off or anything so I don't
think anyone will have to worry about
that there so here we are dangling it
around a bit seems pretty secure so
alright there we go so pretty secure
here and overall just looks pretty good
here you they brought back this little
um this little strip so that you can get
better Wi-Fi reception I'm sure some
people aren't too happy about that but
if it makes it perform better why not
and now they included a 5 megapixel
camera of course I'm gonna have some
camera tests on there this used to be a
I don't even think this was one
megapixel I don't remember but this was
just the worst camera ever on like
anything so that's pretty bad and you
also get that HD FaceTime camera up here
as well so I was very impressed with the
iPhones HD FaceTime camera so I'm
expecting this to be pretty good too and
overall really happy with the looks of
this so here we have it and let's see if
we could just turn it on for the first
time see if I have any juice I'm sure it
does yeah now you get that little I am
Apple logo a note on the camera is that
it now has a flash so you can probably
be using this for you know taking
pictures if your cell phone's camera
isn't that great so this is gonna be
pretty cool to use and here we have it
turned on I'll go ahead and set this up
and that's about it for this unboxing
guys I got the slave version looks
really nice
if you guys want that black version this
is definitely really nice to look at
it's actually the same color as the
iPhone I believe let's see alright guys
so this is exactly like the iPhone 5 you
have the same color scheme going for it
and yeah it's got the 4 inch display of
course all that good stuff so like I
said that's about it for this unboxing
guys gonna have tons of videos for it if
you have any videos you want to see let
me know I don't know if it's worth it to
do a camera comparison because this one
is like just D worse but let me know if
you want to see any videos in particular
with this from iPod and I'll jump right
on that
alright guys your average consumer and
thanks for watching
till the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
