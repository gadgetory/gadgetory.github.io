consumer and today we're going to be
talking about the top 10 tech gift ideas
for Father's Day for all you ladies out
there so whether you're buying for your
father brother anyone you know who's a
dad this list should cover all your
bases so this list is also in no
particular order and I'm also going to
have more than 10 it's going to be a
couple of items with some alternatives
as well and I've made it easy for you by
putting all the links in the description
to all the products that I mentioned in
this video so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
Bob Bob Bob and all right guys to kick
start this list we're gonna go with the
more obvious choice and that's a new
phone now there are tons and tons of
phones out there but the little leading
phones for Android right now are the HTC
One m8 and the galaxy s5 now the HTC One
m8 is a premium device made with great
build quality and it's very fast very
snappy so if you want a very solid
premium device definitely check out the
HTC One m8 or if you want something with
a bit more features a better camera then
you definitely want to give the galaxy
s5 a look and if your data is a more
active lifestyle you definitely want to
give a look into the galaxy s5 active
although it's exclusive only to AT&amp;amp;T
it has a rugged build quality and it's
made to handle day-to-day abuse so
definitely check that out if your dad is
more active and now that we've talked
about phones let's move on to tablets I
would recommend the iPad Mini or the
Nexus 7 those are two very portable
tablets very comfortable to hold in the
hand and very fast and good at what they
do now the big difference between the
two besides their operating systems is
the price now the iPad Mini comes in at
$400 for their base model and the Nexus
7 comes in at 229 for their base model
so if if you're on a budget the Nexus 7
is definitely a very very good option
and you both have screen sizes between 7
and 8 inches so it's very portable but
if you think that screen is too small
you might want to check out the iPad air
or is something like the Samsung Galaxy
Tab pro 10.1 so if you want a bigger
display you want to watch movies and all
that kind of stuff you can definitely
check those out as well and the next
thing on this list is very affordable
it's the Google chromecast and it
retails for only 35
dollars so if you're on a budget this
works very well so this all you have to
do is plug this into your HDMI port on
your television and you're able to
stream content from like Netflix or
YouTube Pandora whatever you want that
supports Google chromecast you'll be
able to stream from your tablet or your
phone straight to your television and
this supports iOS or you can use your
iPhone or anything like that or even
Android devices so definitely a lot of
ground covered there so definitely a
great great option for those of you who
are on a budget so next on the list are
cameras so whether you're shopping for a
new dad or a dad that likes to travel a
lot cameras are always a great great
option for those who want to capture
memories so my first recommendation is
the Canon t3i this retails for about
five hundred and forty-nine dollars but
it's a great camera it can take tons of
great photos and it does 1080p full
recording so it's a really great camera
I used to actually use this for all my
YouTube videos so I definitely recommend
it and if your dad really wants to get
into like videos the Canon t4i is also a
really great option as it has a really
nice auto focusing system while
recording so those are two great options
of Canon t4i retails for 689 but if
they're not really into videos the Canon
t3i should definitely do the trick and
if both those are way above your budget
but you still want to get a nice camera
check out the Canon Powershot SX 500 I
have links for all of these down below
in the description but they're all
really great cameras so check those out
and next on the list if your dad is a
really big gadget guy he likes to use
his phone or his tablet get a portable
charger portable chargers are a godsend
portable chargers are very useful
because you can take them anywhere with
you and try to put your device if you're
running low on battery so what I would
recommend is the new trend power pack
plus or the new Tramp power pack 11 the
new trend power pack 11 is a nicer
looking portable charger but it comes
with a little bit less energy than the
power pack plus does the new trend power
pack 11 comes with eleven thousand
milliamps of battery while the power
pack plus comes with 13 thousand they're
both going to charge up your phone up
quite a few times over probably a three
to four times depending on
and it can definitely give your tablet a
full charge so those are my two
recommendations and I definitely think
they're worth it the power pack 11
retails for about $37 and I think the
power pack plus is somewhere in the same
ballpark so not very expensive but very
very useful now I'm a big audio guy
myself so I got to talk about some
headphones so if you want some nice over
the ear headphones I would recommend the
v-moda m100
now these retail for about $300 but let
me tell you they're definitely worth it
if your dad really likes music this is
definitely a really great option it has
a lot of nice bass very nice clarity and
it's built like a tank so this can
handle a lot and it's got very great
durability it's very good stuff one of
my personal favorites and if that's way
above your price range
check out the audio technica ath m50x
these are amazing headphones they're
renowned by tons of people all over the
internet so definitely check those out
as well I use them a lot for my everyday
recordings and all kinds of good stuff
they're not true bass heavy but they've
had enough they have enough base for
your average person so definitely check
those two headphones out they're really
great options now if you don't want to
go something that's really big no over
ear headphones you want to go something
a little more stealthy you can check out
the Jay Birds blue buds X those are some
in-ear earphones and those are like
amazing they're Wireless and they have
about 8 hours of battery life which is
really good for something so small and
it's actually really really compact and
very easy to carry around with you and
use day-to-day basis it's made for
working out and all that good stuff so
definitely have great quality protects
from sweat one of my favorite ear buds
whenever I'm traveling outside those are
my go-to earphones but if you don't want
something Wireless you want something a
little more traditional definitely check
out the RH AMA 750i now these are some
great headphones they've got some great
build quality as well some great sound
quality so those are definitely nice as
well
now the Jay Baer is retail for about 160
$9.99 and the RHA retails for about 130
now these are either way are great
options they're both very good
headphones definitely have my
recommendation so next on the list is
some wearable tech for those dads who
are out of shape and you want to get
them active again so my recommendations
would be the Fitbit flex or the jawbone
up
and if they have a Samsung Galaxy device
I would definitely recommend the gear
fit these are all very nice options
they'll get your dad active again and
you can use all kinds of apps in order
to see what kind of activity they've had
throughout the day and when they're
working out sleeping all kinds of stuff
you can track with these the Fitbit flex
retails for about a hundred bucks and
the jawbone up is about 80 and if you
actually go for the galaxy gear fit
which is does a little bit more than
just fitness stuff this retails for
about two hundred dollars so it's a big
price difference there but the two that
are in the lower price range they're
definitely going to be worth it they
have their own apps for Android and iOS
so definitely check those out next on
the list is the nest thermostat and this
is great for those dads who love to
monitor the thermostat and make sure no
one's messing with it so if that is one
of those this is definitely a great
option it's all digital and it retails
for about 250 but you can monitor your
thermostat from your phone if you have
like an Android or iOS so you get a lot
of control with this you can take it
anywhere and actually control it which
is really nice and it actually learns
the way you use it so forth at certain
times you bring down the temperature or
bring it up it'll actually start
learning stuff like that so that's a
really great option and it also helps to
save a lot of money over time so it's
definitely a good investment if your dad
likes to save some money on the
thermostat and last but not least is a
bit of a wild card here and this is the
Xbox one now I know gamers are probably
going why Xbox one why not the ps4 but I
say the Xbox one just for its media
capabilities and that's for the Kinect
so if we get an Xbox one with the Kinect
you're actually able to sync it up with
your television and cable so you can
actually give the Xbox commands and say
Xbox watch ESPN or Xbox turn on and
it'll turn on your television or you can
turn it off without even touching any
remotes and that's what I love most
about my Xbox one Kinect I think a lot
of that ads will find this useful
that means no scrambling for the remote
or anything like that you can get a lot
of controls just by talking to the Xbox
now it's not perfect but it definitely
is very useful and I thought to use it a
lot so I think dad's will like it out
there when they're trying to watch TV
and hey you can play games on it too so
there's always that and you have a
couple of other features so that's about
it for my list guys
these are the top 10 things you should
get your dad well more than top 10
because I gave some alternatives but all
the links will be down below in the
description if you want to check those
out and if you guys have any other
recommendations for Father's Day gifts
