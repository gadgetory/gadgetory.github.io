the brand new iPad Mini 2019 is finally
here
but in today's age where we have phones
with much bigger displays I've had pros
running around you gotta ask the
question is it too late now one of the
biggest criticisms we've seen online
about the new iPad Mini is its design
this thing is still rocking the same
design as the previous iPad Mini so a
lot of people feel like it's a dated
look and I gotta admit I kind of agree
with it I did wish Apple went with the
newer look that we see with the iPad
pros those look absolutely beautiful
but this guy but those big battles at
the top and bottom it does look a bit
dated now Apple stock process for this
design is that the folks that have iPad
minis already will be able to pick this
up and use the same accessories and
things that they already have with their
original iPad minis and this thing
pretty much replaces it right away and
while I like that thought process the
techie in me just can't get over the
fact that this does look like an older
iPad I would have absolutely loved to
see the smaller bezels on this guy
because then we'd also have face ID
which we don't have here instead we do
have touch ID but it would have been
nicer to see that new iPad pro look come
to something like the iPad Mini and
while we're on the subject of no-face ID
and now having touch ID after using this
device for a while there are some
benefits and some drawbacks getting into
the device with touch ID so much faster
for me it's just instant guys you just
press the button boom you're in I love
that aspect of touch ID but now after
having to touch ID I kind of see where
I'm missing face ID whether it's logging
into certain apps or accessing passwords
you really don't get that quick login
that you get with face ID now you kind
of have to like you know go back for the
home button which honestly is not a big
deal but if you're coming from a device
that uses face ID you will see where it
is a little bit of a step back beyond
using touch ID to unlock the device now
something else that's a bit of a
throwback is that this thing uses a
lightning port so that means the
lightning cable is the main way to
charge this guy so no USB type-c we
would have seen that if this thing got
there
design but it has the older design which
means lightning now as techies we will
always want to see tech move forward
bring on the USB type-c but if you
really think about it folks who have
iPhones and maybe an older iPad they're
not gonna want to walk around with two
different cables it's still more
convenient to have the lightning cable
if the iPhone was boarding the USB
type-c already then that'd be a
different story but everyone's still
using lightning cables to charge their
iPhones so that is something I think a
lot of people will still appreciate with
the meaning that you only need to walk
around with one cable now even though
this thing is sporting that older design
Apple did make some upgrades and the
main improvements I want to mention are
an improved display so it gets brighter
it's laminated and it also has support
for the Apple pencil sadly it's the
first generation Apple pencil if this
thing had the new iPad pro design it'd
be we'd be looking at Apple pencil to
support sadly it's the first one because
it has to charge up with that lightning
port kind of sucks but it is cool to see
Apple pencil support comes to the iPad
nonetheless and not to mention this
thing got a huge spec bump with the 812
Bionic chip that's inside of it which
leads it to be about seven to nine times
faster than the previous generation
which means this thing is going to be
quite the performer the a12 chip is one
of the best chips on the market for
mobile devices now that brings us to the
questions who is this for and who isn't
it for now Apple is clearly targeting
folks who probably own the older
generations of the iPad Mini or those
folks out there who love the form factor
but want it to be a device that lives up
to today's standards and with the h-huh
Bionic chip that's definitely possible
for me and my time using it I've been
able to do everything that I do on a
mobile device on this with out skipping
a beat so that's watching video content
web browsing and of course y'all know me
gaming so lots of gaming and this thing
pretty much handles everything like a
champ and for me it's been really cool
to have all that power in a form factor
that is just insanely portable like
honestly guys I've been able to put this
thing in my jacket pocket like that is
absurd it's a tablet that can go in my
pocket it can fit in a Harry's purse
it's just really nice to be able to take
this out put it away with no problem
it's just really cool how portable this
thing is and honestly that portability
pretty much changes the way I use the
iPad Mini for me as an iPad pro user I
use that big 12 point 9 inch display to
enjoy gaming and watching tons and tons
of content I will go for my iPad before
I go for like my laptop to watch
something but with the iPad Mini it
being so portable and in this smaller
form factor it kind of changes the way I
look at this as a device and with it now
having Apple pencil support jotting down
notes has just been a really nice
experience I usually walk around with
notebooks like these you guys if you
know me you know that I love to walk
around with these in my backpacks with
this it can go right into my jacket
pocket and when I need it I just pull it
out and jot down a note it's actually a
really really nice experience from a
Productivity standpoint and something I
think a lot of people are under
estimating is the fact that because this
thing has a 7.9 inch display and we have
phones that have like 6 inch displays
that it's a very similar experience but
it really isn't so I've got like my
iPhone 10s max over here and the iPad
Mini and you can see well the numbers
sound very close they're not the same
form factor at all this is like a very
skinny display this is a wider 4 by 3
aspect ratio so it is a very different
feel than what you get with your iPhone
or any other phone and that's great
because you can see content differently
on an iPad Mini than you can on an
iPhone 10s max apps can be optimized for
iPads so you can see a lot more
information the experience is just
totally different now we kind of talked
about all the reasons why I like it whoo
I kind of think that this is for but
let's talk about who it's not for and
that is for folks who want an iPad with
a much bigger display so check this out
over here we have an iPad pro this is
the 12 point 9 inch version so this is a
very very big difference here this is
the biggest that apple offers versus the
smallest if you're a creative someone
who probably takes their canvas very
seriously if you're an artist and you're
using the pencil you're not gonna get
that big old display that you get on
something like
the iPad pro with this guy while you
still have a lot of the capabilities a
bigger canvas is a bigger canvas so
you're not gonna get that here but if
the size of the display really matters
to you this might not be what you're
looking for and you might want to
consider something like that iPad or
iPad pro but with this smaller display
that also means that content consumption
isn't going to be the same experience as
with something like that iPad if you're
not really looking at this because of
the overall form factor and you're just
kind of looking at the price the iPad it
might be a better option since that
one's like 70 bucks cheaper and it still
got an 810 chip not as good as the 812
but you do get to save some money there
but let's get back to the original
question is it too late for this to
exist and I'm gonna go with no I think
that if you pick this up that you're
going to enjoy it I've been really
enjoying my time with it is the design
too late yes it is way too late for this
thing to still have this design I wish
that it had the iPad pro design I can't
stress that enough
but honestly someone picking this up
isn't going to have issues with
performance the quality that they're
gonna get out of this is still an
absolutely great tablet and the
portability is just insane this thing's
crazy thin really small you can put it
away anywhere and I think that the
average person who doesn't really care
about that stuff they just want a small
iPad it's gonna walk away pretty happy
with the experience at least from what I
can tell I've been able to do everything
I've wanted on this without an issue I
just wish it looked different but that
about wraps it up for this video guys I
have been really enjoying this iPad Mini
to my surprise because I'm so big on
these twelve point nine inch version but
this one is really solid let me know
your thoughts with a comment down below
if you enjoyed the video be the cool
girl that gives it a thumbs up I'm gonna
catch out on the next one till then it's
your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
