everyone is your average consumer and
this is my girlfriend hi and today we're
here for another sound leak and sound
isolation test aka the girlfriend test
and this time we're doing it with the
Sennheiser momentum so let's not waste
any time
scare right into it alright so first
we're gonna start off with the sound
leak test and we're gonna play music at
volumes of 50% 75% and then 100% and see
how much the sound leaks from the
headphones at those different volumes so
we're just gonna make sure that her hair
isn't on the under the headphone so
there's no sound leaking coming from
that and she's all good to go and all
right so now we're gonna start with the
sound leak test at 50% are you ready
yeah
alrighty so here it is at 50%
all right really good I can barely hear
anything whatsoever so definitely a good
job there are ready for 75% yeah so 75%
now I do hear a little bit more not
enough to bother me though for sure so
that's really really good all right yeah
I do hear it but not a lot at all so now
we're gonna crank it up to 100% and see
how it is there and guys recommend not
listening to your music at 100% as it
can damage your hearing but will damage
our hearing for you so hit that sub
button and it like alright so you ready
for a hundred percent yes alright here
goes
it's not as bad as I would expect so 1%
is pretty good too well at least she's
not Miley Cyrus right so at a hundred
percent it did pretty well even though
it did leak didn't weak as bad as a lot
of headphones out there so definitely a
very good job at the sound leaking test
so now it's time for the girlfriend test
okay okay so the girlfriend test is
basically a test that mcs if he can
block out the annoying sounds and his
girlfriend me makes with headphones so
you don't see this test I'll be doing
something really annoying and he's gonna
see if these awesome-looking is
Sennheiser's can watch mom I got my son
sounds so see how the noise isolation
does and with this test we're going to
play the music I volumes of 50% 75% and
100% and yeah see how it goes so we're
gonna start it off with 50% here awesome
and for this test so I'm gonna be doing
is I'm going to be watching my favorite
TV show at the moment Mad Men um on
Netflix on his awesome looking screen
over there
and he's gonna see if you can block out
Mad Men hasn't liked the show very much
season see if you can block it out with
his headphones okay so now we're gonna
try it out after 50 percent ready yeah
alright you said for us to see your legs
and you put your waist and move it might
look like a woman
is that all mr. Draper hey I'm not done
here I'm working my way out alright
unreal
Peggy Rizzo at 50% I did hear a bit it
was muffled I couldn't make out what
they were saying but I definitely heard
something in the background so it did
come in on my music a bit so we're gonna
crank it up to 75% and see how it does
there alright ready yep alright here
goes one time for your 11 o'clock
meeting
oh and sorry about mr. Campbell here he
left his manners back to return to yonce
she's a little young Piaget I wrecked it
mrs. Pete Campbell is a very lucky one
so at 75%
I did hear very slightly but I think
that's probably because I was listening
out for it so definitely a very good job
at 75% it was good enough to isolate
that sound coming from the iMac so
that's not only a good job these are
some loudspeakers too so that's not a
good stuff so let's see at 1% are you
completely block about right yeah all
right you can tell you about the
bachelor party tonight you sure did so
do I get first crack at her where does
she took down more sailors in the
Arizona or Japan all right when he sings
I've bent the whole that was good what
was that I didn't hear a thing so that's
fun so the DS actually perform very well
I'm very happy with these and this is my
favorite girlfriend test yet watch my
channel
all right so definitely a very good job
on both ends so at 50% I was able to
hear a bit of the sounds on the iMac but
it's very loud but still it definitely
did a really good job in the 75 percent
range so I'm very happy with these
alright guys so that's about it for this
girlfriend test and hopefully enjoyed it
if you did please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe definitely

action and we'll catch you guys in the
next one so then it's your average
