consumer and it's time for another
episode of your average budget with some
tech under $50 you may remember the
original tile which used to fit on a
keychain but this is the improved tall
slim which can be used on its own or
with an adhesive slip this into your
wallet or stick this on anything you'd
like to find with the push of a button
this is perfect for those of us who tend
to be a bit forgetful and always find
themselves to miss placing something to
be honest my favorite feature of my
Apple watch is to find my phone button
so that I can just press it and it will
play a sound to my phone whenever I'm
looking for it but the taslim cut a 1-up
stat feature because it works both ways
say you have one of these step onto your
laptop you can easily find your laptop
through the tile app but you could also
find your phone if you have a laptop
lying around by double tapping on the
tile and to me that's pretty cool these
things go for about 30 bucks but I
definitely think there's some value
there if you tend to spend a lot of time
looking for stuff next up on the list is
the logitech k310 keyboard I have the
blue here and I appreciate the casual
yet clean looking design some of you
know I love my logitech easy switch
keyboard but this seemed like a more
affordable option so of course it got my
attention not only can you switch
between three different devices using
the easy switch buttons but you also
have a friendlier layout if you plan on
using this with different types of
devices this one works with Windows Mac
Chrome OS Android iOS and even the Apple
TV then it's really lightweight so I can
see this being great for students or
anyone on the go and at 39 bucks I think
it's a great value now we're looking at
the Thor X by centi now these I picked
up for less than 30 bucks which made me
really skeptical at first but after
trying them I was really surprised first
off they came with a hard shell carrying
case which at this price point is a very
nice addition and second these actually
look pretty good I'm a fan of the build
quality since it's not supposed to be
something premium so it does still feel
pretty nice and it's got a foldable
design so that you can fold these up and
put them away it makes it great for
traveling and then if I actually able to
rotate so that this kind of lay flat so
you've got some nice flexibility here it
also comes with a flat tangle free cable
with an inline remote so if you want to
answer calls or control your music you
can do that here
but what was really surprising to me was
the sound quality now I didn't expect
much like I said but these were actually
pretty decent I'd have no problem
recommending these to someone who's
looking for a nice budget pair of
headphones because they sound pretty
good they're comfortable and they got a
pretty decent design now if you've seen
a couple of my videos you know I love
the Amazon echo the thing is amazing
I love voice assistance and with the
Amazon echo dot you're getting that in a
much much smaller package and it only
costs fifty bucks now with this you can
do a ton of cool things like control
your smart home with just your voice you
can ask it a bunch of questions if you
need to know something or you can even
use it to set reminders alarms ask it
the weather whatever you need it's nice
to have that voice assistant kind of
just waiting here to answer your
questions
now with the echo dot being so much
smaller than the original echo the
speakers aren't quite as big but you can
pair this with a Bluetooth speaker and
with that you'll be able to listen to
music or the alarms that you want to set
with it I personally am in love with the
LX assistant sorry Ari and last up on
this list there's something I just had
to show you guys this is a clock and fan
combo it has a pretty sturdy and
flexible arm that you can adjust to the
perfect angle and the phantom was
actually pretty refreshing one of the
blades has LEDs installed and when it's
spinning it creates this analog looking
clock to be honest I just think it's
cool it's as useful as a clock fan combo
could be but it's definitely a nice
little touch to any desk set up but
their apps up for this list guys I'll
catch you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
