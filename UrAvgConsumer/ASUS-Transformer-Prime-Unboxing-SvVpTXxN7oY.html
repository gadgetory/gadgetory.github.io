to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video hey guys your average consumer
here and today I have an unboxing video
of the Asus Transformer Prime now
today's video is a little different
because I'm not home so it's not the
typical background and also I don't have
my tripod with me so I'm doing this
video with the camera in my hand so it
might get a little shaky and there's
probably a lot of videos all about this
already but I figured why not show you
guys anyway alright so yeah let's get
into this okay so this is brand new I
got it from Staples although someone had
purchased that yesterday and I guess he
found it too complicated for his kid and
he returned it the same day so it
doesn't have the little plastic wrap on
it I got a five percent off yeah it
doesn't really matter to me it's still
brand new pretty much not gonna make a
break this video and here we are see if
I can show you so it's got the Tegra 3
quad core it's eight point three
millimeters slim super IPS panel it's
got an 8 megapixel camera I don't know
this is what Sonic Master crystal pure
sound reproduction okay there you go and
it has the optional dock unfortunately I
don't have the dock so I cannot show you
what that's like boat hopefully by the
time I you know do a review or something
I'll be able to get my hands on one and
let you guys know what I think about
that so just bear with me this is
one-handed the box is pretty nice has a
nice little cushion here and pull this
up of course they took it out so the
plastics not as tight as usual and here
we have ICS probably like warranty
information
that's the register your product yeah so
you know your standard stuff we have
there here we have a little thank you
about the you know for purchasing it
boring stuff with words
who cares what are we here this is a
microfiber of some sort okay so we have
a microfiber here yeah
Mike and we have our USB it has its own
little cord here so looks pretty similar
to the iPad but it's it's own cord and
this is the outlet charger thing and
bada-bing bada-boom back to the box and
here we have the tablet itself me unwrap
this now it's got this aluminum back
I've heard so much about I've heard that
this gives a little trouble as far as
Wi-Fi is concerned hopefully that's not
the issue with mine alright yeah it has
a pretty hefty reminds me of the iPad
honestly I have the iPad 2 I don't see I
don't feel a difference from off the bat
so it's alright and I'll guess I'll just
see if it has any juice I don't know the
guy who purchased it before me charged
it at all or if it comes with any juice
but let's check it out so this is the
landscape mode and the power button is
over here
oh okay I guess it was kind of just off
so I don't know if it has a fancy intro
or anything like that I think all right
you know let me go through where all the
buttons are first so here you have the
power button let this focus a bit okay
you got the power button so this is the
volume Jack's your USB or HDMI port I'm
not sure which micro SD card over here
this is where you put the USB port I'm
not sure what this is for I don't know
okay so on both sides I don't know what
that is is the headphone jack and we
have the speaker's here a little hard to
see but there you go and that's as far
as the button goes the name up here this
is the the flash with the 8 megapixel
camera up here and 1.2 megapixel camera
over here alright well that's pretty
much it for the unboxing really but I'll
just see what it's like when I turn it
on and move it around a little okay
seems pretty responsive all right well
pretty much that's it I know this is
pretty much a crappy video compared to
the other videos I have out right now
now like I said I'm not home this seems
a little dark but you know just a little
something just wanted to show you guys
and I'll have a review for up for this
shortly and it'll be back in my place so
if you guys like you know feel free to
comment like the video subscribe and you
know thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
