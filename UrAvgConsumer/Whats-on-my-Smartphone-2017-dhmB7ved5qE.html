consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at what's on my pixel XL now a
lot of you may know that I have two
phones with me usually an iPhone 7 plus
which is my daily driver
and since most of my family uses an
iPhone iMessage just makes our lives a
lot easier but I'm usually using that
second line to test other phones and
since phone season hasn't really started
up yet I've been rocking that pixel
excel now you're probably wondering why
am i showing you the pixel excel instead
of the iPhone and to be honest it's cuz
I'm an Android guy at heart and I put
way more time and consideration into the
layout of this phone then I do with my
iPhone since there isn't really much you
can do there as you can see I try to
keep it pretty simple yet clean layout
on the main home screen and since I'm
rocking a white pixel I went with a
white gray and teal theme that I
customized using a live wallpaper app
called minima Pro it's paid and goes for
$1.00 in the Play Store but it's well
worth it you get access to a ton of well
designed live wallpaper themes that tilt
and have touch motions and you can
customize them by changing the colors or
the layout to whatever you like and if
you take the time to learn how to
customize these you can end up with
something that's really nice and unique
but if you don't have the patience for
that you can always use one of the
zillion themes they already offer or
even access an online library where
people post their own creations but
there's also a free version that doesn't
allow customization but you still get
access to a ton of those pre-built
themes as for the rest of the homescreen
I keep it pretty empty so the wallpaper
can shine through but I do have the
highest priority app for me like the
camera Google Maps Gmail and if you have
the other essentials for any phone and
to the left of the main home screen just
like everyone else we've of course got
Google now and mine is personally tuned
to give me updates on what's going on in
the MBA as well as shipping updates for
places like Amazon and the like weather
info and some news that's pretty
important to me easily I'll find
articles on tech Pokemon go Final
Fantasy and Gundam with a sprinkle of
politics just to stay in the know on the
right of the main home screen we have my
second and only other page and this is
where I try to keep things organized
with folders of my most used apps at the
very top of this page
I have my youtuber life section which
has a live counter widget for my current
subscriber count' shout out to the UAC
fan you guys are everything and so the
right of that we have a folder that of
course has the YouTube app and I'm
pretty sure you guys know what that does
as well as the creator studio this is
where I keep up with most of my
statistics for my videos and where I
read and reply to most of your comments
the legends are true folks I've also got
the social blade app in there so I can
keep tabs on how the channels performing
every day and we've also got the live
subscriber count app that gives me
access to that widget I mentioned before
and lastly we've got that YouTube gaming
app that I might jump on at some point
or maybe twitch I don't know what's
what's your preference guys let me know
what a comment down below now on the
bottom row we have four folders for
games entertainment social media and
music streaming apps if you're curious
about the games I play I only have a
select few on the pixel but if you know
me you know I gotta have that Pokemon go
and yes I still play I'm a true fan and
since my favorite generation has just
been added chances are I won't be giving
it up for a while I also got Crazy Taxi
for some old-school Dreamcast nostalgia
yugioh dual generations whenever I get
that itch to get a few love duals in and
I've also got breakneck which is a
pretty fun and visually appealing game
and lastly Fire Emblem Heroes which I
honestly haven't started yet but since I
am a Fire Emblem fan I had to at least
get it downloaded as for my
entertainment folder I've got the
standard Netflix in Hulu but I've also
got crunchyroll and Funimation which are
dedicated animation me apps but to be
honest that's pretty much what I watch
on all of them
granted most of the animation shows I
watch on these apps are pretty
mainstream but they make it easy to keep
up with some of my current favorites and
if I have any fellow anime lovers out
there hit that like button so I know I'm
not alone here and moving on we also
have that social media folder with all
the standard platforms you can find me
on so if you aren't already following me
stop playing do that I'll have links
down below to everything I say at your
average consumer for just about
everything except for snapchat
this is snapchat next up we've got that
music folder and I mainly listen to play
music since I was able to import my
entire library from iTunes when it first
launched but
found myself trying out other services
like Apple music and Spotify to see if
there are any real advantages worth
being giving up my already imported
library if you guys can make a case for
a better option than playing music let
me know with a comment down below I've
also got SoundCloud that isn't replacing
anything but it's great if you're
looking for some dope underground music
and then there's Amazon all by itself
because in my eyes if it's not on Amazon
it doesn't exist okay well we all know
that's not true but honestly Amazon is
probably one of the best places to shop
online and if you don't have an Amazon
Prime subscription get it it is
absolutely worth it and no they're not a
sponsor nobody's a sponsor on this video
but I do think it's a great value and I
honestly use that app way more than I
should thus having its own little
section now that pretty much makes up
the layout for my main home screens but
I gotta let you guys know about this
bonus app for my fellow Android users
out there called Google opinion rewards
this app occasionally sends you some
quick surveys to take part in and
rewards you with some Google Play credit
I've learned about 39 bucks since using
it and honestly it's made pulling the
trigger on a couple of apps that I had
my eye on a lot easier than having to
pay for it out my own pocket but that
about wraps it up guys hopefully you
enjoyed this look into how I've got my
pixel set up as well the different apps
that I use and if you've got any cool
app recommendations let me know comment
down below and be sure to be the cool
guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
