consumer and as you can see we've got
another massive tech unboxing this one
is number 23 we actually missed last
month for the first time ever this would
have been number 24 and the two-year
mark of us doing this series but you
guys know the deal
grab your snacks grab your drinks relax
cuz we're gonna chill and unbox some
tech now the first product usually goes
Terry but it goes to our sponsor today
so no luck for you we got this giant box
over from the folks at Vizio
all right and here we have it y'all this
is videos P series quantum x 65 inch 4k
HDR smart TV but let's actually set this
thing up and take a better look at it
so this TV is supposed to be able to
show off more colors than your standard
4k television and the colors on this
look really good Wow and I'm happy with
how bright this thing gets it's supposed
to get 10 times brighter than most other
4k TVs out there and I can definitely
see that now something that's cool about
this TV is that it has a built-in
chromecast so I can send something from
the phone right to the TV oh that looks
clean
now this TV is of course 4k with HDR and
Vizio is really proud of the blacks it's
supposed to be like OLED like black so
you get really deep blacks and you're
also supposed to get brighter shades of
white so those highlights are gonna look
really good now not only can you cast
this using Google chromecast you can
even turn on the TV or stream apps using
your voice with Google assistant or
Amazon Alexa and apple homekit is coming
soon
if you guys want to learn more about
this TV I'll of course have links down
below in the description but we've got a
ton more things to unbox so let's get
back to it alright so box number two it
aery you can get that one Oh what this
does you must know what's in here
some skull candy earbuds I love are
these truly wireless earbuds first from
Skullcandy so check this out here we
have them throw these in the ear these
feel like both ear pods and galaxy buds
in one so if you look at the design guys
if we just take off the stem we're
looking at some galaxy buds right here
and this is the charging case for it so
you kind of just throw them in here very
much like the air pods so you get four
hours with the ear buds an additional 12
with the case so that it gives you a
total of 16 hours of playback not bad
there's $79.99 okay you definitely want
to check this out see what that sound is
like alright so Erik got her choice now
I'm gonna go for this one because I know
it's in here and it's kind of special
well we've got over here guys is the
sony a6000 now i have the sony a 65
hundred but this is a really cool option
because it's less expensive and you also
get that pop-out screen and me
personally I'm a huge Sony fan almost
every video we shoot uses a Sony camera
even right now the camera we're shooting
on is the Sony a7 three absolutely
amazing fantastic camera and I decided I
liked it so much that I teamed up with
Sony to give one away to one of you guys
who happens to be a creator if you guys
want a chance to enter the giveaway and
potentially win in a 7-3 follow me over
on twitter tweet me with the name of
your channel as well as what it's about
and the link to it I'll check out the
channels and I'll be picking one person
to win a brand new a 7-3 just to kind of
give back to you guys to also create
some content with an amazing camera and
though you guys don't need a bunch of
subs or anything you can have a really
low sub count it doesn't matter as long
as I see that you are trying to create
some content and you could use a really
solid camera to do it that's all that
you need to answer so good luck to all
of you creators out there can't wait to
see your stuff but as for this a 6400 we
are going to try and use it a bit kind
of get to learn what it's like and I'll
let you guys know what I think of it you
want to pick another one
all right our two in one video
you're lucky you're my wife what's in
this you know we got this from the peel
box I've got no clue what's inside of
here some kind of soup all right let's
take this over here this is an
interesting suitcase oh oh okay yeah all
right it says read oh okay okay so this
is a clock Nixie tube clock there's some
other stuff in here as well like smells
like some candy but I think this is
where the actual tech is oh this looks
like some kind of old school oh look at
this it's got UAC engraved at the bottom
packaging was a little scary at first
but this is actually looks legit uh-oh
there you go that is actually oh it
changes by the second all of that is
awesome so this is a pretty cool box
with a bunch of you know cool retro
stuff all the way from Russia so shout
out to pass indicator first and then
this stuff out well I'll have a link
down below in the description area this
is something all you again right
bed jet so Eric said that this is a
bedsheet that should be able to warm or
cool itself now I like this kind of tech
because it's different so with this
you're supposed to be able to cool or
warm your bed sheet which is something
I've never seen a bedsheet do before
interesting this is nice because airy
likes a cooler room I like it to be warm
so this is actually something we are we
are always fighting with a thermostat
this is the sheet and there's another
box here right that goes with it so this
is the bed jet this is the thing that
actually cools it or warms it depending
on what you want interesting so this is
what's gonna live under your bed
interesting I wonder how loud this is
we'll update you guys on Instagram let
you know what we think of it okay so
next up let's do this guy alright over
here we've got the LG X boom go pk7 so
this is one of LG's new speakers now
what LG's big thing about this one is
being able to take really good sound
with you just about anywhere alright so
here is the
k7 this thing actually features Meridian
technology basically what that means is
you're gonna be able to listen to this
at really high volumes and not have it
distort the sound so you can blast your
music and it still sound really clear
usually speaker sounded really weird
when you kind of throw it up it starts
to sound distorted but this Meridian
technology is supposed to prevent that
let's get this thing a little charged up
and check out how it sounds oh nice so
you guys can see those RGB lights over
here
that'ss sounds great okay so now we got
to play this thing at max volume since
that's what this is all about okay it
sounds much better on a surface okay so
that's pretty impressive that's not a
hundred percent and I was listening out
for Distortion didn't hear it stinks at
Meridian technology that's nice it's got
some crazy it's got some nice bump to it
and everything so alright LG you
shout-out to you guys for sending that
out oh let's go I've been waiting on
this one so Astro has the new
customizable ps4 controller called their
C 40 so if you check out the back here
you can see all the customization
options that it has kind of reminds me
of the Xbox elite controller Sony never
came out with their own fantasy
controller so Astro stepped up to the
plate and made their own and I am really
excited for this okay
opens up like this it comes with a
travel case oh these these buttons and
there's also some triggers down here at
the bottom two in the back rather it
definitely does feel a bit bigger but
the buttons are nice and clicky I like
this Malcolm come check this out man
okay so you can probably unscrew that so
that you can change the kind of
joysticks you're using because they have
a few different joystick options over
here if you want to switch it up and it
uses this a little dongle to connect so
you just put this in to the USB port and
you're good to go
okay cool cool cool wait a minute can
you pick this up and
Oh God okay so that is kind of cool so
if you want to have your d-pad at the
bottom you can do that you want your
d-pad if you're a freak and you want
your d-pad on the right you could do
that to jump alright so this thing is
crazy customizable the feel is really
nice now I just gotta test it out oh you
don't know one of those headphones you
got I feel like you got a lot of stuff
in this massive tech unboxing re so this
is Sony's new extra base headphones I
didn't even know these came out so these
are wh x b700 how much were these 130 so
these have to have something special to
be in that price range so this has
Google assistant and Alexa built into it
oh snap these are actually kind of small
oh these are on ear headphones now with
on ear headphones you probably feel the
bass quite a bit since they're actually
on the ears you'll feel that thump a lot
more but at a hundred and thirty bucks I
am curious to see how good it sounds
okay so it comes with a USB type-c cable
as well as a regular audio jack I like
the two the two-tone Blues over here
this looks really good on the ear cups
but of course I'll let you guys know
about this in a future video okay this
is from Microsoft and we all know what
this is right do we even have to guess
here it has to be I'm saying the fan
some white because I haven't gotten that
yet you know that phantom white baby so
let's see this thing for the first time
dang this is a clean clean controller
guys now the only thing that would make
this better is if it had the grips in
the back that would make this thing
perfect like some great grips they have
a line of these that have like that
see-through top and man it looks so good
shoutout to xbox keep them coming in
what's that oh is this a headphone stand
so this is a headphone stand and it also
has a wireless charging pad so you can
have your headphone sit right here you
pop your phone down and it also also has
three USB ports so that you can charge
up multiple devices
this is actually pretty cool and it's a
simple one cable operation that was got
going on over here
cool you ordered these Oh shout-out to
you for everything huh I'll see once we
got ones out of here a backpack Oh
SteelSeries let's go alright it's kind
of like an orange interior not a lot of
compartments though but it's got a lot
of space so cool shadows are still
serious for sending me a backpack
alright I feel like we can't ignore this
thing any longer it is a gigantic box
okay so this thing is a little a little
used it's all good so what we're looking
at guys is basically a robot vacuum holy
mess yeah this alright so this stuff
looks pretty used and for it being a
cleaning device cotton I don't want to
touch this so we are going to continue
with the other packages but all right
let's see if things got better things
here this is from Oh more Astro let's go
what we got right here guys is the a40
mix ant pro and this is for the ps4 so
you can kind of get like a whole set of
going with these and the controller
alright this packaging though oh look at
that
let's go here we have the headphones
themselves whoo that's clean alright
these look awesome and over here if you
really care about your audio you want to
fine-tune it right here we've got the
mix amp Pro and what's built about this
is my own does it work for the
PlayStation 4 but it also works for the
PC you can just kind of hit this switch
over here and choose which one you want
boom and the same goes for the
controller actually you can work for the
PC as well and here you have of course
the mic which you can just kind of add
on so it's modular in that sense and
over here you've got all of the cables
and whatnot that you'd need to get it
started I am super hyped to try this all
out with my ps4 Astro few shout out to
you for sending this out all right now
can I be a little selfish here can I
go for something that's all about me so
over here we've got something from our
good friends over at Gundam Planet you
guys heard me talk about them plenty of
times that's where I usually buy all my
Gundams so first up we've got the
victory to assault Buster Gundam and not
only that I picked up the special effect
wings so that's also nice but I got a
big boy over here here we have the
perfect grade gundam astray red frame
kai now you guys know the studio is
where I have all of my Gundams but these
perfect grades which are a bit bigger I
think these are what I'm gonna bring
over to my house and put them in my man
cave and have them kind of displayed I
don't give me that look don't give me
that look but if you guys want to find
cool Gundams like this i'll of course
have done them planet link down below
I'm glad they're in Jersey with me okay
I get to go into the store whenever I
want this is a phone the g6 pro gaming
tablets now I've never heard of this
brand before holy mess alright it's a
it's a tablet but it's supposed to be a
gaming tablet the specs are on the side
here I'm not sure what the price is but
I'll have info on it link down below in
the description it's like a pretty
inexpensive tablet I'm assuming now
certain products like these might not
make it into a video but I might do some
updates on Instagram after playing
around with them letting you guys know
what I think so if you're interested in
that be sure to follow me there Oh
Ventus let's see what we've got here so
this is a wireless watch dock duel so
this is supposed to be able to charge
your Apple watch as well as your iPhone
or I guess any other smartphone that has
a Qi wireless charging capability so you
were putting your cable here in the
little USB port wind it up kind of put
it inside here boom and you use the plug
the USB type-c to throw your phone at
the very top interesting design sigh
sorry what are you guys doing let me
know what to comment down below next oh
I picked this thing up so this is
supposed to be a device that pretty much
sanitizes your
smartphone now there's been tons and
tons of research about phones being
dirtier than public toilets can can you
believe that and what this thing does is
you put your phone inside of here and it
uses UV lights to kill off germs oh okay
this thing doesn't only work with smart
phones you could put credit cards key
fobs passive pacifiers all right there
it's a little too much guys I'm not
putting my baby's pacifier inside of
this big it called it clean so you're
supposed to be able to also charge your
device as well as power this guy so
we'll try and test this thing out and
see if it stays true to its claim but
yeah for you germaphobes out there this
kind of thing exists and I'm interested
in trying it out okay so be ok I picked
these up a little while ago I forgot
they should even be in this video but
these are the M Pal jaws this is the
updated version I did a budget bluetooth
earbud video so I'll have the video link
down below in the description I have to
try these out but the previous version
was really good so check that video out
if you're looking for cheap earbuds now
the last product please don't disappoint
oh not bad dang so many headphone so
these right here guys are the Jabra
elite active 65 T also a pair of truly
wireless earbuds so here they are guys
these are the Jabra elite so let's see
how they fit not bad not bad
of course they do have that in ear
design so it makes it a lot easier but
nice I'm gonna have to try these out
test them out and all that but I think
that about wraps it up right we got a
lot of cool stuff here lots of cool
headphones gaming stuff that bed jet I
want to see what that's like in person
