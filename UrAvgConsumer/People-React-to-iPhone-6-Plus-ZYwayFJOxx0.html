Squarespace what's going on everyone
it's your average consumer and I
recently picked up the iPhone six-plus
still getting used to the size but I'm
curious what other people think of it so
I'm going to go and ask around so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it all right so guys here we have the
iPhone 6 plus and have you seen the
iPhone 6 plus previously not today so
let me see what are your reactions to do
you think like it yeah
as Holly conveyed to the apartment I do
like the iPhone I like that they
accepted a bigger screen not a fan of
the first rooting lens I think that's a
little feature that you even Steve Jobs
would have been upset about it's
absolutely huge and it would never fit
in my pocket this some nice size it's a
nice ad where you have bigger hands do
you think that's a fits yeah it's kind
of big bigger than I expected no I
didn't expect it to be this big it's
like a Samsung it's pretty big I have
the note 3 which is a little bigger yeah
this way so what do you think too big
too small and I don't think it's a small
but too big too big yeah to make that
happen
yes a little wider this one looks like
it honestly would probably fit in my
pocket sweater okay now what do you
think about like how tall it is I like
it I like it a lot because it'll I mean
it might stick out of my pocket a little
bit but it'll probably sit it'll fit in
there my note 3 I have to carry a big
purse because it literally doesn't fit
in any
I like the size the size is cool with me
I mean me cuz I wear glasses anything is
always good yeah so I don't have to wear
my glasses all the time so I mean size
is cool and I have a purse so it's
easier for me to carry I don't know for
the way probably you need to use it for
war how to show things or a photographer
I need to show images but else it's
gonna be a good choice the screen size
is definitely on far with the note it
feels about the same in my hand without
the OtterBox but I would have to get a
case because I would drop everything so
with the whole slim factor gets negated
when you get a case anyway definitely
saying that but if you just use to do
you know regular eyes yeah yeah make
phone calls and text messages probably
too big so we buy it I honestly would
I've been excited for it this whole time
I've been very excited let's see does it
fit better now would you be afraid to
sit on it and like have you had problems
like sitting on the note you know what
no I haven't had many problems with that
however this is a bigger screen so I
feel like if one were to break it would
be the bigger screen me
hi I wouldn't bite right now maybe no
well Anna sighs not that emphasize no I
was like see you
I would you wouldn't travel bad witbox
okay that's that's you get it you know
there's a smaller one too right it is a
smaller smaller okay I'm about a smaller
version of this I bought smaller like
you know I'm not this one it's a way too
big I don't like it I like it in terms
of house yes yeah that's that's too big
yeah I think that would be today yeah um
I don't know because I think that Apple
you should have been used to something
the size before so I think that would be
an a deterrent but I'm always been a big
fan of big phones as you can tell from
my note so I would not be a good thing I
would I would like this yeah I think
it's perfect size the bigger the better
so if I had a choice between the two I
would choose the iPhone for sure I want
to take it and all right guys that
pretty much wraps it up for this video
it seems that more people than not said
that they wouldn't go for the iPhone 6
plus a couple people did like the six
but not this Express because of the
larger size but they voted what do you
