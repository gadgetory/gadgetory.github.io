consumer and today is an exciting day
because I finally get to let you guys
know about the brand new razor phone now
I know razor is a gaming company but
they actually want to step into the
smartphone realm with that in mind and
they're trying to bring the best gaming
and multimedia phone to the market so
here's the rundown so first things first
let's talk about the design this thing's
got a rectangular body and for those
familiar with it it looks very similar
to the next bit robin which makes sense
since razer acquired them earlier this
year but they've made some really nice
changes to their version of the design
well we're looking at is a 5.7 inch quad
HD display that supports the wide color
gamut and this is actually the same
panel as the Razer Blade laptops not to
mention this is the world's first 120
Hertz ultra motion display with this
display games are gonna be able to be
played at up to 120 frames per second
and it brings an overall really smooth
experience even if you aren't gaming on
the phone this is adjustable in the
settings though so if you're looking to
save on some battery you have that
option as well
surrounding the display we have stereo
speakers but these aren't just any
speakers they're actually equipped with
Dolby Atmos and they're aiming to give
360 degrees sound and I'm gonna have to
do some more testing to let you guys
know how well they pulled that off but
they did get really loud and I'm not
gonna lie they did leave a pretty good
impression on me but in order to get
great sounding speakers like these razer
did have to forego adding any
waterproofing features so there's no IP
rating over here and i'm actually
genuinely curious about what you guys
think about sacrificing that
waterproofing feature for great sounding
speakers on a phone that's geared
towards multimedia and gaming
let me know in the comments down below I
want to know if it's a big deal for you
or if you think it makes sense but back
to the phone if we take a look around on
the left side you'll see your volume
controls and on the right side you'll
find your power button which also
doubles as a fingerprint scanner you'll
also find your SIM card tray which has a
slot for a micro SD card if you want to
add some more storage at the bottom of
the phone you'll also find a USB type-c
port for charging and this also happens
to be the first phone that shipped with
Qualcomm quick charge 4.0 plus so charge
it's beefy 4000 milliamp hour bad
but sadly there's no headphone jack in
sight which is honestly a serious bummer
to me but razer does include a high
quality adapter that also has a built-in
24-bit DAC which pretty much means we
should get better audio quality than
with a standard headphone jack but man
I'd trade that thing in any day for a
built-in headphone jack I'm not gonna
lie and finally taking a look at the
back you'll see that this has an
aluminum unibody
with a finish just like their razor
blade laptops and it also comes with a
silver Razer logo but if you really want
to represent distance with a classic
green logo but that's only gonna be
available for the first 1337 who order
it because it's for the lead and not to
mention there's also dual 12 megapixel
cameras and a dual tone flash as well as
an 8 megapixel front-facing camera
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to
really test out the cameras so you guys
are gonna have to wait until I put it
through a real day in the life now Razer
is a gaming company that makes a bunch
of Awesome accessories and some insanely
spec laptops but they're trying to bring
that power down to the mobile world in
terms of specs we're looking at the
latest Snapdragon 835 chip carried by
all the flagships of this year eight
gigs of ram which is just nuts I can't
believe we're at the point where we're
seeing that much RAM inside of a smart
phone
it'll also ship with 64 gigs of storage
and has that SD card slot that supports
up to 2 terabyte micro SD s if they'll
ever exist I think that this is more
than an impressive spec sheet and it
hits a lot of the check boxes that we
expect from today's smartphones spec
wise so what does all this power under
the hood actually mean well it should
lead to great media consumption and
gaming Razer is definitely targeting
folks who want the best experience
watching content and playing games on
their phone this is running a stock
version of Android 7.1.1 with a premium
copy of Nova Launcher
but it will be updated to Android Oreo
sometime down the line
I definitely think stock Android is the
right approach for all the Android
lovers out there who are looking for
minimal to no bloatware and speaking of
software Razer is working closely with
game developers to bring games that are
optimized for this phone and it's 2k
display one of those titles is actually
Final Fantasy 15 and if you know me you
know I'm pretty hype about that
and if everything goes according to
Razors plan we'll be playing some
awesome games at 2k with frame rates of
up to 120 FPS with a great sound
experience to follow and while all of
this sounds pretty intense for a phone
razer said they worked really hard on
the thermals to prevent the phone from
heating up and throttling under intense
pressure and if you want to take it easy
with this phone you can always bring
down the resolution of your display as
well as the refresh rate which should
lead to some pretty awesome battery
considering it has a four thousand
milliamp hour battery I'm definitely
gonna have to do some tests to see if
you can get some really nice battery
life out of this phone and while my
first impressions were very positive and
this thing looks great on paper it is
missing a few key features like a
headphone jack water resistance as well
as wireless charging so we're gonna have
to see how it all pans out once I get my
hands on it but it's safe to say I am
pretty excited for this phone I
personally think this phone has a lot of
potential and surprisingly it's gonna be
hitting the market for $6.99 which is
actually some pretty competitive pricing
in the flagship market pre-orders should
be live right about now and I'll of
course have links down below in the
description and November 17th is when it
actually becomes available but even
though I'm personally excited I want to
know what you guys think are any of
those missing features a deal-breaker
for you guys maybe the price let me know
your thoughts down below in the comment
section but I'll catch you guys in the
next one if you enjoyed this video be
the cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then is your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
