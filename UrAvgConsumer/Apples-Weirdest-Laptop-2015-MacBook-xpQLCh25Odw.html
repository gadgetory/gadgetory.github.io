wondering what's up with the title and
why I'm calling this Apple's weirdest
MacBook there are plenty of reasons but
I'll get into that in a second first
let's talk a bit about what you get here
this is Apple's thinnest and lightest
macbook to date and it's a gorgeous
piece of hardware and I doubt anyone
Apple ever or not can disagree with that
it comes in three different colors which
is new to the world of Apple laptops and
you're able to choose between the new
Space Gray version that I've got here as
well as a gold and silver option and the
silver is basically the same as every
other macbook these are the same colors
you can choose between with iPhones and
iPads so if you're into matching you'll
be able to do that I'm not going to bore
you with the exact dimensions of how
thin this is but trust me it's stupid
then we're now starting to see laptops
into the same portability range of
tablets and I think this is probably the
biggest feature when it comes to the
12-inch MacBook to be honest on paper I
thought this was a terrible machine it
doesn't have great specs and even as a
device that I didn't plan to do any
video or photo editing on I still
expected more especially considering the
$1,300 price tag you can easily get a
more powerful MacBook Air for Less and
that's saying a lot not only does this
have lackluster specs but it only has
one port yes you heard me correctly one
port not to mention it's USB type-c
while it's great to see the adoption of
new tech like USB type-c which is faster
and more versatile than the current USB
options you'll need an adapter for any
of your devices if they aren't USB
type-c compatible and chances are none
of the devices you own are compatible
yet I also feel like there should be a
minimum of two USB ports on a laptop one
of the biggest flaws with the MacBook is
that the single USB port is also used to
charge it that means while it's charging
you won't be able to use any external
devices with it unless you of course
buying it
laughter I'm not sure if this is an
issue of being a first-gen product or
agreed on apples end this means you
won't find any display ports SD card
slots or any other port you might come
to expect on a standard laptop
not to mention this thing is packing a
480p webcam which is quite shocking I'm
not even sure what Apple still makes
these kinds of cameras considering every
other product Apple sells has something
better I also wasn't too impressed with
the typing experience and I've been
using this for quite some time now so
I'm not sure if it's something I'll
really get used to personally I prefer
keys with a little more height as I find
them to be more tactile and satisfying
to type on with these I never really get
the sense that I'm pressing the keys
with this MacBook you'll also get the
new force touch trackpad which feels
surprisingly similar to the normal
version with some additional features
like being able to fast-forward through
videos faster depending on how much
pressure you put on the pad now I've
been coming down pretty hard on this
MacBook but the weirdest thing about it
is that I'm insanely drawn to using it
while it has plenty of drawbacks there
are some really nice things about it as
well as I mentioned this thing is
gorgeous and I'm a sucker for it in
Space Gray it also has a Retina display
so you get a pretty crisp screen with
some nice room to work with even though
it's only a 12-inch display and of
course the insane portability it's so
easy for me to grab this and go without
much compromise in terms of
functionality as I mentioned before the
portability rivals that of a tablet but
with this you'll get much more
functionality than a tablet offers this
is the feeling you're supposed to get
with something like the surface pro 3
but I find that this does a much better
job at it it feels like a laptop but
also feels as portable as a tablet with
a less awkward keyboard solution than
the surface currently offers it also has
pretty great battery life which is
surprising with the super thin design
and all but the engineers over at Apple
really pulled off something amazing
because the battery life competes with
that of any of the other Mac books
another surprisingly great feature of
the new MacBook is its speakers I have
no idea how such a small laptop can
produce such great sound the speakers
are so loud it's comparable to the
stereo speakers on my 15-inch MacBook
it's definitely not something I was
expecting but I'm happy they performed
so well and this is why I find this to
be the weirdest Apple laptop yet it's
pretty underwhelming in terms of what it
provides
but it's amazing design has caused me to
fall in love with it due to its ease of
use this is definitely geared towards
the constant traveler or the student who
doesn't want to carry much to class it's
a great note-taking and web browsing
device and if those are your main
reasons for using a laptop this could
work pretty well for you but when it
comes to recommendations I can't
wholeheartedly recommend it because I
know how much it lacks I'm hoping that
Apple addresses most of the issues like
the single USB port bad webcam weak
processor and the steep price tag in the
next version of this MacBook and that
wraps it up for my review of the 12 inch
retina macbook which I'm dubbing Apple's
weirdest laptop yet because it manages
to suck but still makes me want to use
it now Apple has been pretty innovative
with the designs of the new MacBook but
there are some other companies working
on some pretty innovative products as
well and one of those products is here a
pair of wireless buds that gives you
full control of what you hear and how
you hear it through the use of an app
I've got a chance to go to Doppler labs
and check out the hearing person and
I've got to say this is pretty amazing
these buds literally allow you to
control the volume of the world around
you and even gives you the ability to
enhance or tune out certain frequencies
depending on the situation you're in so
from crying babies on a plane to the
sound of the subway you get to pick what
your ears are subjected to and if that's
not cool enough the carrying case is
also used to charge this thing while
you're on the go it's no surprise their
Kickstarter has blown up and if you guys
want to be amongst the first to grab a
pair or learn more
definitely check the links down below
and I don't know about you guys but it's
been a while since I've seen something
this innovative and when it comes out
it's definitely something I want to get
my hands on hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video and be sure to leave a comment
down below letting me know what you guys
think of the new MacBook and be the cool
guy that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video till then it's your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
