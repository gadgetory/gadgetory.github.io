consumer and today we are going to be
checking out some of my favorite tech of
the month and it's still technically
March so it's going to count towards
that but if you didn't see my last video
like this I'm pretty much going to be
talking about some of the detector I've
been using quite a bit might not
necessarily be brand new could be old
but this is stuff that I've been using
quite a bit this month so let's check it
out so first thing we're gonna take a
look at is this guy and oh that is hot
actually says 1 million 70,000 flat so
that's pretty cool but I guess you can
call that a Youtube subscriber count
o'clock slash Bluetooth speaker and it
has a ton of other features as well it
actually has a couple of buttons and you
can cycle through to see all kinds of
information so you've got whether you
can listen to the radio you've got a
stopwatch and what's cool about this is
that you can actually get the app and
add more features to it and just so you
guys know this is the lumetri clock
that's the official name of it and with
this app you can actually jump in and
get apps for the clock so you can see
all the things that I mentioned earlier
the weather stop watch the YouTube
counter but once you go down here you
can go in and add a few more things and
there's a lot of lot of cool stuff here
news tweets all kind of stuff even
Facebook post Gmail so I think this is a
really really dope lock for me as a
youtuber it's a little bit more special
because I get to see how many of you
guys are subscribing and when I hit
certain milestones or if a certain
milestone is coming up but it's a lot of
money it's like 200 bucks right Ari yeah
I think there's like there's almost like
200 bucks I don't know if I really
recommend it but it's really cool piece
of text if you have a lot of
notifications that you want to see on
display and it's got this cool little
pixelated look to it so if your
interests of just has that nice look to
but
oh speaking of retro stuff check this
out over here now I usually keep this at
home but right here we have a cool
little apple watch dock this is from
geez was it for them I don't even know
a logo a logo alright so I picked this
up randomly on Amazon and kind of fell
in love with it now you guys know I
always use an Apple watch and when it's
in this little dock
it looks like a retro Apple Macintosh
computer so I kind of like that
old-school retro vibe that it gives off
you throw in your Apple watch charger in
the bag so if you're really into
old-school retro Apple this is a solid
pick up especially when it's sideways
because you get this little screen it
looks just like an old school computer I
think this is pretty awesome I typically
use this when I'm in the studio but I
have to show you guys this from home how
to bring it in Detroit Board if you
happen to be watching you need this my
man and it's all like what 13 bucks so
it's really inexpensive a nice cool way
to set down your Apple watch now let's
get to this oh-ho-ho no this is a new
pickup now this is not something I've
had for a long time this is brand
spanking new but it's already a favorite
of mine the Sony xb9 50 enones now you
look you guys already know how I feel
about the 950 bps the pn1 whoo and I got
to say Sony really surprised me with the
fact that they were able to improve my
beloved 950 DPS
I'm going to have a full review letting
you guys know all the changes all the
new things that you can expect but I got
to say save your pennies a little sneak
peek on what's different with these you
now got some foldable action so you can
store these a lot easier than you could
the old ones because old one stay just
like this man can do much more with it
but what's also cool is that they
introduce noise cancelling so if you're
really into that these offer it they've
got this nice cool new color alright
I'm already I'm already giving away too
much you guys are going to see in the
full review but note that I am
completely in love with these so so good
and overreach Oh before I forget I
actually got a giveaway going on guys if
you didn't see my most recent video well
two videos back I guess I'm actually
teaming up with do collar to give away a
brand new Google pixel to one of
guys and if you want to enter all you
have to do is check the link down below
in the description download the dual
color app make sure it's installed but
all the giveaway details will be down
below in the description so make sure
you check it out but I got to say this
is a pretty cool app if you guys ever
got like spam calls OH
especially those calls about winning a
cruise those are the worst
if you ever deal with that guys you
definitely want to get your hands on
blue collar especially because you have
a chance of winning a Google pixel so be
sure to check out that link now another
one of my favorites for the month of
March with no surprise is the Nintendo
switch now this has been a great great
time killer for me being able to play on
the go is amazing now there aren't tons
of games out right now
I just been playing a lot of Legend of
Zelda and I am setsuna over here now
these two games have been keeping me
occupied and I gotta say guys it is this
is what I've been waiting for a very
solid portable system so this is just
everything I've wanted I'm just waiting
for more more titles but I actually have
some really cool stuff coming up for the
switch guys so you're going to want to
pay a lot of attention to the channel
soon so keep your eyes peeled for that
but the switch so good now since we're
talking about games a game that I would
have to now I don't know if this
consider is considered like technology
or my favorite tech but it's a game on
the PlayStation it all counts whatever
now the game that I really want to
recommend if you have a ps4 is horizon
zero dawn now everybody's been
everybody's heard about this game but
the games been hyped up but I want to
let you guys know it is legit it's got a
great story
it's got great mechanics it's fun game
to play even Ares interested in meat
watching you played the story has just
been that good so I really really
recommend this and look at this there
are giant dinosaur robot things like how
could you not like that you guys already
know I happen to be a fan of giant
box and whatnot but either way this is
still a very very good game if you were
on the fence about it I definitely
definitely suggest picking it up it's a
great great game I went ahead and got
the collector's edition and got this
little alloy figurine that's her name
but is worth that is the collector's
edition worth it I don't know about all
that but the game is worth it
digital or just regular copy go pick it
up now the last thing I'm going to show
you guys is this guy this is a new
little grab-and-go backpack that I put
together obviously you can tell it's by
UAC because of this feel that it's
rocking but it's like a grain field look
this actually is a very lightweight
backpack very very far from what you
typically see on the channel this is not
a gadget backpack amount of travel
backpack
this is a grab-and-go backpack where I
just take this to somewhere that I'm
going to be for a short period of time
not somewhere I want to get a ton of
work done so let me show you guys what
I've got inside of here and you guys
already know I tend to overdo it with
the color teal and that's what we got
with all the contents inside of the bag
so first off you've got you guys know I
tend to have a second phone with me
usually a phone that I'm testing we've
got the LGG set over here with a teal
background matches that really well
we've also got the surface pro 4 over
here with the teal type cover to10 that
i took from some hotel room and the sony
here on wireless headphones these go
well with the whole thing as well these
sounds really awesome
and I think these dropped in price quite
a bit they sound amazing and I think you
can get them from maybe around 200 I
could be lying but if they're that low
I'll have a link down below in the
description as well as a link for
everything else mentioned in this video
but moving on I know you guys keep the
Altoids if you go if you're going out
your breath can be kicking so you want
to carry some of these they've got the
chill border around it anyway that's
experiment for you but yeah this is a
good look I'm addicted to bees actually
let's see over here I've got that
uncalibrated red we've got the tech
survival kit 2.0 now every backpack
needs to have two tech survival kit if
you guys haven't seen the video I'll
have that link below as well but you
just can't have a backpack without it
you got to have your survival kit to
make sure you're ready for those tech
emergencies and that is why it's in here
but I got to say guys that about wraps
it up really those are all the cool
things that I've been messing with a lot
lately hopefully you enjoyed the video

gives this video a thumbs up stay tuned
for that special Nintendo switch video
