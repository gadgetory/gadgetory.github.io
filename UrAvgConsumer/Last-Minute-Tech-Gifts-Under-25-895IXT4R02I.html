John but he's feeling a little bit sick
right now so I'm standing in for him we
really want to get these gift guides to
you guys so we're gonna be taking a look
at the top 5 tech under $25
also known as stocking stuffers so get
ready for some really awesome stuff and
first up is something that's pretty
handy it's this Aki Bluetooth audio
transmitter so you don't think I'd like
one of those older cars that don't play
Bluetooth or connect through bluetooth
this is a little device I can actually
help you make your car do that so I got
this from my sister because she has an
older car but it works really really
well so she's not getting a new car any
time soon but this device can plug right
into her car and now she can play music
directly from her phone one thing to
note though is you have to have an aux
port if you don't have an aux port in
your car this will not work so please
make sure you take note of that but if
the person you're buying a gift for
already has an up-to-date car you can
use this for like say their speakers
that aren't bluetooth you can actually
use this device to make their speaker's
Bluetooth which is really cool so you
can plug this device in and now you can
play music from your phone to those
speakers but this thing can also work as
a transmitter so it's kind of like a
two-in-one so if you have a TV and you
want to use your Bluetooth headphones
with your TV this can work for that too
so I love it there are a ton of options
here with how you can use it and it's
under 25 bucks it's solid for anyone who
wants to be able to use they Boots's
headphones or play music from their
phone to some speakers or another device
that's not Bluetooth capable and what
would this list be without the Amazon
fire stick HD now I know some people
were doing shady stuff with it but
anyway the one that's on this list comes
with built-in Alexa so that's actually
really really cool and a nice upgrade
this is the perfect stocking stuffer for
someone who has an HDTV that might not
be smart so this can actually allow you
to play like Netflix and Hulu you can
access it over like five thousand
channels with this thing and it really
turns your TV which is like maybe a
regular TV into a smart TV for less than
25 bucks and it also comes with a remote
so you can tell Alexa to rewind play
specific content and even launch certain
apps with just a click of a button and
the best part about it is it's really
easy to set up so if you're getting this
with someone who's a little bit older
it's really not gonna be hard for them
at all as long as you have an HDMI port
and Wi-Fi you're good to go
so at 25 bucks I think this is the
perfect stocking stuffer
one who kind of wants to up their TV
game just make sure you share that
Netflix password now this next item I
really love it I think I could have
really used it in school and it's a
logitech k4
keyboard and what makes us keyboard
special is it's a Bluetooth keyboard but
it works for multiple devices this
keyboard works for Android Windows
Chrome OS and Apple so it pretty much
covers it all and what I personally love
about it is you can actually pair it to
three different devices simultaneously
and if you want to switch between them
all you have to do is turn it off I was
actually planning on buying one of these
for my mom who likes to use a physical
keyboard and she has a tablet at home
and a tablet at work so really all she
has to do is carry that keyboard in her
purse and she can easily switch between
the two devices and use that keyboard
for both of them now if you're an avid
watcher of the channel you've definitely
seen this before the easy switch
keyboard by Logitech JAL loves that one
but this one is different because it has
a little slot at the top that holds your
devices it's perfect for tablets overall
I think this is a great option for the
techie in your life who needs a little
bit of streamlining or even someone
who's not a techie but has multiple
devices that they like to use with a
physical keyboard this is a perfect
stocking stuffer at only 24 bucks and
the next one guys if you follow me on
twitter and then you have heard me talk
about this non-stop so next up on our
list which i think is one of the best
things on this list and only 17 bucks is
a custom pop socket
I bought a pop socket about a month ago
when I got my iPhone 10 it was a little
difficult for me to reach like the
control panel and the pop socket
I swear changed my life it definitely
made using my iPhone 10 a lot more
enjoyable and this works obviously with
larger phones to say if you have an
iPhone 8 plus or seven plus this
definitely helps you to navigate the
phone much more easily and it's on this
list because it's custom who doesn't
like custom things so yes I completely
100% recommend the pop socket I
personally love them I was not a
believer before the iPhone 10 I thought
they looked really silly and to be
honest they kind of do look silly but
they're functional you can customize
them and they just work I love them and
this last stocking stuffer is great if
you're looking to buy something for
someone who travels a lot or maybe for
that college kid who's going to study
abroad and it's the loop world adapter
plug and while this adapter is not a
power converter it allows you to use
this plugin over 150
country's that's a lot and that little
adapter has built-in adapters for the US
Europe Australia and Asia and what's
really nice is it has USB ports included
so if you want to charge your phones or
tablets you can actually charge up to
three different devices at once these
are perfect at 15 bucks be able to
charge your stuff with no problem makes
it all worth it so I really think if
someone travels a lot or if they're
going to go study abroad they would
really appreciate this gift and last but
not least don't laugh for me guys but
last but not least is this pack of
microfiber cloths now you guys know Jeff
loves microfiber cloths he loves to just
clean his tech off even though it's
gonna get dirty again but I bought these
because these are supposed to be one of
the best microfiber cloths on the market
and they were super cheap so this is a
no-brainer it's going right into a
stocking he's probably gonna see this
but whatever but you can never have too
many microfiber cloths
this one's large enough to wipe down
bigger screens really easily and it's
inexpensive so it's an awesome stocking
stuffer and I really think that the tech
in your life would really love it and
that's all I have for this list guys
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
and enjoyed yourself to to teacher but I
did say it was top 5 it was kind of like
this technically 6 but the last one was
a bit of a bonus but let me know if you
guys enjoyed this video by giving me a
thumbs up and leave a comment down below
thanks again for watching and I'll catch
you guys in the next one oh happy
holidays
sue for those of you who celebrate bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
