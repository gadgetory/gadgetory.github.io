what's going on guys to travel consumer
and as you can see today we've got
another massive tech unboxing so you
know the deal I don't I don't gotta say
it do I now I go grab your snacks go
grab your drinks let's relax chill and
open up some tech all right Ari
we finally have Ari here folks and I'd
like to thank you for getting at her in
the comments section of the last mass of
tech unboxing go ahead are you know the
deal pick one you gonna be going throws
okay she wants to see the thing that she
purchased all right well so be it here
we have what is this called anyway the
lifx beam do I need a blending my knife
I do need my knife so and for the guy
who got at me about using a box cutter
you made me go out and buy a new knife
okay you private yourself I'm not
usually this easy to influence guys but
I wanted a new knife anyway so that
worked out I already got some ideas for
this if this thing looks good I'm
thinking maybe a little something around
here to spice it up yeah yeah so you
guys can see this right here this is an
example of what it's supposed to look
like and here we have them mm-hmm so
there are six pieces so this is kind of
like a combo between LED strips and the
Aurora Nano Leafs where you can kind of
put them together so you can't really
make too many designs though they kind
of just go in a line okay so what else
have we got we got a wall adapter and I
guess oh this is the piece right here so
this is like a triple piece so you can
connect one on this side this side and
this side so you can make like a tea out
of it dang it's gonna get really
expensive to make a really cool pattern
out of here but what's also cool about
this besides just creating these
patterns and these interesting designs
is the fact that it is voice controlled
so you can use Amazon Alexa will assist
in all that
stuff to kind of control the lights so
that's interesting we've got two sets
you guys should be seeing a change to
the set up here pretty soon it's just
gonna be teal why even act like it's
gonna be signs fresh it's gonna be teal
guys now Jay my man I'm not gonna forget
about you you could go ahead and pick
something too
we got a new tradition two picks this
guy right here okay
I think I already know what this is
oh-ho-ho you guys see what this is
Oppo baby that Oppo find X I'm hoping
it's the glacier blue the glacier blue
one looks amazing but we'll see what we
get bad box the all screen phone please
what is it Jay dang okay it's purple
it's a dope looking phone regardless I
just really wanted that glacier blue but
it's all good it's all good this is
still a very very nice looking phone man
even in purple and for those of you who
aren't familiar with this Apple find X
we don't know about it never heard of it
this is pretty much an Android device
which looks really really cool but one
thing you'll notice in the front is that
you've got no bezels that means no
front-facing camera none of that it's
completely gone
Wow so it has a tiny bit of a chin and a
little bit of a bezel up top so there's
it's not completely bezel this but this
is it's good enough to call bezels I get
it and there are no cameras in the back
as well you can't see any and I'm gonna
show you why in just a second so I'm
about to enroll in the face scanning
feature so let's take a look at how this
actually pulls it off all right so I'll
hit continue oh you guys see that
just like that that was that was cool
that was really cool so the cameras
actually pop up from this little
motorized hidden section built right
into the phone that is amazing that is
really really cool all right camera as
soon as you know as soon as you press it
so let's see is there delay I'm trying
to get into my phone take a picture real
quick BAM hey it's not a scarf I'm not
complaining about that so not only is
this like a great looking phone but it's
got like these cool mechanics to it and
you know I'm excited for it so if you
guys want to see a real day in the life
with the Oppo find X let me know what to
comment down below maybe hit that thumbs
up button so I can know you guys really
want it hmm so this is the new Gundam
breaker game is ready how did I get that
water to it my mistake when did this
even come in alright clearly this was a
mistake
maybe I'll post a giveaway tweet on
Twitter anybody's interested who shares
my love let me know on Twitter oh I
chose right so here we've got the new
Xbox controller this one is called let's
see you have a special name buddy oh no
I don't think it has a special name I
mean look at that look at this guys this
is like a light blue I thought it was
gonna be like a teal but it's more of a
light blue like a baby blue really so
it's like a grey and baby blue not bad
not bad I can dig it but there is one
that I'm really excited about and that's
this guy now this one this one has a
name it's called phantom black
oh and oh I got the I know exactly what
I'm gonna do with this controller I'm
not gonna spoil it for you guys but I'm
gonna do something special with this oh
I already know so this is the Phantom
black controller and not only does it
have this nice gradient going through it
like where it's got the black and this
what are you even called see it's not
gold but it's got this nice transparent
look at the top you guys see that you
could see right through the controller
this is an awesome awesome design I love
this all right what have we got over
here Oh Ari was telling me about this
you see air you scoop this up herself
that's when you that's how you know I've
converted her into a techie where she's
picking up cool stuff for the channel
without me even knowing what they are
this is the smartlock pro connect or
it's not smartlock pro and connect for
august locks ok works with amazon alexa
apple homekit and google assistant if
you're a smart home product in 2018 you
better support all three it just makes
no sense not to oh nice so this thing
actually comes with the smart home lock
itself and the little Wi-Fi bridge so
that you can go ahead and be able to
access the lock from anywhere so I
didn't know that they sold these as a
kit now so this is going straight to the
new house so that we can have a smart
lock right there this is awesome alright
so let's see what we've got here I know
you guys see this right here you see the
monitor but we ain't going for that just
yet maybe after this one
Wow okay so here we have the Sukkot so
with the Sukkot you can take your phone
suck it onto most surfaces you guys are
trying to get me demonetised huh trying
to take away my ad revenue I hear you
real funny so you can suck it onto most
surfaces to take videos selfies live
feeds to use GPS and more so this is
pretty much it so it can stretch so it
should be able to work with almost any
device
I guess should I trust it with the Oppo
find X that we just got our hands on
there's no way this thing is sliding I'm
cool thanks guys but this this is not
secure at all I'm gonna give it one more
try so it works better with a phone that
has a case okay but I would not try it
if you don't have a case since it's
risky business anyway
alright so I want to take a selfie and I
just I just can't do this I can't I
can't hold it in my hand right well
maybe I got a group picture or something
I'm just gonna go and then put the timer
on I guess you can make a run for it
okay I mean it done this job I guess and
you can hold it like a pop socket too I
don't know what to say J do you like it
seems like I played the fit all right
you've been seeing it let's get to it
right this MSI monitor all right so this
MSI monitor is the optics MP g27
CQ curved LED gaming monitor that is a
mouthful
so we got cables HDMI cable display
cable power adapter booklets with audio
jacks
interesting audio jacks okay and the
power plug and a USB cable so this thing
can act as a hub that we have in the
legs so this is a stand that keeps it up
alright this is nice display suppose 27
inches and this thing that's got a lot
of cool features guys alright so I got a
little something connected to it now let
me power this guy on peep the bottom
guys I don't know if you can see that
but we got RGB lights right here at the
bottom and that's powered by steel
series gamesense so there's a couple of
different things that you can do with
this of course you can change the colors
all that good stuff but if you're
playing like a game it can be like a
health bar it can be a special indicator
or certain things happen in the game so
there's a lot of cool things that you
can do to interact with your monitor and
in your game play so I think that's kind
of awesome and just for you spec heads
out there it's a 2560 by 1440 resolution
144 Hertz refresh rate 1 millisecond
response time and this is oh snap I
didn't even notice this guys check this
out
it's got RG B's back here - oh that is
dough yo so this is the kind of this
kind of monitor I wouldn't even want to
put up against a wall what how do you
show this off oh my goodness that looks
nice I love that alright I gotta find a
way to show this off and not cover up
that design that is cool but either way
this looks like a great monitor I'm
gonna have to test it out maybe put it
in a set
play some games with it and see how it
goes so check this out guys this looks
like a care package from Intel let's see
what we've got got some swag over here
innovators 2018 your average consumer
custom gear I'm with it what's this
hyper chiller make ice coffee in one
minute flat I don't really drink coffee
but that's kind of cool so you can use
it to chill wine whiskey iced tea a
glass of juice oh this is awesome I want
to try this out
all right we've also got a google home
mini now I've actually got a few of
these if you guys want one I'll give
I'll give this one away on Twitter still
thankful for it Intel but cool help out
one of the subs oh this is like one of
the fancy tiles if you don't know tile
you can find your lost items with this I
talked about it quite a bit on the
channel already I can't have too many of
those front and back seat car charger
okay so if you plug this guy in in the
front you got some USB ports in the
front and some one in the back and use
the other USB ports so you got five in
total that's kind of cool this is the
dude Oh fall asleep faster okay so by
focusing on the light being projected on
the ceiling
slows down the flow of your thoughts at
the same time synchronizing your
abdominal breathing with the movement of
the light gradually reducing your
breathing rate from eleven to six
breaths per minute I could personally
use this is designed for insomniacs you
know who could probably use this John
Rhett enger' he's complaining about
insomnia on Twitter before maybe I'll
show this to him over here we've got a
looming man so this is what a smart bulb
you can control the color temperature
and it's just a smart light bulb an
electronic luggage scale so get one of
these and you pretty much just pull up
your suitcase and it'll tell you how
heavy it is without you having to find
out right at the airport so this is
actually useful why don't more people
have this I guess I didn't know what
this existed so maybe a lot of people
don't but this is actually really useful
if you travel a lot so I don't know what
this is I think the
from rustico I've never heard of them
this is a fancy looking thing it says
your average consumer on there this is
kind of nice
okay maybe it's supposed to hold three
earbuds okay so this is supposed to be
an organizer for your cables so if you
have any special cables you want to keep
them in a really nice cool fancy pouch
of some sort you can throw them in here
but all right huge shout-out to Intel
for you know send this stuff out oh yeah
so these are just pair of speakers that
I picked up from Logitech these are the
MX sound these are bluetooth speakers
and I think you can of course plug them
into your computers use them as a
regular desktop speaker but you can use
them wirelessly as well I don't think
this thing comes with a subwoofer so
shouldn't expect any crazy bass or
anything mmm oh is this is this supposed
to be where the bass comes out of oh
this could be kind of cool so we just
might get some bass out of this this is
a pretty confident I like just design
wow this is actually a lot more
impressive than I expected it's got some
heft to it so doesn't feel like a cheap
pair of speakers and the fact that there
might actually be some solid base that
comes from this
it's got my attention okay so here we
have both of them nice clean look but
I'll let you guys know how they sound
I'm gonna give it a shot I'm hoping that
we get some solid bass out of these but
this looks good so far
I think this came from the peel box as
well I have no idea what this is
yes oh okay
strengthened glass screen protector for
the iPad I'm surprised they even sent
this because there's not that much buzz
on the iPad right now there's like no
buzz on the iPad so okay iPad pro case
I've had probe screen protector that's
