to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video what's going on everyone the
Travers consumer today I'm going to be
doing an unboxing of the Samsung
Chromebook for the Chrome OS now I
picked this up because this isn't your
typical computer or a laptop whatever
you want to call it this isn't your
typical kind of operating system so I
wanted to try it out and see how US
average consumers would like using it on
a day to day basis so enough about that
let's not wasting time let's get right
into it
alright guys so here we have the Samsung
Chromebook box and I got this from Best
Buy I guess this is the retail packaging
this looks like something it would be
shipped in to be honest nothing special
about the packaging at all at the bottom
and the back at the bottom left hand
side you can see a sticker with some
listed specs on here says it's running
the Chrome OS it's got a 12 inch 12.1
inch screen 16 gigs of solid-state drive
and it's running a 1.66 gigahertz
processor and typically that's that kind
of stuff we would say it's fast very
fast because of the solid state drive
1.60 60 gigahertz shouldn't be too bad
considering it's not gonna be doing too
much but um alright enough about the
specs and stuff if you guys want I'll
have it listed below but enough about
the specs let's get this thing open so
we're gonna cut this little piece of
tape here and once we get that down see
if we can pull it out
okay so we got that close and pulling
this out I'm very interested to see how
this thing operates not being a normal
computer with you know a normal
operating system I'm very interested in
seeing how this will brought work for
you know day to day use so we got a lot
of packaging here um right here is the
actual notebook itself we also get under
that you get some you know warranty
information it's also as well as a
QuickStart guide under that I don't
believe there's anything else I'm pretty
sure in the back here you can find the
power adapter or you can find and here
it's a pretty standard power adapter
there's really nothing special three
prong really nothing special to show you
guys with these power adapter so now
that we got all of this out we're gonna
put this back and then we're going to
fire up this book alright now that we
got this bad boy out we're gonna take it
out of its protective packaging here and
here you have it this is the Samsung
Chromebook um it's pretty thin compared
to regular laptops it's very thin
actually um definitely a little spoiled
by the MacBook Air so this looks a
little thicker to me but it is very
small compared to your regular laptop
and this definitely gives you that
netbook feeling so let me give you guys
a little close-up of what it looks like
alright guys so here we have the
Chromebook show you guys a bit about
around the sides here's where you plug
in your AC adapter this is where you put
in your ethernet cord if you need one
I'm not sure what this port is right
here but I will leave an annotation and
here is your USB port as well as your
where your headphone jack
right there here you also find another
USB port as well as a solid um not a
solid as well as the SD card slot right
here I am also not sure about this port
on the top right side I'll definitely
putting an annotation there to let you
guys know and pretty much that is all
you can see a couple of fans here and
pretty much that's all for this netbook
it's really thin very nice-looking
alright so now let's try and open this
thing up and it's got a really nice feel
to it feels very clean um the the
touchpad feels really nice it feels very
smooth I like the way this feels it
feels really good I'll top here you have
a one megapixel webcam and Puma's that's
it
pretty nice keyboard alright so I'm
gonna get this plugged in and we're
gonna see how fast it boosts cuz that's
supposed to be one of its own some
features a really fast little load up
time so let's see how fast it takes to
boot okay so I just plugged it in and
we're going to try its first boot up
here okay so here we're greeted by the
chrome logo and see how long this takes
to start up okay so now it's prompting
me to connect so I guess it needs me to
set up and you know configure it for
Wi-Fi and all that kind of stuff so it's
pretty fast I only took like a couple of
seconds so definitely impressive there
um that's about it that's all about all
I'm gonna do for this unboxing guys I'm
gonna set this up and then I'm going to
play with it and see how it runs and let
you guys know how good this Chrome OS is
for us average consumers but alright
guys that's about it for this unboxing
if you enjoyed this video please feel
free to rate comment and subscribe and
be on the lookout for the review coming
up shortly and I'll catch you guys in
the next video alright till then
peace
