five favorite earbuds 2.0 and just like
my last top 5 headphone video I've got
some cool suggestions from my boy Mike
over a hi-fi insider now this list is in
any particular order so we'll kick it
off with the newest of the 5 the V
motors en this is V motors first pair of
earbuds in 4 years and you guys can me
rave about their quality all the time
and this time is no different
these are solidly built as they've got a
diamond back cable that's actually
Kevlar reinforced so you're getting some
insane durability compared to your
standard pair of earbuds you of course
get some different sized ear tips ear
hooks which are great to keep these in
place when you're working out and an
inline remote with a built-in mic play
pause and volume buttons in terms of
quality and durability these live up to
the v-moda name but what about the sound
no disappointment here they sound great
offering some nice clarity while having
some clean deep bass to me these are
like the v-moda m100 s but in earbud
form if you're looking for well-built
great sound the earbuds you definitely
want to check out the ZN next up we have
an awesome recommendation from mike the
ultimate ears ue 900 i've been carrying
this guy around for a while and even
included it in my latest set up for my
gadget backpack it's got a pretty unique
twisted cable design and what sets this
apart from everything else on the list
is the sheer amount of options you get
when you pick it up and if you usually
struggle trying to find the perfect fit
for your earbuds they've got you covered
on first glance you see a ton of ear
cushions both foam and silicone and they
even list the exact measurements of each
tip so you know exactly what you're
working with the box was fun to go
through and when I thought I was done I
wasn't when you go into the second layer
there's even more we've also got a hard
carrying case for travel a polishing
pouch to keep these guys in tip-top
shape and since the cables are
detachable you'll get to a blue one with
an inline remote and a black standard
version now on to the most important
part the sound of course these sound
good or they wouldn't be on the list and
they're pretty basically which I'm a
huge fan of and they've also got a great
sound stage for instrument separation
these are definitely where the
for anyone trying to take their sound
seriously and they better be since
they've got a pretty hefty price tag
now onto another recommendation from
Mike the RHA s500 I now these I'm a huge
fan of since you're getting the most
bang for your buck at only 50 bucks
you're getting a solid build and
dependable sound there's something about
it's simple and clean design that sits
pretty well with me it has a metal
housing for the ear tips that gives it a
premium feel and a black braided cable
with an inline remote as you'd expect
from RHA you also get quite a few earbud
options so you can get the right fit
with a simple design like this it's
pretty effortless to pop these in and
start listening and sound wise these are
solid you get some awesome clarity and
detail but I wouldn't expect a ton of
bass at 50 bucks I was really happy with
the build quality and sound and honestly
think this is an amazing value for some
of you looking to upgrade from those ear
pods next up we've got the Sennheiser
momentum in years it's no surprise that
this made the list again as it lives up
to the Sennheiser reputation as I
mentioned in the last top 5 these their
buds work well with a variety of genres
with his smooth vocals and dynamic sound
now the bass is pretty tight and
controlled here so I wouldn't expect too
much of it but it still offers a really
nice experience not only does it sound
good but it also looks good it has a
black and red color scheme and curved
ear tips designed to fit snugly into
your ear and directly deliver that
awesome sound and it's got a
polycarbonate and stainless steel
housing so it's going to be pretty
durable
now there's two great things I like
about these first being that you can
find these on Amazon for about 60 bucks
and the second being that you can choose
between an iOS or Android version so you
can use them with whatever phone that
you're rocking unless it's Windows and
last but not least we have the j-bird X
twos Unity's were coming these were
super popular when they came out and
completely worth the height now these
are a pair of Bluetooth earbuds and
there's something about Bluetooth
earbuds that's so liberating they're
super portable and there's no need to
worry about dangling cables or feeling
like you're attached to your phone when
you need to switch up your music and
these guys are sweat proof so they'll be
your best friend when you're heading
the gym and you guessed it the sound is
great even though their Bluetooth they
don't take a backseat to any of the
wired ones on this list bass lovers are
gonna have a good time with this thing
and when it comes to workout your buds
that's a good thing
these perform well in and out the gym
and have done well with any genre I do
have them these have a solid eight hours
of battery life and since they're
bluetooth I means their iPhone 7 ready
you can find these on Amazon for about
150 and at that price I think it's a
steal now we just went through a list of
five awesome hair buds and you know what
I think I'll give away a pair I'll be
doing a giveaway over on Instagram where
one lucky winner and a friend will be
able to pick and win any of the ear buds
on this list and take it home so
hopefully you guys enjoyed a huge shout
out to my boy Mike for sending over his
recommendations if you guys want to
check out his stuff I'll of course have
links down below in the description and
I also have links down below to the
giveaway details so check that out as
well and I'll catch you guys in the next
one
till then it's your average consumer
