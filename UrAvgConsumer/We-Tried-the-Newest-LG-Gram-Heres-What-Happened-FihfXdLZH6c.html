consumer and you know Harry hello and
today we are going to be checking out
2018 LG Graham huge shout out Z for
sponsoring today's video and for sending
me something I never gets that thing so
thanks lucky you but today we are going
to be taking it out into the real world
but first we're gonna unbox it are you
late I'm an expert I'm just gonna breeze
through a 15.6 inch laptop yes one thing
I love about the Grahams the LG Grahams
are super lightweight but they're still
durable so if you're like me you just
throw your laptop in your bag no case
you should be fine alright so besides
the laptop we've also got our power
adapter plug this guy into the wall give
you a laptop some juice and we've got
our Ethernet adapter so that you can
plug this up to an Ethernet cable this
USB type-c oh yeah pretty much that's
all you get in the box lightweight
laptop lightweight unboxing for use now
in terms of the specs between ours oho
oh that's cute like clock here says 15
is 13 so pretty much at the same except
you have a full on I also have a
Thunderball 3 port which is something
you don't have yeah I think I wouldn't
need that though I never connect any of
my laptops to an external monitor yeah I
do so that's great for me also this they
both have fingerprint scanners yeah
which are on the actual power button
yeah the logical place to put a
fingerprint scanner I think mine is a
bit more specked out because it is the
larger laptop but okay but other than
that pretty much the same well so let's
get to the fun part unless you take this
thing out into the real world and see
how it works so obviously we were very
impressed when we held the LG gram with
the unboxing but I think you could
really appreciate how light it is when
you're actually using it so here it is
in my purse so I guess we won't see it
poking out but this is it in my purse I
could easily throw it in my purse throw
it on my shoulder is super super light
now that's different from my other
laptop I have a laptop and it's 13
inches also but it's super heavy and I
and not use it with my bags at all
because it digs into my shoulders so I
have to resort to an ugly backpack at
least at this I could like you know so
what kind of cute and not have my
shoulder hurting me honestly I'm just
surprised you can fit anything else in
that bag even though I'm not carrying
some purse every day you guys know how I
am about my backpack and how crazy heavy
they get so it's kind of nice to have
something light for a change
alright guys so something that's
actually pretty exciting to me about the
LG gram is the fact that it's going to
make this backpack which is historically
very very heavy for me it shouldn't make
it much much lighter to carry around now
comparing this to some of the stuff I
typically use it is a major oh I don't
even want to mess around with this it is
a major major difference I feel like
this is nothing this is heavy and we're
gonna see how it does so I've got it in
here and let's see this is nothing guys
oh that's nice that's nice I don't
usually complain about having a heavy
backpack because that's how I do it but
I gotta say the grass is kinda green the
guys he's nice and I only was i
impressed by how light it was you're
gonna hear that a lot but I was also
happy that I can just work with him
outside and direct sunlight with no
problem okay so come and seen I'm in the
car getting some work done but I wanted
to show you guys this really quickly
because even in direct sunlight I'm
still able to see the screen it's bright
enough and I'm able to do all my tasks
without any kind of like distraction
from the Sun or anything like that so if
you're a commuter someone constantly on
the go even if you're someone constantly
on the go you'll be fine with this and
be able to do your work really easily
yeah that kind of brightness is great
for outdoor use so if you're someone who
likes to get work done outside this is
definitely a good thing and obviously
guys I cannot stress enough how
comfortable it was working with the
Graham I'm not too good at bracelet
likes to do work at a desk or anything
like that I like to be on a couch
you know just kind of comfortable with
it and the grand made it pretty easy to
do that so in this next clip you're
gonna see me it's kind of like not the
best quality so don't judge because I
have to shoot at night but I had to show
you guys just how comfortable was to use
it in bed hey guys it is like 12:00 in
the morning and if you guys and see that
I'm on Pinterest Jed and I actually just
bought a house so it's pretty empty in
here as you can see so it's only right
that I'm on Pinterest you know okay some
design ideas and all that stuff here's
Jeff
knocked out he's probably gonna kill me
when he sees this but you know I gotta
put my blast oh and we ran on an air bag
guys so no judgments you know you guys
but yeah I decide to plot the camera
because I never this is a very rare
sight I never ever have laptops in bed
with me I don't like having them they're
too heavy it's just like just not fun
I'm using my phone doing this stuff but
you know this grin was actually nice to
have in bed um since it's so light I
know we keep harping on that but it is
and it makes it easier to to have in bed
and it's also nice having the bigger
screen so this is actually a situation
where I'm not opting for my phone and
I'm not mad at it so yeah I just want to
show you guys that since I know Joe and
I are doing like the real world usage
right now and this is a perfect example
of how you know it's nice to use and
it's a backlit keyboard which is
definitely a plus since it's darken Jed
does not like a bunch of lights on now
all right did a great job testing on
some of the features of the 13 inch
model and the 15 inch model but I want
to talk a bit more about the specs and
some of those features that you won't
see on the 13-inch model like the
Thunderbolt 3 port now one of the
differences between the LG Graham 15
inch versus the 13 inch is the inclusion
of a Thunderbolt 3 port and I've
actually got this one hooked up to this
monitor right here this is the LG
ultrafine 5k monitor I've always been a
fan of these displays but it's just nice
to see that it also works with this I
don't have a lot of computers that do so
it's just nice to have
I have Adobe Premiere Pro open right now
and one thing that I'm actually liking
on the performance side of things is
that it's actually able to play this
footage with a few effects and
transitions just to mess around with it
and it's doing it pretty well it's doing
at a half resolution which is actually
pretty okay for 4k video files so I'm
liking that right now
now another thing that makes the LG
Graham 15 a bit different is the
inclusion of this and
had here on the side it does switch up
your keyboard quite a bit it does feel a
bit more cramped to me but having access
to this as a banks bonus I've used a ton
of 15-inch laptops and none of them
feature this here so it is a nice bonus
to have there is a slight learning curve
so you will it will take some getting
used to but overall I do prefer to have
this year than not and as you can see if
you want to be able to have this whole
setup with your laptop like I do then
the 15 inch model can definitely deliver
on that but if you want to have
something a bit more simple like re the
13-inch model works just fine alright
guys so right now I've got on some
fortnight you know I had to do it you
this isn't a dedicated gaming laptop I
wouldn't try to play anything hardcore
on it but if you want to play something
casual like fortnight you can definitely
do that here now this isn't on the
highest settings or anything there's
probably around medium settings I think
this gives us a pretty nice in-between
of smooth gameplay and decent decent
look 76th place that lasted no time but
yeah guys as you can see it's still
pretty smooth we can play just fine
casual gaming definitely what you can do
here nothing too serious
and one welcome change of the new LG
Graham is the webcam is actually placed
at the top so that is the more
traditional spot it's easier to make
that eye contact rather than it being at
the bottom so this is a better spot and
this is actually the webcam right now so
you guys can see the quality and the
audio that you get from it and while I
have you guys here let's talk a little
bit about the battery life this Graham
can get up to 16 hours of battery life
me personally I got around 8 to 9 you
guys know me I got the screen on full
brightness I'm playing my games I'm
doing all kinds of stuff on this so if
you do less intensive things your
mileage may vary and as with most
laptops you're gonna be able to
customize the specs of your device both
of our shared the same processor while I
have 16 gigs of ram I already had eight
add one terabyte of storage while she
had 256 but they actually worked out
perfectly for what we use on the
everyday basis I read there's a lot more
web browsing and emailing and stuff like
that
pretty simple task while for me I want
to be able to play games and do some of
my work overall guys I think it's safe
to say that we like the LG brand yeah
and I have to say I really do like it
there are three different models in the
13.3 the 14-inch 15.6 yes so you get to
choose your flavor
whatever size works best for you you
have that option which upgrade and I'm
gonna have a person who's like gonna go
out and buy a super spectat laptop that
I'm not gonna use so I do like if there
are other models like a 13-inch it
doesn't have many all the spec dog
things that his has but it has
everything that I need for myself at a
lower price tag but that pretty much
wraps it up for this video guys let us
know if you want to see a one month
later video
with us just using it completely for an
entire month oh yeah let us know if you
guys are interested in that and we'll
catch you in the next one till then it's
your average consumer and Ari peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
