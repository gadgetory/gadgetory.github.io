home security system this little guy
uses Wi-Fi and an HD camera to stream
live feed of your home straight to your
iOS device it also features an air
quality sensor which isn't something
most of us keep in mind when it comes to
our homes it comes in a compact design
that allows you to place it pretty much
anywhere and thankfully this looks
pretty good and doesn't scream security
cam like some of its competition which
includes the popular drop cam
it's packin a 5 megapixel sensor and
shoots at 1080p at up to 30 frames per
second it's a wide-angle camera so
you'll be able to get a full view of the
room you place it in and it comes with a
magnetic base which makes it pretty
poseable and allows you to get different
angles depending on how you want to
place it setting it up is pretty quick
so you'll be able to get this up and
running within a few minutes and as I
mentioned this is a Wi-Fi based camera
but you are able to plug it in with an
ethernet cable for a more solid
connection another bonus I saw with this
over the Dropcam this is pretty
important since you'll be streaming live
1080p footage and on Wi-Fi you might not
always get the best quality since this
is a security camera it will alert you
to any noise the home picks up as well
as motion and any changes in air quality
and to my surprise they even have an app
for the Apple watch so if any strange
things are happening at home you get a
few snaps sent to your watch letting you
know what's going on you can control the
frequency of the alerts sent to you
within the settings menu and you can
also use the Withings home app to go
back and take a look at any of the
alerts sent during the day in the
journal section right under the live
feed it stores up to two days worth of
activity but you can increase that if
you want Withings offers a cloud video
recording plan that allows you to start
the seven days of activities and alerts
Dropcam has similar features but that's
a pretty expensive paid service while
Withings offers it for free as its alone
its beta phase you'll also find a
built-in speaker and microphone for
two-way communication from your device
to the home itself hey get off my phone
and as I mentioned earlier one of the
things that makes Withings a little more
interesting than other security cams
is its built-in air quality sensor and
to be honest this isn't something I
really thought about before getting my
hands on this but to some of you who are
more health conscious or maybe have some
young ones to think about this could be
a pretty awesome feature and since this
thing is running 24 hours a day you've
also got night vision so you can keep
tabs no matter the time there's usually
a little bit of light on in my office
mostly by these LEDs and I tend to like
that more than the night vision the
camera is good enough to use that small
bit of light to show everything going on
in here and it just gave more detail
than it did with night vision now it's
got all these features but you're
probably wondering about the performance
image quality was pretty decent but
don't expect your feet to be super
crispy I was actually impressed by the
Auto enhanced feature when zooming in it
turned a blurry image into something
viewable within seconds you can also
snap pictures whenever you like if you
want to take notice something going on
at the moment and I found those images
to be super clear interestingly enough
you can use this as a baby monitor or a
nanny cam
so if your baby's having trouble
sleeping you can set a timer that will
play a lullaby for the duration that you
pick and it's also got these lights at
the base of the home when you're using
this feature and it'll play random
colors or you can still like the solid
color of your choice all in all I was
happy with the Withings home and I'm
pretty glad I added it to my office
considering the value of all the things
that I have in here
it's pretty nice to be able to monitor
and see what's going on throughout the
day if you're looking for a pretty cool
way to keep tabs on your home or baby I
definitely recommend this as a solution
