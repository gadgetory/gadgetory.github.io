consumer and today I've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the v-moda crossfade
m100 you guys have been requesting this
for quite some time now so finally got
my hands on it and here it is so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it
all right guys here we have the v-moda
crossfade m100 these are noise
cancelling headphones they're over the
ear and they're folding they've got a
metal designed so a lot of you guys have
been requesting this quite some bit I
have the shadow color so you can see
that right here so it's got that like
black and red look going for it so I'm
not gonna keep blabbering on too long
let's open this up so here you can see
it has a little flap and over here you
see it should sit you might not be able
to see it but it has a little scissor
here cuz you have to cut this little red
ribbon here and I don't happen to have a
scissor on me right now but I do have
the unboxing knife so let's see if I can
cut right through this see how difficult
that would be okay not too bad I can
just snip and there we go
get this little last piece off here
alright so cool alright so let's see
what we get up top oh ok so they don't
want you to return to the seller if you
have any issues they'd like for you to
return this to them let them know
customer care and of course you know
they don't want to hurt their
relationships retail store so this makes
sense I saw so republic do something
similar so that goes here let's see
opening it up from the top we've got
this phone a little piece up here 6 star
ok and
we've got the case and that's about it
that's inside ok so put this to the side
I think there's a little something else
in here so it's got some more stuff
pretty cool give you a little info about
other things that they have like boom
mics coil cables things like that
different ear cups so we can put all of
this stuff back in the box and here we
have it now I gotta say guys this is a
tiny tiny carrying case like look at
this it's not the flattest or anything
which I wouldn't expect but this is tiny
this is a small footprint it's not going
to be taking up too much room anywhere
so that's cool we'll move that out the
way and alright let's open this up it's
a hard shell case as v-moda and of
course it has the clip so you can strap
it onto a book bag or something unzip it
and let's see here boom there you go
this is this is very nice I must admit
I'm a sucker for packaging myself and
presentation here is great I'm at the
top we have a one 1/4 inch adapter and
we have the cables
I believe so here we have the cables and
you know what I'm gonna turn up the
brightness so you guys can see what this
looks like better alright so that should
help out a ton sorry for not having this
on earlier but here we are this is the
cable now the cable has like a fabric to
it ok is there multiple cables here no
ok so it's black and red I'll give you
guys a close-up of it right now alright
guys and here we have it this is the
input for the m100 and I really do like
this design I'm a fan of these kinds of
designs where it's raised instead of
just a straight L kind of like the beats
have because that means you can use
these with more cell phone cases or
mobile device cases and you guys can see
here it's black and red all around
and you have this little portion as well
I'm not too sure this is for maybe the
boom mic or something I'm not too sure
but you have this little extra piece
maybe the daisy chain okay that might be
it this is the cable we're going to toss
toss this to the side it's very long too
so I'll put the step aside and see what
else is inside here and now to the
actual headphones here they go
these are tiny these at least they look
tiny and if you still look inside of the
case you can see there's another little
portion here that has I guess some more
cables so we're gonna pluck this out so
now you have a black cable here and this
cable has an inline remote so that's
pretty cool so that goes there as well
and here it is guys is the case like
little black and burgundy ish color
looks really nice too a threaded cranium
so we're gonna put this to the side now
and here are the headphones themselves
and I must say I'm really liking the
design and there we go boom so here we
are this is pretty cool it's very sleek
looking this is a foldable so it can
fold inside like this as well this is
tiny guys these aren't this is really
surprising just how small these can
really get of course we have some
plastic on the side so we'll take that
off and there you go I gotta say guys I
gotta give it up to them these looks
really really good
umm and you're supposed to be able to
bend these all kinds of crazy ways
they're not quite so Republic but I
don't want to take my chances and bend
them too far but this looks really good
guys the quality on this is nice arm
that's about it for this unboxing guys
this is it just really interesting
design it's got these little cables
sticking out on the sides really good
stuff feels very nice both really high
quality the ear cuffs feel very soft so
it's going to be interesting to see
these are over ear headphones and that's
about it for this unboxing guys
hopefully you enjoyed it I'm gonna have
a review girlfriend test and if you want
to see some comparisons let me know what
- what you want to see compared to and
that's about it
