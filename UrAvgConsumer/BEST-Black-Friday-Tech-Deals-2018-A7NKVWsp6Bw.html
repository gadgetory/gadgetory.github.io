and it is almost Black Friday time so
it's time to finally pop those wallets
and buy that tech you've been eyeing for
the low-low but we're gonna kickstart
this list with a Playstation 4 slim
bundles with spider-man for 200 bucks a
Playstation 4 slim one terabyte cost
three hundred dollars but you're getting
$100 off here and a free game so that's
some awesome savings and spider-man is a
great game so that is one you definitely
don't want to miss out on it's gonna be
available at Gamestop I think Amazon and
a bunch of other places so we'll have
this one link down below but if you're
looking for a PlayStation 4 Pro there's
also a bundle with Red Dead Redemption
going for 400 bucks and a one terabyte
drive over at Gamestop and Best Buy for
just four hundred bucks so it's
basically like getting the Red Dead
Redemption for free that's a really good
game that a lot of people are going
crazy about I haven't played it but it's
getting a lot of good praise so it's
nice to have that included but moving on
now you know we got to talk about Xbox
and the Xbox 1s is actually on sale for
200 bucks just like that ps4 slim but
it's bundled with minecraft but if you
guys buy it over at Target you also get
a $20 gift card that you can put towards
anything at Target so that's even more
savings there but if you need more power
over 9,000 that we've got the Xbox one X
and this is gonna be on sale for 4:29
with a fallout 76 bundle am i right now
yes ah and you'll be able to pick that
up for for $29.99 which is $70 less than
a regular Xbox one X and you get follow
76 but if you just want the straight-up
Xbox one X you can find it for 400 bucks
over on Amazon which is a hundred
dollars less than the normal price but
maybe you don't need a brand new console
you just might need some new controllers
well the DualShock 4 controller as well
as the Xbox one controller are both on
sale for 40 bucks at various places of
course have them all linked down below
but you can get these for 40 bucks
versus the 60 bucks that they typically
cost and if you don't need any hardware
you just need some games
GameStop actually has a sale for a ton
of games that are only going for 27
bucks which is a really nice savings
from Assassin's Creed Odyssey NBA 2k 19
fifa 19 and they even have like god of
war for 17 dollars that is insane I
don't have God
yeah and this is the time for me to
actually get it $17 it's practically
free a meal versus like putting in
ninety hours or a hundred hours all
right
I already says it's not practically free
but it's cheap I've got some information
from a somewhat reliable source that you
can get a Nintendo switch bundled with
Mario Kart 8 deluxe for 300 bucks over
at Game Stop and it's in stores so
you'll be able to get a $50 gift card as
well so that's a 410 dollar value for
just 300 bucks yeah that is a really
really good deal and if you go in stores
and it's not there you were just too
late now let's move on to some Apple
products you didn't expect them to be on
the list did you but B&amp;amp;H is actually
gonna have a ton of sales on different
Apple products lots of macbook stuff
some of the ones that stood out to me
were a 15-inch MacBook from 2018 for 250
dollars off and also 2017 for 650
dollars off which is just insane for an
Apple product and they even have the
13-inch model which you'll be able to
save about 400 bucks on so I have all of
those linked down below in the
description so if you guys have been
interested in picking up a macbook of
some sort now is the time and default
got touched bars in case you were
wondering not to mention they also have
the smaller version of the Apple watch
Series three for 270 9.99
which is $100 off even though it's not
the latest version that is still a very
very good SmartWatch so if you guys have
been looking for the Apple watch but for
a little low you know get it now and now
of course we've got some surface
products right here we have the surface
book 2 which is going to be going on
sale on Amazon and Best Buy
you're gonna be able to save around 300
bucks for the 13-inch model I really
really enjoy the surface book 2 this
thing can turn into a tablet it can
detach it's awesome so this is
definitely a good buy but if you're
looking for something a little more
traditional we've also got the surface
laptop - now the surface laptop - is the
newer laptop that just came out it is
extreme comfortable to type on super
lightweight very very nice laptop and
you're gonna be able to save around 300
bucks on this one as well and there's
also going to be some savings over on
Dean
some store so if you guys want to know
what Microsoft has got going on
definitely check the links down below
but if you like the surface pro bit more
than the traditional laptops there's
gonna be a deal on the surface pro six
there's actually gonna be a bundle for
the surface pro six and a type cover
keyboard and that one you're gonna be
able to save around 300 bucks or so
which basically makes the type cover
free and you still get some off of the
surface pro so now is the absolute best
time to pick up one of those now you
guys know I'm a big headphone guy so we
got to talk about some headphones and
surprisingly the sony WH 1000 X Mark
twos are going on sale for just 200
bucks and these are a premium pair of
headphones bluetooth headphones with a
ton of features they sound great and I
absolutely recommend these and yes I
know the newer version is already out
but if you're somebody who likes to save
some money this is definitely a really
good buy these are premium pair of
headphones and even though this is in
the higher price range $200 is still a
very very good deal for these now if you
want something a little bit more
mainstream these is actually having a
sale the Beats Studio 3 Wireless are
actually going on sale for two $79.99
which is $70 off the original price and
actually really like these they're very
comfortable pieces of improve their
sound quite a bit so this is actually a
really good deal it is a bit more
expensive still but it does have some
benefits for those of you who are using
Apple devices this includes the w1 chip
as well as the ones that we're gonna
talk about here and with that you'll
leave it up and then with all of your
Apple devices very easily and there's
actually the porcelain rose version is
that what it's called and that one is
going for 210 so that is even cheaper
than the regular ones so if you don't
care about the color and you just want
to look at the price that is the one to
get but that one's only going for 210
dollars which is a really good deal but
if you want something a bit smaller
there's also the beats solo wireless
breeze these are going to go for two
hundred and forty bucks there's
typically go for three hundred but these
are the smaller on-ear versions that
come in a little bit cheaper than the
studio wireless threes now if you want
earbuds they've also got the beats X
which I personally use on a daily basis
these are only going for a hundred bucks
now and it's not really a Black Friday
deal I've just been seeing them for 100
bucks
everywhere which i think is a really
good price for them and it also includes
the W
 like the bigger ones over here so
this is definitely a good buy as well
and with all these headphones you're
gonna get three months free of Apple
music of course Apple owns beats so it
only makes sense and if you're more of a
Bose kind of person the QC 35 mark twos
are actually on sale on Dells website I
know a lot of people love to buy it both
especially when they're traveling so
this is a pretty good deal now let's
talk some phones first up we've got the
pixel three and the pixel three XL these
are gonna be $200 off over at Best Buy
and Target if you're looking for the
best camera on a phone ever pixel three
XL baby this is the way to go now also
the galaxy line is going to be on sale
so whether you want a galaxy s 9s 9 plus
or maybe even a note 9 that is going to
be $200 off the entire line now to find
the galaxy products on sale you're gonna
want to go to Amazon
vnh or Samsung's actual website and last
but not least the iPhone 10s and 10's
max now for the iPhone 10s and 10's max
if you go for a new plan over at Sprint
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T you're gonna be able to
save 250 bucks
no t-mobile but for those other carriers
you're gonna be able to save that much
money now let's talk about TVs the most
sought-out product on Black Friday and
first up we've got this insane TV that I
didn't even know existed to Samsung 82
inch television as a cue LED television
for three thousand dollars which is
actually fifteen hundred dollars off it
originally cost four thousand five
hundred but if you need a ridiculous big
TV and you want to save over $1000 on it
this is the one you want to look at
Samsung's also got a 75 inch TV for two
thousand dollars $1000 off the original
three thousand dollar price tag so again
if you want a really really massive
television two thousand dollars it's not
a bad deal especially coming from
Samsung but if you're not just looking
for sizing you want one of their higher
quality Q LED TVs they have a 65 inch
going for 2,300 bucks which is $500 off
the original price but if you've been
looking for an OLED TV from LG they've
actually got a sale going on at Best Buy
for twenty five hundred and seventy two
twenty eight hundred dollars at a
typical cost so you save around three
hundred dollars and let me tell you guys
OLED TVs are nice now that's all the
expensive stuff but if you want to save
some
money they got a 32-inch Samsung TV a
1080p smart TV for 198 bucks not the
biggest in the world but it's not
expensive either
and for those fifty dollars more you can
get a 4k 43 inch TV from Samsung and I'm
telling you guys
215 bucks for a 4k 43 inch TV that's a
good deal but if you love you some LG
instead they also have a 4k 43 inch TV
but it's $20 more but Samsung has also
got this really crazy 4k 50-inch TV for
327 50 inches 4k saying you got that for
around 300 bucks I'd walk away from
buying Friday feeling pretty happy about
that they've also got a bunch of other
deals and I'll make sure to have them
linked down below since there's a ton of
deals on TVs everywhere and next up
we've got some smart home stuff the
Google home Mini is going for 25 bucks
that is really cheap for that kind of
product it is an awesome awesome voice
assistant and going for 25 bucks is a
steal there's also the Google home hub
which is also a voice assistant with a
built-in screen and that one is $50 off
making it just a hundred bucks which is
also a really good value but one of my
favorite voice assistants that offer a
ton of functionality is actually the
Amazon fire TV cube this thing is
basically an Amazon echo that connects
to your TV and completely controls it it
offers a lot of versatility when it
comes to controlling your TV and
throwing shows on without having to
touch a remote at all so I really really
like the fire TV cube and it's going for
60 bucks which is 50% off and usually
goes for 120 60 dollars for that kind of
device so good and if you want to get
some smart lights into your home don't
you actually has their starter kit for
$70 off it's the way to get it all
started obviously but it's the nice way
to introduce smart lighting into your
home and we all know Philips you usually
the way to go but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed this list of Black Friday deals
I'll try to have this list be updated as
much as possible so as I hear about new
deals there might be things I didn't
even mention in this video down below in
the description so be sure to check that
out but that's about it for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guy girl that goes if your
thumbs up subscribe all that good stuff
