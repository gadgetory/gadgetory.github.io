consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the Sennheiser game zero
PC gaming headset so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it
wow wow wow
and all right guys here we have the game
zero PC gaming headset from Sennheiser
and as you guys can see this is an
awesome looking headset now this is for
PC use but that's not going to stop me
from you trying it with my PlayStation 4
and Xbox one so I'm definitely give
those a try but here it is around the
box it gives you some more details about
the actual headset it's a pretty nice
looking box actually but um let's get it
open
I'll show you guys what you get inside
so if we can just pull off the top
before there we go so we can put this
over here and pop this open and boom so
this also does come with a carrying case
and this looks pretty awesome already
some very nice packaging hats off to
Sennheiser so we can put this to the
side and that's pretty much all you get
in the box
there's probably more stuff inside of
the actual case so let's open this up
alright there we go
and alright so now we've got that out
the way here it is guys now this is a
really awesome case it's got this nice
little handle so you can travel with it
I'm not sure how many of you are going
to be traveling with a gaming headset
but um this is a really nice touch
nonetheless and this is a very durable
case as you guys can hear it very solid
so let's get to opening it see what we
get inside and boom Wow okay
I like this already guys this looks
amazing this looks really good on the
top just has this little piece here and
it has a little pouch so if you want to
carry tables or any other accessories
you can definitely do that there um boom
this is it guys and I must say I'm
impressed so far it feels really good
umm it looks nice there
black on red is just amazing look so if
you're a fan of black and red this will
definitely do it for you I'm a huge fan
myself so this works so let's get some
of this foam off see how we get that out
of here alright so boom and then we've
got a little bit of plastic on the boom
mic so let's get this off and yeah I
think that's about all there is to it so
we can put the case to the side now have
that bear and let's take a good look at
this
so these ear cups are huge guys really
huge they're going to surround your
whole ear for short no matter what size
ears you have if whether you're you know
you got some really tiny ears or your
Dumbo this is going to work just fine
for you and um seems like it has a lot
of maneuverability you can fold it up
you can move the mic a bit so this is
really good this can really fold up well
it's really nice some of the features
that they stay they have is um the mic
when you move it up it can automatically
mute so that's really nice this is act
this is actually a noise cancelling mic
so there's no background noise that's
supposed to show up when you're you know
talking to someone in your party so this
is really cool stuff and you do have
volume controls on the ear cups just
like you do have a mute function with
the boom mic so that's really cool too
and this is a leatherette material for
the ear cups and it feels really nice
this is going to be extremely
comfortable I can tell already um the
biggest aircraft I've ever seen we're
probably on the audio technica ath M 50s
but this looks like it has a beat for
sure a really big oval shape nice little
red on the inside
design-wise material wise this feels
amazing guys this definitely feels very
premium the headband has a nice padding
cushion on top so that's really nice of
course if you have a bigger head like me
you can actually adjust the length of
the headband so that works well so this
does have a threaded cable and when we
open this thing up then this goes this
is about forever in length but it's
actually three meters so that's very
long so if you're going to be a far
away from your source you'll have no
problem still being able to hear your
audio is very very long cable but it is
a nice threaded cable so it feels very
adorable very nice it has two inputs one
for your microphone and one for your
headphone so like I said this is for PC
gaming so it has two inputs and pretty
much this is it guys this is a really
awesome looking headset but so far I'm
very impressed guys the ridges feel
really nice on the sides it's actually a
nice like rubber ish material it feels
really good guys um I'm gonna have
pricing and availability down below in
the description so definitely check that
out so that pretty much wraps up this
unboxing guys if you enjoyed it

so next time is your average consumer
one for the actual headphones and one
for the mic so you've got two of those
and this is for PC game damn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
