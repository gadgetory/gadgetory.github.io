want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys it's your average consumer today
I'm going to be reviewing the beats by
dre studios
alright let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the beats studios and here we have
the traveling case that come with it now
the traveling case is pretty nice it's a
hardshell case as you can see and it um
it's pretty good for protection and
travel it's a little on the large side
but you know the headphones are on the
large side as well so can't really fault
them for that but you know these are
good I like that it comes with a little
clip here so that you can just like
attach it to your I don't know your
bookbag or something like that and it
just makes traveling with the beats a
lot easier if you don't want it around
your neck
alright so now onto the beats studios
these are a really nice pair of
headphones and they really do feel like
a high quality item when you have these
when you see these in person you can
tell that it's made of some decent
material and that is just some pretty
decent quality as far as the build is
concerned you can see the little chrome
finish here and the top has a really
nice padding up for the headband so this
really does feel like a high quality
item and it does feel it seems like it
can last you can bend it pretty well
without it snapping a lot of people are
concerned about snapping the head bands
of the beads I wouldn't bring these out
as far as the street buy 50 but these do
seem to be some pretty decent quality um
it's really of course it's stylish
people love the way the beats look I
like the way it looks these personally
though the studios themselves they're a
little on the bigger side to me I
personally don't really like how big
they are my favorite pair of headphones
buy beats are the beats Wireless
which are a tad bigger than the solo HDS
and in comparison to them you can see
how big the cups are you can see how
long the cups here and compared compared
to the wireless right here so you got
quite some size on these headphones but
they seem but they're you know they do
their job and as far as delivering on
sound quality but it's just Mountain
Greg would be the size of them and as
far as you know ripes or whatever the
only other gripe would be the fact that
these headphones do not work if you
don't have the little switch on and if I
would have liked if the switch would
just turn on noise canceling but it's to
turn on the headphones themselves if you
don't have it on the headphones won't
work if the battery dies the headphones
won't work so that's really not a good
thing for these headphones a lot of
headphones you just want to be able to
plug it in and go and not have to worry
about battery life but these
unfortunately do not function without
the battery so that's definitely
something to keep in mind I always
happen to forget that the switches on
and it always makes me worry that I'm
draining the life out of the battery
that's inside there but so far to be
honest it's everything every time I've
done that the battery is still going I
haven't had to change it yet so
obviously it's not using too much
battery but it's just a little problem
when you have to sit there and worry
about how much battery you have left
without really knowing what's going on
with that but those are like the only
real gripes I have with the studios as
far as the way it looks and how it
functions um when it comes to sound
quality now the Beats Studios deliver on
some great sound quality I it's really
what you would expect from a 3.3 hundred
dollar pair of headphones if you're a
bass lover these really will do the
trick for you
they deliver with a lot of bass um and
it does a really good job isolating
sounds on the
outside with noise canceling feature and
it really helps you to just focus on the
music and really just tune out
everything else and really just listen
to the music so it sounds great you're
into things like hip-hop and dubstep
things with a lot of bass these will
definitely do a great great thing for
you by canceling everything out and just
let the bass blast in your ears so if
you're not really looking to for bass
heavy headphones maybe this might not be
what you want because these really do
have a lot of bass some people have
complained that the bass drowns out all
the other sounds like it makes the music
not sound as good I don't think that I
think the music sounds wonderful with
these so even with the bass or not these
sounds really great to me and to the
type of music I listen to which is like
you know hip-hop and you know R&amp;amp;B stuff
like that so I really think this does
deliver on the whole good sound quality
thing my only problem with the sound
though would be if you increase the
volume too high people will definitely
hear you and hear people definitely hear
your music
I'm going to have a sound leak test that
shows you just how much the sound leaks
at comfortable volume I was told that
people can hear my music and pretty
clearly at that they could hear lyrics
and everything so that's not even that a
loud volume that's just at a comfortable
volume so that's definitely something to
keep in mind if you don't want if you're
going to be somewhere where there's
going to be a lot of people and you
don't want to disturb them then maybe
these might not be the ones for you
because they do leak a lot it's just
really bad but the sound still sounds
great to you but it'll probably sound
pretty great to other people to buy
horror around you so overall guys that's
my review for the beats Studios they're
really great pair of headphones and they
offer some really great sound quality
now I know there are people who'll say
that you can get better for less but it
goes a little bit beyond just like sound
quality and stuff like that it's also
really stylish and if you like the beats
brand I say go for it
so just on the keep in mind my only
grabs with these were the fact that they
do leak a lot and I don't like the fact
that with these off you won't be able to
listen to music so if you have like a
dead battery or you just have to switch
off you won't be able to listen to music
you can't just plug and play so that's
just a little problem for me and it's
also just a little inconvenient when you
forget to turn off the switch and then
it kills your battery so that's
something also to keep in mind also
these are a bit on the bigger side so
make sure when you're about to purchase
these you look for a demo version see if
you're ok with the size and if you're
okay that I say go for it the sound
quality is great it does a really good
job at isolating sounds from the outside
so you really can just focus on the
headphones themselves and pretty much
that's all there is to the beats studios
guys if you're interested I say go for
it just keep those things little things
I said in mind and that's about it guys
