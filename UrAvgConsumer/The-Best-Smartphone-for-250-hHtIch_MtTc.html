and today we're gonna be checking out
the brand new honor 6 X now honor was
cool enough to sponsor today's video and
send one of these out for me to try and
let you guys know what you can expect
from it now guys the first thing I want
to talk about is the price you can find
this phone for 250 bucks and I think
there's gonna be about 4 flash sales
where you can find it for 200
that's insane now typically when I hear
phone is in the $200 price range I
immediately think it's made out of
plastic but surprisingly the honor 6x
features an aluminum design now the
entire thing isn't made out of aluminum
but having that aluminum back definitely
helps it to feel like a much more
premium phone and while we're looking at
the back you'll notice a couple of
things that you typically see on
higher-end phones like a fingerprint
scanner as well as dual rear cameras now
when it comes to actually using the
camera you're going to be using that top
12 megapixel to capture your image
composition and the bottom one is going
to actually be a 2 megapixel that
captures the depth of field and the
craziest thing about this camera is that
it has an aperture range of F point nine
five all the way to f-16 which is a
crazy crazy range and for my camera
junkies I'm sure you'd appreciate that
this means you're gonna be able to take
in a ton of light so it should be good
for low-light photos and if you want to
have that nice depth of field effect
where you have a ton of book in the back
you're gonna be able to do that as well
and you've even got an 8 megapixel
shooter in the front so you can take
those selfies but that's good
- that mic now the only feature I see
missing here is the lack of 4k recording
but at this price you can't really
complain but that is something that's
going to be missing if you're looking
for that feature and of course we've got
to talk about the display this thing is
rocking a 5.5 inch 1080p display which
is actually very vibrant and really
sharp and of course I had to watch some
of my favorite animes on this and having
that 5.5 inch display and those nice
colors always helps with their
experience and for my spec heads
wondering what kind of power this thing
has under the hood it's running a Carin
655 octa-core chipset as well as three
gigs of RAM which is insane on a phone
this price this thing also includes 32
gigs of storage but a nice bonus here is
the fact that you also have a micro SD
card slot so you can expand the storage
if you want
a dying feature on most phone so it's
good to see it here but if you guys want
to know more about the specs I'll of
course have more details down below now
I think one of the most impressive
numbers we can talk about here is
actually the battery life this thing has
a 3300 milliamp hour battery 3340 to be
exact but that is just insane on a phone
this price I always like to hear when a
full night's over 3000 milliamp hours of
battery so seeing 3300 on here is really
really welcomed and combined with the
fact that this thing has a 1080p display
instead of something higher rest you're
not gonna have to worry about your
screen sucking up that battery life so
you're gonna be able to use it a bit
longer and in terms of software the 6x
is running a skinned version of Android
marshmallow with the emui 4.1 while this
is a skinned version of Android the UI
is pretty clean and it doesn't stem too
far away from stock Android I think the
biggest thing to take away here is that
this isn't some big premium high-end
device but it does a lot of the same
things at a much much lower price range
probably a third of what you'd pay for
your typical high-end premium smartphone
I got a couple of phones that come into
mind when I think the $200 price range
and I gotta say this one already hits
the top of that list but that's about it
for this video guys hopefully enjoyed if
you liked the idea of the honor 6x if
it's a budget smartphone that you think
works for you let me know in the
comments down below and I'll catch you
guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
