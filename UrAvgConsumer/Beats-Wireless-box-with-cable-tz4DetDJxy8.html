want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys drivers consumer this is gonna be a
really quick video on the beats Wireless
and where you should pick them up I'm
getting a lot of questions about whether
or not they're the cable is supposed to
be included with this now I purchased
this at Best Buy
so I would suggest you guys purchase it
as well because mine did come with the
cable and anyone else I know who's
purchased it from that line has had the
cable as well so I would definitely
suggest picking it up from there I don't
know what the Apple store offers I don't
know I've heard that there are boxes out
there that don't come with a que bottom
off that's an older model or what the
deal is but best buys the safe bet so I
suggest you guys getting it from there
and also if you're in a store and you
don't know if it comes with the cable or
not I'm gonna show you guys at the box
that I have and what's on it just so
that you guys can be sure what to look
for when you're actually in the store
alright so I'm gonna give you guys a
close-up of box just going to know what
to get alright guys so here's the box of
the beats Wireless I don't know what
kind of on boxes the ones without the
cord have but these are the box this is
the box that I have this is the one I
got from Best Buy with the cable now
just a tour around the box it's
everything pretty much is the same as
you would expect but I don't know if the
ones that don't come with the cable have
a flat but this one does have a flap so
you might want to look out for that also
a very important thing right here at the
bottom of the back side and the bottom
left-hand corner on the back of the box
you can see that it shows you some
images of what's included so you can see
here it comes with the case the USB
charger and the cable so you want to
check the back of the box on the left
bottom corner because it shows you right
here what's inside so pretty much this
should be all you're looking for but
just so that you guys can get an idea
of you know what the box is liked in
general make sure it's the right box it
has a flap and um pretty much this is it
so look out for that I'm gonna see if it
says anything else that will you know
kind of distinguish it um
there's no other mention of a cable
anywhere
so pretty much guys just look out for
this it'll make your life a lot easier
when you're looking I don't know if like
I said I don't know if the Apple Store
has or anywhere other retailers but just
make sure your box says that if you're
in stores and you'll know if it comes
with the cable or not alright
hope this helped you guys out a bit you
have a consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
