consumer and today we've got a showdown
between the smartest speakers you'll
come across the Apple home pot the
Amazon echo plus and the Google home max
if you're in the market for a smart
speaker you're probably going to be
looking at these guys and the reason why
we're going with the Amazon echo plus
and the Google home max is because Apple
has put a significant amount of effort
into making this a really awesome
sounding speaker so we've got to get the
best speakers that these companies
offers and see how they stack up against
the home pod and all these speakers have
built-in voice assistant that will
answer your questions do different tasks
that you ask them to
so the Amazon echo has Alexa stopped
listening I have the home pod has Siri
of course and the Google home max has
the Google assistant now I'm gonna ask
these a bunch of different questions and
kind of see what they can do so we'll
start off with the Amazon echo what time
is it
the time is 12:40 p.m. what time is it
it's 12:40 p.m. Google home what time
bub
what time is it 12:40 ok so that's
pretty much how you activate these but
now let's ask them some questions what's
the weather today in Newark it's 34
degrees with cloudy skies today you can
look for lots of clouds with a high of
35 degrees in a low of 31 degrees plot
information right there it's currently
cloudy and 35 degrees in Newark
temperatures will be fairly consistent
averaging about 35 degrees
one thing I like is that her voice
doesn't sound so robotic in Newark today
expect a high of 36 and a low of 34 but
there you have it those are the kind of
questions you'll probably be asking it
every morning every now and then right
before you step out but for some more
hard-hitting questions how many final
fantasy games were ever made I found 40
final fantasy video games including
Final Fantasy 15 Final Fantasy saw no no
no final flex are 12 stop
she was about to list all 40 how many
Final Fantasy games were created I can't
get the answer to that on home pod
how many Final Fantasy games were
created my apologies I don't understand
oh that's surprising
I'd expect Google to be able to answer
that how many Final Fantasy games were
ever made sorry I'm not sure how to help
Google you need to get it together
Lex is beating you in the search
Department what are the names of
Saturn's moons I can't get the answer to
that on home pod what are the names of
Saturn's moons here's something I found
on Wikipedia the moons of Saturn are
numerous and diverse ranging from tiny
moonlets less than one kilometer across
to the enormous Titan which is larger
than the planet Mercury 10 what are the
names of Saturn's moons Savage has moons
Titan and solidus Mimas and others okay
we got a few names out of them so Google
with the search
so look Siri wasn't able to answer at
all but I just goes to show you Siri
needs a little bit more help in the
search Department it's not fully there
yet and in our last video comparing the
echo to the Google home meaning I
already had them sing happy birthday
they both did it
Google had a little bit more soul to it
oh she got more soul but we're gonna see
if the home pod can do it too sing happy
birthday
sure absolutely ahem okay here I go
ahem hang on let me just clear my gosh
singing is harder than it looks okay
there's a lot of build up for nothing
but all right so see we decided I think
she decided to not do that now these are
also voiced assistant so you can ask
them to set reminders or even to set an
alarm things like that and they can all
do that the only weird thing is of
course home pod doesn't have the
calendar functionality yet so you can't
ask it to set any events or read your
events it was weird
Google came out with the same same
feature missing and it got it later on
of course so that's something we're
gonna have to wait and see
come to the home pod but we're gonna see
how long it takes surprise that it
didn't come out at launch all right but
now we've got to try out the music
portion these all are the best options
like I said before for each of these
companies so let's see Alexa stop it's
actually painful see she pales in
comparison to their home
guys play now the Google hum sounds
great but something that I immediately
noticed is that I wanted to move forward
like I actually hear it but when it
comes to these two it doesn't matter
what direction you're in you can be
anywhere around them they have 360 audio
so you can be anywhere and still hear
their music the same way you would no
matter where you placed it whether this
guy you've got to have it facing you in
order to hear the best quality app will
actually put in a bunch of technology
here and software to make sure that
wherever you place this you're gonna get
the best sound quality possible out of
the home pot so placement isn't is
something you have to take into
consideration
now of course musics a big part of all
of these speakers because their speakers
so there are tons of streaming apps out
there Spotify being one of the biggest
of course but Google home actually
allows you to string from a ton of
different streaming services so that's a
really good look on Google's end I think
Amazon echo really focuses on Amazon
music and Amazon Prime music I believe
it's called and even Spotify can work on
this but when it comes to the home pod
home pod uses Apple music you can be
music to it from your phone but you
can't call out to ask it to play
something from Spotify that
functionality just isn't here yet you're
gonna have to be pretty deep in the
Apple ecosystem and have Apple music to
really take advantage of all of the
controls it has if you're on Spotify
though you're probably gonna want to
look at something like these unless you
are ok we're sending music from your
phone over to the home pod but in terms
of sheer compatibility with streaming
services Google home that's where it's
at one thing to also note is that these
all have touch controls so there's a
touch panel on the top of the home pod
where you can play in pause and you kind
of use it like an inline remote it also
has the volume controls for the echo you
have a mute button as well as a little
button here that you're gonna use to
activate Alexa and it also has a little
dial at the top so you can control the
volume if you would like and for the
Google home max you've got a touch panel
at the top where you can control the
volume you can slide it up and down to
control your volume so you've got those
options now when it comes to actually
controlling the smart home these all
have smart home integration with a ton
of products out there for the Amazon
echo there are a jillion products out
there that use this and actually have
Alexa integration
as far as the google home at first it
had a really rocky start and didn't have
nearly as many compatible products as
the echo but as of today I hadn't really
find that the gap is being well closed
now Apple has the apple homekit the
products that work with this are labeled
you know home kit compatible so there
aren't as many I would say as the echo
and the Google home I say give it the
same amount of time as the Google home
has had on the market and it'll probably
catch up but it is a bit more behind as
of right now now aesthetically if I had
to choose one I think it'd be a pretty
safe bet to say I'd go with the home pod
honestly this small compact size while
still having a really great sound is a
winner for me the Google home max it is
bigger and has honestly a ton more bass
but that is because it is a bigger
device overall so you know depending on
how much space you have you can use it
like this hey you can even lie it down
if you want take it this way but it's
all up to you I think this looks the
best the Amazon echo honestly this isn't
an award winning design here it looks
like a giant speaker but it does come in
a bunch of different color options and
now the Google they're second generation
which is smaller has my fabric design so
you can choose what you want it to look
like but I'd say in terms of overall
looks though I'd have to go with this
aside though I think the black version
of this looks really really clean now
when it comes to pricing the home pot is
350 dollars which is quite a bit more
than the Amazon echo I believe this goes
for 170 right now and the Google home
max is even more expensive at $400
luckily for it though it does have a
smaller alternative with the regular
Google home which is I think about a
hundred bucks or 120 bucks and that
second generation echo is only 80 bucks
so you have cheaper options while the
home pot is the only option at 350 now
when it comes to actually picking which
one to go with you of course gonna want
to factor in budget that's what a lot of
people will put on the top of their list
but you're also gonna want to take into
consideration what these peakers are
meant to do where the home pod Apple
seems to have focused on making this a
really good sounding speaker with some
smart functionality so that's right now
you're not gonna get something that's
quite as smart as the Google home or the
Amazon echo but you will be getting a
great sounding speaker but if you're
looking for an all-out powerful music
player Google home is definitely
something you're gonna want to look into
while between the two of these I think
the Google home is a bit more powerful
but I do think the Apple home pod is a
bit on the cleaner side of things so you
wouldn't want to make that choice if you
want cleaner audio versus more loud and
powerful audio now one thing you're
going to want to take into consideration
is the ecosystem if you've got an
Android phone or even an iPhone you'll
be fine with the Google home whether
it's the Mac's or the normal one you'll
be able to use it no problem you can
actually do that with the echo as well
the echo what I really like about its
ecosystem is that you've got this the
echo dot there are tons of different
echo products and a lot of smart home
product manufacturers are making sure
their products are working with the
Amazon echo home pod itself only works
with iOS devices so you can't use it
with an Android so you got to be pretty
deep in the Apple ecosystem you can only
use Apple music to really listen to
music unless you use your iOS device to
stream music to it so that's something
to keep in mind as well but if I had to
personally choose I would probably go
Google home Mac's simply because it has
pretty good sound as well as all of the
smart features that I want to use
immediately but if I could mix and match
and make this to a Frankenstein of some
sort I would take the Google smart
assistant and all of its smartness and
take the sound quality and the design of
the home pod that would be my ideal put
Google assistant in here with all of
Apple's tech that would work perfectly
and this you know it's cheaper so
there's that but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you enjoy
let me know in the comments down below
which you would use to set up your smart
home play your music answer your
questions all the time let me know is
the comment down below and I'll catch
you guys to the next one so that is your
average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
