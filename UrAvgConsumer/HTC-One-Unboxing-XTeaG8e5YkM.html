consumer and today i've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the brand new HTC One
this was just released today and I was
lucky enough to get my hands on it so
hey let's not wasting any time let's get
right into it and all right guys here we
have the HTC One and this is a pretty
simple box it's really flat um of course
on the front you have the HTC One front
and back and in the back you have listed
specs and other information so a bit
about the specs this is running Android
with the newest sense i think its sense
5 and it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
processor and it's clocked at 1.7
gigahertz and its quad-core so this has
got some really really beefy specs as
far as the processor goes it's got a
storage capacity of 32 gigabytes it's
got two gigs of RAM so we really
shouldn't see this thing slowing down
whatsoever this thing should be really
really fast it's got a 4.7 inch screen
and it's at 1080p so that's just nuts
1080p under this small display is going
to look crazy I can't wait to see it and
it's also got what HTC is calling HTC
boomsound and that's due to its dual
speakers in the front typically you'll
find speakers in the back of the phone
or the bottom but this has two in the
front so I'm expecting that to be really
great um it's got the HTC ultrapixel
camera there's got beats audio all kinds
of crazy stuff in here but enough
blabbering let's open up this box so I'm
going to get my unboxing knife and here
we have it so it will just pop this open
and let's see a safe side to cut so we
can just get this plastic off or if that
open peel some of the song don't really
need an unboxing knife it's pretty
simple but let's get that out of the way
put this knife away and let's start to
open it well you actually do need a
knife because it's sealed on the side so
we'll have to bring this back out
and let's get the sides open there's one
and there's two now we can put unbox a
knife away and let's see flip this open
and the first thing we're greeted by of
course is the HTC One and here it is so
before we get into that let's take a
look at what else is inside the box so
let's see here please do not miss place
this label so we've got some IM yacht I
Mei numbers over there hcc VIP service
so got a couple of new things and i
bought this with tmobile so of course
they included a sim card I don't need
that but you also do get an HTC sim
ejector so I can pop this out of my old
phone and try it in this we of course
got some warranty information all that
good stuff and over here we have the
charger and the USB cable now I've seen
a couple of unboxings I'm assuming the
international version has those little
earbuds those black earbuds with the red
tips I'm not seeing that here so that's
a little disappointing but um yeah this
is pretty much it for the box pretty
standard USB cable USB stuff um I guess
I'll show you guys what it looks like
this if you if you're familiar with HTC
you know they all have the same USB wall
adapter so this is it here and this is
just a standard microUSB cable so we can
put this stuff away I'll put the sim
ejector away since I won't put my sim in
just yet get all the stuff out of the
side I think we can put the box over
here for now and here we have the phone
itself it's got this wrapping on it see
if we can peel that off okay so we'll
just peel the wrapping off
over here or actually we can slide this
out so i didn't have to peel anything
just slide it right out and boom here
you have it and i gotta say guys this
feels very very high quality this feels
like a premium phone so this is just
great it's got a nice big screen over
here i have my nexus 4 and boom so let
me give you guys a quick close up of the
one and give you guys a quick look
around it and all right guys here we
have it this is the front and up here
the first thing you'll notice is that
big camera this is a 2.1 wide-angle
camera so the front facing camera should
be really nice should be able to shoot
HD here we have the light sensors and of
course is the top speaker grill and the
bottom has a speaker grill as well an
interesting thing on this phone is that
it has an HTC logo right here which is
typically where the home button would be
but the home buttons over here and the
back buttons there I've heard a lot of
people are pressing the HTC button
thinking it'll take them home but that's
that on the side is actually the volume
rocker which is a very interesting spot
it's on the right typically phones have
it on the left but what's on the left
here is the sim card slot so this little
hole right here is where you're poking
the sim ejector you throw your sim card
in there the bottom you'll find the
microUSB cable port so you can plug in
your USB cable there to charge it or
sync it to your computer and here you'll
have the infrared and I forget what this
is going to be used for I think you can
be used as a remote but this is going to
be the infrared right here and of course
your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
of course in the back you have your four
megapixel ultrapixel camera so HTC
decided to go with low megapixels and
soup up the camera specs to get bigger
pixels and all kinds of stuff so that it
can take higher quality pictures rather
than just have a large pixel number like
13 or something and try to get more on
the quality side than just a numeric
side that both you know big numbers
bigger so they're trying to go the
opposite way here and is actually
improve on the camera itself and this is
about it off Kaka and also of course it
has Beats Audio here branding at the
bottom because this phone does have
Beats Audio and this is an aluminum body
it's a unibody design so that means
there's no taking off the back to put in
a different battery or sim card or
anything like that what you see is what
you get and this is all right here and
enough of this close up let's power this
thing on and silly me the power button
is also the infra red button so I didn't
mention that earlier this infrared
button is also the power button so HTC
quietly brilliant logo came up and this
should have a pretty fast boot time ACC
has been having fastboot for a price of
time of course you saw for a tmobile 4g
LTE over there and here we have it now
it's booted on this is the little lock
swipe it up so we'll start see if I get
on some internet here so since i don't
have my sim card in got my Wi-Fi going
Wi-Fi is connected so it's connecting to
the server not quite sure what all this
is but we're going to start from scratch
Oh skip this and I can put all this
stuff in but I'll do that afterwards and
so here it is all set up so I through
now you see we got a bunch of t mobile
stuff here I don't think there's that
much but I'm sure you'll have a ton of
t-mobile bloatware actually this doesn't
look too bad unless this is if this is
all of it it's not that bad t-mobile
good job well actually now here we are
so this is all the t-mobile bloatware
that you'll get my account t-mobile name
ID t mobile TV visual voicemail and lock
out security and this is pretty much it
guys this is a great looking phone I
just want to do a quick unboxing for you
guys I'm gonna really fully set this
thing up and then I'll give you guys a
full review
tons of test videos all kinds of good
stuff and let you guys know how it is
compared to some phones that are out
right now like the Nexus 4 iphone 5 and
we'll see how this thing compares to
those for the average consumer and all
right guys this yarbs consumer and i'll
catch you guys in the next video if you
enjoyed this unboxing please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe and i'll
catch you guys in the next one so then
