average consumer and today I've got an
unboxing for you guys of the brand new
HTC one this was just released today and
I was lucky enough to get my hands on it
so hey let's not wasting any time let's
get right into it
and all right guys here we have the HTC
One and this is a pretty simple box it's
really flat of course on the front you
have the HTC One front and back and in
the back you have listed specs and other
information so a bit about the specs
this is running Android with the newest
sense I think it's Sense 5 and it's got
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor and
that's clocked at 1.7 gigahertz and it's
quad core so this is got some really
really beefy specs as far as the
processor goes it's got a storage
capacity of 32 gigabytes it's got 2 gigs
of ram so we really shouldn't see this
thing slowing down whatsoever this thing
should be really really fast it's got a
4.7 inch screen and it's at 1080p so
that's just nuts
1080p under this small display it's
gonna look crazy I can't wait to see it
and it's also got what HTC is calling
HTC boomsound and that's due to its dual
speakers in the front typically you'll
find speakers in the back of the phone
or the bottom but this has two in the
front so I'm expecting that to be really
great
um it's got the HTC ultra pixel camera
there's got Beats Audio all kinds of
crazy stuff in here but enough
blabbering let's open up this box so I'm
gonna get my unboxing knife and here we
have it so it will just pop this open
and let's see a safe side to cut so we
can just get this plastic off lift that
open peel some of the song don't really
need an unboxing knife it's pretty
simple but let's get that out of the way
put this knife away and let's start to
open it well you actually do need a
knife because it's sealed on the side so
we'll have to bring this back
out and let's get the sides open just
one and there's two
now we can put unbox a knife or a and
let's see flip this open and the first
thing we're greeted by of course is the
HTC One and here it is so before we get
into that let's take a look at what else
is inside the box so let's see here
please do not misplace this label so
we've got some I am yacht i mei numbers
over there acc VIP service so got a
couple of new things and i bought this
with t-mobile so of course they included
a SIM card I don't need that but you
also do get an HTC sim ejector so I can
pop this out of my old phone and try it
in this but of course got some warranty
information all that good stuff and over
here we have the charger and the USB
cable now I've seen a couple of
unboxings I'm assuming the international
version has those little earbuds those
black earbuds with the red tips I'm not
seeing that here so that's a little
disappointing but yeah this is pretty
much it for the box
pretty standard USB cable USB stuff um I
guess I'll show you guys what it looks
like this is if you if you're familiar
with HTC you know they all have the same
USB wall adapter so this is it here and
this is just a standard microUSB cable
so we can put this stuff away I'll put
the sim ejector away since I won't put
my sin in just yet get all this stuff
out of the side I think we can put the
box over here for now and here we have
the phone itself it's got this wrapping
on it see if we can peel that off okay
so we'll just peel the
rapping off over here or actually we can
slide this out so I didn't have to peel
anything just slide it right out and
boom here you have it and I gotta say
guys this feels very very high quality
this feels like a premium phone so this
is just great it's got a nice big screen
over here I have my Nexus 4 and boom so
let me give you guys a quick close-up of
the one and give you guys a quick look
around it and alright guys here we have
it this is the front and up here the
first thing you'll notice is that big
camera this is a 2.1 wide-angle camera
so the front-facing camera should be
really nice should be able to shoot HD
here we have the light sensors and of
course this is the top speaker grille
and the bottom has a speaker grille as
well and an interesting thing on this
phone is that it has an HTC logo right
here which is typically where the home
button would be but the home buttons
over here and the back buttons there
I've heard a lot of people are pressing
the HTC button thinking it'll take them
home but that's that on the side is
actually the volume rocker which is a
very interesting spot it's on the right
typically phones have it on the left but
what's on the left here is the SIM card
slot so this little hole right here is
where you're poking the sim ejector you
throw your SIM card in there the bottom
you'll find the microUSB cable port so
you can plug in your USB cable there to
charge it or sync it to your computer
and here you'll have the infrared and I
forget what this is going to be used for
I think you can be used as a remote but
this is gonna be the infrared right here
and of course your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and of course in the back
you have your 4 megapixel ultrapixel
camera so HTC decided to go with low
megapixels and soup up the camera specs
to get bigger pixels and all kinds of
stuff so that it can take higher quality
pictures rather than just have a large
pixel number like 13 or something and
try to get more on the quality side than
just a numeric side
that both you know big numbers equals
bigger so they're trying to go the
opposite way here and is actually
improve on the camera itself and this is
about it okay and also of course it has
Beats Audio here branding at the bottom
because this phone does have Beats Audio
and this is an aluminum body
it's a unibody design so that means
there's no taking off the back to put in
a different battery or a SIM card or
anything like that what you see is what
you get and this is all right here and
enough of this close up let's power this
thing on instilling me the power button
is also the infrared button so I didn't
mention that earlier this infrared
button is also the power button so HTC
quietly brilliant logo came up and this
should have a pretty fast boot time ACC
has been having fast beat for quite some
time of course you saw for a t-mobile 4G
LTE over there and here we have it now
it's booted on this is the little lock
let's swipe it up so we'll start see if
I get on some internet here so since I
don't have my sim card in got my Wi-Fi
going Wi-Fi is connected so it's
connecting to the server not quite sure
what all this is but we're gonna start
from scratch I'll skip this and I can
put all this stuff in but I'll do that
afterwards and so here it is all set up
swipe through now you can see we got a
bunch of t-mobile stuff here I don't
think there's that much but I'm sure
you'll have a ton of t-mobile bloatware
actually this doesn't look too bad I
mean unless this is if this is all of it
it's not that bad t-mobile good job well
actually no here we are so this is all
the t-mobile bloatware that you'll get
my account t-mobile name ID t-mobile TV
visual voicemail and lock out security
and this is pretty much it guys this is
a great looking phone I just wanted to
do a quick unboxing for you guys I'm
gonna really fully set this thing
and then I'll give you guys a full
review tons of test videos all kinds of
good stuff
and let you guys know how it is compare
it to some phones that are out right now
like the Nexus 4 iPhone 5 and we'll see
how this thing compares to those for the
average consumer and alright guys this
is Yahoo's consumer and I'll catch you
guys in the next video if you enjoyed
this unboxing please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and I'll catch you
guys in the next one
so then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
