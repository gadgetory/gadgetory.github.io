consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at the Microsoft Surface
headphones and these actually came out
back in November but I wanted to spend
my time with it and really get to know
it since these are Microsoft's first
pair of headphones bluetooth headphones
at bat let's see how they did and of
course the first thing we've got to take
a look at is the overall design
Microsoft's done a really good job at
matching the design with the rest of the
surface products you put this thing next
to a surface book or a surface studio
and you can just see that they belong
together of course thanks to that great
aesthetic now I'll be honest with you
guys I don't think these are the best
looking headphones in the world they're
a little bit on the larger side
especially when you've got them on you
guys can see how large these ear cups
are but I've gotten used to that because
of my favorite pair of headphones have
really large ear cups as well and that
leads to amazing comfort this has some
really awesome padding it's very nice
and soft and it actually goes completely
over the ear so when you're wearing them
for long periods of time you absolutely
have no issues and it's built mainly out
of plastic but it doesn't feel cheap by
any means and the overall look isn't bad
at all
only thing that I will critique about
this overall design is the fact that it
does look a bit large and the fact that
it's not foldable it would have been
really nice if the ear cups were
foldable so you can have more storing
options but as it is right now these can
be laid down completely flat and with
the travel case that it comes with if
you're trying to throw this thing in
your backpack you're not gonna really
have any issues I just like to have the
foldable option especially at that
premium price point and I don't think
this is a design that's gonna work for
everyone but if you have surface
products this is gonna fit just right in
but in the future I would like to see
more color options the surface laptops
have a ton of color options like black
blue that burgundy so it would be really
cool to see these headphones kind of go
with that
and speaking of surface products one
thing that these headphones have going
for it is if you already owned them it
makes it extremely easy to pair so once
you power it on you'll see some options
come up in your notification section in
Windows and then you can just kind of
pair it from right there and it just
makes a really simple process kind of
like what we see with Apple and their w1
chip where you can pair a pair of ear
pods or beats to your iPhone very
quickly these kind of have that with all
the surface products with
nice and I believe Microsoft is calling
that feature swift pair and speaking of
pairing these headphones can pair with
up to 10 different devices which is just
crazy because most headphones max out at
2 now that doesn't mean you'll be gonna
be able to play music from one device
and listen to something else on another
device and you hear both at once but it
does mean that once your audio stops on
one device you can kind of pick up with
the other without having to press any
buttons or jump into any menus which i
think is just awesome and while we're
talking about features let's talk about
some of the cool ones that Microsoft has
introduced with these first things first
they've got touch panels on both sides
of the ear cups so that is really cool
because usually it's on one so you can
control it with any side whether you're
left-handed right-handed I think that's
pretty cool but to control your audio
all you have to do is tap it once to
play and pause your music double tap to
skip to the next song triple tap to go
back pretty standard stuff but if you
long press you can activate Cortana
which can download an app for or you can
just use Siri or Google assistant
depending on the device you're using and
on the right ear clip you've also got a
power button and a button to mute your
mic and you also have a USB type-c port
which is very 2018-2019 I am very happy
to see that and we'll talk more about
the battery life and charging in a
second but you also have a headphone
jack so if you don't want to use the
Bluetooth features you can always plug
this in the regular standard way which
is always nice now those are all nice
things but let's get to what makes this
headphone really special and that's the
dials on the ear cups so on the right
ear cup you have a dial where you can
control your volume so you can bring it
up to max the minimum all with this dial
but the left ear cup is where there's
some magic happening so you can actually
control the active noise-cancelling with
these and that's something that we're
seeing with a lot of premium headphones
in this price range active
noise-cancelling it's kind of like that
feature you got to have but this takes
it a step further and gives you 13
levels of active noise-cancelling and
you can actually bring it all the way
down and that gives you access to
ambient noise and we all know active
noise-cancelling is meant to block out
everything around you so if you're
traveling and you don't want to hear
other people in your commute you can
have that on or maybe you just want to
block out all sounds you can do that but
with ambient noise it actually does the
opposite and it lets sounds in so you
can at least know what's going on around
you so if you're at home and your wife
is calling you or the kids are calling
you but while you're listening to
something you can have that feature on
and still be able to hear what's going
on around you and not be completely
oblivious to the world but Microsoft is
the first company I've ever seen make an
actual dial where you can just
completely control that at the flip of a
switch or turn of a dial and I think
that is really cool and the ambient
noise mode is surprisingly good guys one
of the nights that I was testing these
it was really late in the night and I
was doing some cleaning getting my
basement together and I don't want to
play music with the speakers because Ari
was sleeping so I put on the headphones
had an ambient noise mode because in
case Ari woke up and she was calling me
I wanted to make sure I heard her and
while I was cleaning up and everything
and putting things away and getting
things together I could hear everything
that I was doing even though I was
listening to my music and it just felt
like I had sonic hearing guys when I
paused the music and I was still doing
activity with the headphones on I could
hear everything amplified and each air
cup is equipped with microphones so that
you can kind of hear what's going on
around you but I will say guys it was an
interesting feeling to use this in
ambient mode and just feel like I had
sonic hearing and that's what I really
like about these headphones being able
to have that level of control off from
the headset itself you don't really have
to touch your phone to do anything I
think that is really awesome now let's
talk about battery life this thing has
about 15 hours of battery life which is
okay I would like to see that number in
the 20s usually when it comes to these
premium headsets with the noise
canceling and all that you usually see
it in the 20 range 15 is a bit on the
low side but it did hold up to its claim
but one thing that this thing does have
going for it
is the fact that you can get an hour of
listening which is a five minute charge
so it has a quick charge feature built
into it and I can appreciate that with
any headphone I love quick charging and
something cool that you can do with
these headphones is just call out to
Cortana by saying hey Cortana and it is
gonna be able to pick up what you're
saying no buttons to press and you can
just ask your questions or make it do a
certain command and I find that this
feature works pretty well with computers
or even your phones and the headphones
also do this really cool thing when you
first turn them on they'll tell you just
how many hours of listening you have
instead of just a battery percentage
which i think is a lot more useful now
let's talk about one of the most
important parts of any headphones and
that's the sound quality now I think
these sounds really good
basses there
the vocals could be a bit better if
there are any weak points in the sound I
think that it's the vocals I like to be
able to hear the artists crystal-clear
and I can't say that this is the case
here don't get me wrong though that's
not to say it sounds bad or muffled or
tin tea but I've heard better vocal
quality and headphones in this three
hundred and fifty dollar price range
which is up there but I'll be honest
that critique is moving into audiophile
territory and I throw this thing on Airy
or my dad or a friend of mine they're
probably gonna hear and just be like oh
this sounds great but because it is in
that premium price category I do want to
put it out there I have I been enjoying
listening to audio on these absolutely
but I do want to mention all the areas
that could be improvement Tenace these
are Microsoft's first pair of headphones
and if anyone's listening this might be
able to help now the question is do they
get my recommendation right now and I
gotta say they do I absolutely do
recommend these they are solid pair of
headphones they sound good they've got
really cool features especially if you
use them along side of the surface
product I think it just makes a very
very nice ecosystem but I will say I
don't think these are the kind of
headphones that you save up for for a
long time especially if you're looking
for is like the best sound quality
because these are premium headphones so
if you're just somebody who you know you
got extra cash to burn you want a nice
solid pair of headphones that'll work
with a bunch of devices this is a really
good buy but if it's something you're
gonna have to save up for I think there
are other headphones out there that are
a lot cheaper that'll give you better
quality in terms of audio but you will
miss out on some of the awesome noise
canceling features that this thing does
have I would have been really happy with
these at 250 bucks 350 just seems like a
lot to be honest I think 250 bucks would
have been the sweet spot for these
headphones they got good sound quality
really cool features a pretty decent
look 250 for me would make it perfect
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed
hopefully this helped you make a
decision on whether or not you want to
pick these up I personally really like
them but I will know what you guys think
down below in the comments but till the
next video guys it's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
