consumer and today I finally have the
what's in my gadget backpack 3.0 video
for you guys and this time I'm using a
oh gee Oh renegade RSS 17 that's the
name of the backpack and you might be
wondering where's the case logic
backpack that you had before well I
still have it and it's still in great
condition it's held up very well over
the year and I still like it a lot but I
wanted something a little more sturdy
and with more compartments for all the
tech that I'm carrying now a couple of
disclaimers I don't take this with me
just about everywhere I only take it
with me on long trips or if I'm going
over to someone's house or maybe if I'm
going somewhere where I just want to be
productive for a bit so that's why I
carry this stuff around with me never
really on the daily I don't take the
train with it I don't travel outside
with it where I can get mugged so don't
worry about me getting mugged the hut
also this is not a regular everyday
setup this is meant for like extended
trips as I mentioned so there's a lot of
stuff in here
tons and tons of stuff you'll definitely
consider to be over packed but I love
having options and I love all my tech so
I try to carry as much of it as I can in
this backpack so without further ado
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
alright guys here we have the og o
renegade RSS 17 now this is a gadget
lovers backpack for sure because it has
a ton of compartments as you guys can
see there are tons of zippers everywhere
so that means there are tons of
compartments tons of places just to pack
your stuff but the first thing I'm going
to go over is actually actually on the
side here and it's not actually a part
of the book bag but I attached it to it
and those are my headphones now some of
you might be familiar with these from
the previous what's in my gadget
backpack video and you can find that
link down below in the description if
you haven't seen it but these are the
v-moda m100 now you can actually open
these up and it's got a hardshell case
for protection that's why I'm not afraid
to leave it on the outside of the bag
and here you have it it's very small
very portable and this is like one of my
favorite pairs of headphones period now
these are a little different than last
time because
I got some excel cushions on it and this
changes everything about how I feel
about these headphones on this makes it
much more comfortable to use excellent
sound quality this is definitely just
one of my favorite headphones period now
I also have some new AC reviews branding
on it which is really cool really loving
the fact that v-moda allows you to have
customizable heel plates so of course i
Slimak my logo on there and this is how
I rock them also inside of the case
you'll get a cable to listen to your
music of course it only has one button
on the inline remote for playing pause
but that works just fine with Android
and Apple devices and of course as a mic
and all that you also get another cable
which has a is a really long cable and
it has another input so that you can
daisy chain so when you plug this into
your device
someone can also plug in their
headphones into this little jack and you
both can be listening to the same source
of audio at the same time so if you're
traveling and you want to listen to
music on a bus or a plane or whatever
you can both do that with this cable
really nice stuff and I had a couple of
other accessories from v-moda for these
headphones as well so I'm gonna have a
video about that if you're interested in
that leave this video a thumbs up to let
me know and yeah I'll be getting it out
to you guys pretty soon so we're going
to put all this to the side here and
this blank this big table is actually
going to get pretty filled up watch so
now let's go into the first compartment
that's down here and as you can see what
I really like about this is that it's
actually got a lot of compartments that
you can actually have like labels and
stuff so it kind of makes it easier to
pack things away so when you've got all
this stuff here makes it really simple I
really got I got a couple of pens here
these Oh depends I usually used to like
you know write down notes or anything
that needs writing these are my favorite
pens did a pilot g2 pens
0.5 for the ink and I also have this pen
here you guys have seen this in all the
other gadget backpack videos but this is
my pen that I still carry around with me
that actually turns into a USB stick
so you can actually just screw off the
top I believe let's see if I can still
get it off here all right cool so you
can screw this off and then you've got a
1 gigabyte USB stick right here so this
is really cool I have links down below
for a similar device but you guys have a
pen and a USB stick all in one really
cool um let's see here I also have a
cool little transformer stylus for my
3ds that I have inside of here and this
is actually a bumblebee stylus so as you
guys can see it's shaped like bumblebee
so that's really cool here too
um now let me show you guys some of the
other stuff I have going on over here I
have the mouse that I take with me for
like my laptop and all that this is the
Logitech g600 two mounts I love this
Mouse so far I'm gonna have an unboxing
on the channel come up really soon so
you guys can see you know be unboxing it
I'm going to have a review of this as
well but so far I'm really big in the
mouse um let's see what else we've got
here we have a 1 terabyte hard drive and
this is what I pretty much carry all my
content on if I'm you know recording or
video editing on the go this is where it
all goes it's USB 3.0 it's Western
Digital so I can do the transfer speeds
really quickly I can get content onto my
computer or even records directly from
here and you know edit with no problem
so that's why I carry that around and
let's see here
also this little compartment here with a
pouch that has a couple of things I of
course have a pokewalker
I always carry this thing around I don't
even really play the game that much
anymore the Silver Edition but I always
carried around anyway I have a little
USB charger so Apple so I carry that
there too if I can plug it into a wall
charge something up really quickly um
let's see what else we've got I've got
some extra batteries for my camera so
I'll show you guys that in a second so I
got some spares put that here I've got a
32 gigabyte sandesh USB it's a nice
little USB stick gets 32 gigs which is
nice for its size only drawback is that
it's USB 2.0 so it's not the fastest for
data transfers but it's great for like
putting movies and stuff like that
and plugging into a laptop with no
problem so definitely love this little
thing and here I have a headphone
splitter I got this with the Logitech UE
9000 I believe or maybe it was the 6000
I'm not sure but it's a headphone
splitter and you can actually just like
the cable that came with the V motors -
people can listen to the same audio
source at the same time so that's always
useful and also this is the USB dongle
for the Logitech mouse here so it's a
wireless mouse so I plug this into the
computer and I can use this mouse no
problem and all that stuff pretty much
was all in this one little compartment
which is pretty good and it didn't look
crazy or chaotic so I really like how
they categorize the stuff here so really
easy and simple so let's close this and
get to the second one so here I have a
little book that I got from Walmart this
is where I jot down some notes I had a
bigger book before but this is makes it
a little easier so I've got some notes
and some video ideas so that's where I
carry all of that stuff so I can put
this here as well this is a little hand
grip for my camera I'm going to show you
the guys to camera but this is the hand
grip for it so I can attach the camera
to it and this is usually what I use for
vlogging I can point the camera at me or
at something and it's a lot easier to
hold and you know it's just really easy
to hold the camera like this rather than
you know oddly grabbing the camera
making sure you're not covering any mics
or anything like that so this is very
very nice and useful and right here it
has a little pouch for a tablet as you
guys might be able to see here so you
can put a tablet in here with no problem
kind of gives us some extra protection
with this padding and this is where I
keep my Nexus 10
now Nexus 10 isn't the smallest tablet
in the world but it flushes in here with
no problem it's nice and securely so
this is my Nexus 10 this is like my
go-to tablet for just like Android
I don't really use an iPad at all or
iPad Mini this is the tablet my tablet
of choice so this is the Nexus 10 with a
cover on it so that's that protects it
and pretty much that's it for this pouch
now moving on to up here this is where I
store like my head my earphones now up
top here these are a little tight but up
tight up top here I have the RH
a 750 I now and but I think it's ma 750
I yeah ma 750 I now these are amazing
earbuds really really great quality
great build quality great sound
I love these as you can see this is why
I'm carrying it around with me and I
just love to use these whenever I'm on
the go also I do carry a pair of
Bluetooth earbuds and that is of course
the jaybird blue buttsex
now you guys have seen my review I love
these things I walk around with these a
lot now if I'm not in the mood to deal
with cables I can just throw these in
and have no problem the sound quality is
great great base great clarity I love
these things and they've got great
battery life so depending on how I'm
feeling if I want to use bluetooth or if
I want to use regular cables I use this
guy so I got these two options now I
know all of you might be wondering who
needs all of these headphones and
earbuds but like I said I love options
and those definitely provide it for me
and over here I have a pair of v-moda
ear plugs so if whatever reason I need
earplugs I can actually plug these into
my ears block out any sound so if I'm on
a plane with crying babies or something
and I don't want to listen to music I
can just plug that in want some peace
and quiet so that's all of that now
let's see what's on the sides here over
here I have an iPod Touch what does this
fifth-generation they need to update
these things but this is the fifth
generation iPod Touch of course the the
lightning cable to go with it let's see
what else we've got back here
ah let's see I have a business card
holder so this holds all my business
cards and when I'm ready to give it out
to people if I'm telling someone about
my channel I give them a card so that
they can check it out
that's that let's see we've also got a
charger so this is a for my surface
which I'll get to but that's that
and let's see also here I have the zoom
h1 so let's say I'm recording or
something on the go this gets you some
great audio I've been using this for
quite some time I actually upgraded
since then but whenever if I'm on the go
and I don't want to carry all of my real
equipment this is definitely a solid
option got a little windscreen on here
and boom you're good to go to do some
recording so that's that and then I also
have a mini tripod that I can throw my
my camera on or even the zoom h1 and you
know it'll be there in position no
problem very portable very easy to use
and in this pocket on the side here I
have a couple of portable chargers got
to start moving this thing down I got a
couple of portable chargers here I have
a small little youtube charger I got
this from working with YouTube on a
little project and I was given this as a
gift so that's that and here is my new
trend power pack plus that has thirteen
thousand yeah thirteen thousand milliamp
sub battery power so this can charge up
a phone quite a few times can even
charge up this tablet so definitely
great stuff I love using this if you
don't have a portable charger guys get
one you need it it's great so there's
that ah let's see so that's all the
stuff on the sides now now what's really
cool about this bag is that up top it
has a arm like it's not armored but it's
like a hard shell for this little
compartment here so you can put
valuables in here like if it's something
that's fragile you can put it in here
and you don't have to worry about what
going on with the bag it's safe because
everything is sealed it in here so
that's cool
a lot of people used I think they really
show that you can put like glasses in
here or like sunglasses whatever you
want but me I put my rx100 in here and
of course it's inside of a case as well
but this is the rx100 mark 3 so this is
my go-to camera when it comes to like
vlogging and stuff and you know I have a
case on it right here just to give some
extra protection when I'm not putting it
in the bag and this is it
if it's very nicely up here I also have
a couple of microfiber cloths so that it
doesn't move around too much and it
gives me a nice easy place to store
microfiber cloths because I have an
addiction to cleaning off the screens of
my products so this is always around
with me so I can put those there and
here you guys have it and a nice little
thing about this bad guys wherever you
see like a red insides that means it's
got like extra protection so that's that
guy it has extra protection there the
tablets get a little extra protection
over here so that's what that little red
stuff ghost means let's see over here we
have my PS Vita inside this big
compartment and this is where I really
carry like my gaming stuff and most of
my cables here I have my Nintendo 3ds XL
when you open this up you got a ton of
games up here a lot of the same games
that I've been playing some of these
games I haven't beaten in forever
but this is a 3ds XL with the Pokemon
X&amp;amp;Y yveltal and xerneas so it's a
special edition 3d yes so I put that
here it was actually my girlfriend's but
she stopped using it so I saw no reason
to let it go to waste and over here of
course like I said I have my PS Vita my
one of my favorite portables ever this
and the PSP man I love portable gaming
they're all just really great so that's
that um also I have this little stand
for a tablet stand so I can put my Nexus
10 on here
and you know I can watch videos or use
it at different viewing angles with no
problem and it's really really cheap on
Amazon I'm gonna have links to
everything you see here on Amazon um I
have them links all down below in the
description so if you're interested in
anything I talked about here look down
below in the description and you'll be
able to find it I also have this in tech
USB port thing right here now this has
three USB ports and it's all USB 3.0 and
it also has an SD card reader and it's
also an OTG cable so that means you can
plug this into a device like my Android
tablet over here my Nexus 10 I can plug
this in and it can read the storage
devices that I have attached to it so if
I have an SD card I can plug it in here
and I can actually pull the content out
on this tablet and I can you know attach
some you know devices through the USB
ports which is really awesome and it of
course doesn't just have to be used with
a tablet or anything there's also a
regular USB hub so I can plug this into
a computer or a laptop and I get three
extra 3.0 USB ports really awesome stuff
and this thing is cheap this is not
really expensive at all I'm gonna have a
full review of this so you guys can
learn more about it but expect to see
this on your average budget really cool
stuff also let's see I've got a couple
of chargers before I used to use I just
have the Chargers just loose in my bag
but I figured I'd use a black bag since
I do that in my room so got some Ziploc
bags here to carry some of the chargers
that I have so those are the all
Chargers there here's another charger
and the last thing I have in here is
this wireless Bluetooth speaker by favi
AV audio plus I believe it's called this
is called the boomerang so this is a
wireless speaker
it's got NFC it's bluetooth and you can
also plug it in just in case you don't
want to use bluetooth but it's got a
rechargeable battery and this is meant
for like tablet use you can actually
just throw this onto a tablet
and it'll pretty much upgrade your
speaker game so you can you know watch
this play any video and you've got some
great speakers coming out towards you
and it also functions as a stand so it's
really good stuff I'm going to have a
review of this as well now some of these
things you guys probably haven't seen on
the channel yet but you can expect a
full review of just about everything
that I haven't made a review of yet so
this is really cool stuff I actually
really like this expect to see a video
on that soon and you can call it quits
for that bag coming back compartment and
the last one and this is where the RSS
comes in that stands for the reactive
suspension system this is where you hold
your tablets or you're not really tablet
martial gear with your laptops and this
can hold up to 17 inches that's the 17
so I have my macbook air here so this
goes inside so and it's actually a hard
shell it's actually a hard shell casing
inside here so if there's any impact or
the bag Falls or something you don't
have to worry about your laptop getting
hurt or damaged because of this
hardshell case that protects it and of
course it's got that red lining here as
well um I have my macbook air in here
but I also have my Microsoft Surface pro
3 so I have both of those with me I
really like having the option of you
know Mac or Windows so it's really
really nice I love the surface pro 3
I've really enjoyed using this I'm gonna
have a special video about this and so
you guys gotta keep an eye out for that
as well but um yeah whenever I'm doing
video editing I can actually go with the
MacBook Air or the surface pro 3 I can
actually edit on this thing and what's
really awesome is that the surface pro 3
has a USB 3.0 port so when I use this in
tech USB hub I can put this in and I get
three extra USB 3.0 ports so this pretty
much turns it into like almost a
full-fledged laptop well it's pretty
much is a full-fledged laptop but with
more ports access to a SD card reader
this pretty much shuts it up and makes a
great great combo so that's pretty much
all of my tech here that I carry around
with me guys this is all that goes into
this
Oh Gio renegade backpack it's a pretty
expensive backpack but for a real techy
somebody who really loves protection and
a lot of compartments and being able to
take as much junk as they can with them
this definitely works as you guys can
see here it holds a lot and it does it
well protects everything very well and
that pretty much wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
like I said links will be down below in
the description for everything you see
here let me know what you guys think of
the video be that cool guy that gives it
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
subscribe to the channel for more
content from me I'll catch you guys in
the next video till then it's your
average consumer piece alright
