today you couldn't tell we've got
another massive tech unboxing where
we've just got a ton of stuff here
things that will be making it to the
channel in future videos things that I'm
going to be testing out to see if
they'll be in videos yada yada yada
there's a bunch of tech in these boxes
so let's get started do we have a
tradition here arey yes go ahead and
pick the first one no no no go ahead
signal this one okay so we'll go with
this guy so I know this is so here let's
pop this guy open in a minute it's just
- in here huh so alright so we've got
let's get my little unboxing knife so we
got some stuff from anchor over here I'm
pretty sure we're considering the skies
of these they gotta be some cables okay
so we've got a anchor what is this I
don't even know their real oh is the
power line plus I think you're right
babe so you have the anchor power line
plus this is a USB type-c cable so this
is pretty pretty standard stuff but I
was looking for something that was
really durable and a bit longer I think
this one is about six feet or so so yeah
there's what we're looking at actually
really like their cables this is really
thick it's a braided cable it also comes
with this little velcro strap so that
you can you know keep it together really
nice and neat so with this what we've
got over here they're not really
expensive either so you get pretty good
quality cables for pretty cheap price in
the other box this is a bigger box and
it's not like this one so I'm curious oh
okay cool so over here we're looking at
this is their power fusion 5000 I
believe it's called but this is a
portable charger by anchor and what's
cool about this guy is that you can
throw this right into a wall outlet and
use it as a regular wall outlet with USB
ports now what's great about this is
while you're charging your devices with
a cable plugged into the wall once
you're done with that you take this out
the wall you throw this thing in a
pack and got a portable charger on the
go so I think this is about 5,000
milliamp hours so you can charge the
phone a couple of times maybe one and a
half times depending on what size it is
but um this is pretty solid so yeah this
is the anchor power core fusion 5000
what I call it earlier anyway
power plus whatever in its power core
fusion 5000 this is awesome because
multi use like I just mentioned so if
you're looking for a good portable
charger five thousand milliamp hours not
sound crazy but it's super useful and it
has quick charge as well so can be that
okay so it comes with a USB cable of
micro USB so that you can charge it as
well as a little carrying pouch so you
put this get backpack y'all get to go
it's actually not bad I like this I just
want to add another USB cable in here
somewhere maybe some one of these boxes
stuff alright so next up I'm gonna go
with this guy this is pretty heavy for
something so small plus see oh I just
took a wild guess and here's the other
power cable from anchor this is a
lightning cable think oh oh this is a
Teufel one okay so these are micro USB
cables okay cool so I got two micro USB
cables these are pretty much like the
USB type-c but in red SiC braided red
cable so super durable you look really
really good you want one Eric okay
alright so that's that oh now if you
guys saw the last video where I showed
my favorite tag of the month for May you
might have seen these Belkin surge
protectors now I wasn't lying when I
said I use these personally I actually
have to go ahead and pick up a few more
just from the bedroom if you didn't see
me checking out our bedroom at home we
actually added a lot of new tech and we
need more surge protectors than we
initially thought so I picked up a
couple if you guys need any kind of
surge protectors for your setup or
anything like that this is absolutely
one of my favorites and just to give you
guys a quick idea of why you can change
the outlets to go on the sides
got cool stuff like that you can use
right here for cable management very
very cool stuff that you don't typically
see in surge protectors well worth the
money
lastly in this box anyway we've got this
this is a power AC inverter so basically
what this is this is going to provide
outlets and USB ports to a car now why
what yeah right so why that's cool is
let's say I'm working on a project I
need to edit on the go I'm in the car I
don't have to worry about my MacBook
dying sense editing really eats up a lot
of juice with this I have access to two
outlets and all I've got to do is plug
into the cigarette lighter so that's
really cool having this kind of thing in
the car
just chilling waiting there I think this
will help a lot of people especially if
you go on like a long road trip or
something this can be really really
useful a glove compartment it is for
this all right it's kind of big well you
don't like it hey go sit on the it can
fit under the car seat okay yeah yeah
okay compromise folks alright so over
here let's say this oh I know this is
all right all right that's what she said
I could you can set it up so over here
we have a wire organizer this is a
little race way that you can tilt under
your desk now if you guys ever saw my
little setup over here I've got a lot of
stuff hooked up right now it's not the
cleanest in the world because I've been
swapping a lot of stuff in and out but
in order to keep this somewhat
manageable I use one of these in the
back up here so if you want to get your
desk set up and organized really nicely
where you're not seeing a lot of cables
you definitely want a Raceway you put
this up in the back you tuck your cables
inside of it and you're good to go so
this is a must if you want to have a
clean set
okay so let's do Oh
all right so you guys know me so I have
to get another Gundam because I don't
have enough obviously if you can't tell
this is um the Gundam Barbados this is
what for me this is like the sixth form
yes sixth form so basically this is a
cool high resolution setup for those of
you who care anyway but those of you who
don't it's still cool right I think so
either way I'm going to be adding
another guide to this collection don't
watch this anime though it'll piss you
off I swear
oh no yeah let's just open this guy up I
think this one might be for you re yeah
sorta
it's for us I think how'd it go from
being for you for us right this is the
Sony a 65 hundred so we got we told you
guys that we were going to try to do
some more vlogging again and this should
help us do it we wanted to get a
lightweight camera that should make it
very easy for us to just pull out the
camera and start vlogging wherever we
are this should help us do that
this recorded in 4k it has great image
quality I can hook up a mic to it so you
can just get a good audio from it so a
6500 now in this box I actually picked
up a bundle from Amazon this bundle was
the exact same price as the camera
itself just the body so it was a
no-brainer I was like you know what I'll
get all the stuff for free so why not so
what we've got in here our LCD screen
protectors oh another battery which is
great because if it dies while we're out
and about we can throw in another one
screen protectors because Ari will
probably put it in her bag and get the
screen scratched up ski card readers we
got an SD card 64 gigs and we've also
got o SD card caddy
cases I'll just leave SP card in the
case in the camera but whatever we've
also got a cleaning kit battery chargers
a Sony case so we can walk around with
it dang this is this is a very good
bundle for the price of the body itself
I didn't pay extra this is really good
we got a strap so we can throw the bag
over it and I think this is like a cheap
tripod yeah yes we will do that we'll
give this to your dad since you broke it
good job Eric so this is a great bundle
for a great camera if you're looking to
get into video and you still want to get
great video quality without paying the
price of some of the crazy 4k cameras
that are out there right now so uh
there's going to be us for vlogging so
keep your eyes peeled for those they're
going to be coming soon alright so next
up we're looking at oh you looky looky
we got some gaming headsets these are
some pretty inexpensive headsets
actually I wanted to pick up some
headsets that were in the less expensive
realm I think this one goes for about 30
bucks and maybe this one 50 it's that
much so I kind of wanted to see what's
out there at the lower price ranges let
you know if there's anything I could
recommend so over here we've got a
gaming headset from a company that I've
never heard of before but I figured why
not if it's a Qi gaming headset maybe it
might surprise me something I could let
you guys know about so I'm going to be
testing it out and Logitech you know you
can always kind of count on Logitech so
I figured I'll give this a shot the g4
430 now if you guys have any experience
with these let me know what you think of
them in the comments down below
but yeah I'm trying to get into the
realm of showing you guys some less
expensive options so you can stop
complaining but um we're going to see
what these take us what is this
oh it's heavy all right so I don't know
what this is but it's oh wait oh okay so
this I don't know have you guys ever
heard of the sub pack basically it's
like a backpack that provides bass you
can actually feel like literally it's
like this crazy backpack contraption you
throw it on and then you're able to hear
the bass of whatever it's connected to
interesting so let's see we've got a
power plug and amp interesting so this
is where you power it oh you've got
bluetooth that's really cool then you
got line in so you can connect whatever
device you want to connect to it and
then basically you're going to feel a
bunch of bass coming from right here now
I wanted to see if I could maybe make a
video out of this what can I you know
use this for initially my first thought
is virtual reality you know you jump in
you got your headset on you got this on
your back you're seeing and you're
feeling whatever's going on I think this
could lead to a really really cool
experience I just want to get it open
though so this is what it would look
like I guess oh you oh just has a little
clip so you just throw it on to like
your pants or something turn that on I'm
really really interested in seeing how
this will perform or something like VR
if you guys can think of any other
applications or something like this
could be useful let me know what to
comment down below if you want to see a
separate video with this maybe I'll do
like a really cool virtual reality set
up that could be a good idea I'm
actually pretty excited about this this
ain't cheap though I think I paid like I
think this was like 300 bucks yeah 300
bucks
I know right alright this hmm oh okay so
this right here is a portable screen by
Asus pull this out and boom
the Asus MB 169 and we have I guess this
is the travel case to take it along with
you wherever you go alright so let's
look at here I think this is like you
know straight up full 1080p you can
connect this with USB type-c man this
feels thin holy whoa this is super light
oh the spinach this is clean this is
nice Wow and this is it this is the
screen so the idea behind this is maybe
you're traveling let's say I want to use
two screens to edit my videos whenever
I'm on the go that's what I'm used to
win on that home or something I can go
ahead and throw on an extra screen just
by plugging it into my laptop which is
really awesome and this is so
lightweight and so thin it's actually a
pretty viable option to expand the
displays on your computer so we've got a
full 1080p display IPS users USB type-c
like I said so let's see okay these are
the ports right here so we've got the
USB type-c port I guess this is the
volume controls and you've got your
power over here and that's it so let's
see what this travel case actually does
this is going to provide a standby
belief so this thing can't support
itself just stand up by itself so with
this okay you can prop it up with this
so this is like this okay and then I
take this and boom oh oh okay
not the best way to do it I don't think
but it gets the job done so if you want
to set it up you got to do some very
very weird folding
over here has to pull out the manual I
just picked it up real quick just to get
an idea of what this thing looks like
and Wow just one cable guys and it
powers up the entire display and this is
nice this is really nice
I really do wish it had a better
contraption to have a stand but for the
most part this gets the job done I don't
know how much I paid for this exactly
but it really wasn't that expensive for
what it is providing a second display
1080p can run off of one cable there's
this solid stuff right here guys I'll
see how I can integrate it into some
kind of video see what we can figure out
with this but initial first impressions
I'm liking it but that's about it for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed
there's a ton of cool stuff here let me
know what things you want to see make it
into a video first and then of course I
can get to working on that I'll catch
you guys in the next one be sure to look
out for the vlogs coming soon till then
is your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
