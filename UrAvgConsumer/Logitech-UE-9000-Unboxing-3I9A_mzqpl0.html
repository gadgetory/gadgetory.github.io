consumer and today I'm gonna be doing an
unboxing of the Logitech UE 9000 if you
guys know me and my channel I'm a huge
fan of wireless headphones so I'm very
interested in giving this a try it looks
like it's gonna be pretty good but we'll
see
but let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the Logitech UE 9000 these are bluetooth
headphones they retail for about 400
bucks so these are a little on the
pricey side but they are wireless so
that's really cool I can't wait to give
these a try
they've got active noise-cancelling all
that good stuff as you know the
packaging on this looks great we've got
some good stuff here so let's get this
thing open get my unboxing knife and
we'll cut the tape on the sides it was
one there goes the other alright and
let's pop this open here so let's see
this packaging is very similar to the
6000 so let's see if we can get this out
but the box is quite bigger I must say
all right so it's finally out all right
so this got the same box got the Yui on
here Ultimate Ears
just pop this open with love it yeah and
as you can see it's presented a little
differently it's already got the
headphones out and be open so we can pop
this up and cool it has a little swivel
feature that you can do this I didn't
even really know that but let's put this
to the side first and see what else
comes inside we've got two little flaps
here let's see if I show you all righty
so we've got two little flaps here I'll
pull this out and there's nothing else
inside of here and we've got the big
case that holds the earphones or head so
first let me put this back and let me
get rid of this box and alright so here
we have the case we've got the
headphones over here let's see what's
inside this case probably all the other
stuff that would be inside of a box so
of course we've got the manuals and
warranty information all that stuff
inside here so of course it's has a user
guide which this is probably gonna be
necessary for some who don't have
experience with Bluetooth headphones so
it'll show you a little bit about the
headphones and how to sync it all that
good stuff so that goes inside of here
other important information and that we
can put this to the side and what else
do we get inside over here we've got a
charger for the actual headphones these
are battery-powered so we've got the AC
adapter here we've got
let's see this is probably the USB cable
this is a really thick USB cable so
that's pretty cool shouldn't have some
longevity so this is what we're gonna be
using to charge it up and put this over
here and let's see we've got a quarter
inch adapter gold-plated so that's cool
too and we've got the cable with control
talk so if you don't want to use the
Bluetooth feature you can still use
these instead so it has a volume up and
down playing pause should work with all
Apple devices playing pause I'm sure
we'll work for Android but not the
volume controls and we can pretty much
get rid of this little piece and here we
have the case it's pretty much it it has
the compartment here so that you can
throw accessories or anything here and
yeah that's about it it's a hardshell
case and let's see is pretty interesting
it's got a little hole here so I'm
guessing you could put like a string or
some something to maybe tie this to or
something I'm not sure but I'm sure
that's what it's for and pretty much
that's it for this case also inside the
case we got this here they're really
opening yet let's see what this is and
I'm sure this is probably a microfiber
yeah so this is a microfiber cloth since
these are glossy
I'm sure it'll get tons of fingerprints
and this is gonna be useful to just
wiping it off maybe when you're going
outside or something and you want it to
look presentable boom you've got these
so pretty cool accessories here quarter
inch adapter cable and a USB charger so
move these to the side well and here we
have the actual ue9 thousands so these
actually look pretty cool it's a pretty
interesting design it looks pretty
different from the 6000 but it looks
similar
and different at the same time so that's
pretty cool let me give you guys a quick
close-up of the actual headphones
alright guys so here we have the
Logitech UE 9000 on the left ear cup
you've got a little button up top here
I'm not sure what it's for
I'm sure the user guy to let me know
there doesn't seem to be anything else
really
on the right side though we've got quite
a few buttons and things going on of
course at the top we have the power
button so that turns it on and it got it
has the Bluetooth light button up in the
back there it's got some little sounds
playing there I don't know if you guys
can pick that up but it's got some
sounds going there and that's what that
is and of course we've got the volume
controls these are bluetooth so you know
you got all these features on the actual
headphones so you can control the volume
playing pause right here and the volume
up and down and of course we have the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack as well as
the micro USB slot to plug it in and
charge it up and that pretty much wraps
it up for all the little things on here
this doesn't have as much padding as
then 6000s so but this still feels
pretty decent not definitely not as much
padding but the ear cushions have a lot
more padding these are much deeper ear
cups then the 6000s have so it's pretty
cool do you still look really nice I
really like this little swivel feature
it has going for it um I can't wait to
try it out and compare it to the 6000
unless you guys know the difference um
I'm very I'm a big fan of the design I
love the little blue accents all over
the device it looks really nice so I
really can't wait to try this out one
thing that I do find interesting is that
it doesn't have any track controls like
you can't really hit forward or back for
songs maybe this right here might have
the functions like an inline remote
where you double tap the play and pause
button to go forward or three times to
go back not sure but
we'll find out and I'll let you guys
know in the review but pretty much this
is it for this close-up guys and here we
have it so it's just pretty cool I'm
very I'm a really big fan of this
ultimate ear series that Logitech has
going for it this looks like it's gonna
be some really good stuff their
Bluetooth so I can't wait to try these
out so that about wraps it up guys if
