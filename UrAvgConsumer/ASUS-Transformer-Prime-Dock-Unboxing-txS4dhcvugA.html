want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys she's your average consumer today
we have a quick unboxing video of the
dock for a basis transformer prime all
right let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright so let's open this
thing up
it's a pretty similar box to the one
that the Prime came in the front part is
highlighted to show the dock itself and
the picture of the tablet is faded in
the back this is the back side show you
a color I don't think there's another
color available that I I've seen in the
stores or anything good look around the
box then let's open it up and here we
are we also have the same kind of nice
mesh inside the box for protection just
like the prime hat itself
here goes to dock take this out ok wait
to see wait and inside the box we also
have another little package probably
another thank you card like the prime
hat and a manual of course well ok just
a manual
and this is it for what's inside the box
so you can get this out of the way and
we can unwrap the dock so we have to
take this tab off that would go from the
side or plastic indicates a USB s-- a
USB symbol SD card slot I'm guessing
this is ace I'm not sure what this is
right here what this symbol is looks
like something that could be a speaker
this is a charger and a an inject symbol
I'm not sure what that would be for
maybe to eject the dock or something
yeah find out the fun is finding out
take this off
it's not heavy it's really light by the
keys feel a little bit small oh we have
big hands or anything okay so you have
your diagonal pad your regular keys your
special function keys for the tablet
itself home key search so this doc
charges it charges the is charges the
transformer prime as well as has its own
battery so it add adds on to the battery
life of the prime itself it goes from 12
hours to 18 hours fully charged and you
have the touch pad here which is also
clickable I believe a mouse appears on
the transformer prime when you insert it
into the dock and you can use a USB
cable like a USB cable or other USB
device okay so the place holder just
fell out I will have to go pick that
back up you guys might want to be
careful with make sure you don't lose
that well listen take USB devices this
is what the charger goes and the micro
SD cards not microSD I'm sorry your
standard SD so it takes normal memory
cards not just micro electic the prime
itself does so you can add even more
storage on to the 32 that's already
given so I guess let's see how do you
bring this back all right so to open
this up
looks like you need to been a you know
put a little force on here to help pry
it open I thought that would be a switch
or something but it just takes a little
brute force I guess and let's see if we
can get this guy situated up you're
gonna want to take out these little
rubber parts from your tablet I'm gonna
do that now all right so now that we got
those taken out and you're going to
insert this here and as we plug connect
it this switches over the lock mechanism
I guess which is over
no it's connected and this is it a
little heft to it along the way it
connects but overall not bad feels
pretty it feels pretty good and it looks
pretty good too they did a very good job
making this seem like a one-piece I done
really wonder combined so that's really
nice
well I'll have a review up for you guys
about on this shortly just wanted to do
a quick unboxing and show you guys what
it's like all right guys well this is my
unboxing and hopefully you guys enjoyed
it and I was able to show you guys
firsthand what it's like so this is a
Sue's transformer prime dock alright
