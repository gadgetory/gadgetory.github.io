what's going on guys it's dry average
consumer and in the past we've talked
about the top 5 accessories that are
must-have for the Nintendo switch and
the ps4 but this time we're gonna talk
about pcs and the first thing we're
gonna talk about on this list is the
Logitech G 560 desktop speakers now
something I feel like I've learned
pretty early on in my tech days is that
having a pair of solid desktop speakers
can really enhance your experience when
using your computer whether it's for
gaming or watching movies now the g5 60s
have a couple of interesting features
obviously you're seeing these RGB lights
and that's one of them but what's most
important is the sound quality now these
are actually pretty small speakers I was
very surprised when I first saw them but
don't let that fool you they still sound
very good and it's actually quite
powerful now of course you get the 2
speakers and a sub for that extra bass
hoo and that sub is so powerful guys now
I actually have one gripe with these
speakers I wish there was a knob to turn
down the sub whenever you wanted to
without having to go into the settings
on the computer unfortunately that isn't
there but it is so powerful that
sometimes I feel like I gotta turn it
down a bit but if that's not gonna be a
bother to you guys this is absolutely
something you're gonna be stoked about
of all the audio that I've thrown at
this guy everything has sounded great
whether it's for gaming or even just
listening to music I've had a pleasant
experience with besom they have a pretty
simple circular shape but they've got
this groove on the inside that helps it
to sit up and also houses the RGB lights
now inside of here's where you see those
cool RGB effects but there's also a spot
in the back that has a clear casing that
allows the RGB lights to show off in the
back so when you have these close to a
wall on your desk it actually
illuminates the wall which is a really
nice touch they've even got this
interesting screen sampling feature that
allows the RGB lights to kind of match
whatever is on your screen it actually
works pretty well it's kind of cool to
try out it's a bit gimmicky but it is a
cool feature nonetheless now these
aren't the cheapest speakers in the
world there are 200 bucks but I
absolutely think they're worth it they
sound great have a lot of cool features
and you can even sync up the lights with
other Logitech RGB products but
nonetheless guys I think these are
absolutely worth it and definitely a
great addition to any battle station or
just regular setup and next up our
Titleist is also from Logitech and it's
my favorite wired mouse
is the logitech g502 now I love the g502
and I think it'd be great for just about
anyone because of that amazing ergonomic
design I love the way this thing sits in
the hand it fits perfectly and not only
that but you can easily access buttons
all over the mouse so you can go into
the Logitech Gaming software and change
up those buttons and map them to certain
effects so you can use those buttons
however you'd like it's all customizable
and I really think that comfort and
ability to customize the masa for the
way you want to use it will definitely
be an upgrade to Indian who's using a
standard or generic Mouse that came with
their computer now honestly straight up
think that this thing looks great it
does have a couple of RGB elements to it
not a lot so if you do want to customize
a couple of the life that you see on it
you can do that with no problem with the
software and if you're a PC gamer
chances are you might have already heard
of the 502 there are tons of PC settings
that you can access with the gaming
software so you can also customize this
to fit your way of using it you can even
add some weight to it if you want to
change up the way it feels so if you
want to have your mouse or a lighter
Mouse you can actually customize the
weight of this thing so it can feel just
right for you when you're using it all
in all though I absolutely love this
mouse and the fact that it's only 50
bucks is a great deal and with a nice
Mouse like that you're gonna need a
solid mouse pad now this one isn't
technically a must-have but it is a
great mouse pad with an awesome feature
this is the corsair mm 1000 qi wireless
charging mouse pad that is an extremely
long name but it's a cool mouse pad
nonetheless and this is a pretty
standard hard surface Mouse but it's got
a great size so you have a lot of room
to move around with but one thing that
makes it amazing is that right in the
top right corner
it actually works as a qi wireless
charging pad so if you have a wireless
charging device you can just throw it
right on top of there so while you're
using your computer you can keep your
phone nearby without having to look for
a cable or anything and even if your
device doesn't support wireless charging
courts it actually adds some options
inside of the box so that you can charge
pretty much any device that you can
connect it to so with this little add-on
piece you can plug it into anything that
uses a micro USB lightning cable or USB
type-c cable and charge it with the
mousepad and that to me is just like
next level I personally love devices
have multiple functions it works as a
regular mousepad but it also works as a
wireless charger and not to mention it
also has a USB port at the very top so
if you want to go ahead and plug
something in without having to touch
your computer this could be a really
convenient way to do that and now I
can't not mention a gaming headset so
right here we have the HyperX cloud
flight wireless gaming headset now if
you're not familiar with HyperX they've
got a pretty good reputation of making
great headsets without breaking the bank
what's different about this one though
it is that is now completely Wireless I
hope this is HyperX s first wireless
headset and they did a really good job
here not only do these sound great but
they also look good as well it's black
and red which is a pretty standard gamer
theme I do wish you could kind of change
the colors but you only get black and
red but the logos do light up and that's
kind of cool but most importantly these
sound great you can use it for your PC
and even if you want you can go ahead
and use it for the ps4 as well or even
your Xbox I don't know about my
compatibility there's like specific ones
that is compatible with I'll throw it up
so you guys can see that but the mic
sounds really good and that's something
that HyperX has been pretty good about
having good quality mics and the fact
that this one is detachable is really
nice so if you want to use it for your
PC to just watch movies you can do that
without having that mic sticking out and
if you want to just use it for gaming
and talking to your team mates you can
throw it on with no problem and this
thing also has 30 hours of battery life
so if you're having a really long gaming
session you're not gonna have to worry
about these dying on you I was great
about having this much battery life is
that even if you forget to charge it
chances are you're gonna still have a
lot of juice left when you come pick it
up I'm definitely happy with these and
it's super easy to recommend because
it's that good and this is kind of an
unofficial addition to this list but my
cloud flights are sitting on this
awesome Corsair st 100 RGB headset stand
and I absolutely love it I feel like the
hook that the headset stands on it has a
pretty good shape a lot of heads that
stands out there really dig into the
cushion of the headband and kind of
leave these bad marks on them I'm not
gonna lie this isn't the
I've ever seen but there are tons of
heads that stands out there that leaves
some really bad marks on the cushion for
your headband so I really like that this
one isn't so bad
but not only that this thing also works
as a USB hub it uses USB 3.0 so it has
two extra USB ports so like I said if
you don't want to go and plug something
into your computer maybe you just want
to have your dongle for your headset
right there on the headset stand you can
just do that or maybe your mouse dongle
you can do it right into that without
having to plug it into the back of your
computer I just like having extra USB
ports close by because it's convenient
and if you're inside UB lights these of
course have you covered now the last
thing on this list isn't really a
peripheral or anything like that is
actually a cable management tool this is
the j raceway and i've been using this
for pretty much all of my best setups
ever since I found out about it I feel
like one of the biggest challenges with
a desk is being able to keep it nice and
clean and definitely taking care of the
cables so that they're not just dangling
all over the place you want to have
something that keeps it nice and
organized and the J raceway does exactly
that so instead of having all of your
cables just running down your wall get
one of these put it in the back of your
desk mount it and then have all of your
cables run down one side all the way at
the edge of your desk that way it's nice
and neat and hidden trust me it'll make
a huge difference in the appearance of
your desk set up a J Raceway I'm telling
you guys is the way to go and my gamers
paradise that gaming PC that you see
there has so many cables attached to it
but I'm able to keep it nice and
contained thanks to one of these guys
it's not as flashy as everything else on
this list but it honestly is probably
the most important now I'm pretty glad I
could partner up with Nord VPN because
with everything being on the internet
these days I'm spending way more time
online to do everything from
communicating banking and handling other
things that require sensitive
information Nord VPN provides a virtual
private network with military-grade
encryption to protect your data from
potential online threats and in 2018 I'm
telling you the need for that is growing
more and more you guys know when to WWDC
and using the airport Wi-Fi as well as
the hotel Wi-Fi is something that I
don't really feel comfortable doing
anything on unless I have a fee
inactive I don't even like checking my
bank balance on my computer if I'm on a
public Wi-Fi network but having
something ordered VPN gives me all the
confidence in the world that my data
won't be stolen and used against me so
having something like this so clutch and
Nord VPN allows you to protect yourself
whether you own windows mac OS iOS or
even android and they're offering my
viewers 77% off a three year plan so if
you want to get yourself protected head
over to Nord VPN comm slash consumer and
use the coupon code consumer at checkout
to get yourself those savings but I'll
have links down below in the description
so definitely check that out
but guys hopefully you enjoyed this
video if you did be the cool guy or girl

accessories coming next so unless one
