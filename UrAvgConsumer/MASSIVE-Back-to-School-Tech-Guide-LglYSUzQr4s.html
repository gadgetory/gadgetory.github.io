and unfortunately it's that time of year
again folks it's time for back-to-school
but we got to give a huge shout to
Microsoft for sponsoring today's video
and sending us a bunch of awesome tech
from the Microsoft store to check out
for the new year and I was able to
personally pick out all the tech that
we've got here from the Microsoft Store
so we're gonna have some fun with this
one now we've got a ton of fun stuff but
I figured we'll start off with the
essentials now the first thing I have to
talk about is the laptop of choice and
that's the surface book to now I don't
know if you guys have seen some of my
previous videos where I talk about the
surface book to that I have but it's one
of my absolute favorite laptops and this
one right here is the 13-inch model
which is great for portability and if
you're not familiar with the surface
line there are a ton of configurations
so you can get this to be as powerful as
you would like the 15-inch model does
come with a dedicated GPU so if you want
to do things like playing games which I
really enjoy doing online you'll be able
to do that but what's great about the
surface book to line up is the ability
to detach the screen so this is a twin
one and you just hit one little button
and boom you can go ahead and pick up
the screen and pretty much use this as a
tablet and if you opt for the surface
pen you'll be able to do even more in
class by being able to take notes signed
documents do all kind of stuff even draw
on if you like they add quite a bit more
functionality so I definitely think it's
worth picking it up with the pen but not
only can you use this as a standalone
tablet but you can also put it right
back into the laptop but face it in the
other direction so you can yeah you see
that so you can do more with it like
this you can lean over draw take notes
however you want you got to worry about
holding the tablet in hand with the
surface book too you've got an awesome
keyboard that feels very comfortable so
if you're typing along essays you're
gonna feel right at home here this is
gonna feel very nice it also has a
really nice display so when you're
watching content or maybe even just
staring at the screen forever doing
whatever you're working on it'll always
look great while the surface book 2 has
an awesome trackpad I feel like a great
accessory to go with it is the Microsoft
precision Mouse this thing is probably
one of the most comfortable Mouse's that
I've
ever use it's got a really smooth
surface so the feel in the hand is very
nice and the ergonomics are there so it
feels very nice and comfortable in the
hand and you also get additional buttons
on the side so of course you can go and
go back go forward when you're visiting
websites so there's a lot to like about
this mouse and I definitely recommend it
the next up we've got the bose qc25 twos
now this is great for college students
because you guys know dorms can get
crazy noisy so if you want to just block
all that out just focus on your music
and study this is gonna be great because
the active noise-cancelling that you get
on these top-notch stuff some of the
best that you can actually get on the
market and it's great for regular
students as well maybe you're not in
college yet meet back in the day when I
was younger I would just walk to school
with my headphones on I didn't even have
remember those cheap Sony headphones I
used to wear back in the day just on my
commutes to school on the bus I used to
wear those so this can be really great
oh man if I had these I'm tuning
everybody out but no these are an
awesome pair of headphones because
they're crazy crazy comfortable and they
also sound pretty good and the active
noise-cancelling is just a total package
and it even comes with a carrying case
where's that thing here we go so this
carrying case is actually great for
protection so if you want to protect
this thing put it into your backpack you
not to worry about your books or your
laptop scuffing it up and for those of
you due for a new phone I highly highly
recommend the Samsung Galaxy S 9 or even
the s 9 plus and I feel like the s 9 + S
9 plus are the easiest phones for me to
recommend because they have practically
no compromises these things are super
fast and snappy they perform well so
whatever you're doing with it it's gonna
be able to handle it it also has a
really awesome camera so if you're out
taking photos with your friends you're
gonna get some really really great shot
it's also got that water-resistant so if
you have any accident you're not gonna
have to worry about this here it's also
got wireless charging USB type-c has its
headphone jack there's a lot you can say
even the display is amazing you can go
on and on and on about these these are
the most well rounded phones out right
now in my personal opinion so the s9 s9
Plus definitely something you want to
look into and you guys knew this was
coming we of course have to have a
portable charger let me keep this one
short this is from Belkin so 10,000
milliamp portable charger so it's gonna
be able to charge your device at least
three times over if it's one of the new
ones but this thing is great because it
has two USB ports so if you and a friend
both know to charge up make sure they
have their own USB cable and you guys
can go ahead and do that so just think
it's definitely great to have in your
backpack because who knows you might be
texting all day in class scrolling on
the gram your phone is dead by the end
of the day juice up baby now I think all
of those are absolutely essentials let's
talk about some of the fun stuff you can
take off to school and here we have the
most powerful console on the market
right now
the Xbox one X now listen I think this
is going to be great if you've got your
own dorm room you got your little TV set
up you want to chill with your friends
hang out play some games after you've
done all of your homework and your
studying and it's time to just relax
throw on the Xbox one X this thing's got
4k HDR you can use it to watch Netflix
Hulu all that kind of stuff and game on
it come on anybody's gonna be like deal
listen I want to go to so-and-so's place
he's got the Xbox one X you know then I
know
Xbox is in what you think when you think
back to school but listen I've been
stuck in a dorm room over bike breaks
that were a week long and I had
absolutely nothing to do so this would
have been a lifesaver if I had it back
in the day so this is something I
definitely recommend now if you don't
game on a console in your part of the PC
master-race
you want to level up your gaming you got
to get the HTC vive having friends over
playing virtual reality is a crazy fun
experience just watching them play is
hilarious so I definitely think that HTC
v is great if you've got a pretty decent
PC already and you're taking that off to
school HTC vive is definitely a nice way
to kill some time with some friends or
maybe you can make a
simulator so if you're homesick you can
just act like you're home with your VR
headset
you gotta be you gotta be pretty
talented and and sad to do that though
but if you don't game and you don't pick
up the Xbox one X and you still want
smart apps on your TV you should
definitely check out the Roku streaming
stick Plus now I recently got one of
these for my sister a lot and she's been
loving it ever since so I think this is
great if you go off to school maybe
you've got a pretty crummy TV I know I
had a pretty bad one and this would have
been nice to have Netflix on Netflix
when we're out there yesterday we're not
that old and with this thing being so
small and compact you can even go ahead
and take it to a friend's room and watch
on their TV or you can even bring it
over to the common space where multiple
people can take advantage of it so this
is definitely a nice option and it's not
super expensive right here we've got the
Bose Soundlink revolve now this is a
Bluetooth speaker it speaks for itself
if you guys are partying it up in your
room or maybe you just want to enjoy
some music this thing is a really nice
compact option that has amazing sound
quality this thing gets plenty loud and
has a ton of bass I'm like don't even
really know where the bass is coming
from that comes out of this but it's
really impressive but like I said
everything we saw on this video came
straight from the Microsoft Store so if
you want to check them out I'll have
links down below to everything you saw
in the description and of course you
guys know I'm going to have some
back-to-school backpack edition videos
for you guys to check out so keep your
eyes peeled for that but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
being a cool guy or girl that gives
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
