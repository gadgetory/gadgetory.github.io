consumer and after a ton of your
requests I'm finally going to be doing
an unboxing of the beats by dre your
beats so let's not waste any time let's
get right into it and alright guys here
we have the urbeats
now these are 100 bucks 99.95 but there
are hundred bucks pretty much and these
seem to be in direct line with the I
beats so it's pretty interesting to see
that they came out with this this is the
second time they did pull the move like
this like the executives being in the
same price range as the UM studios so I
don't know if they're trying to phase
out the I beats or what but here we are
these are your beats pretty standard box
um nothing special about this really so
let's just get to opening this right up
so we can pull off the plastic here get
rid of that alright so let's get this
out you can pull up and tab here and
here we have two your beats and of
course let's go to the side here see
what kind of stuff they have in this
package they should be pretty much the
same stuff as always let's see here
you've got the beats catalog with a
bunch of other products other beats
stone devices that they have and pretty
much this is it
you got your beats ticker warranty
information and of course your your
beats user guide so we can put all this
to the side and we're going to pull in
this little tab here to get these out as
you can see here they are but let's see
what's inside here first so I believe
this is the little case that it comes
with which is really nice I actually
really like this case this is pretty
cool let's see how to open it up oh okay
I'm gonna
family is I'm definitely a fan so let me
give you guys a close-up of this real
quick so here you have the carrying case
for the urbeats
like I said this is really nice um it's
got an interesting little flap here that
it's it's metal
I mean it's magnetic and you can um pull
it apart and as you can see it if fall
it flips right back together and it's
being sealed very tight so that's really
really cool so you don't ever have to
worry about your um your beats falling
out or anything so this is definitely
really nice I would use these with um I
would use this case for any other
headphones um in your headphones that I
have so I'm really a fan of this some
little thing that they've got here very
cool and it's going to offer some pretty
decent protection it's not a hardshell
case but it'll it'll keep it from
getting scratched or anything like that
or torn so this is pretty cool
definitely a big fan of this let's see
what else we've got this is the little
um pouch that holds the ear buds as you
can see it comes with a couple unlike
the Beats
Tours that has like every single pouch
filled up this one only has the bottom
three filled so you got to use the right
ear buds that fit your ears and that's
such a very very important part of
having in-ear headphones
having the right bud makes all the
difference
I used to think that certain um certain
ear buds but I first tried the eye bees
I thought they were bad until I um
switch the ear buds up and it actually
worked really well so I'll definitely
make sure you pay attention to that and
then let's get right to your beads pull
this out and here we have them let me
get this little thing off of it and well
alright boom slip it out
beat it alright so here we have the ivy
under your beads and I must say this is
a pretty interesting on let me give you
guys a close-up of what I'm seeing and
alright guys here we have two your beads
and I gotta say this is a pretty
interesting design on the material feel
similar to that of the mixers if you're
familiar with them so it's pretty tough
material here I can see this getting
some scratches I can imagine some
scratches coming up on the black so
something you might want to keep an eye
out for um at the top of course it says
your beats as you can see here and um
here we have the ear tips and they come
they come with a little fuzzy because of
the material that was packaged in if we
take that off you can see inside here
it's got a little chrome finish and it's
got that little red speaker part so put
this back on and not this isn't bad
overall this is a flat wire but it's
much thinner than that of the tours the
tours are a little thicker and wider so
these are um definitely a smaller
version of that and here we have the
inline remote there's no beats branding
on here anything it's just similar to
the cables that come with the on ear
headphones and over your headphones it's
got the similar design but it doesn't
have any of the Beats branding over here
and as we go further down here this does
have two beats branding and go further
of course this is the headphone jack
that you can plug into your device and
it says beats this doesn't have the
l-shape is straight so you can kind of
plug it into your device and have no
worries there and pretty much that wraps
up this close up guys these are the your
beats alright guys that pretty much
wraps up this unboxing overall I'm
pretty impressed so far this does seem
like a smaller version of the beat tours
I'm really really impressed by this
little case here out of everything here
I'm more so impressed by the case than
the headphones but these do feel and
look pretty nice so I'll let you guys
know how that is
I'm gonna have tons of comparison videos
between these two tours the eye beats
the power beats all that good stuff
I'll let you guys know how to stacks up
in comparison to the other in-ear
headphones that beats have so pretty
much that's it guys thanks for watching
