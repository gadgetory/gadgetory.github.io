consumer and it's finally time to let
you guys know if the Xbox one X is dope
or no and yes I know I promised a few
weeks ago when I unboxed it that I'd be
doing a giveaway and that time is
finally here so if you want to enter it
into the giveaway of a brand new Xbox
one X all you've got to do is make sure
you are subscribed to the channel don't
leave a comment down below and in two
weeks I'm going to be selecting a winner
and I'll probably be announcing it over
on Twitter so be sure to follow me there
if you haven't already or just check the
page it doesn't really matter but for
those of you who aren't interested in a
giveaway and you want to know if this is
worth your purchase here's what I think
after using it for about a month and of
course you know we've got to talk about
the design here and if you're familiar
with the 1ss design then you're pretty
familiar with the One X as well they
look almost exactly alike but the One X
is slightly wider and a bit shorter when
laid flat but the main difference you'll
see what the bodies here is with the
events the 1s has vents at the top
similar to that of the original Xbox one
while b1x has its vents on the sides and
I'm personally a fan of this because if
you need to stack things on top of the
line X it makes it a little bit less
worrisome especially if you're not
working with a lot of shelf space but
honestly the One X shows how different
it is from the 1s with what's under the
hood firstly the One X is 30% faster
when a 2.3 gigahertz 8 core processor
while the S is clocked at one point
seven three gigahertz the GPU also has
quite a bit more graphical power with us
coming in at 1.4 teraflops and the One X
with six we've also got eight gigs of
ddr3 RAM on the 1s and 12 gigs on ddr5
on the X now when it comes to storage if
you're looking at the 1s you've got
options between 500 gigabytes all the
way up to 2 terabytes but for the One X
currently there's only a one terabyte
model and this is something you're going
to want to keep a note of and because
we've got Xbox 1x enhanced games the
file sizes are gonna be much larger due
to all that extra graphical data which
means they're gonna be taking up way
more room on the hard drive which means
less space for extra games
this makes needing an external drive
that much more important with the One X
so you can have all the space you need
for those enhanced
and based on my conversations that the
folks over at Microsoft it's actually
beneficial to have your game safe on the
external hard drive as it frees up some
of the workload for your Xbox now I know
I just hit you guys with a ton of
numbers but for my everyday folks we
just want to know what this stuff means
what it basically translates to is more
power better graphics with much more
detail and better textures and you're
also gonna be getting smoother gameplay
thanks to that eight core CPU and even
faster load times now if you've got a 4k
TV you're obviously going to be able to
play all the 4k content at its full
resolution but what I like about the One
X is that even if you're still rocking a
1080p TV you're still gonna be able to
reap the benefits from all that power
under the hood so even if you aren't
rocking 4k you still have access to
faster load time improve texture
filtering and better frame rates now
I've been playing The One X with a 4k TV
and let me tell you guys the games look
really really good even performance you
solid everything that's been super
smooth on my end and that's kind of what
you expect with all the hardware that
this thing is working with hardware wise
Microsoft killed this machine but taking
a look at the software side of things
I do wish they did a few things a bit
differently they've made great strides
in simplifying the homepage but in all
honesty it still taking some time to
find what I'm looking for I think I'd
like it a bit more if everything were
laid out in front of me instead of being
on different pages that I have to either
go down to or go over to the right
everything in front of me would have
been ideal but one nice implementation
that I like is that when you're
accessing your games you'll be able to
find the Xbox 1x enhanced games by just
hitting this little tab so you can know
exactly which games in your library are
gonna be able to take advantage of the
Xbox one X's hardware I definitely think
that's a tab people are gonna want to
keep in mind and that actually brings us
to the next thing I want to talk about
which is games games are absolutely
enjoyable on the One X but if I'm gonna
be completely honest I do wish we had a
few more exclusives at our fingertips
Microsoft guys if you're listening just
bring back scalebound we didn't act like
the cancellation ever happen
promised but all jokes aside I do wish
the gaming lineup were a bit stronger
hopefully the hardware on the One X will
entice a few developers to come over and
create some cool games for it now the
big question is who is this for and is
adult or no now I personally think that
this is for the gamer who wants the
absolute best quality they can get out
of a console or that person who wants
this to function as their 4k
entertainment system this thing pretty
much covers every aspect of 4k content
delivery from 4k gaming to 4k streaming
and even 4k blu-ray playback and on top
of that it also supports Dolby Atmos so
you're gonna get the best audio quality
available there as well so this thing
pretty much covers everything from a
visual to audio perspective and it does
it all really well and the Xbox
functioning as an entertainment hub has
always been one of my favorite aspects
about the system especially if you pair
it with a Kinect which is pretty much
over our IP Kinect and while it's on the
pricier end of consoles available today
Xbox isn't limiting your purchasing
decision to the X as they still offer
the 1s for those who don't think they're
gonna need all the power of the X with
all the same games still available for
it but with all that in mind I do think
the Xbox one X is dope its hands down
the most powerful console out right now
it makes a great entertainment system
and it does lose a few points for not
having a stronger gaming library but
overall I think is a solid purchase but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one definitely
