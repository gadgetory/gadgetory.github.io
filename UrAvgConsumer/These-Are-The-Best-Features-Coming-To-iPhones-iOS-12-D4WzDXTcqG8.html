and today Apple announced iOS 12 at WWDC
2018 and these are the new features
you're gonna be excited about now the
first one is something that we've been
asking for for years and that is group
FaceTime and then we're gonna have more
than a one-on-one conversation we're
actually gonna be able to FaceTime with
up to 32 people I don't know where
you're gonna find that many people to
FaceTime but it is possible and that's
actually really cool and yes I know
there are third-party apps that already
do this but it's gonna be great to have
that feature built into the iPhone and
with this you'll be able to have set
groups that you can jump into a chat
with at any moment so if there are a few
people already in a group chat you can
actually jump into that chat which is
pretty cool something we haven't really
seen on the iPhone while ever uh-huh but
you can also start a whole new group
chat at once if you want from the app it
kind of similar to what we see when
Google hangout when one person is
speaking the app detects that and
they're the main focus of the chat as
they get a larger icon and you can even
use an emoji stickers or emojis which
I'll talk about in a second to kind of
spice up the chat so if you want to have
a little bit of fun with it you can
throw those into the FaceTime and even
if you don't have an iPhone as your
daily driver if you've got something
like an iPad or something with Mac OS
like a MacBook Pro or an iMac you'll
still be able to take part in a group
FaceTime now for that one moji I talked
about if you were a fan of Samsung's AR
emoji you're gonna like this one I think
they kind of did it better and memo G's
are pretty much an emojis but you get to
customize it yourself to make it look
just like you and it's actually really
customizable and inclusive you've got
tons of different hair styles skin
colors you can get really granular with
your changes which is awesome something
I really like to see so that you can
really get it to look like you and have
special things like maybe hats or
earrings you can switch this thing up
quite a bit to give it your own personal
taste and of course you can use these
just like you would an emojis you can
send them through iMessage and record a
video or you can send them as a sticker
but what's even cooler now is that you
can even use them as a mask during your
face time so he face time with your girl
and she doesn't want to get on camera
cuz she doesn't think she looks right
you can go ahead and put on that mode
and get back to shad and there's even
you an emojis like a ghost I think
they've got this new tiger a t-rex and
what's even crazier is now it has this
high-tech feature that they're calling
tongue detection so if you want to throw
that in there you definitely can and
another feature that we've all been
waiting for is finally here
and that's group notifications with this
if you have a ton of notifications from
a single app it won't clog up your
lockscreen or notification center so now
you don't have to worry about any more
clutter all your notifications will be
grouped right together and next up we've
got Siri Siri has gotten a few updates
nothing drastic but there are a couple
of things that'll make her a lot more
present whenever you're using your phone
and it feels like Apple integrated her
more into iOS in a way that makes her
feel more like an assistant she'll be
able to learn your behavior and check
your calendar for certain things so like
let's say you're running late for a
meeting
she'll automatically pop up with a
suggestion saying hey do you want to
text the person you're meeting and tell
them you're running a bit late which is
pretty cool or it may be in the mornings
too actually if you want her to order
your coffee so that you can go ahead and
go pick it up so those little bits and
pieces that an assistant would typically
do she's going to be able to do right
for you from your phone so she's gonna
be able to take a look at everything
you've got going on everything you put
into the system and give you suggestions
based on that before you even ask her -
some people might think it's a little
creepy I personally love seeing things
like that thing is gonna be awesome
but something that is even more exciting
is Siri shortcuts now we see these
shortcuts you're actually gonna be able
to have Siri speak to certain apps so
there's going to be that Siri
integration now one of the examples that
they showed is with the tile app I
personally use tile quite a bit to find
my keys
I always misplaced them and I always
have to jump into the app and that hit
fine and then try and locate it but now
with the seria integration I can just
call out to Syria and say find my keys
and she'll be able to have the alarm go
off on my keys and I can find it that
way that is a much much easier system
and you're gonna be able to do this with
a ton of different apps a lot more going
to be getting integration so I cannot
wait to see that platform grow and like
the shortcut name implies you're gonna
be able to do this cool thing where you
set up a bunch of different actions
based on the shortcut that you created
and I can see myself using this for a
routine that I set up from
bedtime so I can have Siri activate
bedtime with just one phrase and have
her speak to my shades where it brings
them down turn off my lights lock my
door using the August lock all these
different things that you would do
individually you can now have Syria do
with just one command instead of having
to jump into all of those different apps
and you're gonna be able to use just for
a bunch of different scenarios
I believe in children where if you're
heading home you'll just throw up your
Maps set your temperature to your house
to be ready for you when you get there
all kinds of cool stuff it's gonna be
interesting to see how setting it up
actually goes might require a bit of
work but maybe it won't be too bad and
now that you've got this focus on
digital health so if you're conscious
about that you're gonna finally be able
to start unplugging and spending less
time on your phone thanks to some new
updates now do not disturb you can
actually opt out of getting
notifications when you're going to bed
at night or even when you first wake up
in the morning so that you're not
distracted by those notifications and
you can actually do what you need to do
whether that's sleep or you get started
on your day faster I think we've all
been there when we first wake up and
we're sitting there checking a bunch of
meaningless notifications
hopefully with this we'll be able to
actually jump out of bed and get they
started and now we're gonna be able to
see just how much we're using our phone
with this new feature called screen time
and with this you'll be able to see how
much time you're spending on your phone
how many times you pick it up throughout
the day how long you're spending on
particular apps lots of information so
you can monitor just how much you're
using your phone and if you're one of
those people who feel like they need to
cut back a bit you couldn't be able to
do that because you can now enable
certain time limits on certain apps so
if you're spending too much time on IG
you can finally set some loans to that
if you want to just do an hour
throughout the day your phone will be
able to limit that and then it'll give
you a notification when you've got like
five minutes left to let you know you're
about to run out of time and this
actually works throughout multiple
devices so if you're gonna go and pick
up your iPad and try and cheat it's
gonna remember that you want that limit
and then set that for you now where all
this is gonna be extremely helpful not
only for us but it's gonna be great for
parents and helping monitor what their
kids are using and how much they're
using it you're pretty much gonna be
able to treat apps like an allowance so
after a certain amount you get cut off
which i think is going to be really
helpful for parents and last but not
least we've got some really cool
features with AR they showed a lot of
cool stuff like being able to have more
we player with AR games I actually got
to try that out myself and it was it was
really cool I'm not gonna lie so that's
gonna be a really awesome feature now
beyond gaming something I think a lot of
people will be able to take advantage of
is the measure app with this you'll be
able to scan 3d objects and measure
something based on segments or actually
even have it automatically measure
something so that you can get the exact
measurements and it's really cool this
is like next-level guys I personally
wish I had this while doing my house
renovations this would have been
something that would have been really
helpful instead of always trying to
track down some measuring tape to get
some measurements down this would have
been really nice so for me personally
I'm very excited to have this I think it
could be useful for a lot of people and
there are other cool things mentioned
like a new search tap for photos changes
to carplay news and stock apps and even
renaming iBooks to Apple books but the
ones I mentioned this video I feel like
are the ones you absolutely need to know
but what do you guys think of iOS 12
either there's some cool features that I
didn't talk about that you think are
really good let me know what's a comment
down below and I'll catch you guys in
the next one so then it's your average
consumer case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
