here re and today I have for you the
unboxing of the brand new iPad pro this
bad boy just released today so I'm super
excited to start unboxing this thing so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it and just so you guys know today
we're unboxing the 32 gigabyte Space
cream model this cost about 800 dollars
and then there's two other models it
jumps right to 128 gigabytes for 950
dollars and then you have another 120
gigabyte model with cellular for 1080
Gregston a suit we came here for there's
no way I can ever do that cool
unfortunately this only comes in space
grade gold and silver I was really
hoping for that rose gold but there's no
rose gold model for for this iPad pro
unfortunately just put this to the side
so when I first heard there was gonna be
an iPad pro it was like really do we
need an iPad pro we have the iPad then
we went to the iPad Mini and now there's
a pro let's see it whoa this thing is
huge this is 13 inches and cuz it I
didn't mention that before but this is
13 inches and it looks it it is very big
for an iPad and just give us some
perspective the iPad from the iPad air
was 9 inches so that's a big jump from
the iPad air 2 to this great so let's
put this aside because you know we have
to save the best for last I let's see
what's in the box so you get your
booklet in here presented by Apple in
California and it comes with booklet
and sicker x' of course
so regular white stickers and right here
we have the power doctor and around it
the lightning cable and this is your
basic lightning cable except if seems
pretty long which is always a plus to
have but yeah pretty much these are all
the accessories that come with the iPad
pro and speaking of accessories I was
super disappointed today when the iPad
pro release but the Apple pencil and the
Apple smart Keyboard did not release
with it so we'll have to be a couple
weeks for that but whatever what can you
do so nuts actually unbox the main
attraction and I'm just going to put
this up to the side first so we can
really give it the attention it deserves
great and now that our space is nice and
clear let's actually undress this bad
boy um let's start to get that nice
beautiful sound oh we had a long one too
because it's so so big so huge I just
put my fingerprint on it guys
I'll put that to the side and here it
goes you could probably see how my
finger prints by this point but yeah
we're all screened here
it looks really really nice it's huge I
can't get over how big this is this is
big as a textbook like in terms of the
length and this guy's packing four gigs
of RAM and Apple's new a 9 X processor
that pretty much just means it's going
to be pretty fast it also weighs about a
pound and a half which feels pretty
light to me but other people might think
it's a little heavy for a tablet so
let's take a look around it so at the
top we have a button to power on the
iPad and also two speakers which is
different this is pretty cool you have
two speakers at the top and when you
turn around you also have two speakers
at the bottom so this is gonna be great
for watching movies or watching your
YouTube videos um but yeah it's pretty
cool if you have four speakers this time
you also have your volume rocker and
this over here is pretty new because
actually the place we're gonna connect
the smart Keyboard so that's where the
connection will go so in the front we
have a fingerprint scanner and your
FaceTime HD camera great for FaceTime
and great for selfies it's kind of big
for a selfie though but you know we all
manage alright on the back we have an 8
megapixel camera as well so now let me
set this up and take a look at it you
see this thing what's all this thing is
massive it's huge as this thing is Matt
this doesn't make any sense this is huge
alright go ahead set it up okay so we're
all set up and I have to admit as I was
saying this thing up I felt like a pager
you know they have those like big
pallets and they're painting with are
like those people who hold silver trays
and like present on like entrees to
people yeah this thing is huge
um but Apple is really trying to target
creative people and artists with the
Apple pencil and this thing and even
trying to make it seem like a laptop
replacement so you have the smart
Keyboard so people could use it as a
laptop so my initial impression is this
thing is huge there is no denying a
massive
massive tablet but I have to admit I'm a
little bit drawn to it I love the four
speakers and I could really see myself
watching my youtube videos my makeup
tutorials on this and I really having a
good time with it
it's also nice and thin which is always
a plus and feels pretty light to me at
least but I have to admit I am
disappointed that I don't have the Apple
pencil or the smart Keyboard to use with
it it's totally part of the experience
so it just feels just like a huge iPad
at this point so let's know in the
comments section down below if you would
like a full review of the iPad pro
without the iPad pencil or the smart
keyboard or if we should just wait until
we get that so we can give a review of
the full experience so what about wraps
it up guys
this was your unboxing of the iPad pro
if you enjoy this video please feel free
to give me a thumbs up and I'll catch
you the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
