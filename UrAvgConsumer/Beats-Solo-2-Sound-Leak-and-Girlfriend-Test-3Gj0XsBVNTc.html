average consumer and this is my
girlfriend
hey and today we've got another sound
leak and sound isolation test aka the
girlfriend test but actually the
boyfriend test
okay we're switching it up a bit we're
gonna make this a boyfriend test so stay
tuned for that
so first we're gonna start off with the
sound leak test and what we're gonna be
doing this with today are the brand new
beats solo2 let's call it beats a little
squared fellow squared so - I feel like
so - just this easier
anyway we digress so let's not wasting
time scare it into it ba ba ba ba ba ba
ba so first we're gonna start off with
the sound leak test and with the
sounding test we're going to listen to
music at 50% 75% and then 100% to see
how much the headphones leak music at
those different volumes so now we're
just going to make sure there's no hair
blocking make sure everything is all
good alright guys we just want put it
out there also these tests are not
scientific whatsoever by no means by no
means we're a tempting - like I have
like independent dependent variables and
doing all that kind of stuff we just
want you guys to see like the
disappointing experience with these
headphones something you'd experience at
home or maybe outside yeah so that's
what these are all about so we're gonna
start with the sound leak test and we're
going to start off at 50% so are you
ready I am okay so let me move shorts at
50 and here we go
now I do hear it a tiny bit step away
from her a little bit and you can't
really hear it so I think that you know
these are on your headphones I did
expect it to leak a bit more but I don't
think this is going to bother anyone at
50% especially if you're outdoors
definitely not going to be a problem so
let's pump it up to 75% all right ready
yes here it is do hear it a bit more
here a bit more clearly than I did
before so I don't think it'd be a bother
to anyone does so mmm
hearing those lyrics so I still think
it's gonna be a really big bother but
people will definitely be able to hear
that if they're really close to you like
on the bus or something except if
something on the bus well there's a lot
of ambient noise a lot of background so
I still don't think it's gonna bother
anyone in a library or something where
quiet people will hear it but outside of
the quiet area not bad at 75%
so let's pump it up to 70 100% and see
how that goes
are you ready my dear I'm good all right
guys we don't recommend listening to
music at 100% cuz you can damage your
hearing so without further ado 100
percent obviously you can clearly hear
that oh my gosh you have to feel these
they have like a might even like the
Skullcandy where it has like the basic a
lot of basil oh my gosh you could feel
it like in the ear cups Oh tons of bass
there you have it so guys I wonder
percent of course you could hear it
really clearly yeah people will be able
to hear that definitely outdoor is not a
problem for sure but like I said indoors
definitely will be able to hear that so
now we're going to go into the boyfriend
test hey so she's gonna keep the
headphones on and I'm going to be doing
something that probably annoys her as
her boyfriend I get annoyed - okay guys
can be annoying so I'm gonna do what I
typically do that she has to be in a
blackout or you know do something else
while I'm doing it and that's actually
make a video if I'm going to review
something she doesn't want to hear me
going so honestly I'm starting over
what's going on everybody hey we don't
talk about it on YouTube it's all magic
I say perfectly alright guys so we're
gonna do the same thing here we're gonna
start off from 50% 75% and 100% and see
if she can block out my voice while
listening to her music so in the real
world if you don't want to hear someone
maybe somebody's having a loud
conversation you don't want to hear that
we'll see if these headphones will work
to block that out so you ready yeah so
here it is at 50%
what's going on everyone at your average
consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of this girl and let me start
off by saying she's an OK girlfriend now
I wouldn't I heard you all right so that
you heard me clearly
yes she's an OK girlfriend I'm gonna
fantastic girlfriend guys yeah so you
heard everything clearly I did pretty
same room I'm definitely here you gotcha
ok so now we're gonna do it at 75% right
let's do it alright guys don't get me
wrong she's very smart very beautiful
got tons of degrees but doesn't make me
sandwiches guys when I asked her like
babe make me a sandwich go to the
kitchen real quick won't do it
I did not hate you at all these are my
new go-to guys and ice has 75% so that's
really good so nothing at all not a
single word Wow so I'm gonna raise my
voice up a bit so I could be heard and
then I'm gonna do it at 100% we'll see
how that goes
are you ready I'm ready so here it is at
100% now guys here's the skinny she
won't do anything she's a lazy bum don't
know you don't want this don't go
looking for in the stores leave this app
leave this alone just know hey babe all
right so honey did you hear anything all
right so there you go so that was about
it it did really well for the silent
isolation so good stuff so I don't think
it's bad for a sound leave in sound
isolation definitely good stuff um you
could hear it in a quiet environment
you'll definitely hear the outdoors not
going to be a problem anywhere loud a
okay good stuff I'm not surprised
all right so that's about it for this
sound leak and sound isolation says aka
dentist boyfriend tip well say boyfriend
test
