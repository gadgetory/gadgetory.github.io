average consumer and I'm pretty short by
the title you can tell what video this
is going to be but today I'm finally
going to be doing the boom phones
phantom unboxing now it feels like you
guys have been asking me for this
forever
and more recently it's like every other
comment was a request for a review or an
unboxing of these so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it and alright
guys here we have the boom phones
phantom and like I said I've gotten tons
of requests for these what's special
about these headphones for those of you
who don't know is that these actually
have a built-in speaker on the outside
of the ear cups so it kind of transforms
into a boombox and that's kind of like
their slogan here the first headphones I
can transform into a boombox so that's
why they're called boom phones so it's
pretty interesting design they're really
big on sharing your music that's their
big thing so let's take a quick look
around the box and let's take a quick
look at the box for sure because here's
how mine came in I bought these from
Urban Outfitters online I if you guys
watch my vlogs you'll see that I went on
a manhunt for them in stores with no
luck but I ordered these offline and
they finally came in and as you can see
this is how the packaging came so very
disappointing but let's take a look
around the box like I said and you can
see pictures of the boom phones all
around more stuff here and what it has
up here is just some little features
some things that it can do and on the
side it has more features boom box mode
rechargeable battery and pure gear LED
mode indicator so it has like lights
high fidelity and phone ready so you can
use it with your phone all that good
stuff but now let's get to this unboxing
let me grab my unboxing knife alright
here we have it so let's slice this open
and here we are now I gotta say this box
feels pretty fragile so maybe that's why
it what led to this doesn't seem like
too strong a box but that's no biggie it
is just a box
puts unboxing knife away I don't know I
think someone must have stopped this or
something I don't know how this happened
but let's see here we've got some more
tape so we're gonna pull back out the
unboxing knife get that and as you can
see it has the big boom phones logo
right in front of the box that's about
it let's open it up and of course inside
it says boom phones here we have the
carrying case with that boom phones I
logo thing so let's take this thing out
looks like an egg and that's pretty much
it for the box nothing else inside so it
didn't take this close it up now the box
doesn't seem that bad is I just really
think that somebody wasn't careful with
it so here we have the egg shape boom
phones phantom case and it's a pretty
nice case it's a little large but I'm
assuming these aren't small headphones
anyway and on the side you can see this
little zipper and it's got a pretty cool
little logo I'm sure you got the quick
close-up and here you guys can see a
quick close-up of the little zipper I
just think this was pretty cool but not
bad nice little color scheme black and
red very good and alright so this thing
has two straps at the top you have a
small one here I guess to just hook on
to something and then a bigger one I
guess so you can hold on with your hands
kind of hold on to it like this so it's
got two little ones to UM straps here
now let's open this thing up
see what's inside all right so you got a
couple of things here first off the
start with these all right so first
thing we've got here is your card tells
me you're a serial number and tells you
about your warranty policy where you can
go figure it out tell you to boom some
phone site and you've got some stickers
everyone loves including stickers now so
that's cool and let's see
they have velcro in the case and you got
this little pouch pull these out so you
got a couple of things inside of here
let's see so first this is the USB cable
it's a mini USB so it's not micro like
most phones are it's mini USB most new
phones anyway you got this little clip
so I guess you can clip onto one of
those straps that you have up there and
pretty much this is it this is a cool
little pouch I like this so you can just
put all your accessories in here I
really do like this this is really cool
part of the case um and here we have the
cable and let's check them out
and here we have a inline remote sort of
let me give you guys our close-up and
here we have the inline remote and it
seems to have a volume control on the
side says boom phones you have a mic
here and I guess this is so you can
answer calls I'm not sure if this is
going to work as a play and pause button
you know how certain my inline remotes
have a plain pause and not nothing else
I don't know if this is going to work as
one and it's gonna also answer calls and
I don't know if it's going to work with
the iPhone or the Android phones I'm not
sure which one it's particularly made
for I'm pretty sure both but I'll let
you guys know in the review how it works
exactly
inside you'll also see that it includes
a quarter inch adapter so that's also
there good stuff and of course we have a
straight cable nothing special about
this cool little design on the Jack's
nothing too special but nice I'm glad
that they are tangle free these are
thick enough to be tangle free and
alright now to the star of the show what
you guys have been waiting for
put the boom phones phantom so we can
just pull these off and here we have
them and I you know I'll admit guys
these look pretty nice and they feel
pretty soft and yeah I'm a fan and I
like this so good job - boom phones and
let's see this is a little sticker that
they have here so boom there you go and
those are all the instructions that it
comes with so not bad no not a lot of
paperwork here only these little cards
and stickers and that little warning
sticker so not bad and all right so let
me give you guys a close-up alright guys
so here are the boom phones phantom now
these like I said these are some really
nice-looking headphones they um they're
pretty soft the headband feels great I
can't complain about that and questions
feel pretty soft as well inside you see
it says phantom and you've got the
little clickable bombs right there you
got your power on an off switch and when
you power it on this is what happens and
I guess when you click it lets see
changes color so you can change I guess
this is between the different modes the
boombox mode and normal stuff like that
so let's turn that off and of course
this is where you can charge it this is
the mini USB and of course you guys can
see the grill here this is where the
speaker is it's got some pretty cool ear
clubs as far as rotation it can't rotate
that much but it rotates enough for you
know fitting anyone's head I'm sure
alright and I must say this is this is
it and part of the design says boom
foams all over the actual headphones so
that's pretty cool says boom phones
everywhere boom and alright guys that
pretty much wraps up my unboxing I am
pressed by the design of these I do like
them I must say I was take a fold but
they can't but that's enough I'm really
impressed guys good stuff stay tuned for
the review the girlfriend tests all
good stuff might have to think a little
outside of the box for this girlfriend
test since it does have some speakers on
the outside might want to test that out
as well and pretty much that's about it
