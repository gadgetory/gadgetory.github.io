consumer and CES 2017 had a ton of cool
tech products but I couldn't help but
focus on one of my favorites new Sony
extra bass headphones now huge shout out
to don't remember his user name but you
saw it too this guy who kind of put this
thing on my radar I had no idea they
even came out saw his tweet and had to
run over to the Sony booth so let me
introduce you guys to the new Sony xb9
50 and 1 now these look familiar that's
because they're the upgraded version of
the sony xb9 50 bt but to give some
background to some of you who aren't
familiar with the predecessors of these
headphones they're one of my favorite
headphones of all time because overall
they're a great package they've got some
of the best bass you'll experience hands
down they come in at a very very
welcoming price they retail for about
200 but i usually see them on amazon for
a hundred bucks and even lower at times
and they've also got these amazingly
soft ear cushions which makes long
listening sessions not a problem and
they're bluetooth so it's a lot of all
my favorite things smashed into one but
I did have some complaints like them not
being foldable and that is actually
something they addressed with the new
version so if laying them flat didn't
really help out in terms of portability
for you you can now fold them so that
they take up a bit less space in your
bag now something I like is that Sony's
finally including a travel pouch with
the N ones and it makes sense because if
you're gonna invest in some headphones
you should have something that protects
it so I'm glad to see that here now one
of the biggest changes and upgrades of
the new end ones is the addition of
active noise-cancelling so with the
press of a button you'll get some new
noise canceling features and trying it
out on the show floor was actually
pretty decent now I wouldn't expect any
both QC 35 or maybe even sony MDR 1000x
quality but it does the trick I was able
to isolate the show floor pretty well
and it really helps you to focus on
getting that nice clarity and bass so
you were able to just focus on your
music and not hear all the stuff going
on around you now like with every other
headphone with the addition of active
noise-cancelling you see a little bit of
a price hike and luckily this is only a
$50 price hike so instead of that $200
price
you're gonna get it for 250 I'm really
hoping that n ones following the
footsteps of the 950 BTS and you can
find them for much less than the retail
price maybe we can find these for about
150 or something that would be awesome
hopefully after a few months of them
being out we'll start to see those sale
prices and in talking about being out
these are scheduled to be released in
spring of I guess 2017 we don't have a
hard date yet Alex I didn't find out a
date but spring 2017 so in the upcoming
months and let's see there's also a new
app so with this new app you're going to
be able to change the kind of sound
quality that's you're going to be
getting out of these so you can change
up the sound if you don't like a lot of
bass you can I don't know why you'd buy
this if you don't like a lot of bass but
if you don't like a lot of bass maybe
you just want to have these be like your
overall headphones you want to tune down
the bass you can actually do that with
the new app that's gonna be coming out
now in terms of battery life I was told
that this will get 22 hours without
active noise-cancelling and 18 hours
with it and for those of you who don't
care about active noise-cancelling but
you do want these headphones in a
foldable form factor there's gonna be
the Sony xb9 50 b1 which is basically
the exact same thing minus the noise
canceling and for those of you who may
have purchased the 950 bt is based on my
recommendation do not fret you're not
getting screwed over at the fact that
there's a new model out now it's a
pretty minor update that addresses some
of my complaints from the old one so you
don't have to really worry and you
probably got it at a much better price
than 250 bucks
but that's about it guys hopefully you
enjoyed this video if you plan on
getting the 950 enones let me know if a
comment down below and i'll catch you
guys in the next one so then it's your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
