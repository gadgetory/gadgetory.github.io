consumer and today I've got another
comparison video for you guys of the
beats by dre your beats and I beats now
I don't think the I beats are still
being sold but if you already have a
pair we'll see in this video if it's
worth it to upgrade to the urbeats so
let's not wasting your time
skit right into it and all right guys
here we have the eye beads and the your
beads and of course I like to talk about
the case that they come in they both
come in the same a similar case I
believe the eye beads have like
different branding on it but it's
essentially the same case there's a
really big fan of this kind of case it's
really soft um it doesn't take up too
much room you can throw your headphones
or earphones in here and kind of just
put them away and it's really simple the
only thing I have I against this case is
that it can be a little difficult to
open it could kind of just jerk around a
bit like that but it's kind of easy if
you just pry it open like this but I'm a
big fan of these on this case and I'm
really happy that they both have this
kind of case compared to some of the
hard shell cases that the tours or the
power beats come in now of course let's
talk about the earphones themselves
first thing we want to talk about is the
design does the by beads I'm not too
crazy about them to be honest they're
okay looking they're pretty solid I like
the little metal feel I got they they
feel pretty sturdy I do like that
they're um you know they've got this
kind of look but that to me the metal is
just a little too shiny I'm not too
crazy about it myself they're not bad
looking but it's just not my kind of
style whereas your beads has got a more
plain look going for them they look
pretty good um reminds me of an ear in
ear version of the mixers based on the
material that it's actually made out of
um really a fan of these I think that
these are pretty simple yet they get the
beats image cross with the red being
black without any of the extra shiny
that's going for it now the next thing
we're going to want to talk about of
course is the actual
cables themselves the eye beads have a
pretty standard in ear cable they're
pretty skinny they don't are they're not
tangle free so when you're throwing them
back into that pouch you gotta be
careful not to crumple them up because
they will be tangled I've had that issue
tons of times where I've put them in my
pocket or my little case and they've
gotten all crumpled up and it came out
tangled and I had to untangle it which
is just crappy but the urbeats you won't
have that issue whatsoever
I've fumble these up come out they come
out just fine and they're ready to go so
tangle-free is definitely a bonus here
so I definitely think that in the design
department that over all be your beads
has a lot more going for it it's also
got the pretty standard inline remote
that most of the beats are do carry now
this doesn't have any beats branding on
it but it does have the same design
whereas the eye beats has this little
kind of remote where it's not a bad
looking remote it's fine but um I just
like the fact that this goes well with
the other beads and another thing about
the IDs is this thing jingles quite a
bit I don't know if you guys can pick
that up but when walking around that is
quite a problem I'm not too happy with
that you people hear when I'm talking to
them on the phone and using this as a
mic and it's just not really a good
experience so I think the overall design
aspect definitely goes for your beads
and in the durability Department I also
have to give that to the ear beads as
they do provide a thicker cable so
you're going to be a little less worried
about a snag or anything like that due
to the stronger bigger cable whereas
this has a really thin cable and you
know you can feel like you're going to
tear this at any moment so definitely
going to give that to the urbeats as
well like I said though the actual
earbud part this is pretty solid I'm I
like that about the I beat very solid
but the your beauty of solid as well so
even though these are solid they don't
have a plus over these because these are
also very solid now in terms of comfort
I gotta say that this is probably an
equal match up here
boots are the eye beats are a bit
smaller so this won't be as much of an
intrusion into your ears as the urbeats
sometimes when using the Europe beats I
did feel the material of the actual ear
um the earphone so that was just weird
sometimes it wasn't a bother or anything
but it did feel a little weird where
it's just a smaller you won't really
feel that they've got the overall same
shape where it's you know pretty
standard like this as you can see it's
pretty standard shape but because this
is a little smaller it might feel a
little more comfortable
but the urbeats are a bit lighter this
does have that like metal feel to it
it's not metal of course but it does
have a little more heft to it and these
do so on I don't know they both have
their plus and minuses but I do think
that this is pretty equal in terms of
comfort and now the last and probably
most important part is the sound quality
and to be honest with you guys I had to
listen really really closely to see if
there was a difference between the two
and there really just isn't enough of a
difference for me to recommend one sound
quality over the other um when I first
tried out the IB to friend gave them to
me and the earbuds were smaller than the
standard earbuds that I'm used to these
are the small ones and I either
typically use the medium earbuds and
within ear headphones you want to make
sure you're using the right size earbud
because the seal is very important when
you get the right seal and making sure
there's no gap between the earphones and
your ears you'll get the best sound
quality out of your earphones but I was
using the small one and that led to a
big gap and I wasn't getting the best
sound quality because music would leak
out and the sound would just come out so
I was ready to give this a bad review
but luckily I changed the earbuds up and
I didn't notice that it made a huge
difference but um overall I gotta say
when I changed the earbuds to match the
urbeats they sound pretty much the same
I'm sure maybe an audiophile would be
able to pick up pick apart the
difference between the two but as an
average consumer someone who's not
really an audio engineer or have a crazy
ear for stuff like that the sound
quality is not going to be a big
difference
I didn't notice it myself after
listening real close and I still can't
even come up with something so I got to
say that these are pretty simple equal
in terms of sound quality now the sound
quality on both of these do you know
they're both very bassy they both sound
good
in comparison to some other earphones
like the tours they probably won't have
as good a vocals they've had one sound
that's clear but on their own regards
they both sound really nice they both
have a ton of bass if you're into that
and I was pretty happy with the sound I
got out of these so I think your average
consumer won't have an issue with these
if you're an audiophile these might not
work for you it all depends pretty much
that wraps it up guys it's been a quick
comparison video of the IBS and your
beads oh one more thing before I go I
wanted to let you guys know I've seen a
ton of comments saying that your Beach
is for HTC phones eye beads is for
iPhones and iPods no they're all the
same they work exactly the same this
only works as a plain pot with the play
and pause for I um Android phones HTC or
not the same goes for this it playing
pause is all you get from the inline
remote and for iPhones this is fully
functional play pause volume up down
forward back all that stuff you get all
that with both of these these function
exactly the same when it comes to the
inline remote when it comes to Android
and iPhone so one is not geared towards
Android devices when it's not geared
Typhon devices just wanted to clear that
up for you guys and pretty much that
wraps it up guys um if you enjoyed this
video please feel free to rate comment
and subscribe and if there's anything
that I missed and you guys want me to
clarify be sure to let me know and I
will do so in the comments and thanks
for watching guys it's your average
consumer and I'll catch you guys in the
next video till then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
