have a very special video it is just
birthday today so I decided to do a
video for him so that he can enjoy his
birthday festivities and I have to worry
about recording video but also because I
think would be really helpful for those
of you who are buying gifts for tech
lovers so here are three ideas you can
use when trying to shop for tech lover
the first idea is to upgrade something
that they would love so whether it's
like a new pair of headphones or a
backpack whatever it is that they've
been using maybe for a year or so it is
a new version upgraded or if there's a
better version upgraded at one cool
suggestion I have you guys in terms of
upgrading someone's our headphones these
are the Sony xb9 50 and one jen has
raved about this on the channel i think
he has made like three or four separate
videos on them so he loves these
headphones these are the upgraded
version of the BPS so the person you're
buying a gift for has a pair of
headphones that maybe wireless but not
noise cancelling this is a way to
upgrade them they are on sale actually
which is why Fortin omits list - they
used to be $249 and now they are I think
178 so that's like a $71 difference for
you guys and that's awesome what a leak
dead ones and everything else mentioned
here in the description and just
birthday gifts in the upgraded category
is going to be visible to you guys know
he loves his electric keyboards and he
loves his v board he's had his report
for I think like three or four years at
this point
so shout is e board for sending out this
V boar to to him he's going to love it
he's going to go crazy when he sees it
now I'm going to go get it so this is a
zebra - blue he's going to be so amped
and he sees this ever since he saw the
released he was so excited because this
one is several pounds lighter than his
old one I think the old one was like 25
pounds and this one is 16 pounds so 9
pounds lighter which is going to be a
huge difference in terms of being able
to take it everywhere I think it even
goes like a farther distance on a single
charge and it charges fast there's just
so many upgrades to this thing it also
has a headlight in the tail light so you
can ride this thing with no problem and
the reason why he also loves the board
over like his other Electric skateboards
is because it's so intuitive you can
just move forward and back by pressing
on the pads here so there are two pads
here and you can go forward with with
the one that's in front of you and go
back with the other one or stop it so
super easy your hands are free you're
just going forward and back to like move
and
so your turn is so so easy he's going to
love this so much but I'll link more
information about the Seaboard to in the
description
chances are Jed is going to make another
video on this he's going to just join us
so thanks again to the guys over at V
Board for sending this my way and doing
it in time I'm actually recording this
while he's over at e3 secretively Soho
they had to really get this here fast so
thank you guys again that's another
thing if the audio our lighting is off
just cut me some slack
it's I'm a one-man team here and the
second idea is to splurge so this um
that your tech lover really really wants
but either can't afford or feel really
guilty getting there's your chance to
get them it as a gift
and when I say splurge I don't mean like
take your whole check and spend it on
that person do like a combined group so
my sister and I we do this with every
single gift we give my parents we just
split the cost
but for Jed the splurge is the Sonos
play 5 so this big guy in front of me is
this one was play 5 I have heard about
this thing non-stop since he saw it and
tested it invest buy it's a speaker
that's part of a home theater system
judge continues to test and has tested a
ton of really really good speakers but
this one blew him away it has really
awesome bass you can connect multiple of
these to have like multi room sounds and
it also connects through Wi-Fi not
bluetooth and that's good because you
don't have to worry about keeping the
device close to the speaker when you're
playing it or you know having range
issues it goes right through Wi-Fi and
you can just play it in different rooms
walk around with your phone if you're
playing from your phone and not worry
about disconnecting from the speaker
it's $500 which is just insane so he
would have felt really guilty buying it
he already has a nice home theater
system he has so many speakers so he
loved it and kept talking about it so I
decided to just just get it waste the
money and get by no he'll be really
really happy with it and the third idea
is to add to collection of their so
you'll find that tech lovers have like a
specific tech that they really like for
Jenna it's like headphones and backpacks
or it could be maybe gaming controllers
or games whatever it is just add to
their collection I think that's
something that they really really value
so another gift I got so jet is the
freedom gundam metal build you guys know
how much he's obsessed with guns uh so I
figured let me just add another thing to
this collection
I don't know why encourage this or
unfortunately
here right now there were two options on
Amazon there was one for prime gainer in
two days for five hundred dollars and
then one to get here I think July 15th
for $200 so you guys know which one I
chose I'm not spending $500 on a Gundam
and if you've gotten to this point in
the video and still don't like any of
the options obviously you can get them
an Amazon gift card like Amazon has so
much tech like so many different things
so give them an Amazon gift card let
them go wild on shopping spree and I
think that's really one of the best
gifts to give someone when they really
don't know what they want or do pretty
much have everything give them a gift
card let them pick it off themselves and
everybody's happy and that's pretty much
it thank you guys so much for watching
please make sure you thumbs up this
video leave a comment down below some
happy birthday on here on Twitter
Instagram wherever you can't have too
many birthday wishes and he'll see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
