consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the v-moda XS I'm currently
in the Dominican Republic but I figured
this would be a really awesome spot to
get some footage for the XS and show you
guys some of the scenery here so let's
not wasting your time let's get right
into it and alright guys here we have
the v-moda XS this newest headphone in
the v-moda line and mininova motive for
producing awesome build and sound
quality but let's see of the XS lives up
to the name the XS carries on with the
traditional v-moda design but probably
in the most compact design you'll ever
see for an on-ear headphone I used to
praise my v-moda m100 for having such a
low-profile design but aside by side
comparison with the XS would fool you
into thinking the m100 were a large pair
of headphones of course by carrying the
traditional design you also get the
expected build quality and durability
once you have these in your hands you
know you have a premium product and
don't let the size of the headphones
fool you as they've been under military
grade testing for quality and durability
it has a steel flex headband that can
withstand up to 10 flat bends and even
the cables kevlar reinforced which is
some of the stuff that tires helmets and
other highly durable products are made
of the cable can withstand over 1
million bends and also includes a play
and pause button for Apple and Android
devices the button can also be used to
answer our end calls when being used
with the built-in mic on the cable the
input that goes into your device comes
in at a 45 degree angle which is perfect
for use with any device especially those
with cases on it while still on the
subject of durability and protection you
also receive a hard shell carrying case
with excess which is small very small it
also includes a carabiner clip if you
want to attach it to something while
traveling here it is compared to a
couple of other objects to give you guys
some perspective such a small case has
many advantages as it increases the
portability of the headphones by
allowing you to throw them into a bag or
backpack with no problem at all and I
found that it even fit into my jacket
pocket
and because of Atari shell case you
don't have to worry about impact damage
and the case is also lined with a nice
suede material and also includes straps
to hold your cable when not in use now
back to the headphones themselves they
have a click fold design which as the
name suggests produces a click sound
when folded in these metal hinges
eliminate the typical worry of looseness
from wear and tear this design really
helps decrease the overall footprint of
the excess when folded in like this and
I have no issue getting these into even
my pants pocket the overall size of the
headphones give it a very stealthy feel
and helps it to remain very low-profile
the small frame creates a very
form-fitting headphone and looks to
eliminate any large gaps between the XS
and your head now you would think this
could lead to a tight fit and some
comfort issues but you get the exact
opposite the XS almost feel as if they
aren't even on your head due to how
light they are the clamping force on
these will keep them on your head but
won't be a burden on your ears which is
great as this tends to be an issue with
most on ear headphones after listening
for a while I do however wish it was
just a bit tighter so I could feel a bit
more secure with it but that could lead
to a trade-off with comfort the
adjustable steel sex headband is also
welcoming to those who have normal to
advanced head sizes the ear cut type of
memory foam cushion which also helps for
long listening periods as you can see
here based on their size they stay true
to the XS name but I still found that
they covered my ears completely there
are also customizable shields on the
outside of the ear cups and if you order
these from v-moda website you can get
customizable shields with text or an
image for free also on each ear clip
you'll notice a headphone jack for
sharing your music with someone nearby
and when you aren't using the feature
you can plug it in with the Nuvi cork
and now for the moment of truth let's
talk about the sound quality and I'll
just start off by saying these have the
best clarity I've experienced on an
on-ear headphone vocals and instruments
come in very clearly and these aren't
very big on bass but it's definitely
present you won't get any head rattling
action but it definitely is good enough
for the likes of hip-hop dubstep and
other bases on Rah's and even though
they're not very bass low tone sound
came in surprisingly deep I would
however look into
something like the m1 hundreds if big
bass is really important to you I was
also very surprised at how loud these
headphones can get when pumped up even
as a bass lover I have to say that these
are probably the best on ear headphones
I've used so far these are great for a
multitude of genres especially those
with lyrics and vocals to be heard the
XS have a ton of great things going for
it and I highly recommend it to anyone
looking to pick up a pair of on ears in
the $200 range it is definitely worth
the price in my opinion and I feel as
strongly about these as I do the M 100
with the only difference with these
being the XS doesn't have as much bass
and they don't have any comfort issues
whatsoever if you're looking for some
under-the-radar headphones with some
great sound quality these are what you
want but now that you guys have my
recommendation let me show you what they
look like on so here you have it here's
the front view and very small coarse
investin see very tiny has been and
there's little gaps there's like little
to no gaps between the headband the ear
cups everything to your head so this is
really cool this is what the motor was
going for and here you have it it goes
that's it
and here it is around the neck very
small very very lightweight I can
definitely go around with different not
feel like I'm bothered I can turn my
head all kinds of way so pretty good
stuff and pretty much guys this has been
my review of the v-moda XS I'll of
course have links down below in the
description if you want to pick these
out I definitely recommend it and if you
