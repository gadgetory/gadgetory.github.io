consumer and today we've got something
really interesting on the table a paper
airplane controlled by your smartphone
and you guys actually decided that this
should get its own separate video
during my last massive tech unbox and
you all voted and here we have it this
is the powerup 3.0 smartphone controlled
paper airplane now when they sent this
package to me it came with three pieces
the actual plane itself some paper
templates over here and I think a stand
to hold the actual plane once it's all
folded I've got no clue with my unboxing
knife is so we're gonna be using this
little finger cutter thing by nimble it
works though oh snap this thing cut the
box - it's pretty far and you guys
wouldn't believe it but this is the
actual body of the paper airplanes
things made out of carbon fiber
it's stupidly skinny but let's take it
out of the box
oh snap but it also comes with a few
templates these are different papers to
actually fold and you can fold them in
different ways I think they have the
instructions right on them alright so we
finally got it loose and this is pretty
much it
so what we're looking at over here this
is the nose of the plane and right here
is also where you have your Bluetooth
module and this thing charges with a
micro USB cable and you get about ten
minutes of flight time over 200 feet
which is really really good for
especially for something this big and in
the back here you've got your propeller
so this thing is what's going to give a
juice keep it going and it's got this
little thin here that's actually going
to be tilted using their smartphone now
one of the things you'll notice is that
there's a little QR code right at the
top of the polling paper so you go ahead
and watch an instructional video on how
to fold these up so I've got my video
right here and let me get started
alright I'm a fly this thing alright
guys so here we have me powerup 3.0 and
let me tell you it's been a month since
we filmed the unboxing but we finally
have perfect weather since it's summer
to actually take this out and fly it and
we got this really really big open field
we're at a park and we are going to see
how this thing does ok guys so there are
three steps that we need to take before
we actually start flying this thing so
they want us to trim the rudder I'm
supposed to get it straight it seems to
be veering towards the left alright so I
think I got the rudder now to trim the
elevators I actually have to throw it
you got this day you catching this
about to send this thing off into space
man let's give this another shot
ho yo did you see that ok guys so I
think I did just about everything that I
need to to get it set up to fly so let
me double tap this to unlock it woo
alright so I'm cleared for takeoff let's
uh let's do this alright guys here we go
I think I've got it now I've got the
perfect throwdown
you ready for this guys watch the arm
it's coming this is gonna be the one
here we go right angle boom alright here
we go
or whatever and now it flies come on
whoa come on give me something come back
home I didn't even try that side so I
feel like one thing that makes this kind
of hard is when you're throwing it you
have your fuel and your throttle that
you can control on the smartphone so
you're using this to control your speed
but I find myself one thing to look at
this guy rather than this and it just
got a feel like it just kind of throws
off the whole thing but let's let's give
it another shot all right come on don't
give up don't get flow let's go let's go
do you see this yeah come on home ding
it was up for a while bow ride off into
the sunset baby go on turn around oh
come back come back oh it's working now
so alright so the wind is definitely our
enemy just gonna have to wait it out a
little bit oh we're running out of juice
so here this is the last one oh let's go
come on come on
come back come back come back up up oh
it's just gave love alright guys so that
was fun but you definitely need no wind
so that it doesn't mess up your flight
we got the best result when there was no
wind but this just has me wanting to go
out again and try this when it's I guess
a calmer day in terms of the wind do I
recommend this it's not very expensive
so it's worth giving it a shot I have
links down below in the description for
you guys to check it out but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully enjoyed it if you did be the
cool guy or girl that gives it a thumbs
up I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
