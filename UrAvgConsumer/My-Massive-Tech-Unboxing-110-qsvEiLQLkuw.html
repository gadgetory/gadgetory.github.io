consumer and it is time for another
massive tech unboxing video we've got a
bunch of packages now this time around
there's a lot of stuff that came from
the PIO box so I don't know what exactly
is inside of here but we're gonna find
out together so you know grab your
snacks drinks let's chill for a bit all
right Ari you know what the deal is how
you gonna forget we're living in this
one you have to pick the hardest one to
get alright so this is from the peel box
and huge shout out to all the companies
who sent something over to be featured
on the channel
that's what's all good oh all right so
this is a wireless smart plug it's a big
box for a small wireless adapter here
let's see oh okay so this is it this is
the pure gear wireless power switch so
has this code here on the side which
means it has homekit capabilities so
that means you can use this with homekit
see who's gonna be able to control it we
can do that right from your iPhone and
what I really like here is that this
thing is really small and compact so
usually these smart plugs are really big
and bulky this one is not and I like
that alright so now onto the next oh oh
thing is a special edition so this is
radiant historia for the Nintendo 3ds
it's an RPG it's surprising that there
are any games still coming out for the
Nintendo 3ds but this was actually just
released you guys know I'm a huge RPG
fan so I want to get I wanted to get my
hands on this I'm actually pretty
excited it looks like it has a couple of
cool stuff inside so dope 3d s keeping
it alive
well okay this is from Satoshi now this
is a 75 watt multi port power hub okay
so this is kind of like the anchor one
that I featured not too long ago but
this one looks like it has a bit more
going on now so test you make some
pretty good stuff yeah
they designed their stuff to work really
well with me Apple products so of course
this is some space gray stuff right here
notice looks clean feels nice so what I
like about this already it's got USB CPD
so that's power delivery that means it's
gonna be able to charge up iPhones fast
charge it's gonna be able to also charge
up MacBook Pros or any other laptop that
uses a USB C port to charge so it's got
that power here it's also got a quick
charge 3.0 port over here as well as two
other ports with 2.4 amps so you got a
lot of juicer you can do a lot of quick
charging which is nice
usually there's only one quick charge
slot so this is pretty cool alright so
lucky be more Satechi so oh ok so these
are the clamp hubs that we showed last
time but these are in space gray so
these are gonna work well will be iMac
Pro so this one is from Tech armor ok
tech armor what you sending me okay
screen protectors for the iPhone 10 so
these are tempered glass yes
but tempered glass won't protect us for
our iPhone tens if only we didn't wait
if only you didn't wait to open these
things up but boom here it is yeah
yeah we missed out we didn't have to pay
for it
they were too expensive a pit from the
apple store okay so let's see we got
this one from oh this is from ghost
attack okay so here we have them so
these are the rapture headphones these
are wireless bluetooth headphones so I'm
curious let's see these are way more
comfortable than I expected I thought
that these were gonna be you know theirs
yeah cuz they're square you know you
don't expect it but you don't see the
normal kind of air cushion padding over
here but when you actually put it on not
bad not bad
I'm gonna have to go ahead and power
these on try them out and see if they're
worth their money but what do you guys
think what do you think guys to give the
design this is different looking so it's
kind of cool
oh and we've got a case to go with it so
it's like a leather it's like a leather
case with some red lining on the inside
alright this is yours it's for home
hmm another box so this is preventive I
see what they sent this time all right
three times more powerful than the
competition fast Wireless try it's a
wireless charger go got just displayed
are you serious oh there's a whole demo
going on and everything this is insane
okay guys so I think vent --iv needs to
win an award here for an awesome
unboxing experience here they've got a
demo video going that you can control
hit different videos this is just nuts
I'm I'm like impressed with the box I
didn't even get to the product yet it's
so fast wireless charger re so this is
crazy
so this is basically what goes into a
car you throw this into your car into
your air vent you just put it inside of
there it also comes with you know the
little plug so you can put this in the
cigarette lighter as well as a USB cable
so you've got everything you need for
fast wireless charging of course phones
like you know these Galaxy phones and
all the other phones that support fast
wireless charging and take advantage of
this which is really really cool
embossing experience though that's crazy
clothing or this is back
interesting this is a really really
lightweight backpack okay so this is
from Tron of eight it's a backpack
that's supposed to allow people to pack
a bit more easily and this is a very
interesting zipper system hmm okay
should we attempt a gadget backpack
setup with those guys
what's interesting enough I don't know
if it has the compartments for me I
don't know how useful this would be but
cool innovation the smartest keyboard in
the world okay so check this out guys so
this is a keyboard I guess with a bunch
of programmable buttons I don't know so
this reminds me of the al gato stream
deck where you can program different
scenes and stuff into it so this looks
like is a keyboard with that you can
pretty much program to do any kind of
commands that you'd want so I'd look at
these more like macro keys that you can
have do all kinds of different things
like open up folders launch applications
you can open up websites and all that so
this is pretty interesting I actually
want to mess around with this and have
it on the side of my setup and see how
useful it could be to just jump into
certain folders and sites with the press
of a button I like this it actually
feels high-quality too if you guys want
to learn more I'll have a link to this
down below so you guys can check it out
oh okay oh happy Chinese New Year okay
so this is from abacus they sent out a
little goodie box for Chinese New Year
so let's check it yeah we're a little
obviously we're a little late on
everything because we save it for this
video but this is cool nonetheless all
right so let's just pull everything out
Oh red envelope unless I've got it
interesting Oh a little Rubik's cube
with a light in it all right so we got
what looks like a little jewelry box
oh there's little goodies in here and
snacks oh nice oh this is heavy
what's this can I eat it Oh probably
okay so we've got a booklet that
mentions China's tech industry more
facts about abacus ho ho we've got a
little something from anchor the power
port Wireless five pad this is really
really light from anchor pull and let's
see these are the last two things I've
got a little booklet over here oh is
this like a notebook this paper oh this
is nice
yeah this is nice how do you want to
write in this I don't mess this up this
is awesome this looks like another
jewelry box of some sort
oh is this like a hold again abacus duh
yeah yeah okay cool so we got a abacus
here too I've never had one of these so
shout out to you guys
super Stokes actually check out
everything inside of here thanks guys oh
so these are some things that I picked
up from Amazon now I needed some surge
protectors you guys know how I feel
about Belkin surge protectors now this
is great for those gigantic plugs that
just take up too much room to share a
spot with another plug so you can
actually turn these around and get them
out of the way which I really really
like so I've got two of these definitely
good for a set up we've got eight
outlets and I also got this RGB headset
stand from Corsair this is the st 100
this actually feels pretty solid of
course you want that because once this
is on your desk was throwing your
headphones on it you don't want it to
move around also I'm really liking what
I see up top here because this is not
gonna leave an indent in your headphone
cushion where the headband is so I like
this design here it might leave a little
bit because there are some edges here so
maybe a little bit but I want to be too
bad I don't know why they don't just
make this a curved design that way the
headphones can sit on it
but anybody who makes headphones is
listening that's how you do it but it
does have two USB ports so when you
connect this to your computer you'll
have access to two extra USB 3.0 ports
as well as a headphone jack it actually
just makes sense on a headphone stand
since your headphones are gonna be on
this anyway
plug them in go into it about plugging
them into your computer access it all
right here which is nice and it's got
RGB lights I mean how can you beat that
okay a vertical mouse single color so
this is the v6 28 is it really
interesting design I've never seen
something like this alright if I could
just get it out of the box that would be
nice this this is out of this world this
is nuts so it is like they say a
vertical Mouse you hold it like this and
then this is how you hit your buttons
this is a very very interesting design
I've never okay you take this part off
I've never seen anything like this
before
I'm curious to see how it actually feels
to use something like this the thumb
also has two buttons on the side now I'm
not really sure what these are gonna be
for maybe going back and forward but
this is this is interesting
oh okay so this right here is a Nintendo
switch battery case I actually just did
a video about Nintendo switch
accessories but I actually picked this
up because I was curious to see how it
works but it didn't make it in time for
the video you just put this thing on the
back of your switch and you've got an
extra six thousand 500 milliamp hours of
battery life so this is a full charge at
least and then some so this is pretty
cool okay so it's got these little
so it's got these little buttons on the
sides you press them in and then it pops
open you can throw your switch inside
close it and boom you're playing so I
like this I'm gonna see if it makes it
hard to play or not but um I'm glad I
put this up okay powerup 3.0 2.0 oh so
this right here guys is a smartphone
controlled paper airplane the fact that
we're controlling paper airplanes now
before it just beat be all in the wrist
but of course now it has an app and
you're gonna be able to control it from
your smartphone which is actually really
really cool I'm super excited to see
this in action if you guys want to see
this in a video let me know with a
comment down below I'm hyped about it if
you are let me know but I'm super
excited about this paper airplanes
getting tacked up so we've got three
more I want to see what this is this is
a giant box oh yes I did order this so
this right here is the k63
wireless gaming lat so hoarser actually
has a wireless mechanical keyboard that
can work with this and I actually have
it inside one of these things but this
is basically a lap board that allows you
to use that wireless keyboard and a
mouse at the same time while not sitting
right next to your computer you can kind
of be a bit away from it have this on
your lap and play your games but I want
to see what the keyboard looks like and
boom this is it this is the corsair k63
wireless mechanical keyboard so this you
know for those gamers who want a
mechanical keyboard but you know don't
want to deal with the wire there's now a
pretty solid option from a company like
Corsair I heard about this a while back
the only thing that didn't really mesh
well for me with this whole thing
was that there's only one color
backlight that it uses it's just blue
but I'm still curious in terms of how it
actually performs this has Cherry MX red
switches so if you want that speed you
got this so this is interesting I'll
actually like the look of it a lot more
than I thought I would just blue isn't
bad at all there's also a nice blue
version out there but this is just a
regular dark blue and this is the lap
board now this thing is pretty big it's
not too heavy and I like the fact that
it has this nice padding so when you've
got this thing resting on your lap it's
not gonna be much of an issue
okay so fits right in nice and snug you
do this have your mouse going over here
I like this maybe I can finally use all
three of my monitors in that setup and
kind of be away from it and be able to
play and get the full immersive
effective there's actually gonna be
really cool to try out alright so I've
got no idea what this last pack oh yes
all right I know you guys don't care but
I do
another gun to not play oh so this is
the double-o quanta this is an official
release from bandai i've got a metal
build just like it but it's not official
from bandai I'm super stoked to have
this you guys know I love my Gundams I
don't have any more space for them but I
can't help but keep buying them so here
we are but that's pretty much it I'm not
gonna bore you guys with what's inside
but I love it that's it for this video
hopefully you guys enjoy shots all the
companies who sent something over for us
to check out we've got a lot of cool
stuff to sort through I really want to
see what this vertical Mouse is gonna be
like this is this has got my attention
but hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you
did be the cool guy girl that gives this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
