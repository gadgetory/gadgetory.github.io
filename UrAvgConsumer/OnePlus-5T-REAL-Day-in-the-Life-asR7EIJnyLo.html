consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day-in-the-life
with the 1 + 5 t and yes yes I know I'm
super late on this but for those of you
who have never seen one of my real day
in the live videos you're pretty much
gonna be spending the full day with me
and the phone and we're gonna see how it
does in terms of performance battery
life those cameras and we're gonna see
how it does in the real world I spent a
lot of time with phones that are doubled
this thing's price tag so it's gonna be
interesting to see how this thing holds
up so here's how it went all right guys
so we're starting our day as you can see
we've got a bunch of boxes another batch
of tech unboxing coming out pretty soon
looking right here on top of the box
we've got the 1 + 5 t that bad boy is
all charged ready to go and we're gonna
see how it does in a full day of life we
got we gotta go to New York today right
yeah so we've got some stuff to do folks
all right guys so let's take a quick
look at the design of the 5 T as you can
see it looks really similar to the
typical one plus 5 so if I got I got it
right here actually so this is the 1
plus 5 no fingerprint scanner but this
one does have a home button but with a 5
T no home button so it's all straight up
screen actually like this it's an 18 by
9 aspect ratio so that means you got
that much wider screen so you can have
more room for activities and guys in
terms of battery life working at 79% and
it's what 153 and let's see how much the
screen on time is we're looking at about
an hour and 27 minutes almost an hour
and a half
21% that's actually pretty good
so I got to test out these dual cameras
for a post to Instagram and they've got
a portrait mode effect now so that's
gonna be pretty interesting to see I
want to see if it actually works that's
like my favorite feature to test out on
these new cameras with the dual
cameras Google pixel 2 is like king but
let's see if this can compare so this is
the new vlogging setup right here so
let's see how that does it didn't look
so hot in the viewfinder but it actually
cleans it up it cleans up the image all
of this was blurred when I was actually
looking at the image so it looks like
you can't just completely judge it on
what you're seeing in the viewfinder so
I'm gonna try this again and let's see
that one there were some blurriness
around the edges yeah it cleans it out
really well this actually looks really
good
I'm impressed all right and now you're
gonna see it on IG alright guys so one
of my favorite features with the 1 + 5 t
is to face some well this thing is
lightning fast it instantly unlocks the
phone I feel like out of all of the face
unlock features that I've ever used
whether its face ID or an iris scanner
of some sort on samsung phones this so
far has been the smoothest experience I
can literally hit the power button and
within a second I'm in the phone I love
that that is super quick access no
fingerprint scan and none of that even
though the fingerprint scanner is in a
very nice location and it's super easy
to press and get into I still is super
nice to be able to see the power button
and get inside your phone alright guys
so I am currently in the car wash our
car looks like complete trash because
the smell has been beating us up in the
Northeast so it's finally time to get it
cleaned up but while I'm here I'm gonna
be doing some searching on my phone
looking for I guess some before you get
the car inspected today's a day we got
to do just like adult stuff once I'm
done here pick up arey then we'll head
to New York so we can get that done and
thank someone plus there's curved edges
it's actually really easy for this to
fit into the hand it feels really
natural even with the larger screen it's
actually really easy to use with one
hand so I still like to feel in the look
of this phone and the ease of use and
while the body is great and everything
and it feels nice and sleek I still got
in my case because I don't like breaking
my stuff so I'm gonna throw this on here
and not look back alright guys so now
we're gonna get some grub but I gotta
let you know where the battery is at
right now it is at 46% and it's 5/16 now
in terms of screen on time
let's take a look three hours and 56
minutes oh wow
well I guess the long drive we were on
GPS for almost an hour
but still this is amazing that is really
good considering that this has a 3300
milliamp hour battery usually I would
see this kind of thing on phones that
have like 4,000 milliamp hours wow
that's really impressive
nice alright guys so this right here is
like my favorite video on the internet
right now it's by a dude called King
Bader and of course it looks pretty good
on this display but this isn't the most
colorful video in the world so I'll
probably have to try out some other
videos probably like my anime which is
usually pretty colorful but content
looks good on the screen
I'm gonna watch another video and kind
of give you guys an idea of just how
good it is since it's rocking out OLED
display AMOLED display but checking
radar out dude's funny alright guys so
this might be a better example of how
good this thing looks you can see those
costs just pop obviously it's an OLED
display and the AMOLED display looks
really really good and even though this
isn't this is just a 1080p display if
2160 by 1080 it still looks fine I
really enjoy I feel like it looks really
sharp so I've got real no real
complaints when it comes to the actual
screen and even though you can't take
advantage of the full screen here on
crunchyroll you can do it on youtube so
if you watch youtube videos a ton you
can always do that and you know have it
take up this whole display but for all
those folks out there who always ask me
what gun shows should they watch for the
first time so they can get into it
Gundam double oh baby this is like the
best Gundam series ever stuff really my
favorite
he had a PC really really awesome PC
here and some consoles he's choosing to
play Sonic listen I need you didn't stop
coming for me whatever I play this game
man but no I I love this game guys and
this is like the game that I'm always
playing on my phones these days
I like playing this game on phones that
I'm testing because this is like a lot
going on on the screen at once and how
the phone actually handles that is a
good representation of how you know how
good the performance is so this does it
really well I've had no issues so far
when playing this game so for me that's
a nice little benchmark if we could
handle sonic forces they could handle
yet instagrams and all that cookie can I
have my sign for a second please
all right guys so it's pretty much the
end of the day I got my bubble tea
though so I'm hype I'm super excited
real quick though just wanted to give
you guys a battery update it's 11:30 and
we've got about 12 percent and in terms
of screen on time we're looking at 6
hours and 13 minutes
12% now it was just 13 but it's at 12
now is that more than the the huawei dad
is really impressive
Wow all right so we're at the six-hour
mark I still gotta take some like
low-light shots some really low like
shots so I think that's probably gonna
be the last thing this phone's gonna be
able to do so let's try and give that a
shot
all right guys so it's time for one
final camera test obviously there's
gonna be a low-light shot but we're
gonna do the car again and see what we
can get from it
okay she looks so much better when she's
clean my goodness okay so this looks
pretty good the blacks are really dark
but still definitely passable I would
use this with no problem and it's still
pretty sharp too so I'm actually pretty
surprised for the low-light it did
really well can you use portrait mode
what was it actually trying to use
portrait mode even though it's this dark
on the iPhone portrait mode requires a
ton of light I mean it looks like it's
working it's so dark around it though so
you can't really tell but it still looks
like it's working that's actually pretty
impressive so in terms of low-light
capabilities this looks like it'll
definitely get the job done for any kind
of picture that you would take with it
all right guys you can't see me right
now but that's kind of the point I'm
gonna see if the face unlock feature
still works even though it's really dark
out so let's see boom oh yeah yeah this
is pretty this is really really quick
now you guys might notice that there's a
little white flash that happens now
that's because I turned on the feature
where you're able to brighten up the
screen in the dark so that the camera
can see your face so in this kind of
situation it really it really is helpful
so let's see if we can give it one more
shot yeah yeah it's working no problem
cool yeah I'm not complaining this is
nice and that's pretty much my day now
the 1 + 5 T is undeniably a good-looking
phone with a solid design something you
wouldn't expect from a phone that is in
the $500 price range so I'm very
impressed with the overall build quality
the new screen is also really nice with
the 18 by 9 aspect ratio and it's an
OLED display so colors are nice and
vibrant I definitely enjoyed using this
to watch videos YouTube of course takes
advantage of the full screen so overall
it has a very good viewing experience
whenever you're using the device I also
like that it's comfortable in the hand
the overall shape makes it really easy
to use with one hand so one-handed use
is not a problem even though it has that
much
larger display the only thing is the
metal body might be a bit slippery so I
do suggest getting a case the case is
that one placements are actually really
nice quality they feel good I think they
look good and they don't add too much
bulk
I definitely think if you're gonna pick
up a case you should go with the
proprietary ones and in terms of
performance you guys saw that for
yourself this thing handled everything I
threw at it of course social media web
browser all that stuff is going to do
without even breaking a sweat but when I
was playing with those more intensive
games with a lot going on on the screen
I didn't have any issues there as well
so you can be pretty confident that this
thing is going to hold up to your
expectations it's got the latest specs
Snapdragon 835 processor has up to 8
gigs of ram so this thing is a
powerhouse but it's not super expensive
which is awesome now when it comes to
those dual cameras I was actually really
impressed the quality that I was able to
get out of them was really nice sharp
very colorful even that portrait mode
feature was really impressive which
isn't something that I would expect from
oneplus I think this is the first time
they implemented this portrait mode
feature I could be wrong but they
implemented it very well here even at
night where usually you need a lot of
light to make those effects really work
it did it really well so impressive
camera for sure honestly for photo and
video used to spin did a really great
job now what really blew my mind has to
be battery life this thing had about 6
hours of screen on time which I only got
out of phones with 4000 milliamp hour
batteries while this one has 3300
milliamp hours so that is really
impressive considering its size now you
do have to keep in mind that this thing
does have a 1080p display so that
absolutely helps its 2160 by 1080p so
that's the resolution of course because
it has the 18 by 9 aspect ratio but it
does a great job in not draining the
battery and honestly everything looks
really sharp on it still it's really
hard to tell the difference between a
1080p display and something that is a
higher resolution when it comes to a
screen this small so impressive overall
and it leads to good results and even on
top of that impressive battery you do
have the dash charging which charges
this thing up in like no time so you got
you covered there honestly I feel like
oneplus hit this one out of the park all
one feature that I'm absolutely in love
with is the face unlock feature I'm not
sure how much it lacks in terms of
security compared to
something like face ID or an iris
scanner but I will say it provides the
user experience that people would come
to expect whenever using a face
unlocking feature on a phone it just
works really quickly that's kind of what
you want you want it pulling at your
face
have it unlock in no time that's what
people want and it works really well now
there is no expandable storage or
wireless charging but it does have a
headphone jack so there are some
compromises but I honestly don't think
those are really big deals it's not
gonna make or break the phone honestly
at 500 bucks this thing is a solid buy
if you're on a budget it has to be the
place you look oneplus did a killer job
with the 5 t and it's absolutely worth
looking into but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed if you did be the cool guy girl
that gives this video a thumbs up and if
you like a different kind of budget
phone let me know with a comment down
below what do you think is the biggest
competitor to oneplus and there are
options out there right now let me know
what that comment down below but I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
