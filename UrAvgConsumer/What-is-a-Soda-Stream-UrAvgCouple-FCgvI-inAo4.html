enjoy the day because it is Labor Day
weekend and you know I have a little we
have a little bit of time together

little bit oh my god last week guys was
so busy it was a crazy crazy we barely
even saw each other yeah we didn't I saw
him like maybe two days out of the whole
Tyreke it was crazy if you're curious
about what I was doing during the week
go check out my Instagram I almost need
peek we are now having breakfast well
this is oh I had a croissant and also an
iced latte and Judd had attention span
baby had a bacon egg and cheese on a
bagel with and I sauteed yes also I
would show you guys this thing this is
beef jerky ya know it's extremely sharp

oh you guys I visited her yesterday and
beef jerky oh look at that
what are you doing up there yeah what is
it it does have wings but it has like a
bulb like been an interesting Oh yep
it's a five oh yeah so Stefan gave me
this big turkey and you know when I
first seen it be jerky I think it's like
slim jims
umm and so she gave this to me as a
little skeptical but I had it I tried it
and it is delicious
it's called righteous fellows and I'm
not being paid to promote this at all
but I did it was a monster yeah it's
marinated in like victory beer and it is
really really good but they got me
thinking it's like that's so worried
that like beef jerky is a snack like
Americans eat meat as a snack meat like
fully Americans would do that like you
have other places they like rice cakes
or you know a little things like that no
we eat meat
snack normal what is really good
victorious Vig it's called beef jerky so
you have to go try it out it's really
good
so now we're on our way to target
probably get gonna get some pokemon
cards oh c'mon pick up a couple of
groceries for the week
Oh guys speaking of groceries you know
how busy we were right okay
to the person that said that's gonna be
a - we think you were wrong it was a
one-week thing sucks that you had so
much hoping us but yeah we were really
busy this week so you're getting back on
the horse by will sake I will say though
guys even though I did not work out this
week I lost two pounds I don't know how
it happened we got that metabolism
started yeah I got it soon we got a kick
so yeah I lost a pound show that to me
check how much weight did you gain this
week oh very lost I'm just worried about
tomorrow
oh my god it's national target there
it's freaking crazy
wait the parking lot never looks like
this and target live when we come here
it's always open and free this is cray
cray
ignore the brake OOP on the window gross
alright so we got this car for her
clothing bag all that stuff but does she
push it
no she does not she leaves it to her
boyfriend
make your been through this you
shouldn't push a cart you'll push the
baby stroller in a couple of years oh I
hope I hope you remember that in a
couple years
all right gosh well you see Cena here
first is claiming for a stroller in a
couple years whatever that may be guys
don't get a girlfriend it's a trap the
trap don't do it
collars check was Nargis yeah yeah
that's a good indication I actually
really liked target and there
what is it room essentials or whatever
that's the brand they have a bunch of
college stuff this is where I used to
deck out my dorm room with it's actually
good stuff are you guys are interested
in back to school videos let me know I
could make that happen
I'm kind of that guy
like this other woman who is who
overheard me she was like you don't have
one I have one too what is it this just
makes our soda but like this one we use
it to make her own like seltzer water I
feel like the sound very dangerous let
us know do you have one in your
household a SodaStream yeah like I said
I feel like this is very dangerous
oh I'm just gonna make some root beer
everyday I that's not cool maybe this v8
splash or what not cool okay so for one
cup eight fold ounces oh my god it's
zero calories oh I don't know zero
sugars seriously yeah we're on the brink
of something extraordinary guys
somebody's gonna who's gonna let you
know you give you the rundown what are
the pros and cons of this is it should I
buy it shy not buy it
will aid me in my weight loss I say no
just kind of changes to taste a little
bit I said we stay away
iris got her eye on me I'm trying to
escape but she won't let me out of her
sight are you happy I'm right here let's
try make my escape No so this game
bounce off is pretty much like training
your child to be good at beer pong by
the time they get to college look at
this that is passing on some good
lessons I'm looking for a really good
board game I love board games I think
there's so much fun Yoshi my god and
everything it's great to be connected to
social media all the time but like
sometimes it's good to have quality time
playing a board game that's not I don't
know why she's matic she says okay let's
plot life I love the game of life she
pulls out the shoes she wants to play
these games randomly especially when
Ana's around yes it's the you guys saw a
vlog where we were playing what game
wasn't it Scrabble Scrabble ah it was
fun though we had fun I'll leave a link
down below to that vlog you guys check
that out
it's actually funny she's quite the
cheater so playing these games is not
only time and it's not only time
consuming but she cheats and complains
and talks trash terrible person when
people have a hard time recognizing
greatness they call it cheating and
there you go with the trash talk there
you go I murder them in every game Wow
what's happening in that game you guys
so upset
she is terribly named you watch the
video these people they like they just
don't know how to act I wind they just
get so jealous of constantly losing but
I just say stick her game up train and
come back oh she's the type of girl who
if you're playing a card game so get mad
stop and force everybody to play 52
pickup alright guys I just got the
coolest idea we should buy some nerf
guns I think that would be awesome
our house is a bit of a mess right now
I'm gonna clean it up so we could just
run around the house shooting each other
with these oh yeah yeah oh those are
exploding ammo not in my house no I
think I'll stick with the suction cup
things but yeah guys you see me as a kid
I was never allowed to have any kind of
nerf gun really no my parents didn't
want me playing with guns I don't mind
that I don't mind that as a kid not
getting used to
guns never so now that I'm old enough
I'm okay I'm not some traumatized child
I never owned any guns whatsoever so I'm
gonna be picking one of these up I
probably won't even get a gun I'll
probably get one of these bows or
something cuz yeah they've got a couple
of them here this looks pretty awesome
too so I think that's pretty awesome
idea what do you think yeah got them
right there yeah so maybe we'll vlog
that sometime to just us just blasting
each other with nerf GoPros or something
right alright guys after much debate
we can't find a blessing we can't really
find any of these nerf guns that we like
that isn't an extreme amount of money
like this thing right here is $46
why I mean I get it it's a big gun and
whatnot but it's a lot of money and just
for kicks in like you know kicking do
just also being an elitist he doesn't
want the buzz be brand he was their
friend
whoa I'm gonna do it right if I'm gonna
do I'm gonna do it right you know what's
cougar where's your commercial I'm just
joking
but I'm not I do want to get a nerf
though but these nerf things are crazy
they're real expensive
I like this bow like I said before but
it only shoots like these three giant
foams where it best sucks can't have a
war with three three Wow okay this is
what my girlfriend does wish people
around she doesn't care get out of here
man beat it and guess what guys one
starter pokémon cards and groceries and
you should get the ring at the checkout
I was like oh we didn't even get
groceries oh my gosh

airy-fairy

sweater and some board games and I got a
charge and play kit for the Xbox one

well I have tons of work so you gonna
get home though so like what part is
shown in the next vlog yeah I'll get it
done first and then but um we're still
on the mission to find the nerf guns
we're not just rolling it out we just
want to make sure we if we're gonna
spend a lot of money on those guns
I say we go to Toys R Us let me go to
the picture have so many nerve oh by the
way guys big thumbs up for you all you

you and also I didn't forget about
checking out the living room don't worry
about that I just I gotta do some
research on getting the best things for
the living room if I'm gonna be taking
it out things are expensive guys it
might this is gonna be a project but
it's gonna take some time to accumulate
everything and blah blah blah
yeah terms of research needs to go into
it so it'll happen probably not within
the next month but don't happen all
right guys so now we're back home and
we're probably just going to play some
some one of these board games to have
you picked up on life and battleship and
we are going to choose one of these to
play I'm voting for life I'm voting for
battleship we've played this already
