want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
just your average consumer and today I'm
gonna have a quick unboxing for you guys
of 12 stops book arc for the MacBook Pro
as you can see here I've had a bit of a
change of environment and I have a lot
of things on here and I kind of just
wanted a little way to like declutter
this desk so I figured I'd pick this up
and use it for my macbook pro so I can
you know have a little more space
surface space on this desk
alright well let's not waste too much
time let's get right into it so here are
let's see if we can just slide this off
ok let's see ok so that's some really
nice packaging it all has a nice little
thank-you side the box I must give it to
12 soft they did they have a good design
team or as far as packaging goes and the
first thing I can tell you that I feel
already is that this thing has a little
bit of a some heft to it so it feels
like it'll be sturdy I'm expecting that
it won't topple over easily as it
definitely has some heft to it and you
can hear it sounds pretty solid here you
have the logo from 12 South here's the
thank-you card I just believe this just
maybe what a manual er yeah so this is a
manual also inside you can get this you
have another Western ok so inside you
have another I guess filling part here
so that you can I guess by our different
sized
laptop I'm not sure what size this one
is in particular but I'm gonna try and
go with the one that they already have
in here
and here you have some silica gel and
that's about it for the box so you have
an extra one of these I'm assuming as a
different size stuff some silica gel
Thank You Manuel just nice little red
stain holder place over there and box
and we'll put this and we'll put this on
the side all right so here we are at my
macbook pro here now let me see if I can
just change the setting so that I can
close the laptop without the display
going away I'm going to do that right
now okay so now that I have that setup
on my playstation display I'm going to
put this down I think I'm going to move
this iPad and stop out of the way here
until I find a better spot for it and
kind of just set this on the side I want
so you guys can get a look at how it
looks inside here here you are if it's
perfectly with the one that was already
in the filling that was already inserted
so here we are it looks great I think um
it definitely fit you would think Apple
made this the way it meshes so well with
the macbook pro itself so I'm going to
find the spot for this now and I'm gonna
have a review up for you guys about this
give you some insight on how I've been
using it after a couple of days so here
you are this is the book arc by 12 south
and hopefully you guys enjoyed this
unboxing alright thanks for watching
