consumer and the iPhone 7 hype is real
so if you have an iPhone 6 or 6s we're
going to take a look at some of the new
features and changes to see if it's
worth your upgrade so I'll start with
the most controversial change and that
is the removal of the headphone jack
Apple moved the headphone jack stating
that the Lightning port will deliver
better sound and I've got a few tests in
the works to see if that's true
they included an adapter in the box for
those of us that don't like change and
so you can still bump music from the aux
cord now I personally don't mind the
change that much since I'm a huge
Bluetooth junkie but for some of us who
have a favorite pair of headphones that
might not be bluetooth you might be a
bit disappointed still I know a ton of
companies will adapt to make headphones
to accommodate this change so if this is
a huge change that's stopping you from
upgrading don't let it should be pretty
fine and there are some great options
out there I'll have a few listed down
below but I'm working on a video that
will work especially with the iPhone 7
now another cool change announced is the
stereo speakers instead of just having
one speaker at the bottom of the phone
you now have an added speaker behind the
earpiece unfortunately only one of these
speakers are front-facing and the other
kind of shoots off to the side so you're
not getting that front-facing action
like you'd get with the Nexus 6p or the
axon 7 Android definitely has better
options in the speaker department but if
your team iPhone all the way this will
still be a nice upgrade compared to the
old speakers now for that front facing
camera the iPhones rocking a new 7
megapixel camera which isn't a huge bump
from last year's phone but it's a bump
nonetheless personally I didn't see a
huge difference in quality when
comparing it to some of the older models
so this feature alone isn't worth the
upgrade so selfie Queens
save your money the rear camera now
features optical image stabilization on
both the 7 and 7 plus and with the 7
plus you get an additional telephoto
lens that gives you two times zoom and
it's pretty nice to be able to switch
between the two with the press of a
button and of course you know you get
improved quality if you're big on iPhone
photography this is a no-brainer
especially if you're considering the 7
plus one thing though is that the new
iPhone is water resistant which is good
news for folks who are bit careless with
their phones no more having to worry
about dropping it in a running sink or
in a toilet
arie so it's create for those who are
accident-prone but also for those who
just can't stay away from their phone
you can use this in the shower if you
need to send a quick text or even if you
wish want to use your phone in the rain
and honestly this is a feature that we
should have seen way sooner but it's
cool that it's here we can finally put
the rice away and of course you've got
those new colors the iPhone comes in
silver gold rose gold which are standard
but it now has the new black that
replaces Space Gray in that new jet
black for you insanely brave folks out
there I'm grating for one of the new
colors might be worth it as long as you
don't throw a case on it or something
now I don't see any reason to upgrade
for one of the changes or features that
we've talked about here to be honest
none of them are actually stand out
features but I do think as a package
they're definitely a step in the right
direction and pretty much where the
iPhone should be so if you have a 6 or
6s really might not be worth it but if
you have something older than that I do
think there are enough improvements here
that would make it worth it but whether
you're upgrading or not there's a chance
to win an iPhone 7 in my video over here
and all you got to do is check that out
if you want a chance but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy or girl that
give this video a thumbs up I'll catch
you on the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
