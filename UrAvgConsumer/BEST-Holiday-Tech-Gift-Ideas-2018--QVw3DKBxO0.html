going on guys a traveler's consumer and
here we finally got her back got area
over here so we're tag-teaming today
because I'm the better gift giver Wow
okay today we've got an awesome gift
guide some cool things if you think that
just about anybody would appreciate yeah
we really took a lifestyle approach for
this one I think you guys really gonna
like it and let's see what we got just
so you know this was Aries idea and
first up on our list guys is the shark
ion robot vacuum r85 and I think that
this is a gift that just about anybody
can actually use it is a robot vacuum
who don't want somebody else to do the
vacuuming for them and some of you may
have seen robot vacuums before but for
those of you who have it this little guy
will roam around your home and pick up
dirt debris pet hair all those little
things without you even needing to
monitor it and it's really nice that
this thing works on carpet and hard
floors and of course this thing has an
app and within that app you can go ahead
and set schedules so whenever you would
like the robot to go ahead and start
cleaning your home maybe that's right
before you come back from work or after
you head out to class you could have a
set in the schedule and it'll do it
automatically
you can also remote start and stop it so
even if you are at home you still have
control so if someone's coming over and
you weren't expecting them you can
actually go ahead and have you start
cleaning before you even get back home I
think my favorite feature with this
vacuum is being able to program it with
Em's on Echo so you can just go ahead
and call out to one of them and have you
start cleaning without touching your
phone or any remotes and even though
this guys roaming around your home you
don't really have to worry about objects
that may get in its way it has advanced
object detection so it'll stay clear of
anything that may potentially block it
and not only that this thing also has an
extra large dust bin so even though it's
got this small compact body it'll still
be able to pick up a lot and next up is
the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean
electric toothbrush now I know when you
first hear but like a smart toothbrush
it probably sounds pretty useless but
it's actually the opposite so makes us
smarter so it actually connects through
an app and then it kind of gives you
I'm feedback on your brushing technique
yes so if you're brushing too hard or if
you like miss a spot they're actually
sensors that set up a vibration let you
know to like ease up on the brushing and
second it has like five different modes
it's like a whitening mode of gum
cleaning mode it has all these different
modes and then corresponding brushes for
them you can even choose like three
different levels of intensity it's
really really cool what I personally
think is the best part about this is it
actually comes with a carrying case so
you can charge your toothbrush from the
carrying case but will even take it up a
notch it actually comes with a little
cup that doubles as a wireless charger
so you just plug that thing in in your
bathroom and the second you finish
brushing you just place it in the cup
and then it charges it automatically so
you never really have to worry about
losing charge with this toothbrush it
just it's pretty seamless and what I
really like about this whole system is
it really helps me to brush my teeth for
the right amount of time I think I've
been doing it way too short but with
this it has a timer and you just brush
your teeth until the timer goes off and
you know that you're getting like fully
clean so if there's someone in your life
that you know is like a dental hygiene
freak this is definitely nice way to
level them up or if someone's not this
is definitely my performance well I
really like this is something definitely
highly recommend it now that toothbrush
is cleaned but now we got to talk about
some audio and right here we have the
Bose sound sport free wireless these are
a pair of truly wireless earbuds now
what I like about these earbuds is that
they're sweat proof and weather
resistant so if you know someone who has
an active lifestyle this is gonna be a
great option now I know these look kind
of large for a pair of truly wireless
earbuds but trust them believe me these
are actually really light when you put
them in your ears
and these have about five hours of
battery life but when you put them in
the travel case that it comes with it'll
charge them up and give you an
additional 10 hours of usage so not only
will this thing protect your earbuds but
it will also charge it now in terms of
sound quality
these actually sounds really good vocals
coming pretty clearly and it's got a
decent amount of bass so if you want to
listen to some music that just pumps you
up this will definitely do a good job
with the way the earbuds are designed
and with the included wing tips you can
throw these in your ears and they stay
very secure in your ears so when you're
working out and moving around you don't
have to worry about them falling out and
also works alongside the Bose Connect
app and with the app if you ever happen
to lose one of the earbuds it'll
actually help you find it which i think
is a must-have feature for truly
wireless earbuds since they're so small
you could possibly lose them so if
there's an audio lover out there who
happens to love the gym you know exactly
what to get them and next up is the HP
sprocket photo printer second edition so
last year we actually talked about this
one of our other gift guys and you guys
loved it but this year we have the
second edition which is pretty nicely
improved so this photo printer weighs
about a pound and is about the size of a
smartphone and it actually pairs through
bluetooth right with your smart phone to
print out any photos you take but what I
really love about it though is you can
actually edit it before you print it so
you can draw a little things on it add
stamps and then you can print it out
right on this like sticky photo paper so
the paper has like a sticky back you can
just peel it and like stick it onto a
wall I would have loved this has a
teenager and after you print it or even
before you print it you can still upload
it to your social media or send it to
friends right through that app and
what's new about the second edition is
that now more than one person can
connect to it so you can print
simultaneously before I have to like
disconnect and Joe with connect is but
now you can just both connect at the
same time and print and there's even a
little LED ring with your personalized
color so you don't have to really get
confused when multiple people are
printing out ones and with the second
addition we also have Bluetooth 5.0 and
a sleep mode so it's always connected
and it'll wake up when you're ready to
print but I think this is the perfect
gift for a teenager because it's also
travel size so if you're going out and
hang out with your friends you guys want
to take pictures and print them right
then and there it's like super small so
you can just take it put in your purse
your backpack and print those photos
instantly so again I definitely
recommend this for teens or even adults
I really enjoy be it I'm actually think
about giving it to my niece if I'm
feeling generous enough now this little
guy I actually found while just browsing
on Amazon and that's this mini Manfrotto
tripod and universal clamp for
smartphones now I personally really like
this because I love taking photos and
videos with my smartphone and having
something like this means you're gonna
have a little bit more flexibility with
your camera from your smartphone without
you actually having to hold it and I
think this will be great for a budding
youtube star who's currently using their
smartphone to record their videos or
someone who loves to make time-lapse
videos this is just gonna be a great
option so that you no longer have to
hold your phone and what's really nice
about this combo is that it is super
portable you can fold up the tripod and
the clamp put them away and they take up
like no space what's special about this
clamp though is that
a hot shemale so if you happen to be
using this for video you can include a
microphone right at the top without
having to add any extra pieces or maybe
if you don't need a microphone you can
even throw on a little flash there
possibilities are endless you have that
little spot there it's Universal and I
think this is really cool so I really
like this thing it's small lightweight
takes up like no room and it's really
secure and right here we have the ninja
coffee bar Auto IQ coffee maker and this
one is for you coffee lovers out there
this thing is the real deal you can
choose from six different sizes and five
different brews so if you prefer you
know iced coffee one day over the
classic group you can do that with the
push of a button and the other types of
fruit are rich a specialty brew and cafe
forte if you want that really strong
brew and what makes this thing smart is
the Auto IQ feature which takes your
brew and your cup size and pours just
the right amount of water to make the
perfect cup of coffee but if you want to
make more than just a single cup there's
a ten cup carafe included and a warming
plate so you can make your cup and then
keep the other nine cups they're warm
for about two hours
after two hours it'll shut off
automatically and if you want to get
fancy with it there's a built-in frother
so you can take cold or hot milk and
within seconds turn that milk into froth
and make you know your little designs
and your coffee add a nice little touch
so overall if you know a coffee addict
who'd enjoy this you can definitely
level them up with this tech tout coffee
maker and last but not least guys we
have the Philips Norelco shaver 9700 now
we don't usually talk about shavers or
anything on this channel but you'd be
surprised how much tech actually goes
into this kind of stuff and I think this
would make a great gift for anyone who
likes to keep a clean face and wants an
extremely close shave this one actually
has what Phillips calls their contour
detect technology and with that the
blades move in like eight different
directions at the same time which all
leads to a very nice and clean shave
I've been on the channel wolfing before
and I wish I had this to kind of clean
up you guys have seen that you've called
it out but having something like this
would have been nice for those times
where I'm just too lazy to go to the
barber it also comes with this really
cool base called the smart clean pro and
all you have to do is dock it in there
it actually charges the shaver as well
as gives it a deep clean for me I think
that's the biggest selling point you get
to save some time
this thing will automatically clean it
for you that just takes one step out
they let this thing do it for you it
charges it up it's a no-brainer so for
all those bearded folks out there who
need to keep it clean this is something
you definitely want to look at and that
about wraps it for this video guys we
hope you guys enjoyed it and we have a
lot more gift guys coming so keep your
eyes peeled for that and everything that
you guys saw in this video will of
course be linked down below in the
description as well as some of the
decorations that you guys saw a lot of
cool Christmas things that we have here
some personalized stuff lots of cool
gear we'll have it linked down below for
you guys to check out maybe decorate
your own home and actually found it
really cool that you can buy all these
like decorations and stuff on Amazon
find everything I am is on there and
it's no joke well well that's about it
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it till the next one is your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
