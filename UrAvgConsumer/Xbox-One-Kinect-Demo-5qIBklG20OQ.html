Traverse consumer this is my girlfriend
hello and today we're going to be
showing you guys some of the features
and gestures of the Xbox one Kinect now
let's see what happens if we want to
turn on the Xbox one
using just voice commands to turn on the
TV as well it's really cool that you can
hook up your Xbox to the model of TV
that you have and kind of control it in
every way possible and now do the honors
Xbox on awesome so we know you know
you're successful when you see the
little white the logo light up and it
has a high success rate so that's a good
thing yeah it definitely does so you can
always just walk into a room say Xbox on
and then it'll get going right away so
let's see here it already recognized me
that's cool so we're gonna start off by
showing them recording the actual TV
section because the Elgato Game Capture
cannot capture the television side of
things so we're going to start off with
that first so Xbox watch TV
and it looks like we still had it
snapped from last time so Xbox unsnap so
pretty good so far
Xbox watch Cartoon Network Xbox mute
Xbox
mute there we go
Xbox volume up on the TV
changing manual Xbox me ok so I thought
we said FoxNews Xbox knew and Nelson
Mandela's estate is worth more than four
million dollars Xbox meals of his will
listen there we go Xbox one guy this is
pretty cool if you want to see what's
playing what's on right now let's see if
we can scroll through it under how long
the hand has to be
I don't know if you can even maybe used
to read me well there you go
all right so I should grab and scroll
see but I don't like scrolling with it
because it goes really fast see we try
to make it more controlled trice not
closing your hand again come again this
yet so good bring it down but like
that's pretty fast to go through yeah
the gestures are not like the hand
gestures are not my favorite assistant
ones Xbox stop all right so let's see
what else is data we want to do with TV
Xbox watch Disney Channel so it gets the
names wrong of the digit going to direct
channels is a little difficult um so far
the most successful one I found this
Cartoon Network and I guess that's
because it has a name like Cartoon
Network and what's one thing that you're
not seeing is because we haven't mute
but if it if the sound is on and you're
trying to give it a voice command it you
have to really yell to kind of struggle
so a tip of probably just to mute it
first they can give your command because
it can't hear your voice over its own
volume yeah it kind of struggles with
that it can be done but it tends to
struggle so but that's also if you're
playing it at louder volumes so let's
see
Xbox unmute Xbox unmute do you still
notice that sometimes you find let's me
I just
- uh-huh Xbox watch BEP can I do a gold
stud like one
next box watch ABC you know what Xbox go
home
Xbox go home
Xbox go home see it's like yell over it
Xbox EMU so as you can see that that was
a perfect example of having to yell
can't to get it but like I said the it
depends on your volume but you want to
be able to hear it especially you know
listening to TV now what we're going to
do is actually turn on the elgato game
capture card to show you guys all the
other stuff now that we're kind of done
with the TV side you can see it
functions well sometimes and you know it
has a lot of functionality but it misses
the mark quite a few times especially
when it comes to volume being up and
stuff like that that's a huge I think
it's one of the biggest complaints that
I have about it having to yell and also
another thing to know is when you're
yelling you tend to not speak you know
as yes clearly you know really
frustrating and you're like Xbox ah ah
and it's not work that is controlled
yeah and now the things we're gonna turn
it off no all right so time for Elgato
so let's do Ryse son of Rome so that's
the game that's inside of there we
CryEngine and do the games have certain
commands the games do have commands from
what I've seen so far with this game you
can have some commands I don't know how
often they come up xbox alone Xbox yeah
there's nothing we can do it record that
yeah so you can do that like that game
yeah but you know what go to killer in
int that go to killer in and that sucks
too sometimes if you're gay if you get
it wrong and you wanna you know finish
saying what you were saying it kind of
disappears on you gotta call it back
yeah
Xbox go to killer instinct what's that
it's another game so what's really cool
is that it jumps once you tell it the
command it jumps through it really
quickly Xbox go to Skype I'm going to
care about killer instinct Xbox go to
Internet Explorer so if at least
responding fast even though got the
command wrong Xbox go to Internet
Explorer something you really have to
enunciate so you want to really make
sure you get it right okay show address
bar show address bar and usually at the
top corner is to stop listening when you
want it to stop listening that means
it's currently listening but we find
that if we just give it a command while
it shows that it's still not listening
yeah
Xbox select browse to Facebook calm that
work at me scroll up oh so ready oh oh
scroll down oh I was responsive yeah
let's see here well go home sorry I'm
guessing that one it's showing that
that's only for the app not that in
general so Xbox go home okay so Xbox
snap you can see the shoulder snap
mm-hmm so music snap music think you
have to say that you see it's weird
though because when I like I said it
when it has a little bit stopped
listening right yeah it should be able
to just pick up on the little text that
is on that yeah but it doesn't do that
all the time at all yeah so that's not
just a quick overview of what it looks
like some of the voice commands so our
overall experience has been like it's
been pretty responsive responsive enough
for us to not need to use our remote
control so yeah like fall back on our
lazy side but if you're someone who gets
like easily frustrated yeah you
definitely don't want to rely on it yeah
so let me show another cool feature
where you can just go like this
come on Xbox you're making me look bad
you try it like this
out yeah and then
oh my goodness alright what's supposed
to do
it's supposed to go home so try closing
your pens okay and then bring it
together well a lot of these features
didn't work out so well so this is what
you get
Xbox go home we should do a comparison
venue for the PlayStation 1
yeah PlayStation definitely isn't as
sophisticated though it doesn't have as
many apps and it doesn't have as many
commands for sure
Xbox turn off Oh didn't you see this no
I don't think it's gonna do it Xbox turn
off yes yes
yeah we're giving up so guys hopefully
enjoyed our pretty bad demonstration of
all of Xbox one and connect gestures not
all of them just some of them but this
just goes to show you how well it works
and you can see for yourself just how
good it is at listening to everything
you tell it to so we'll catch you guys
in the next video till then is your
average consumer and his girlfriend
Harry please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
