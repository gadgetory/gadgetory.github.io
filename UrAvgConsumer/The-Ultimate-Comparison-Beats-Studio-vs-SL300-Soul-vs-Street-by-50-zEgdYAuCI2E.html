want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
everyone this your average consumer
today I'm going to be doing a comparison
video of the street by 50 the SL 300
sold by Ludacris and the beats by dre
studios
alright let's not wasting your time
let's get right into it now the first
thing we want to look at between the
three of these is the size here we have
the street by 50 looking a bit bigger
than the rest of them when laid out like
this when you put them and tilt them
forward a bit the SL 300 look a bit
bigger from the front sort of when it
comes to the headband but the ear cups
look huge on the street by 50 and the
studios also they're still quite big as
well but in comparison to the others
they seem a bit thinner at the headband
area and they also have um thinner ear
cups compared to the other two as well
but mind you these are still really big
headphones I still think the seniors are
really big but is that in comparison to
these it looks a bit smaller especially
in the comparison to the street by 50 um
one thing about the speed by 50 is the
ear cups are a bit different from the
these to the sheet by 50 have completely
circular ear cups and what that means is
is going to be a little more difficult
for your ear to get completely inside as
you can see these are made to kind of
fit the ear shape as it has like an oval
shape and the Beats Studios also have
that oval shape but the street have this
round shape so it kind of gives your ear
a little less room inside but it does a
good job covering the entire ear as do
these as do the other two but it just
might be a little more difficult for
these to get around the ear
my squish your air a bit compared to
these and since we're on the topic of
form-factor the one thing I like about
the beat studios and the SL 300s
are the fact that they can bend in they
they're foldable headphones
unfortunately the street by 50 this is
what you what you see is what you get
you can't really do anything with them
and this makes carrying this around a
lot harder as you oh you can only put
this in a pouch and when it's in the
pouch there's not much more you can like
you can put it in a boot book bag or a
purse or something maybe but these are
just really so big that they'll be
taking up a lot of room in there and
also that means that the only real other
carrying place you can have is around
your neck and these are really big they
seem a little clunky on the out when
you're outside they just look really
huge walking around with these on your
neck even though these are a little
larger luckily they come with carrying
cases that you can put them into and
clip them on to like your book bag or
whatever you want to clip them on to so
I got to give bonus points to these two
as far as form-factor goes because
they're more convenient the street by 50
really aren't convenient especially
considering their size and their
portability just there's a no-go for me
compared to these two now another thing
about since we're still on the actual
looks and feel of the headphones one
thing to note about 50 that trumps these
two is the fact that this is a very
durable pair of headphones as you can
see here I can bend them apart do this
and that no issues no problem whatsoever
I don't I'm not even scared doing this
because these are built really tough so
these seem like they're gonna have some
really good longevity in the future
where as far as these two they can bend
a little bit but I'm I'm like cringing
right now even doing this little bit I
feel like these can snap at any moment
especially considering it's made out of
plastic and it feels like it's a little
hollow on the inside so I wouldn't want
to risk bending it or you know anything
right
I basically I wouldn't want to test this
durability too much and the same can be
said about the Beats studios look while
I tried bending them out a bit and they
can move out a little bit but I wouldn't
test it too much like I would with these
because they do feel like they're um
you're putting a lot of pressure on them
when you do this
so you can bend these super slightly but
nothing I wouldn't even go beyond this
it's just you can feel that it's too
much pressure on it so the street by 50
definitely Trump's these two as far as
flexibility and durability so hats off
to the street by 50 in that regard now
also another thing about these two
headphones compared to this one is these
require batteries the the beach studios
need batteries to power its noise
cancelling and to basically power itself
you can't listen to any music if you
don't have this turned on and if you
don't have a battery or your battery's
dead that means these are not going to
be working for you until you get a new
pair I mean a new battery inside luckily
with the SL 300 by ludicrous you can put
in a battery and use the noise canceling
feature but you don't have to have this
on in order to listen to music you can
listen to music regularly without any
kind of power being used so that's
definitely a plus here so and these
require no batteries whatsoever it
doesn't have noise cancelling it has
what they call passive noise cancelling
and that means that there's no switch or
anything to turn noise cancelling on but
since these cover up your ears entirely
they're going to block out some sound
you know just by pure you know logic you
know if your ears are covered you're not
going to hear anything or what you're
not gonna hear much around you so that's
what they call no passive noise
cancelling and that's what these have
reckful going for them now one thing I
do have to say I like about the street
by 50 in comparison to these two is
actually the
fact that it doesn't use any batteries
and I don't have to worry about
batteries running out at all compared to
these two I'm always finding myself
leaving the switches on for the noise
canceling features on these and it
really just leaves a bad feeling when
you come back to your headphones in and
you see you've left them on for hours at
a time when they were just put away so
that's definitely something this will
have no worries as far as whether your
battery is going to survive the day or
when it's going to die on you or
anything like that so definitely a
couple points for this but you can't
really knock them for having the feature
but it just sucks that sometimes you'll
forget to turn off the switch it's just
something to keep in mind when
purchasing these you just want to know
make sure you're able to handle being
responsible for it the switch coming off
and not draining the battery but I
really want to tip my hat off to the SL
300s because it adds the feature and you
can pick and choose whether you want to
have the noise canceling or knowingly no
noise cancelling so it's like the better
of the two so I think that's really a
bonus for this and also when you use the
noise canceling feature it gives a
tremendous boost in sound quality to
these headphones as well as far as being
comfortable I would have to say that the
SL 300 is also win in that regard
because they're just little the material
is just really nice it's really cushiony
and you can um the material is really
nice and really cushiony and the ear
cups are just really soft and when you
have your ear inside of it it kind of
gives it an on-ear over air feeling it
has your the inner part of the ear cups
you are going to be pressed onto your
ear as well as sealed in with the
outside ear cups so that definitely
gives a lot of bonus points it gives it
a great feel the second place I would
have to say would be the Beats Studios
some might find that a little tight
maybe I found it slightly
tight not too much not too much pressure
or anything like that but my slide
someone might find it slightly tight I
found it a little myself but these are
these are still very comfortable I'd
rate them in second place as they have
the really nice cushion and they really
just fit the ear really well whereas for
the street by 50 they're still very nice
but because we're ranking them amongst
all three of them I would have to give
this third place as it does not exactly
fit ear size as well um our you know
ears can fit inside of it with no
problem but it doesn't you know shape
the it doesn't have the shape of the ear
so it can be too a little squishing of
the ear inside of it instead of just
being itself inside now as far as other
features I already went into the fact
that these are foldable these two are
foldable and this is it these two have
noise cancelling and this has passive
noise cancelling um there really isn't
too much else but one thing I do like
about the sole by Ludacris is that when
you have the noise canceling powered on
in your using battery you can use this
little neat feature to turn on this
light around the logo and you know it's
just a little bonus noting that these
two would lose out lose points for or
anything but it's just something that
gives this an extra point if you catch
my drift
so that just gives us a little boost
it's a nice little neat feature some
people probably would never use it
because they're in fear of draining the
battery but you can't fault them for
adding something that wouldn't if it
only it only make this better than it
wouldn't hurt it at all also as far as
little features go the beats studios
also are able to mute the volume unmute
the music that you're listening to or
whatever audio you're listening to by
pressing the little B here so that's
also a neat little feature that the
beach studios have and as far as
features for the
street by fifties there really there
really aren't any these are really just
like a standard pair of headphones with
them just some great durability I would
say the durability could be a feature
because you know this is some amazing
stuff but it doesn't do anything outside
of the ordinary like these to do now of
course we're gonna want to talk about
the sound quality of the headphones and
if I were to rank them it would have to
go like this the SL 300 the beach
studios and then the street by 50 now
what this is really surprising because
the SL 300s aren't really publicized
like that and you don't really hear much
about them but the SL 300 have the
greatest sound quality I've heard
amongst the three of these and it really
it's just really surprising cuz actually
like it's a random pair of headphones
compared to these two as you know the
street by 15 is getting really popular
and beats his beans so I think that this
is really good but I first listened to
it
yeah well I was really taken back at how
good it sounded and I was just really
really impressed overall especially when
you're using the noise canceling feature
because as I said before it gives us a
really great boost to the sound quality
so with the noise cancelling on these
are just some amazing headphones as far
as sound and the beats are what you
would expect they're really good they
deliver a lot on they deliver well on
bass as well
these deliver well on bass too but these
deliver really well on bass they sound
really crisp when you're listening to
them the noise canceling really cancels
out any other sounds and it really helps
you to focus on the music and really
hear everything and not have to hear
anything else on the outside the street
by 50 were the least impressive to me
they sound good in general overall they
sound like nice pair of headphones they
were lacking on the bass side for me
especially compared to these two they
were a bit not they weren't strong on
the bass and it was very disappointing
because it advertises that it has some
special kind of base I forget what it's
called but the special base really I
didn't really hear any of that so it
just was a little disappointing because
I listen to a lot of bass-heavy songs
but if you're someone who isn't into a
lot of bass but still wants good sound
quality I think you might want to go
with DS over these two because these are
very bass heavy so if you're looking for
a nice pair of headphones where the bass
isn't too heavy but it's definitely
there these might actually be really
good for you now as far as these two are
concerned I would rank this above the
Studios marginally not really - not
really that much over them but it
definitely is a bit better to me and
maybe is the surprise factor that it's
you know sold by Ludacris but I
definitely feel that through my
experience that these are better as far
as sound quality goes now as far as as
much now as far as sound goes where a
big problem for these studios are that
they leap the sound leaks like crazy
someone can someone right next to you
will definitely hear your music if you
are listening to it next to them if
you're close enough so that's definitely
something to keep in mind these leak
terribly these are like the worst out of
all three of them but these don't lead
to badly but a high enough volumes they
can leak these aren't that bad as well
but given enough volume they will lead
to but I think that can be said about
any headphones really if you max out the
volume you'll pretty much hear unless
it's like some in ears or something but
these are giant speakers on here on your
ears of course people will hear it at
high volumes I know everything seems to
be going against the street by 50 but
one thing it does have over these guys
is the price range as well the price
range is two 49.99 and these are both to
$99.99 so you're looking at 300 versus
250 and I do think these are comparable
to these two as they just it's just
lacking on the bass so I do think that
sabonis right there you're saving 50
bucks but honestly if it were me I would
just shell in the 50 bucks or wait till
I can afford it and go for something
that I couldn't be sure we'll have a bit
more of what I'm looking for which is
bass now I'm just gonna kind of show you
guys what it looks like to have the
headphones on because these are really
big and considering that they're so big
you're definitely gonna want some
insight on how big it is especially when
you're going to be wearing these outside
all right guys so now I'm going to show
you what the headphones look like on and
we're gonna start off with the studios
when they're on they look like this I
just said these are the smallest of the
group as you can see from the side here
this is what it looks like and when you
have it around your neck it's about this
big now okay now I'm going to show you
guys the SL 300s as you can see here
these was a lot larger especially
because the white makes it seem a bit
more prominent the width it makes the
whiff seem more prominent and you can
see it from the sides and down when
they're around the neck this is what it
looks like here and I'm moving on to the
buy 50 these really come out on the
sides I don't even think the camera does
it justice on how big it really is but
these are how they look and when they're
around your neck it looks about this big
so these are some they're all pretty big
headphones but in order of biggest to
smallest it's the street buy 50 SL 300
and then the studios and that's pretty
much it for the comparison guys if I
miss anything please feel free to
comment below and ask me I'll be sure to
get back to you shortly as you all know
I answer all my questions and I try to
do that relatively quickly and if you
like this video please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video thanks for
watching this is your average consumer
