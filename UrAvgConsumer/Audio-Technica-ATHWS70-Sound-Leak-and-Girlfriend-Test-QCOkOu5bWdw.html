want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
everyone the Traverse consumer and this
is my girlfriend hi everyone and today
we have another sound League and sound
isolation test aka the girlfriend test
and today we're going to be doing these
with the ATH WS 70s that audio technica
sent me out so that's not wasting time
let's get right into it so what can I
first start off with the sound week test
and we're going to listen to music at
50% 75% and then 100% so that we can
kind of see how much the sound leaks
from those at those different volume
points so we're gonna start off with 50%
right yeah and this time guys I'm going
to tuck my hair behind my ears and put
it on so it's why you guys thought the
sound leaked because of my hair okay
cool all good to go yes alright guys so
this is 50%
they are absolutely nothing pretty good
nothing at all alright so that was
pretty good
well let's try 75% right
now I hear slightly but this is usually
how much how us on that fifty percent
for a couple of other headphones that's
pretty impressive I'm very very nice
based off of that right there to pass I
said an add on yourself we know it's
kind of a little bit let's try it out
yeah yeah all right so this is ninety
percent
I can hear it but this is actually not
that bad
wow really sir practicing really good
and I want to Seneca bed like I heard it
but it wasn't very loud or bothersome at
all so definitely a plus for soundly
test guys really good job isolating
sounds from eighty hws seventies so now
we're gonna jump into the girlfriend
test okay tell them what it's about
sure so so the girlfriend test um I
usually do something that's annoying you
know that most girlfriends would do or
maybe you said what I do that annoys him
and he tries to see if it's headphones
can block out the racket my complaints
anything like that okay so that's what
we're going to do in today what we're
going to do is I'm going to do my
typical whining and sometimes emotional
outburst surprise so you guys will get
to witness that today
alright so wish me luck guys and we're
gonna start to solve that 50% 75% and
ten hundred percent so it's not about
50% I hate the way you look today so if
you look so fat okay are you listening
to me
unfortunately yes I could oh yeah 50
percent wasn't enough to block out any
of that pretty clearly
so let's crank about 75 percent see how
it does there sometimes I just feel like
the world against me it's just it's not
fair trying to do the best I can
all the time
we just don't understand the fact that I
really do try I tried my hardest but I
just think they judge me okay I don't
know what she said at the end there but
it was actually pretty actually pretty
good guys I did hear her a bit but it
was all mumbles so didn't isolate it
completely but at least it wasn't enough
to distract me by picking up what she
was saying so pretty good at a my house
to 100% I'm hopefully this will block it
out completely let's try it out
I feel a gonna pay attention to me only
you're ignoring me as usual but you know
what when I die then you'll wish you
could have me and hear me
am i complaining and everything like
that you know what even cares about me
it's not right
alright guys % I didn't hear her at all
pretty good there um I wish it was a
little a little more around 50% range I
wish it could isolate a little bit more
but not too bad that if I percent did
the trick so I'm very very impressed
didn't we get all at the UM it didn't
leak at all with 50% through 75% but it
wasn't bad and of course under protect
was pretty normal but it was still a lot
lower than a lot of the iPhones we've
tried so very impressed we wish it
isolated a little bit more anyone hiring
