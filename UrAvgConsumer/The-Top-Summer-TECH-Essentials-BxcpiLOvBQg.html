this is Ari hello and today we're
talking about the top summer tech
essentials yeah we say essentials but
really it's like really cool stuff you
should have for an awesome summer the
first huge shout-out to our sponsor blue
smart which actually gave us one of the
coolest pieces of tech that we've gotten
in a while yeah and it goes really well
this video actually and this is blue
smart probably the smartest in case
you've ever seen yeah this thing has a
ton of features it has a ton of
compartment just like you guys know I
like with my backpacks you can actually
find that right in here let's talk about
the tech this thing has a built-in GPS
so that you can track it wherever it is
and I'm not talking about it being
connected to your phone by a bluetooth
and you finding it that way ah
this thing has straight-up satellites
that will pinpoint its exact location
all using its app and in the back you'll
find a USB port for its built-in
portable charger yes the normal habits
like huddle around those little charging
stations and when you're loud with yeah
yeah this is awesome because you can
just sit there and wait for your plane
try to drop your phone with no problem
and not to mention one of our favorite
features is being able to use the
handles as a straight up scale to know
how heavy your luggage is yeah this is
super fudge for me because I'm always a
minute over packing okay I can be really
nice people just weigh your luggage
before you even get to the airport we've
all been there where they make you like
take stuff out yeah you don't want to be
that guy and you can do all that right
through the app and that actually has a
ton of other cool features like a
digital lock that allows you to lock it
no matter where you are so in case
you're wondering if you lock your
suitcase you can just do that right from
the app but the piece of the app has a
ton of other features we can't spend all
day talking about it but one thing that
we can talk about the fact that we're
going to be giving one away to one of
you guys now all you have to do is run
over to my facebook page I'll have a
link down below in the description and
they also fire their IndieGoGo campaign
today which introduces their new lineup
of upgraded products they got the boost
Mart - they've got a bigger version of
this you know what let's make that prior
to giveaway head on over to the
IndieGoGo campaign and let me know on
the Facebook post about the blue smart
what you think you're most excited for
this is probably one of the coolest
things I've seen in a while sponsor or
not I think is awesome and I'm Jessica
has one anyone someone to be smart with
the business a lot of smart suitcases
definitely great for your summer trips
we've also got our own little list of
other suggestions starting with the
spectacles why snapchat so these are
sunglasses released by snapchat and they
look really cool they give your eyes
some protection and the Sun but it also
doubles as a camera so all you have to
do is press this button right here and
then the camera that captures what
you're doing or what you're seeing in
first person and it'll go straight to
your snap stories and it makes your snap
stories come out in a really cool way so
you can poke the phone and see more than
you'll see in a normal camera but it's
also great because you can go hands-free
and see things in first-person and it
comes in a couple of other colors so
these are really awesome for summer and
let's not forget you might be able to if
you're lucky see some real star moments
you could put these on in a really
discreet way capture that and you're
good now Michaels little suggestion is
the JBL clip too now this is a pretty
awesome portable speaker because not
only is it small but it gets pretty loud
and it's waterproof so being able to
take this to the pool or anywhere that
you're going to be dealing with some
water you don't have to worry about this
getting messed up and of course into the
booth you got all your controls on the
side so that you don't have to worry
about going for your phone to control
your music and if you don't want to use
bluetooth it also has an aux cord to
plug into the headphone jack of any
device that you want unless they got
removed but I really like the speaker
because it has a really tiny compact
body it's waterproof
it's bluetooth and it still gets pretty
loud but most of all is that it doesn't
break the bank and it has a ton of
different color options so whatever you
may like you know I got the peel because
I'm a theme but this is an awesome
speaker and definitely worth picking up
for the summer
up next is probably my favorite thing on
this list it is a six port smart super
charger this thing is awesome if you're
road-tripping or even if you just have a
really large family there are two ports
in the front that can be for the driver
and passenger there's a sis that has
four additional ports there's a clip on
the back we just clip it onto the
backseat is like the passenger and then
everyone can just charge up so no more
having to fight over who's going to be
able to charge their phone or taking
shifts everyone can just plug in their
cables and then charge their phones or
charge of every devices they have and
it's five feet long so you don't have to
worry about stretching to the
backseat is also nice and stylish and
compact so pick up like a sore thumb but
the best part of all is one $15.99 I
think that's an awesome price for the
peace of mind you'll have knowing that
everyone has their devices charged up
ready to go
and while our USB hub is small and
inexpensive if you need a little bit
more power this is the energizer 500
watt power converter now something like
this you have for 2.4 m USB ports so you
can charge all of your mobile devices
with no problem
but you also get access to 2 AC outlets
so if you want to charge something a
little bit more hardcore like a big
laptop or maybe if you want to bring a
TV with you on a camping trip who knows
what you want to do you can do all that
right with this now to get something
legs to work all you got to do is plug
it into a 12 volt cigarette lighter and
boom you're all good to go
but let's say you're out camping or
tailgating and you don't want to keep
the car on just the power of this all
you have to do is use the included
battery clip cables attach it to your
battery and this thing has got power
honestly summer or not I think this is a
really useful piece of tech to have in
your car
I personally am going to have this one
in my car at all times I think you guys
saw me unbox a different one in one of
my massive tech unboxings but this was
better to definitely go with this one at
one of the best things about summer it's
finally being able to go in the pool and
do board of course and when the best
things to have for that is this mpow
waterproof bag and I know a lot of us
love to have our phones near us kind of
obsessed we also use our phone to
capture moments cents a snapchat and all
those types of things and with this if
you just tuck your phone away
feel it nice and tightly so there's no
kind of damage to it
and also work just fine now if that's
the most attractive looking thing but if
you don't care about the looks and just
want to make sure you have that
functionality this is an awesome route
to go and you get to predicting books
really good and I saw the bonuses were
comes with a strap so if you spill
around your neck and if you're on a
water slide or if you're swimming you
can still have your phone really close
to you but if you're looking for
something a little bit more permanent
and stylish this is a lifeproof case as
called lifeproof because the thing is
really durable
it can handle Falls it even has like a
kind of like a screen protector here
built into it so you know if we're about
scratches and it's also waterproof those
great for someone who may be like really
clumsy live the pretty active lifestyle
or if you're going to be in the word a
lot this summer
now it is 50 bucks they'll submit more
of an investment than the em pal but
it's a solid case it's waterproof and
I'll just keep your fuzzy now you
thought you were safe but we got a
portable charger baby nice now of course
with the summer theme this is a little
bit different than the typical portable
chargers I show this is actually by solo
I believe but it is a fifteen thousand
milliamp hour portable charger with a
couple of cool features so first off on
the very top you might notice that it
has a solar panel so if you guys are
going to be outdoors a lot which you
probably will come to the summer if not
go outside but this is solar powered so
you can charge it up while you're
outside doing whatever activities you
may be doing 15,000 milliamp hours and
if you're doing stuff like hiking
camping like I said before you can
actually use the back which has a ton of
LEDs and you can use this as a light so
you got a little not even little you got
a giant flashlight over here and since
this is pretty much made for the
outdoors it's extra durable and it's
even waterproof a waterproof portable
charger now you get all of these
features 15,000 milliamp hours all for
less than 20 bucks just go for around
eighteen ninety-nine
so I'll just about 20 this is a really
really good deal if you want something
solid that you could depend on and it's
kind of life proof like that and of
course it wouldn't be the channel if we
didn't show you some laptop backpack so
here we have two backpacks mine is
actually from adidas - nope that kind if
it was a lady's backpack so boom you got
best of both worlds over here folks but
this is of course made for someone who
is super active you got a waterproof
backpack here and of course holds your
laptop so we're not forgetting the tech
side of things but I think what these
both have is a really cool feature is
insulated pocket so that I can keep
things nice and cool so my
what a chances of some completely
different brands having the same kind of
right now feature yeah I'm so job with
his boat his look so legit so we've got
super cold drinks you want to take that
out with you to do whatever you got to
do outside you can put them inside of
here and keep their temperature yeah or
if you like taking this to the park with
your friends you can put like your
sandwich or whatever snack maybe left be
kept cold right into the socket it's
summertime you know it's gonna be hot
outside so you want to be able to keep
your stuff cool and that's a really
really cool way to do it
these both also have other compartments
that you come to expect like a
sunglasses compartment so if you want to
put your spectacles in here you can do
that they also both have a very very big
inside pocket nice thing is right these
colors don't do it looks good but yeah
mine is also spaces on the inside and
the compartment they're both less than
40 bucks they have quite a few
compartments so you can organize it and
put whatever you need inside of here and
they're solid I'm a big fan of this one
because of the waterproofing and
actually this looks good yeah I think
they're both good for summer and also
just like for the school year to this
how about that yeah all year round baby
so that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that gives this video

had here if you want to see more videos
