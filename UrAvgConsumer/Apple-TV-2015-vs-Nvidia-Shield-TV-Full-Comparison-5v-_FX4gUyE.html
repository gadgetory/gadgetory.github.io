continues with Apple's introduction of
their new Apple TV as you guys might
have seen in my ultimate living room
tour I've got the Nvidia shield in my
set up so I wanted to compare the two
and see who should claim the HDMI slot
on my TV so first things first let's
talk about looks these are gonna be
present in your living room and if
you're like me you want them to look
good the shield has a bit of an abstract
design but overall it has a rectangular
shape I kind of like the triangles all
over the top of it and I'm especially
fond of the glowing green strip you can
even grab a stand to make it sit upright
which I think makes it look pretty cool
with the Apple TV you get a subtle
compact design that makes it very easy
for it to fade into the shadows of your
setup it's a very minimalist design as
you'd expect from Apple and I think that
most people will be pretty happy with
that although I love the glowing green
strip
I think the Apple TV will have a better
time blending in with most set ups now
let's move on to the specs and what's
actually powering these two the shield
is packing some pretty impressive
hardware it uses in videos Tegra x1
quad-core 64-bit processor who has three
gigs of RAM comes with a default 16
gigabytes of storage but there's also a
500 gigabyte option as well and it has
an SD card slot to expand your storage
hdmi 2.0 and the ability to output 4k
content you'll also find two USB 3.0
ports which can be used for external
storage or some accessories as for the
Apple TV we've got apples a8 chip which
is a dual core 64-bit processor it has 2
gigs of RAM and it comes with two
default 32 gigs of storage yet they
can't do this with the iPhone as well as
a 64 gigabyte option and no options for
expandable storage it also comes with
HDMI 1.4 and even though it has a USB C
port it's only used for servicing and
repairs so you won't be able to use it
for any accessories in the specs and
hardware department the shield pretty
much Trump's the Apple TV in every way
possible
speaking of hardware and accessories the
shield comes with a console style
controller which you
as a remote and if you plan on playing
games with someone else you can grab a
second controller to add to the system
they also offer a more standard remote
if you want something smaller and you
can also grab that stand for the shield
if you decide you want to change its
orientation as for the Apple TV it comes
with a single remote with no options for
additional accessories yet I can make an
entire video going over the differences
between the remote options for the
shield or the Apple TV but here's what
stood out to me the most while it's kind
of cool Apple added a touchpad to its
remote I often find myself passing by
the option I'd like to select and this
usually leads to more swiping around and
I'd like so it feels less accurate than
the simple button style of the shield
remote and even the older Apple TV
remotes a pretty nice bonus the shield
remotes have over apple's is the
inclusion of a headphone jack for
private listening this is an excellent
feature if you want to listen to your
audio through your headphones instead of
your speakers or through your TV this is
especially helpful at night when people
are sleeping and you don't want to wake
them up now we've talked a bit about
hardware but let's get into the software
side of things the shield is running
Google's Android TV with some added
bells and whistles from Nvidia and the
Apple TV is running Apple's new TV OS
and it has a pretty clean and simple
interface as you'd expect
while Android TV does its best to show
you all the things you may be interested
in and give you recommendations as well
as showing you all of your apps this can
definitely be pretty helpful but I gotta
admit I do like to clean a look of the
TV OS interface both these operating
systems offer things like apps games
voice commands and search but who does
it better as of right now you'll find
more apps in the Google Play Store since
it's been out quite a bit longer and all
your typical apps are present like
Netflix Hulu YouTube but only the shield
can output 4k content while the new
Apple TV is still rocking 1080p as a 4k
TV owner and content creator 4k is a
must a pretty cool feature these both
have is the ability to stream content
from your phone or tablet to your TV
the shield TV uses google cast and the
apps that support it will have a little
streaming icon that lets you send over
whatever you're watching this works for
both iOS and Android which is awesome
because it doesn't limit who can cast
here TV the Apple TV can do
the same with airplay but it actually
has quite a bit more functionality you
can stream any video to your TV and even
completely mirror your device
this is pretty cool if you want to show
something off to a group of people or
just want to play one of your favorite
games on the big screen there are two
pretty big limitations to airplay
however and the first being that you
need strong Wi-Fi for the best results
and the second is that you're limited to
iOS so if you're an Android or even
Windows Phone user you get no love here
you also get some pretty cool voice
features with both devices Apple has
brought C over to their TV OS and she
works just like the iPhone or iPad only
difference here is she doesn't speak
she's pretty responsive and it can be
pretty helpful to access her even when
you're watching something or in an app
you can use her to search for shows
different actors and even some genres
but I found that you have to be pretty
specific with what you ask to turn up
any solid results sadly this
functionality also seems pretty limited
to shows and movies so if you want to
ask you any questions that would require
a web search she'll let you know she
can't figure it out since there is a
music app it would have been nice to see
them tie it in to her search
capabilities now with the shield running
Android TV you've got the power of
Google search at your fingertips and
just like Google now the voice search is
impressive you can even ask normal
questions that don't limit you to just
finding content like this when is the
next solar eclipse
August 21st 2017
something I really like with the voice
search here is that it'll go through
most of the apps you have so you're
bound to find what you're looking for
and if you guys know me you know it
comes down to just one search result and
where the Apple TV failed the shield
didn't and gaming is definitely a thing
on both the shield and the Apple TV and
while Apple has some interesting and
pretty fun games controls can feel a bit
awkward the remote feels a bit small and
unnatural when it comes to games that
include steering which are usually very
fun for me and because the shield comes
with a more traditional styled console
controller it feels more natural in
playing games apples also limited to
just a few available games since its
platform is new but the shield offers
quite a selection to choose from
you've got games like war thunder Game
of Thrones HD and a bunch more and they
also have GeForce now which is a cloud
gaming service was a bunch of alias
games that can stream straight to your
device
with the ability to stream up to 1080p
at 60 frames per second of course
depending on your internet speeds and
honestly I couldn't even tell it with
streaming rather than having an actual
copy it's super smooth and being able to
play like this with two players is
amazing it is a membership service but
they give you three months free so you
definitely only got enough time to try
it out so if you're into gaming this is
another big bonus for the shield over
the Apple TV
now we've compared hardware and a ton of
features but which will I keep for my
living room setup I'm gonna have to go
with the shield
I love the options it provides through
its hardware as well as the stronger
voice commands which you guys know is a
big deal for me not to mention it's
amazing gaming capabilities while I love
the simplicity of the Apple TV and it's
unobtrusive design I don't think it's
quite there yet in the future Department
and not being able to use it to watch 4k
content makes it lose quite a few points
for me and as typical conversations go
when it comes to Apple vs. Android if
you want something more feature packed
with much better hardware go for Nvidia
shield TV with Android TV OS but if you
want something really really simple you
might want to take a look at the Apple
TV
but to be completely honest I really
can't say that simplicity is worth going
with such a weaker system unless you
just really need airplay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
