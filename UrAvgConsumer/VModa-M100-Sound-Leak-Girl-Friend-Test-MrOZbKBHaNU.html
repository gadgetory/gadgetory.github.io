average consumer and this is my girl
friend uh uh some of you guys might know
her she's actually my girlfriend's
sister she's old she's on the blogs all
the time so my girlfriend isn't here
today so today we have and today we're
doing the sound leak and girlfriend test
and today we're doing this with the
v-moda m100 so let's not wasting time
let's get right into it all right so
first we're gonna start off with the
sound leak test and what we're going to
do is we're going to play about music at
volumes of 50% 75% and then 100% and
then we're going to see how much the
music leaks at those different volumes
so we're going to put those on outside
and then you wanna throw okay alright so
she's good now alright so first thing
we're gonna do is play music at 50% you
ready
hmm all right so I did hear that very
slightly shortly not a bother to anyone
around you um if you're outdoors no
one's going to care whatsoever if you're
sitting to someone in a closed room this
close maybe but definitely a very good
pass at 50% so now we're going to crank
up to 75% and see how it does they're
ready ready all right so here it is a
75% so I do hate is pretty clearly what
they got some Sun we found sano-sama
feels shady hitting other Sun she's
alright
so at 75% I did hear a bit more still
not enough to bother anyone outdoors
maybe indoors it'll probably be a bit
more of a issue here at 75% range so now
we're going to try a 100% see how it
does there I'm not sure what to expect
here so you ready yeah and guys don't
listen to your music at 100% it can
damage your hearing but we're gonna do
it for you so there is your ears a break
yeah
here it is that 100% right / yeah this
is really clear too
all right so there it is at 1% is what
you would expect this 100% volume but
for some of those who do like to listen
to their music at 100% it does leave
quite a bit there
like I said outdoors probably not big
deal outdoors like I'm starting up
walking around but in indoors anywhere
that's probably going to be an issue for
sure so now it's time for the girlfriend
test all right so what do you have
planned for us well I have my robot
unicorn
um game that I just started I'm a newbie
so I'm you know I'm gonna be making a
lot of mistakes but it's a lot of fun
and I don't know what's I guess you'll
see yeah so we're gonna do the same
thing here we're going to put the I'm
gonna have the headphones on and I'm
gonna play music at 50% and 75% and 100%
so that I can see if this can isolate
the noise that's coming from the game
and her baby so we'll see how it does
there and we'll start it off with 50%
all right level 3 so I'm just kidding
okay so I did hear that quite a bit
um they isolate the best and then can't
help noise but she's really close to me
and I think that's pretty loud so um
this is not bad
I do think that if something was pretty
far away wouldn't be that big a deal but
it wasn't as strong as I would have
liked but this is an active
noise-cancelling or anything so we'll
see how it does around 75% right
that again
all right so a 75% I did here very
slightly I hurt her more so than the
game so I think that's going to be a
pretty good for anyone who's like I said
not in the very very close vicinity so
slightly 5% I really did like
considering you know the volumes here so
75% is a pretty good go and acting
outdoors you'll be just fine you'll be
hearing any cars and buses things like
that so good go now
let's try it out at 100%
okay Jenna's really good at this game so
he got me a star level dream all right
so at 100% I didn't hear anything at all
it was pretty good
and what I liked about this even though
I 100 percent I'm not recommending
listening to it but it's not that loud
it did leak a bit um here but it wasn't
that loud when I'm having money
on my ear it's not unbearable and
overall guys I think these did pretty
well it did leak a bit at 75% and a lot
of 100% 100% is natural but 75% did leak
a bit more but not enough to bother like
I said outdoors anything like that
and for the girlfriend size I think it
did pretty well I did hear it a bit at
50% not as much sound isolation as I
would have liked but it definitely did
better at 75 and 100% so overall these
are pretty good especially when you're
at that 75% ranging up so that's about
it guys let's give a round of applause -
yeah on your sandwich and we'll catch
you guys in the next video till then
it's your average consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
