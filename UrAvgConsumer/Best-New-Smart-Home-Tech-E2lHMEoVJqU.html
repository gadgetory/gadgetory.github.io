Siri meet Alexa if Siri was someone's
wife Alexa would be the mistress amazon
has created a device that's always on
and always ready for you the Amazon echo
is just what I was missing from my tech
living room it's a cylinder shape and
it's pretty sleek so it was very easy to
integrate into the setup one of my
favorite things about it is its home
automation features you can turn
anything on or off using smart plugs
like the one sold by Wemo and even
change your lighting if you own Philips
- smart bulbs just say Alexa and you can
ask you any question or give it a
command Alexa turn on the moon lights
okay course it allows you to buy things
from Amazon listen to audible audiobooks
and play music from the Amazon Prime
streaming service you can also listen to
Pandora and other popular music apps
with its 360 degree speaker that
actually sounds pretty good it's also
equipped with the ability to set and
play alarms give sports updates manage
your shopping list and check your google
calendar and you guys know I like the
ability to be as lazy as possible and
talk to my tech shout-out to my Xbox one
Kinect I can already see this thing
changing the way me and Ari use our
living room I also purchased the remote
which you can use to talk to Alexa if
you don't feel like shouting are in a
different room or to control your music
now I find that Alexa fell short when it
came to questions that she didn't know
the answers to
and unlike Siri it doesn't provide
search results since there's no attached
screen you so questions like what time
is Willowbrook Mall closed just got a
simple I don't know it's constantly
updating through the cloud though so I
can't wait to see whatever features are
added to
the existing list of Awesome ones so
next up we have the amcrest pro HD Wi-Fi
camera and if you're checking out your
living room like me you'll want to keep
your eye on things with a small
form-factor and discreet black matte
finish it appears to be your typical
security camera but it's far from that
within a minute or two I was able to
quickly set up the camera and start
messing around with its features with a
built-in two-way speaker the ability to
wire in existing alarm setup and night
vision this thing was definitely made to
guard your valuables what makes em
crests different from all the other
security cameras I've tested is the
ability to literally control what you're
seeing using the amp rush that you'll be
able to pan tilt and zoom so you have
complete control over what parts of the
room you see how close you see it that
kind of flexibility can definitely come
in handy you can hook up multiple
cameras and view live feeds of up to 16
different cameras simultaneously which
is pretty amazing so if you deck out
your house with a few of these I can
imagine me missing anything that happens
you also have the cool ability to get
your recordings onto a micro SD card or
you can use em Crysis cloud service to
keep footage that may be important to
you now on to what really matters to
camera quality this camera is equipped
with a wide-angle 1080p camera so you
get that full HD playback with a wide
field of view needless to say it's
crispy and if some of you guys are
interested in winning the pro HD camera
I'm actually teaming up with amcrest to
give away a few you guys all you'll have
to do is follow them on Facebook and
find the post talking about the giveaway
for more details and while you're at it
be sure to let them know UAC sent you
next up you have the google onhub this
cylinder-shaped device doesn't look like
your typical high speed router Google
did something really cool here they've
taken your typical image of a router and
changed it completely this thing was
made to be out in the open where your
Wi-Fi signal works best without being an
eyesore like this guy in taking a look
around a router you see that it has a
much friendlier design there are very
minimal wires the antennas are tucked
inside the body and instead of those
blinking status lights you have lighting
that you can
is to either dim or turn off completely
the design is definitely unique and so
are some of its features the onhub works
with whatever internet service you have
and regularly searches for the least
crowded Wi-Fi signal and it'll even
switch to it so that you have the best
connection possible without ever
disrupting you Google's focus here is
optimizing your Wi-Fi performance you
can even choose which device gets the
most bandwidth so if you're into gaming
like me and you want to make sure your
connection doesn't cut off while playing
your favorite online game you can
prioritize most of your bandwidth to go
to your system and what's even better is
this thing works through an app using
the new google on app you can set up and
control your router right from your
phone or tablet gone are the days of a
lengthy setup process since you can do
it all straight from your app and
instead of having to memorize those
crazy passwords you have written down
somewhere you can use the Google on app
to set and securely share any passwords
with your friends using your device and
now we've got the third gen Nest
Learning Thermostat I don't think
there's anything more boring than a
thermostat but somehow let's manage to
make it cool it does what a typical
thermostat does controls the temperature
in your home but Nest has some new
features that allows you to save money
through its improved learning
capabilities you have full control over
your thermostat even when you're away
you can use the nest app to adjust your
temperature so if you're on your way
home and you want to make sure your home
is cool when you get there instead of
having your AC blasting all day simply
set it to be an hour or two before you
arrive home you can even monitor how
much energy you use so you can be
conscious of how much you're spending
and because this is a list of tech for
your smart home it makes sense that this
thing is smart it learns from your
habits and starts to program itself and
automatically turns itself down when you
leave the house even when the seasons
change next changes to make sure you're
comfortable in your home and for all of
us who want to be environmentally
conscious the thermostat has a leaf when
you choose a temperature that saves
energy it also does this on a bigger
more beautiful and vibrant screen than
its previous versions I don't think I've
ever called it thermostat beautiful but
nested a pretty good job making this
thing
practive but that's about it for this
list guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy that gives this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next video
till then it's your average consumer
