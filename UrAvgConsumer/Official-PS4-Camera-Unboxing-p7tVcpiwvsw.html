consumer and today I'm going to be
unboxing the PlayStation 4 camera it's
actually just called the PlayStation
camera but Best Buy is selling these as
well as the DualShock for control it's a
little bit early and I decided to pick
this up for you guys so let's not waste
any time let's get right into it
my my Bob Bob Bob Bob and all right guys
here we have the PlayStation 4 camera
and I did mention before I got this from
Gamestop and I paid $60 for it so if you
can find the controllers the camera as
well as like a charging dock over here
so they've got a couple accessories and
some games as well for the ps4 so he can
get those early and at first I wasn't
too interested in the camera because I
never really had any interest like in
the PlayStation I that was for the ps3
but since Sony's going with this whole
social aspect with the ps4 I figured
this might be pretty cool to pick up
since you know you can use it to talk
and video chat all that kind of stuff so
we'll see what this can do but umm
alright so let's get to unboxing this
thing will just pop open the top we have
some stickers up here so we can use the
unboxing knife to get those open and
let's see there we go alright so let's
this up here and let's pull this right
out and boom so let's see what we get
here so we've got a manual this is the
manual for the ps4 camera this is I'm
assuming a stand of some sort and let's
see what this is
alright so this is the stand that it
sits on and it seems adjustable so you
can move it around a bit here so let's
put this aside for a second and I guess
all that's left is the actual camera
itself now I'm not sure if this
functions with the ps3 at all I know the
Dual Shock 4 control
or you know you can use that with the
ps3 aside from the you know the touch
features but I'm not sure if this
functions at all for the ps3 now this is
a pretty interesting camera it's very
long it's very Kinect like you can say
what's interesting is that I believe the
tilts and has all kinds of movements
here as you guys can see so let me give
you guys a quick close-up of what I'm
seeing here all right so here's a better
look at it
you can see it has two cameras here so
this is supposed to capture 3d
environment so it can capture you as
well as your background so it's got two
wide-angle lenses here so like I said
captures through the environment and it
also has four microphones so you have
the two cameras here as well as two
microphones on each side so this works
with voice commands you'll also be able
to use this for party chats I'm not sure
how close it it has to be in order to
pick up your voice clearly but that's to
be seen and then these cameras will also
work with like augmented reality things
so if developers want to have some kind
of augmented reality games or apps
you'll be able to use this camera for
that now this camera will also be able
to pick up the PlayStation 4 controllers
LED light so it can decipher which
players are in the room and it uses
those lights to kind of capture that so
it's going to be pretty interesting to
see what developers do take advantage of
this camera it should be pretty
interesting like I said before I wasn't
too interested in having a camera period
the PlayStation Eye wasn't that great
but I do feel like you know with the
whole new social aspect so he's trying
to incorporate with the PlayStation 4
this could be pretty useful and at 60
bucks it's pretty much a bargain
the Xbox one comes with its Kinect
sensor and that you have no option there
and it makes the Xbox $100 more
expensive this with a PlayStation 4 only
retails for about 460 in comparison to
the $500 price point that the Xbox one
has so it's still a pretty good offering
here and let's just take a look at how
long the cable that it comes with is so
here we've got a pretty long cable as
you can see so this should give you some
decent arm
room to put place this somewhere so it
shouldn't be too bad for my geeks out
there who are interested in what the
resolution of these lenses are they both
are 1280 by 800 so it's not bad pretty
good resolution um higher than 720 so
that's really nice and yeah let's take a
look at what this how this stand will
work with it as you can see it has these
four little knots right here makes you
give you guys a close-up as you guys can
see it has these little four things so
I'm assuming this is going to be able to
hook onto it and as you guys can see
right here at the bottom you can just
hook these together and it snaps in
place so you can see it just bends in
place and you can place it however you
want so that's pretty cool and yes it's
pretty comfortably it seems not like it
won't tip over anything easily that's
really really good can't do too many
positions with it you can probably sit
it on top of your television it has a
little border here at the bottom so that
it can stay on top of a monitor and um
yeah so this is pretty much it guys um
I'm interested in this camera I can't
wait to see what developers do with it
augmented reality the social aspect um
being able to video chat and all that
stuff it's going to be pretty cool to
see and that's about it for this
unboxing guys I'm gonna have more
PlayStation 4 coverage on the channel
for sure I definitely can't wait to get
my hands on it November 15th is coming
and I'm pretty excited but as I said
that's it for this unboxing guys and
I'll catch you guys in the next one
