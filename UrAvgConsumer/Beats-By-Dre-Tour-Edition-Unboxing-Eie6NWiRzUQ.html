want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
is your average consumer and I'm gonna
do another unboxing video for you guys
this time on the beats by dre tour
Editions and I already have these but I
was lucky enough to get my hands on a an
open box today so I'm going to unbox
this for you guys and let you see what's
inside
alright let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright let's get this bad
boy open I'm sure you guys have probably
seen tons of the unboxing of this thing
you know it's been on forever for now
but you know I got a new box I didn't
have a video of it already so figured
let me just do the unboxing for you guys
and you know we can see what's inside
alright so we have a little repair so I
guess we'll just start from right here
plastic ball as always just the
packaging you come to expect black on
red this over here get the black on that
packaging of course it's really nice
tells you about the control talk here
this comes with control talk and as you
know control talk does its volume up
volume down allows you to answer calls
play music press the play button to play
music of course skip songs go back you
know go back a track rewind fast-forward
all that good stuff and these are black
these are the black pairs and um you
know this is the box so let's pull this
thing out
you already got the big red box and you
grabbed a little flap open it up and
here you can see SS whoops here you can
see this has sound matters and here we
have the headphones so nicely place in
this nice little velvety feeling
container pull it open by grabbing the
sides which lead to the headphones and
some warnings about damaging your ears
by listening to the volume too loudly
here we have some booklets special other
beats by dre products in the series so
that that here's a Quick Start Guide as
well as a warranty your warranty
information so we can put all these
words away nobody likes to
and we'll get to the headphones
themselves now here you'll have the case
the little small case that comes with it
inside you'll find a plethora of earbuds
to fit all types of ears to make a
comfortable date supply you was I think
about maybe at least 10 different
earbuds about maybe five or six pairs
and it really is to like try and fit
everyone's ears also inside of this
comes to with a little clip to latch on
to the headphones themselves which is
very useful because a lot of people like
to complain about them falling out of
their ears and I think that is that
plays a big part in keeping it on your
ears without it falling also because
this is a little heavy because of the
control talk and this little part right
here there is great for keeping it and
even though you have those heavy things
weighing it down
finally captions now also back to the
case with the different earbuds you get
these two adjustable clips that can
easily get on the get on the headphones
themselves for those people who again
have trouble keeping these on their ears
it easily just hooks right in and you
can go it around your ear and if to hold
it in place and they're adjustable so
you can bend this it's like a bendable
metal inside you can bend it to
customize you know the shape of it so it
can be as comfortable as possible for
your liking so they really went out of
their way here to supply you with things
to keep it in your ears and not how to
fall out every two seconds
so they give you those you know what you
need they're gonna use it here we can
just come strap this and you got
yourself some tours now the design is
really nice of course I love these
headphones the basis really nice on
these it's really surprising actually
how much basis and this but I'll save
that for the review I'll give it the
sound and all that good stuff as you
guys like to hear and pretty much that's
it for the box itself you have the
headphones here you have two earbuds
the adjustable clips the case and the
box and all the warranty information
inside the box and that is what you get
inside of the beats by dre tours when
you open it up this is your average
consumer please feel free to rate
