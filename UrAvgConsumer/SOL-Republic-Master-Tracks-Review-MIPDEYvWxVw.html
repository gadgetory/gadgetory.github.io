consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the SOL Republic master
tracks so let's not wasting your time
let's get right into it
and alright guys here we have the SOL
Republic master tracks now these are
some pretty nice-looking headphones
they're a little bit on the larger side
but they are still very nice I think so
republic has some very interesting
designs as far as their headphones go
the first thing you'll notice about
these is that they can actually take off
the ear cups and you can unplug the
cable so it's like a little assembly
then required kind of thing here but
overall it's still very nice this does
come with a case now this case is a
little pouch that you can throw it in
and zip it up it's not going to offer
too much protection as far as impact or
anything like that but it will protect
it from possible scratches or stuff like
that and it makes it easier to carry
around so you don't have a loose cable
just flopping around or anything like
that
so it's not the best case in the world
but it does get the job done as far as
just making it a lot easier to carry
take a look at the actual headphones
themselves you'll see that it has a lot
of cushioning around the ear cups and as
well as the headband on older solar
public headphones they didn't offer as
much cushioning at the top they just had
a little strip but this one has a
dedicated portion to it just all cushion
so it can feel really nice and soft now
it taking a look at the ear cups
themselves you'll see that it has a
smaller cutout but it's good enough to
get your ear right inside and it's kind
of like a hybrid of over ear and on ear
because even though you get your ear
inside it still feels like the ear cups
are covered are on the ears so it's kind
of a bit of both it goes around it but
it still feels like it's on but it's
still very very comfortable I'm very
happy with this but like I said it isn't
bit on the larger side so that's
something keep in mind I'm very happy
with the design of these I think they
look pretty cool although they're a bit
larger I still am a fan of design of
these headphones I'm actually pretty
impressed with solar public as far as
the design aspect it's hit or miss
depending on who you are and your
preference but I think that they did a
pretty good job here and what's great
about these headphones is that there
extremely durable you can see that you
can twist the headband in all kinds of
shapes and you can make it even a whole
180 degree line it's really surprising
but this stuff is really really durable
it's really strong head Bend now as for
the ear cups I wouldn't say they're ice
durable at the head band they do move a
little bit you can actually get them to
move around to fit your ears so that's
pretty good as well now this does come
with a white sheet cable so that means
you'll have to plug those jacks in to
both sides of those ear cups the inline
remote is able to work with all Apple
devices so you got the volume controls
to play and pause fast-forward rewind
all that good stuff but they will only
do playing pause with Android devices
the volume controls will not work and
now of course to talk about the sound
quality the sound quality on these was
pretty nice as a bass head I'm a fan
they advertise that this has some really
deep bass and it sounds good and I
actually am a fan of the sound I don't
think that the an audio file would be
too crazy about this in comparing them
to be audio technica ath M 50s I did
notice that impounds a bit more muffled
in comparison but it did make up for it
with the whole bass thing which I'm a
fan of so that's the kind of trade-off
here I can't imagine some people saying
that this isn't the clearest pair of
headphones out there but it does sound
pretty good to me when I wasn't
comparing it to something like the 80 hm
50s I definitely did enjoy them but
overall I'm very happy I think the
average consumer can pick these up and
feel very confident let's say you don't
want to do the whole beats thing but you
still want the bass heavy headphones I
think these are a very good alternative
especially considering they're only
$1.99 so that's not bad at all so
overall it was a good go for me if
you're someone who likes bass deep bass
then this is gonna be a good fit for you
if you're not someone who's crazy about
bass I would say you're it you should
probably look into like the em 50s if
anything if you care for that but
overall guys I did like it time for me
to show you what it looks like on and
here you have it this is what it looks
like on there a little bit on the larger
side as I mentioned before and if you
take a look around and see this is what
looks like but you'll really notice it
when I put it on and you can see I got a
little Princess Leia thing going here
big pretty big air cups so turn to the
side of course so you guys all kinds of
angles and this is what it looks like
like I said pretty big but I do think
it's kind of stylish I kind of like it
um
but that's about it guys um overall I do
like these headphones I would recommend
them to the average consumer who wants
bass-heavy headphones not someone who's
looking for more so clarity or anything
like that and guys if you're interested
in picking up the master tracks be sure
to check them out at orb headphones comm

else that you see browsing their site if

still save 20 bucks so there's a lot of
good savings over there with my name and
