consumer and today I have another
unboxing for you guys of the new beats
by dre tours now this is the new version
without monster and since the packaging
has changed and unboxing is in order
so let's not wasting any time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the beats tours like I said I've already
done an unboxing of these but this is
the new packaging without monster I'm
actually doing this because I actually
got a short in my beat story I think
they got a little wet and I luckily I
had the warranty from Best Buy and I got
these exchanged so I had the old monster
versions now these are the ones with
that monster so I figured why not doing
unboxing to let you guys see what the
packaging is like now so let me pop this
open and we'll get a quick look at
what's inside this yeah now if it made
the Box a lot smaller before used to be
a lot taller but this is the new size
and all of the in-ear headphones seems
to be coming in to size now so it's very
interesting let's open this up and here
you have the tours but first on this
side so what you get pretty standard
stuff I'm sure that we see in every
other unboxing video to be so here we
have all the packaging stuff this shows
you all the other beats products all
that good stuff you got some stickers
here warranty information some other
stuff and a user guide so now that we
got all of this out of the way see the
actual tours here you got this little
flap you can pull this down and it'll
show you the beats and that's
interesting now I unboxed the beat the
power beats and I notice that they had
this little egg-shaped umm
before the beats tours have that around
case so this is very interesting so I'm
going to pop this open if I can figure
out how I don't go sticky all right so I
saw these with the power beats first and
it's very interesting to see that they
change the shape of the beats tours case
to this so that's very interesting let's
see what it looks like inside
and give you guys a quick close-up so
here we have a close-up of the new beats
tourist case and I'm interested in
seeing how this is going to work with
the tours I'm not sure I know how these
will work with the power beats but I'm
not sure if they really work with the
tours so it's going to be interesting to
check this out and yeah pretty much this
is it guys it's a hardshell case should
offer some pretty good protection form
and you also get this little thing and I
saw this with the power beats as well
this is where you have all be the
different the different earbuds so this
is how they're caring they're storing
them they'll I'll give you guys a
close-up of this as well and here you
have them guys as you can see inside
these are a bunch of little earbuds and
I think this looks like they're some of
them come with three now I'm guessing
those are the most common ones this must
be the small large so I guess if you
happen to lose one you got a spare so
you can exchange up to three different
parts I guess so that's pretty cool that
they offer so many buds
they've always offered a lot of ear buds
for with the UM tour so it's pretty cool
that they offer this now and it got this
nice cool little carrying case with it
as well and all right now let's take the
tours out themselves
it's a very interesting little design
here very interesting stuff that they
actually went with so let's pull this
out I can put this back in the box
now let's get this little sticky part
off
and here we go all right and here we
have the tours now this looks pretty
much the same as the previous version
not much difference here um I guess the
only difference would be maybe that it
says beats here I can't even remember if
the old one said monster or beats on
this part but alright let me give you
guys a close-up so here we have the
tours of course it's pretty standard
stuff this is what they always look like
it's nothing new here and um yeah this
is it moving along we have the inline
remote this works with out all Apple
products pretty much and it works with
Android devices to play and pause works
with most Android devices the up and the
volume up and downs don't really work
and this is the little part that holds
it together
it says beats on it I can't recall it to
set monster before but it does say beats
now and at the bottom you have the the
jack and this does say beats I do know
that before it said monster but it says
beats now I think that's about all that
changes with these earphones guys and
pretty much that wraps up this unboxing
of the beat tours that don't have
monster branding on them now my
experience with Beats that don't have
monster branding is that they sound
exactly the same as they previously did
so that's just my opinion I didn't see
any difference between the ones that had
monster branding and the ones that
didn't so I'm not expecting to do it
don't expect a new review or anything
like that but I do think I'm gonna do a
new girlfriend test since the last sound
League test I did with the tours wasn't
really the greatest so I think I'll be
doing that and you can look out for that
guys and that pretty much wraps up this
unboxing so if you like this video

next video till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
