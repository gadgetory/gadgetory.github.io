going to Best Buy again and what are we
getting married wait okay I don't even
know if I can have a say we reading the
windows surface pro tablet 3 nice
alright good job you should know what
you're buying when you're spending that
much of it so here's what you guys know
elastic we went to Best Buy and we saw
it we want to think on it we don't like
to make it like impulse purchases but
now after we've had some thought I think
a week we're decided to get it
yeah why not so we're gonna I'm gonna
get one I was gonna get one and before
you can say guys he's not paying for it
for me okay oh god she's gonna buy it
herself
my own full time job guys so we're on
our way there now so Lexi needs new
brakes it's durable I'm going I'm
actually going to New York tomorrow so
don't be blocking tomorrow but man she
going to New York sticking her simulates
brakes because she is crying
can you guys hear that let us know if
we're gonna system back it's actually
pretty embarrassing driving around
actually I can only imagine why you'll
stop the car and since you guys did such
an awesome job giving me feedback last
week about
what kind of things gotta you guys want
to see on the channel he was so excited
meeting those comically cat had like a
paper been making lists of like he's
gonna do next
I really really appreciate that so
expect to see some of those things in
future videos but now I have another
requests kind of feedback thing I want
to get from you guys I want to bring a
project to the channel something I want
to work on over the course of a few
videos and I want to know what you guys
want to see I'm thinking maybe like some
kind of PC or anything that would take
some time to build and
research over a project kind of thing
yeah I personally think you should check
out our living room right now we have a
really nice TV in our room but like that
and he got like surround sound speakers
that kind of stuff so I think we've
really awesome if he just like check out
the room and just like really like tech
film awesome but what you guys think
yeah that sounds like a pretty good idea
to me
all right idea of sprucing up and living
out the living room and so that sounds
like a really cool idea but um if you
guys have any other suggestions things
that you really want to see me work on
something that you know that average
consumer can take on as a project as
well let me know and then I worked on
that and trying to bring that project to
the channel so I definitely want to see
what your ideas are and able gets
working on it alright guys so right now
we're and that's five so we're checking
out the surface tablets this is actually
what we're planning on picking up
so this is the tablet right here and the
little pen never purchased a new
computer or laptop well I haven't been
very long time he yeah I got my last
laptop one of my last computer purchase

those who might be interested they don't
have the i3 the one that's $800 they
don't have that one until August 1st was
it she'd be probably better suited for
that one but I want whatever the average
consumer is getting I mean it's funny
this surprising we got a lot of
attention from the last vlog people were
asking questions about these I didn't
even see that one it's true this is an
interesting little speaker look at this
