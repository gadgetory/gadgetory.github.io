this is my wife Ari and today we're
bringing back the sound leaked and sound
isolation test formerly known as the
girlfriend test now it's the live test
and today we're gonna be doing this with
the sony here on headphones right yeah
technically sony here on wireless noise
cancelling headphones it's just too much
right and it's like the model numbers
like and whatever so we're gonna be
using this guy and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna start off with the sound
leak test where we're gonna put it on
and see how much it leaks at 100% 75%
and 50% and for those of you who are new
to this channel this is a good practical
use for like if you're on the bus and
you don't want to like annoy people with
your music or if I'm like sitting with
him and I'm doing something else I don't
want to hear all of his music so we want
to say just how much it leaks from that
book basically how annoying are these
headphones for someone nearby so let's
start off with the sound leak test and
I'm actually going to start this off at
50% and then we'll work our way up to
100% which won't be too fun for this one
in here I have to look because back in
the day police like she's wearing the
headphones wrong oh well alright so
we're gonna start it off at 50% you
ready yes and here we go
I do hear it a little bit even at 50%
yeah definitely not a bother though if I
say she was sitting next to me if I were
preoccupied with something else I
probably wouldn't even notice if I were
any further away be dressed alright yeah
I can't even hear it right now actually
must've been a lot of point in the song
so now we're going to start at we're
gonna go to 75%
okay you ready yes now it is a bit more
audible now I do hear it a bit more
still wouldn't really bother me oh
actually it might but you got to be you
got to be a bit of a douche to be
annoyed by this yeah it's not so bad
right now even at 75%
yeah not bad not bad alright so now
we're going to go to one
% ready yes and what do we do oh yeah we
don't recommend listening to your
headphones about a hundred percent
because disclaimer disclaimer disclaimer
right you can hurt yourself we're going
to do it for five seconds
I have imaginary earbuds don't worry
about a guy okay maybe not your place
it's called dibblex
earplugs yes so 100% ready yes as you
didn't jump for anything you've had 100
percent this is not so bad it only
sounds slightly louder than 75% I mean
if you want to be nitpicky you could say
that this could annoy someone but I
don't think this is gonna be a problem
at all so 500% this guy gets a pass in
my book awesome you could you could I
could hear it yeah but I mean it's not
really a pain if you guys can hear it
tell us same with a song in the comments
right now boom alright so now it's time
for the wife test aka
sound isolation test formerly known as
the girl for test yeah so what we're
gonna be doing here is I'm gonna be
listening to the music yeah almost drop
the phone
so we're going to be doing here is I'm
gonna be listening to the music this
time of course at 50% 75% 100% and I'm
gonna see if I can block out her
annoying ways and I want to isolate her
all the way over there the whole
conscious of the wife test is just like
see if you can block out annoying sounds
he thinks I'm annoying with my nagging
and sometimes my singing so awesome but
we do a test to see if these headphones
are worthy and typically in regular real
life situations if they can block her
out they can probably blackout things
like you know standard noise that you
hear on the outside now these are
actually noise cancelling headphones so
when it comes to low frequencies like
buzzing or maybe a train sound airplanes
this is gonna be really good but we're
gonna see how it works here yeah and
this idea is actually inspired by what
happened last night I was I'm going to
be singing karaoke from this app ah what
is it mule yeah
but she's been using that guy as she
hasn't used it in like forever but she's
just brought it back yesterday I'm like
you know what that's perfect for trying
these guys out yeah all right so let's
see I'm going to be singing um you'll
see it's a classic so for this one we're
gonna start it off at 100% and work our
way down and see if it works even at the
lower volumes alright alright you ready
put this guy on I feel sorry for you
guys I know 100% I don't have to here
for now listen I'm not a good singer but
I try just enjoy it
are you ready okay all right here goes
I'm gonna be a mighty king so enemies
beware well I've never seen a king of
beasts with quite so little hair I'm
gonna be the main event like no King was
before I'm Russian I'm looking down I
thought I could escape it but she kept
saying it man you I did not hear you at
all this thing killed it right so of
course now we got to try to add 75%
what's hope it still works I feel so
sorry for you guys but hid behind notes
ooh oh my gosh all right here we go
I'm working on my roar the small rather
uninspiring thing oh I just can't wait
to be king
oh sorry all right so I didn't hear you
at all day really yeah it look like your
belly
I like your belting so this this did a
great job at 75% which isn't too loud
for you know regular listening so
awesome job there cool alright time to
bring it down to 50% and see if this
will still protect me from that
alright ready and boom no Stu this known
be there what I meant no sigh stop that
don't say see here free to run around
all day free or do it all my way
all right so I did hear that she was
saying something she was you know I
heard a little bit but there wasn't
enough to bother me I couldn't make out
what she was saying so these was that
Raman applause for me no it was not goes
for these guys these are very very well
the Sony here on Wireless killed it I so
it's a pass for both both so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this look Oh God
hopefully you got here get rid of that
hopefully you guys enjoy this little
test of course it's not super scientific
and it's not meant to be meant to be for
fun practical situations well sort of
both of you guys enjoyed it shout out to
her and again look out for it the review
coming soon yeah in about a week yeah
til next one guys booth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
