going on guys it's ravage consumer and
today we're gonna be talking about some
features you got to know about before
you buy your next laptop and is
graduation season shout out some
graduates so whether you're moving onto
a new school or maybe going for a
full-time job this one's for you now the
first feature we got to talk about is on
this guy right here and that is Intel's
1-watt display also known as their
low-power display and what this is
basically going to do is increase the
battery life on your laptop now even
though this is called a low-power
display don't let that confuse you this
is still a really good panel that gets
plenty bright even in a room like this
with a ton of windows and a lot of light
coming in it still looks really good and
you can still see all the content on
your screen without a problem
so brightness not an issue even though
it's called a low-power display now let
me give a quick a little explanation
about one watt displays and why this is
actually a cool feature usually this
plays are about two watts so that means
about half the consumption that you
would get from a standard display is
what you're getting here which
definitely impacts the battery life no
matter what the device is whether it's a
laptop or a smartphone depending on the
display and the brightness that you have
of that it could really impact the
battery life on that device so with the
display being one of the biggest things
that consume battery life on a laptop
it's awesome that they actually tried to
bring that down while still keeping the
same quality of the display so with
students in mind especially if you're in
college and you're on campus you want
your laptop to survive as long as
possible especially if you're on the go
and you don't want to stick to a wall
and be plugged in and there's gonna be a
really really helpful thing to have more
juice now this right here is the Razer
Blade stealth 13 and it features the 1
watt display but it isn't the only one
that features this display I'll of
course have links down below in the
description for all the laptops that I
know of that currently have this so if
you guys are interested in saving some
battery life those are the ones you want
to look into but of course the list is
growing is still pretty new technology
so we will hopefully be seeing that in
future laptops and it's great because
these laptops with these low power
displays are still powered by eighth
generation intel core i7 processor
so you're still getting that great power
and great battery life now one of my
personal favorite features on this list
is actually called Windows hello and for
those of you who don't know what Windows
hello is it pretty much uses the webcam
on your laptop or a special webcam
actually to scan your face and unlock
your device and you can actually find
that feature on a ton of different
computers but where it's most popular is
with smartphones being able to unlock
your phone with your face is something
that's pretty normal nowadays and that's
the feature that's been on laptops for a
while now so it still drives me kind of
crazy when I see new laptops come out
without this feature so it's definitely
something you want to check out if I
want to put this computer to sleep and
when I go to wake it up let's see and
boom
logged me and just like that so that is
really awesome not being forced to type
in a password or a pan of any sort it's
really nice to be able to just hit a key
you wake up the computer I have a
scanner facing you get right in now
windows holidays only come in the form
of a face scanner it actually uses other
things as well so with this laptop over
here if I wanted to put this guy to
sleep and wake it up you'll notice that
right here this little square is a
fingerprint scanner so if I want to wake
this guy up I just hit this boom and I'm
inside so very quick access to your
computer with your face or your
fingerprint depending on what you want
or what your computer supports but it is
extremely helpful and that laptop that
we were using with the fingerprint
scanner is actually called the Acer
swift 7 and it has a cool feature that
you should definitely look out for it
has Intel 4G LTE capability and with
that you can pretty much get a SIM card
inside of this guy and get data
connection anywhere you go that you
would probably get data connection just
like you would with your smart phone it
is a different kind of beast
when your laptop can go on the internet
no matter where you are so for my
students if your campus happens to have
some pretty crummy Wi-Fi this is going
to change everything for you because you
won't need to rely on that Wi-Fi anymore
and not only that it's also just safer
to be able to have your own private
connection
rather than being on a public Wi-Fi
network when you're accessing things
like the bank or whatever private
information you may be accessing this
thing is going to be a lot safer a lot
faster most likely and overall just a
lot more convenient and while we're on
the topic of having a data connection
there's actually another feature you
might pass to me the razor now this kind
of right here actually has the Intel
wireless AC feature now what that
basically does is allows you to have a
stronger data connection with your Wi-Fi
now you will need a supporting router
and service to make it work but if you
do have it that is something you're
gonna want to look into when you're
purchasing your next laptop with this
feature you're pretty much able to get
better speeds on your Wi-Fi as well as
have better connectivity so for me you
guys might have seen my video where I
had to put a ton of different Wi-Fi
access points in my house because I just
couldn't get Wi-Fi in certain spots
there are a lot of dead zones and with
the wireless AC feature I wouldn't need
as many as the six that I have right now
throughout my house so that is also
something you're gonna want on your
radar if you're making a laptop purchase
in the near future so that's pretty much
my list I really do think that these
things will impact the way you use your
computer on a daily basis but hopefully
you guys enjoy this if you did be the
cool guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up and if you want to learn more
about any of these features like that
low powered display of course have links
down below in the description for you to
check out if you like these kind of
videos let me know with a comment down
below and I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
