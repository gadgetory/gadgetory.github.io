consumer and today I'm going to be
reviewing the Logitech UE six thousands
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it
and all right guys here we have the
Logitech UE 6000 and these are probably
one of my favorite headphones at this
price range they retail for about two
hundred dollars and they're direct
competitor would like to beat solo HDS
amongst some other headphones but before
we get into that let's take a look at
the case that it comes in
first things first you'll get a soft
carrying case which is interesting
because it's got this square shape and
you usually don't see a square shape for
these carrying cases they're usually
like oval or you know round and flat but
this one is square and it's actually
pretty cool and it fits inside bags
pretty well it doesn't take up a lot of
space at all so it's really got a nice
small footprint and you can see as I put
inside this bag here in my small pouch
it gets in with no problem no not too
much heft to it and when we open up the
case you'll find the headphones of
course and they're sitting inside
diagonally and I guess that's how it
fits inside of a square shaped case but
it's very secure nonetheless so you
won't have a lot of movement and when we
take a closer look inside of the case
you'll see that it has a pouch and this
is where you can carry some accessories
this is where the cable sits and taking
a quick look at the cable that it comes
with you'll see that it's a tangle free
cable due to the thick wire and it has
an inline remote that works with Apple
devices like the iPhone and iPod and
play and pause button works with Android
devices and this cable does have a
raised L shape input so you can use this
with any mobile device that has a case
on it with no problem one thing I really
like about the UE six thousands is that
they come with a headphone splitter and
what you can do with these is plug it
into an audio device and have two
different headphones listen at the same
time you can either have the UE six
thousands and another one plugged into a
device or you can plug these in between
the six thousands and it's cable and
then add another pair of headphones to
create a daisy chain effect hopefully
that wasn't too confusing but now let's
take a look at the actual star of the
show the UE 6000 and I must say these
are some great looking headphones
definitely very stylish I was very
impressed when I did my unboxing
of them and I saw how nice they looked
and it's got a nice sturdy feel to them
my only upset about these headphones is
that it's very glassy on the side so as
you can see here there are tons of
fingerprints so you might want to use a
little microfiber to get that cleaned
every now and then and one of my
favorite aspects of the design of these
headphones is that cool hints of blue
you see around the ear cup and also
inside of it the headband is also made
of a smooth matte finish which I'm
always a fan of and you'll notice that
there's a good bit of padding found on
this headband combine that with some
very plush ear cups and you'll find
yourself listening to music for a long
period of time with no worries about
comfort the ear cups are also quite deep
so you don't have to worry about your
ears pressing against anything which is
always nice these ear cups are an
over-the-air design that actually
outlines the shape of an ear which means
that's going to be a pretty good chance
that the cushions won't be pressing
directly on your ear which leads to some
good comfort and for those of you
interested in seeing up close how it
actually folds here it is but inside
these ear cups you'll be using two
triple A batteries when you hit this
little switch you can flip it open and
you'll find the two triple A batteries
there and what's really cool about these
headphones is that they come with the
batteries so that's always a really good
thing and you can see there's a little
strap there that makes sure you'll never
lose that cover that pops off and of
course on the right side you'll find the
input for your 3.5 millimeter cable and
you'll also find the switch that powers
on the active noise-cancelling and
what's great about these headphones is
that you don't need the batteries or you
don't need to use this feature without
batteries it'll work just fine with it
you'll be able to use the active
noise-cancelling and of course time to
talk about the sound quality I was
actually very impressed with the sound
quality of the UE 6000 they delivered on
some good bass they sounded very clear
it's night and day in comparison to
something like the beats solo HDS in
comparison to the audio technica ath em
50s I would say that these sound a
little more bassy but not as clear but
overall it's definitely a really great
sound
I was definitely a fan because I am a
basehead and I would definitely suggest
it if you're into the
you want to listen to hip-hop or
anything like that definitely good stuff
here and all right guys it's time for me
to show you with a lot of you tech you
e6000 look like around the neck and here
you have it as you can see it looks
pretty cool I'm a big fan of the style
as I've said before and here it is
around the on the ears here it is with
the front and of course here it is with
side and I can't say it enough I am a
big fan of the design really good stuff
here
overall I do like these headphones is
pretty isn't better than solo HDS for
the price um I definitely am a fan of
this line I think the sound was pretty
good and have the bass that I was
looking for or sounded clear enough to
me I tried in a bunch of different
genres it really sounded good so I'm
very happy with the UE 6000 I would
definitely recommend them if you are
interested I do think they're a bit
better than some of the other headphones
you'll find in this price range so that
pretty much wraps up my review guys
