and today we've got a list of ten new
tech life hacks for you guys to try out
the first hack we've got is moving
around multiple apps at once on iOS so I
don't know if you guys know this but you
can actually move around multiple apps
on the home screen of any iOS device by
doing just this so like always when you
want to move around a an app you just
have to hold it down you wait till the
whole thing starts wiggling and whatnot
so you grab it but once you grab it you
can also start grabbing other things and
it starts to bundle them and when you do
this it's easy to just go ahead and
throw them all within one folder so if
you're someone who likes to organize and
you know keep your home screen clean but
it usually takes too long because you've
got to grab them one at a time this
thing is a huge time saver and next up
is accessing emojis right from your
computer so let's say we've got a
Windows laptop over here and we want to
access the emoji keyboard so when we're
typing something all we have to do is
hit the Windows key and period and boom
you've got access to all of the emojis
you could possibly want now you can also
do the same thing on a Mac and I've
talked about that in the past and for
the Mac all you have to do is hit
command ctrl + spacebar and boom emojis
for everybody now we've got another tip
for you iOS device users let's say you
have a ton of tabs open on Safari you're
able to actually close them all at once
so all you have to do is jump into
Safari and use the little tab button
down here hold it and you can close all
your tags all at once as you guys can
see I have like 474 I probably should
hit that button but I think I'd get
anxiety from closing all of that out I
don't know what I'd lose in there so
we're gonna keep it open but you have
the ability to do that
yeah that's a good idea
pause the video and write in the comment
section down below how many tabs you
currently have open in Safari what do
you have oh you're probably at like the
limit you but I have like 600 or
something and it can't even count
anymore
now we also got a tip for those chrome
users out there so if you got Android
and chrome is your main browser or iOS
you can always just jump into the chrome
app and then swipe between tabs by just
going on the address bar
that's why thing left and right now this
could be really useful in case you want
to compare products or something so
let's say I've got like two headphones
open over here I can just kind of swipe
between them so I can see different
things whatever it may be that's a cool
little feature that you can use to jump
back and forth between tabs
now the next hack is actually a website
recommendation called hotel Wi-Fi test
comm now this is great for those of you
who plan on traveling soon and Wi-Fi is
going to be very important to you so
check this out so if we pull open the
site and you type in where you plan to
be like I'm going to be in San Francisco
soon so San Francisco California I can
go ahead and see which hotels have the
best Wi-Fi so there's the speeds right
here and you can see how reliable it is
based on this confidence rating over
here so for me this is great because I
know exactly which hotels I should be
looking at when I'm in a San Francisco
area now I know I'm not the only one
who's close the tab while browsing by
accident and here's what you do to
recover it so when you lose a tab all
you have to do on a Mac is hit command
shift T and you get that exact page back
and what's also nice is that you can
even go back on this page and go back to
pages that you were on previously so you
get the entire thing back and for
windows all you have to do is hit
control shift T and you get the exact
same effects now another feature that is
surprisingly unknown to a lot of people
is the ability to move the cursor on iOS
when you're typing with the keyboard so
let's say you're at the end of a message
and you realize you've got an error or a
mistake all you have to do is force
touch the screen and you can move this
cursor around wherever you want so I can
go ahead and take away this three
pop just like that now you if you don't
have forced touch on your iPhone or
maybe iPad all you have to do is hit the
spacebar hold it and you still get
access to the same feature now next up
is a feature for u Android users out
there and this is something I wish was
on all devices and it's called screen
pinning so let's say you want to give
your phone to your mom or your sister or
something and you don't want them to go
into anything else all you have to do is
hit the recent tab button and then hold
on to the icon up top pin this app and
this way when you give it to them they
can't go into any other apps if they hit
back recent none of that it locks the
app in place and doesn't allow them to
jump into anything else that you don't
want them to see unless they're able to
get past your lock screen now real quick
jumping back to the iPhone if you have
an iPhone with forced touch and you hate
the little badges with numbers at the
top here's what you can do to make sure
you get rid of them all you have to do
is force touch the screen and you can
see exactly which app has badges that
need to be taken care of
and the last thing we've got is for our
desktop users let's say you've got a lot
of a particular file let's say photos
for instance I've got a bunch of photos
here of some plants now if I want to
organize this instead of having the
weird name that comes out of the camera
I can go ahead and rename all of these
by right-clicking after highlighting
them all go to rename and then let's say
I call it plant it'll automatically
named them all plant and they're all
beat in order 1 2 3 4 or 5 etc the Mac
is a little bit more complicated but
it's pretty much the same process you
can go over do the same thing highlight
all of them right click go to rename
let's say 20 items and I like to do
format so I'll call this plant as well
we'll start at the number 1 rename and
boom plant 1 2 3 4 5 etc but that about
wraps it up guys hopefully you enjoyed
all these quick little tips for a bunch
of different platforms if you did be the
cool guy or girl that'd give this video
a thumbs up and also if you've got any
special
tax yourself leave a comment down below
I'll also include the previous life hack
videos that we've done in the past if
you guys want even more tips check them
out in the description but so the next
video guys is your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
