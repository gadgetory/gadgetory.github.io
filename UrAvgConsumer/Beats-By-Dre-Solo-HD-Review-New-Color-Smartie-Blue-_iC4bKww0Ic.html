want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video it was going on if
you want to traverse consumer today I'm
going to be doing a review for you guys
on the new beat solo HDS the smarty blue
ones and hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the solo HDS in the new
smarty blue color but before we get into
this let's talk about the traveling case
there's a pretty nice traveling case um
it's soft but it does have a good amount
of padding on both sides to protect it
from inium damage and when you open it
up you have enough space for your
headphones as well as a little pouch
here to put your cable or any other
accessories that you wish to include in
there and on the side you also get this
little arm strap where you can put your
hand in and carry it like this
personally I like to clip it on I like
to unclip it and get it onto my bookbag
straps and then just kind of have a
hanging through on there and it makes
traveling with it a lot like really easy
not that these are our hearts have fun
to travel with due to how small they are
they're really small and it makes it
really easy to you know move around with
them they're really compact when you
fold them in it's easy I find it easy to
put in my pocket and I can just go like
that but I don't want it you know my
jeans rubbing on or anything like that
so it's just really easy to walk around
with and it's very you know travel
friendly and they're so small that I
feel that girls and guys can wear this
without any problems like they won't
look obnoxious waiting like it would
indeed lashes on a girl wearing these it
wouldn't look wear anything like that
because they're so small pretty cool and
because they're so small that makes
these um on ear headphones so these
don't cut around your ears they code
directly on it which I actually prefer
over over your headphones because I like
listen I like when songs have a lot of
bass and I can feel the bass by like the
headphone vibrating online
years I I feel like it's a better
experience like that and of course not
everyone agrees a lot of people I know
like over your headphones but if that's
one of the pluses I seated this being on
ear headphone like an on-ear pair of
headphones
um now since we're still talking about
like the looks and stuff the smarting
blue is really great I like the new
colors that beads have has placed on
young solo HDS I would have liked to had
the metallic blue I really like that or
the sour apple
I saw those but I when I first saw the
colored I really wanted to go for these
but on retrospect I really liked those
other ones too and one thing that you'll
notice when looking at these is that
since beats and monster parted ways you
can't find a logo of monster anywhere on
that phones usually they were placed
right up top here but now they're gone
and I'll show you with my beats Wireless
right here that all you can see the
monster logo here I'll show you guys a
close-up and here you can see the
monster logo right here is no longer on
the solo HD so this is just straight
beats for all those on monster haters
out there well there's no more monster
involved it's just beats and that's what
you get now you can't find any image of
monster on the box the headphone moves
anywhere so it's like they never existed
and since we still have the Beach
Wireless here I'll give you guys a
little idea of how much bigger the ear
cups are compared to the solo HDS as you
can see here it kind of divorced it a
bit you see about let me zoom in as you
can see guys the solo HDS are much
smaller than the beats Wireless and I
got this is really what made me what
caught me off-guard sometimes I forget
that the wireless are big are bigger and
you can see you can see that this
completely overlaps it so these are
really small and you know like I said
very compact
and that these now come with the new
control talk cable that has like a
little oval design it no longer has let
me pull out the old one here for you so
here you guys have a close-up of what
the old design from the control talk'
were used to look like and what it
currently looks like now so this is
pretty nice you get the volume controls
and the play and pause button in the
middle now for the iPhone all of these
buttons work volume and the play and
pause all that but for HT phone HTC
phones and blackberries and things like
that the only button that'll work is the
play and pause button so just be aware
of that when purchasing views all right
so now kind of want to talk about
durability of these headphones now on
their videos out there that you know
have stress tests where they come in
like then the headphones and you can see
how much the headphones can handle
before they snap well these do a pretty
good job not snapping I know that it has
a reputation of snapping I guess when
they were just solos now that they're
solely HD is I know they come with a
reinforced band where you know it
doesn't snap so easily and you know
really give them props for that I've
seen people do like a roll like a 180
and that means like a straight line and
it not in a snap at all I don't suggest
trying that yourself I really don't so
but you know if there are videos out
there so you can see that this isn't
going to just snap on you easily now you
know of course these won't snap but
there are other little things that no
come into play when it comes to
durability are the band up here for some
reason with a lot of use back now back
with my old pair and I can tell with
these as well
this isn't really like it's not like a
stitched in there or anything like that
so it doesn't completely come out it
uses an adhesive like a kind of glue and
after a while with a lot of use these
little on this band
can come out and you know the internals
can get exposed a bit which is really
not not a really good thing at all it
really disappointed me when I first you
know used solely these for a while I
thought something was wrong with my pair
and no it have I have the best buy
insurance so I was able to go in and you
know switch it out for a new pair and it
happened a couple of times after a while
you kind of just get used to it but you
shouldn't have to get used to that it
really sucks so that's just something to
keep in mind this little thing can come
apart but um outside of that everything
else is fine um see I don't think the
ear cup the ear cups never really gave
me any trouble at all
I know you can take these off I believe
but um I've never you know had issues
with that but um yeah that's as far as
durability goes it is really strong the
band's great a not only problem was this
little piece up here coming off
sometimes and showing the insides that's
the only little problem I have as far as
durability so now I know you guys are
wondering about the sound quality and I
also know that these have been getting a
lot of slack as far as on people saying
that these don't have produced the
greatest sound or that you know
sometimes it's muddy but I all I think
that it all depends on your level of
experience with sound if you're a
professional or you know someone who
knows about you know sounds and
headphones and things like that then
yeah you'll probably feel that way but
like I said for your average person your
average consumer who goes out there and
purchases their first pair of high-end
headphones you're going to like these I
know my experience was that when I first
got these I love the sound quality I
really like the bass and how strong it
was and nobody could tell me that the
sound quality wasn't great
I really liked it and my friend like I
have friends who I recommended these two
as their first pair of on ear headphones
I mean high-end headphones and they
really like to sound quality as well so
I really think that it all depends on
your
level of experience with sound and
anyone cool going for their first pair
definitely go for it if you're
interested in the solo HDS I'm not going
to stop you and tell you there aren't
like you know it's not good are there
better options yeah sure are you going
to start like as your first pair of
headphones are you going to be blown
away by these probably so if you're
interested in them go for it of course
there's always going to be better
options I think that's pretty much it
guys I think that these have good enough
sound quality for our first pair of um
high-end headphones for anyone and I
really feel that you know the build is
good it looks great you know beats
always looks great
um I like these headphones I really do
they were my first pair of um high-end
headphones I really enjoyed my
experience with them which you know got
me into the whole Bede's thing I
definitely would recommend you to anyone
who was looking for their first pair of
high-end headphones like I said before
you know it looks great the only thing I
really have a concern about is the
padding at the top as it does sometimes
come off it's easy to put back on but
it's annoying
it really gets frustrating that you have
to really keep pushing it back on and it
seems like they're not they don't use a
strong enough glue but overall I do like
these and I wouldn't change my
experience with them at all and pretty
much that's it guys if you have any more
questions about them please feel free to
leave a comment below and I'll
definitely get back to you so if you
guys like this video please feel free to
rate comment subscribe favorite share
put it on Twitter to everything I don't
know but if you liked it please you know
just show you support somehow and pretty
much that's all there is to it guys
on this is your average consumer and
these are the solo HD is in the new
smarty blue also I'll be giving these
headphones away actually so stay tuned
