and we have a lot of stuff here guys
more than it's ever been on any table of
mine and this is the ultimate the
average consumer tech kit let's go with
that but first off I got to give a huge
shout out to Microsoft for hooking this
whole thing up they told me to spend
$6,000 on the Microsoft Store website
not only for myself in this kit before
one of you guys we're gonna talk about
that in a bit let's talk about the six
thousand dollars worth of tech gear that
we've got here and you can use
everything you see here as a gift guide
for a graduation or even Father's Day
and this is all part of Microsoft's
adventure awaits campaign and I pretty
much made this the ultimate tech lovers
kit so with everything on this list
you'll be covered for days so first
things first since we're working with
Microsoft we got to have the most
powerful console out right now be Xbox
1x and right here we've got the Beast
itself this is the Xbox 1x you guys know
the Xbox one axis things capable of 4k
gaming watching 4k content it is the
most powerful console out right now the
specs on this guy are absolutely insane
if you haven't seen my videos on the
Xbox one X and everything it can do
you'll definitely want to check the
links out down below now I've been
loving this thing since it dropped in
November and I'm excited to get another
one in hand because now I get to have
this in the new crib in the man cave
you guys gotta watch out for that video
but had to have this here powerful
system why not
we can't have an Xbox with no games so
here we've got two of them far cry 5 and
Marvel vs. Capcom infinite now far cry 5
is a dope game and you've probably heard
of it but what's great is that it now
comes in 4k and HD ours so the Xbox one
X is really gonna be able to go to work
and you'll be able to see all that is
capable of with this game and then we've
got Marvel vs. Capcom infinite now I've
been playing Marvel vs. Capcom for years
so this was a must for me if you love
people from the Marvel Universe as well
as the Capcom characters from Street
Fighter and whatnot you're going to
really enjoy this and with an Xbox one X
you're gonna get an Xbox one controller
with some double-a batteries but you got
to go a step beyond that and get the
play in charge kit with this you don't
have to worry about replacing those
batteries just charge this guy up with a
micro USB key
and your xbox 1x controller is always
going to be good to go now we've got the
plan charged kid but another accessory
you need for your controller is the chat
pad with this you'll be able to send
messages to your friends with no
problems
typing it I was gonna be much quicker
but what's also really nice about this
is that if you're signing into certain
apps you'll be able to do that so much
better than having to hunt down each and
every letter when you're trying to type
in your email address and since the Xbox
has a web browser built into it
you can also use this to navigate it and
find whatever you're looking for so this
is an underrated thing that you
definitely want to have not to mention
the chat pad also comes with a little
headset so if you don't have one or
yours isn't that great
you got this option but we got a better
when we're gonna talk about later and we
all know you can play some Xbox games
right on your PC and use that Xbox one
controller with it so because of that
we've got a wireless adapter here for
Windows 10 and with this you can just
plug it into your computer start playing
with your Xbox one controller and forget
about it so here we've got the samsung
galaxy s 9
one of the biggest flagship of the year
so if you saw my real day into life with
this phone you know that I really
enjoyed it
honestly Samsung packs all the features
that you could possibly want in your
smartphone into their smartphones which
I can really appreciate I'm talking
about a beautiful display fast charging
wireless charging waterproof you name it
it's got it and picking this to be a
part of the kit was a really really easy
choice because of how good it is
and while the s9 is dope and it still
has the headphone jack we still got some
wireless earbuds these are the Samsung
gear icon X now everybody's making truly
wireless earbuds these days but I think
Samsung really nailed it with these they
sound great
they fit in the ear very comfortably and
they offer some really great features if
you're using something like the Galaxy S
9 and in terms of truly wireless earbuds
these are currently my go twos even
though I have some very oddly shaped
ears they fit just fine with me so I
love that so these had to make it to the
list to be a companion for s9 so you've
got your smartphone and your earbuds to
jam out to some tunes but we've got one
more piece for audio so next up was that
the JBL pulse 3 now I love this speaker
I actually have two of them here in the
gamers paradise but check this out right
here you've got your typical Bluetooth
speaker it actually sounds really nice
but when you turn it on this whole thing
is a giant
so you got RGB lights inside of here so
if you want to have a cool funky design
in your room or your set up this thing
can absolutely help with that and with
the app you can change up the look as
well so I love this thing it just it
looks great sounds great this is awesome
and I think everybody could appreciate a
really good Bluetooth speaker it's about
to be summertime we're about to be
outside we're gonna be chilling outside
picnics and all that so this is gonna be
great if you want to bring the music so
we got a dope console with accessories
even a smartphone with some dope
accessories but now let's throw a laptop
in this thing and the Microsoft Store
had a ton of different laptops to choose
from but I went with the Dell XPS 15 and
this right here guys is an awesome
laptop you might have heard of it it's
got a 15.6 inch display for Kate
touchscreen display at that and this
thing is also Specht out it's got an
Intel Core i7 7700 HQ processor 32 gigs
of ram in a laptop and not only that but
it also has one terabyte of storage and
an innovative gtx 1050 graphics card so
if you want to do some gaming you're
definitely gonna be able to with this so
this is easily one of the heavy hitters
in this kit and we've got a ton of
awesome stuff to go with it so if one
terabyte of storage wasn't enough for
you on the XPS 15 over here we've got
two more terabytes on this Western
Digital My Passport ultra so in this
little body you get two terabytes of
storage it also comes with USB 3.0 so
you'll get fast data transfer speeds I
don't need to tell you guys what to do
at your storage if you need more you got
more that was great about having
something like this in the kit as if
you're good with the one terabyte of
storage on the XPS 15 you can also use
this with the Xbox one X that way you
can have more games stored right onto
the hard drive now something I think
will go really well with the XPS 15 is a
brand new monitor and right here we have
the Republic of gamers Swift gaming
monitor this is the PG 258 so this right
here is a really dope monitor by asus
not only is a good-looking has really
nice cool lighting effects at the bottom
and it also has a really fast response
time and refresh rate so if you're into
gaming you're going to be
take advantage of this and we did
graphics card that you get inside of
this laptop these two should get along
pretty nicely now I actually did a video
a minimalist setup video where I had an
XPS 15 doctoral monitor and that created
a really awesome experience because you
can have a lot more connected to this
laptop just by having one of these
monitors here and with that in mind this
is one of the first things I decided to
pick up this is the logitech g930 now
this is targeted at gamers but it's just
the awesome mouse over all have some
really cool RGB lights it ambidextrous
so you can use it with either hand this
is an awesome addition if you decide to
use a laptop connected to a monitor or
maybe you're just more comfortable with
a mouse and since we're doing the whole
monitor thing I decided to go ahead and
add a mechanical keyboard and this right
here is the HyperX alloy elite RGB
mechanical keyboard this has the Cherry
MX brown switches so this is great if
you want to go full docking mode close
your laptop and focus simply on the
monitor this pair with the G 9:03 can
make for an awesome gaming experience so
that right there could be a really quick
and awesome setup but one thing that we
didn't talk about was some audio for all
that gaming you're gonna be doing so
right here we've got the hyper x cloud
flight wireless gaming headset now if
you've never heard of hyper X's gaming
headsets they sound great have really
good mic quality and be coming at a
really nice price now this is their
first wireless set and these look
awesome they even have a glowing red
light on the side so you can just throw
these on and you're good to go
this is super comfortable you can expect
some great quality so if you want to use
this with your Xbox one X or the Dell
XPS you're gonna be fine either way
and what we've got right here is a
wireless display adapter now you don't
actually hear a ton about this but this
is actually really cool if you want to
send content that you're watching from
your smartphone tablet or even your
laptop or surface device you can
actually do that right to your
television by plugging in the HDMI and
USB cable this is really cool if you
just want to share something on your
smaller screen over to a bigger screen
like your television now we've got that
cool Dell XPS 15 that's VR capable so I
figured why not throw in some VR and so
right here we've got the HTC vive Pro
when it comes to VR the HTC vive is top
of the line and when it comes to the HTC
vive pro
you get even more now I will say I did
pick up the headset only so if you don't
have any of the vive controllers or base
station so you'll have to get that from
the Microsoft Store but I believe it's
sold in a bundle so you can get that but
for those who are ready have the vibe
this will be a really nice upgrade but I
mean come on you've got a VR capable
laptop so why not take it to the limits
with something like this if you haven't
tried VR trust me should and last but
not least you know we had to have a
backpack so here I actually have a Dell
backpack but we had to have a backpack
this is one of the best ones that they
offered on the Microsoft Store and it's
got a nice black and red color scheme
now what I love about this thing is that
it offers a ton of space with quite a
few compartments so if we want to add
all the cool gadgets in tech that you
get from this list you guys just throw
it inside of here and take it on the go
and this is pretty much everything in
the ultimate tech lovers kit guys now
