we've got some serious business here
folks it's time to crown the king of
bass headphones and in today's showdown
we have the sony xba-40 bt and it's
going up against the skull candy crush
or wireless a pair of headphones that
you guys always mentioned every time I
talk about these so but see which one's
better
first up design now let's talk about
straight-up looking folks with the
Shoney's you're getting a nice premium
looking pair of headphones they've got a
nice black and red theme going for it as
well as these metal accents can help
with that whole premium look while the
Skullcandy crushers they look a bit more
basic normal pair of headphones are made
out of plastic they're all black so
while not looking as premium as the
phonies they do look a bit more normal
I'd say one thing that I do have to get
to the skull can crushers is that when
you're going out with these you can put
them on and you feel like you're wearing
a normal pair of headphones while when
you Sony since they've got these pretty
big ear cups you might feel a little bit
more silly walking out the house being
billed a little bit on the bigger side
something else to note is that the
crushers can fold while these sony's
have a swiveling ear cuff design so you
can lay these flat while you can fold
these up a basically a personal
preference what works for you I kind of
like being able to just put this in my
backpack laid down flat without it
taking up too much space kind of like a
book but it's up to you in terms of
what's more comfortable for you to
travel with now you all know how much I
love the Sony's but I got to give it to
the Skullcandy crushers just because
they're dimmable wearable now in terms
of comfort k9b in these these are like
super super comfortable these ear
cushions because they're so big they're
like giant marshmallows you can throw
these on your head and wear them for
hours while the skull can crushers will
crush your skull these are a bit tight
and I honestly feel like wearing these
for a long period of time you're going
to want to take these off so Comfort
does not match up with 950 BTS
whatsoever now in terms of features
these are both bluetooth headphones so
you can use them wirelessly with
phone tablet whatever you want but they
do have some different qualities between
them the Sony's have NFC so you can pair
these easily with your device's it pay
support NFC while the skulkin crushers
do not also one thing about the sony
that they have a ton of buttons all over
the air cups so you have access to a ton
of different controls at your fingertips
while the Skullcandy carter's have a
very very basic layout this radically
just three button pretty much like any
inline remote on a pair of headphones so
there's that trade-off if you call it
one you might like a simpler layout or
you might like having access to all of
the controls now this both also have
some crazy base features and I'll
describe the base in a second but with
the Sony's you have the face boost
button which turns the base top by a
jillion while the Skullcandy has this
slider where you can control just how
much base is getting put into your
headphones which is a really nice touch
something that the skull can crushers
have over the 950 DPS is that the slider
and the base control can be used even
without using any Bluetooth you can use
it with an inline remote while when you
have the inline remote plug into the 950
bps you won't have that feature you
won't have access to the base boots
because you can't turn on the headphones
the 950 N one you're going to be able to
turn on the headphones and get access to
the base controls but you can use this
without having any battery at all so
this is kind of a bonus bear and lastly
I don't know if you want to call it a
spec or feature but in terms of battery
life the phones have around 20 to 22
hours of battery while the cell can
crusher has a very impressive 40 hours
that's a lot of time so you can go a
long time without charging these that's
a very very nice touch with the skull
candies and in terms of the features
between the two of these guys I also got
to say I do like that I have more at my
fingertips with these skull candy
crushers the Sony's NFC is cool bass
looses on or off depending on how you're
listening to the headphones but with
skull candy crusher she's always got
access to the bass controls and you got
that's 40 hours of battery life so
features Skullcandy gets it now let's
talk about that sound
and when I even touch on baby yet we'll
talk about that after but when it comes
to straight-up sound no based feature is
just straight-up listening I gotta say I
do think the sony sound better and
that's because these have some better
overall clarity it is easier to hear
everything with these it's not as
muffled as with these cocaine crushers I
found that to match the kind of clarity
that I got on the Sony's where the
crushers I had to pump up the volume
quite a bit and that's never a good sign
and to be honest if you want to listen
to some music that doesn't have a ton of
bass maybe you want to listen to
classical that day maybe you fill in
fancy you're going to want something
that can handle more genres of music
that isn't so heavy on bass offers a bit
more clarity you can hear the vocals a
bit better so overall sound I got to
give it to the sewing but now to talk
about that bass you guys know that I
talk about the bass boost button here
like it's an earthquake blown on your
head but the Skullcandy crushers has
something crazy going on with this
slider and when you max it out your ears
will seriously vibrate to the point
where it almost feels like it's tickling
to be honest it's kind of strange it's a
weird sensation but there's something
about the Crushers that I'm not so crazy
about it almost feels like that bass is
like artificial Disney springs on the
inside of the ear cups and that's the
matting like with the first version of
the Crushers that spring sound is just
annoying actually ticklin is it I don't
know if you guys can actually hear that
but you hear it all the time when you've
got these on so when you have it just
like this they move it around you can
hear like some Springs moving it's just
it's weird
it doesn't sound normal and that's why
I'm not too crazy about it but if you're
looking for something that just straight
up shakes up your head these are the
better option but I don't like the way
this sounds to be honest I don't like it
it kind of sounds you know what it
sounds like it sounds like when
someone's driving in a car and playing
loud music outside and you can hear the
music and if you can hear
your windows in the windows are kind of
rattling a bit but you still hear the
music that's kind of how it sounds
it is weird another thing to mention
here is the price these are both
supposed to retail for 200 bucks but you
can find the songs for way cheaper than
that they're always on sale you can find
them on Amazon for about like 150 right
now they go down to that's blowing 88
bucks when there's like a big sale like
Black Friday I think our thing is for as
low as $1.99 price gap - so overall to
me while I think it's awesome that you
can control the bass with the bass
slider here and get some extreme extreme
level based on the skull candies I still
got to go with the regular Sony's it
sounds a bit more natural to me works
with more music than the skull candies
do I personally I'm still rocking the
950 BTS over the Crushers I know a lot
of people like these but I'm gonna stick
with these guys for now I think there's
a better base option but that's about it
guys hopefully enjoyed it and if you did
be the cool guy or girl give it a thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
