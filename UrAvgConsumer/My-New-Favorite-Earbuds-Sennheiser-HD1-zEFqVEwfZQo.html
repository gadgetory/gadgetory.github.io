and today we're going to be taking a
look at the latest creation from the
folks over at Sennheiser the Sennheiser
HD one now I've been telling you guys
how obsessed I've been with these
earbuds with the neck end design so I
was excited when Sennheiser reached out
to sponsors today's video the HD ones
are a really good looking pair of
earbuds and surprisingly one of my
favorite things about it it is the neck
band now I said it before and I'll say
it again I've never really been a fan of
these earbuds with a neck band but I
feel like Sennheiser actually made this
look good
with the genuine leather wrapped around
the band and the red stitching the HD
ones somehow managed to deliver Sylas
and professionally this is definitely
not a look that i've seen on other
earbuds like this so this was a nice
surprise on the inside of the neck band
you've got your power as well as your
volume up in down buttons which also
double as your track controls when you
hold them down and lastly we have our
play and pause buttons and on the front
of the left side you've got a flap that
leads to your micro USB port and this is
how you charge them up and in just about
an hour and a half you get a full charge
which leads to about 10 hours of
playback which is actually the longest
battery life out of all of the earbuds
that i have in this style and looking at
the earbuds you can see that they have a
mirror chrome finish with a flat black
and red cable all of this works well
together to create a sleek and honestly
very good looking pair of earbud one
thing I would have liked would be some
form of cable management whether its
retractable cables or maybe magnetic
earbuds it'd be really nice to be able
to just do a quick tug on these and have
them attract while pop them together
when you're not using them it's not a
deal breaker by any means but it's
something I'd like to see maybe in
future iterations so now let's move on
to comfort the leather is great for both
style and function since the softness
really makes me feel comfortable around
the neck and here's what I love about
neck band design you don't have to worry
about the earbuds just being left or
right or maybe being victims of gravity
and falling out of your ears with
something like this they stay in place
and you don't have to worry about them
going anywhere so whether you like to
make them design or not you can't deny
its functionality
now the earbuds themselves are very
comfortable they've got silicone tips
and they're angled which makes them have
a more secure
fit and it gets the music right into
where needs to be so if you happen to
have very weirdly shaped ears like I do
and you can't wear things like ear pods
these are going to be perfect but in
case they don't fit your ears right
out-of-the-box sennheiser offers
different size tips so that you can find
the right fit for you now as for
features these are of course Bluetooth
earbuds so they have all the controls we
mentioned earlier on the left side of
the earbuds so you can control all of
your music right from there and you also
got NFC so if you have an NFC compatible
device like a phone or tablet parents
should be pretty quick and easy and it
also features that Qualcomm aptX codec
so you're going to get that high
resolution audio not to mention it also
includes multi connection which allows
you to pair these with two devices so we
can switch between them simultaneously
so I compared you to my laptop in my
phone and not have to worry about
disconnecting two pair to the of it
which may seem like a small thing but
it's actually really useful and the neck
band even vibrates when you're getting a
call so these are just resting on your
neck you don't have to worry about
missing in calls and bonus this even
comes with a hard shell carrying case
which is perfect for those on the go and
I got to say I've been pretty
disappointed by the carrying cases of
other earbuds that I have in this style
so shout out to Sennheiser for making
one that's actually legit and now of
course let's talk about that sound now
I'm going to be straight up with you
guys these sounds great they definitely
live up to Sennheiser's reputation
they've got great clarity vocals come in
super clear really crisp a bass this is
are not bass heavy head phones let's get
that out of the way
these aren't bass heavy but the bass is
definitely still present and of course I
have to compare these to all the other
earbuds that I have like this and you
guys know how I raved about some of
those and I feel like these are actually
a lot better there's more dynamic range
in comparison the music just sounded
like they had a lot more presence in
comparison to all the other ones and
honestly guys back to thinning a lot
because you know I love those Sony's I
absolutely think the sound quality is
the best part of the HD one and trust me
I'm not just saying that
Apple money on it overall these are a
solid pair of earbuds and if I had to
nitpick
I bought some kind of quick charge
feature something where I can get maybe
an hour to of playback after
after ten minutes of charging maybe
overall guys I really like the HD ones
these are probably going to be my on to
go earbuds Sennheiser if you're
listening how about we get some teal
stitching in there I know a lot of
people like black and red but look into
teal so that about wraps up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up I'll catch
you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
