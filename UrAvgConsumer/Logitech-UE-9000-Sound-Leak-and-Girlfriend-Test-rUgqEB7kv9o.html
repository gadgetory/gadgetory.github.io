consumer and this is my girlfriend Hey
and today we have another sound leak and
sound isolation test okay in the
girlfriend test and today we're gonna be
doing this with the Logitech UE 9000 so
these are bluetooth headphones so we're
doing it via bluetooth no wire there we
go magic so if not wasting you time
let's get right into it
so first we're gonna start with the
sound leak test and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna play music from volumes
at 50% 75% and then 100% and we're gonna
see how much the music leaks at those
different volumes from the headphones
alright so now we're gonna play music at
50% ready yep I hear very slightly not
too bad but do hear very slightly so it
doesn't leak a little bit alright so now
we're in through it at 75% already yeah
all right here 75% so this isn't leaking
a bit more than it was before
at 75% some 1x you would hear this
probably not in a large room or
something but this is that's not really
leaking so now let's hear that 100%
right yeah and of course guys we don't
advise anyone with some Sarah music a
hundred percent cuz it could damage your
hearing and we don't want that so here
it is that 1% Wow
this is leaking quite a bit guys so
we're going to turn this down this is
definitely a lot of leakage right there
I don't think that song was even that
loud and I heard it very clearly and so
now we're gonna move on to the
girlfriend test right yeah okay so the
girlfriend test is basically a test to
see if my annoying girlfriend left
things um can't be blocked out by this
headphones
okay so I'm gonna do some noise and
stuff and I'll see if you can walk me
out all right so now what we're gonna do
is play the same music at 50% 75% and
then 100% so let's start off by 50% and
wish me luck okay so here it is at 50%
okay so I was thinking the other day
like you should really be happy that I'm
with you because this is a catch right
here I mean I don't really complain
about much I don't really nag um alright
guys so after super sad I definitely did
hear her quite a bit um this these are
noise canceling too so say month then so
we're gonna try to 35% see this a little
better there okay
just joking by the way huh I'm just
joking with what I'm saying yeah all
right so hearing is at 75%
I'm like I have a college degree
I just I'm just really amazing you know
I don't really I'm not probably the best
girlfriend you could find considering
the fact that I'm not I think that these
someone who complain so much
all right 35% was actually a big
improvement 50% we could hear I could
hear her a good bit 95% not so much so
definitely a good step up there so now
I'm gonna try to launch percent and I'm
expecting not to hear a peep so let's
see how that goes
ready yes
all right and here it is at 100 I'm like
your mother loves me I mean but how
could she not love me I'm just pretty
cool and I treat you well and I have
some great about me there's so many
things that like I just can't be here
right now um I clean I cook I do laundry
you go make sandwiches okay so but I
didn't hear it I stopped it and I caught
the last wind up that line so one
percentage of a good job um 50 percent
wasn't so great 35 percent was good one
percent was definitely just perfect so
that's about it guys
this has been the sound week and sound
isolation test aka the girlfriend test
