consumer and as you can see we've got
another massive tech unboxing number is
this one area ding this is actually the
17th one well we've been doing this for
a while guys and we're gonna keep this
train going so you know the deal
grab your snacks grab your drinks I'll
wait because we got a lot of tech to
open up and we've got a special box over
here let's see let me make sure this is
the right one yes it is and we got quite
a few goodies inside of here so it's
from the good folks over at mass drop
who sponsored today's video let's see
what they sent us guys ah and I'm using
the old box cutter guys yes I know I
already misplaced the other one that I
bought last time so deal with it so this
is the main guy right here this is the
sennheiser HD 58 X so what we've got
right here guys is a pair of 150 dollar
headphones they're supposed to be good
enough to rival $500 headphones without
a much better price so this has that
classic Sennheiser design that long oval
Dex supposed to cover your ears also
nicely open-back headphones - yeah I
could hear all of that so open-back
headphones give you a wider soundstage
so you're supposed to be able to hear
things like instruments in different
parts of the room that's the kind of
feel you're supposed to get when you're
listening to open-back headphones so
Sennheiser does this all the time always
makes great open-back headphones so
these I actually got to try them out you
can hear that can't you Jay
okay these are actually legit so I know
you guys could hear me listening to the
music that's because they're open-back
headphones sound leaks out of them quite
a bit but that's what helps you get that
real nice soundstage so you're getting
high quality stuff here this is actually
this actually feels really good in the
hand is right here this metal this
actually feels pretty solid this is
definitely something you're gonna want
to use at home unless you just you just
wow then you want to go outside with
these you could do that and like I said
these are supposed to be 150 dollar
headphones
that rival $500 headphones in terms of
quality sound and all that good stuff
can I just legit when it comes to audio
so of course I'm expecting nothing but
greatness from this but if you guys have
never heard of mass drop I'll have them
link down below in the description where
you guys can check out these as well as
a ton of other cool products that they
sell check it out I have it linked down
below in the description so that's the
Sennheiser Jubilee HD 58 X kind of a
cool name but they also have some other
stuff inside of here as well so let's
see this is the PC 37 X limited edition
so like I said collaboration with mass
drop and Sennheiser let's take a quick
peek all is a gaming headset alright I'm
gonna give these a shot later on and
we'll probably talk about this in
another video and last but not least
we've got some in-ear monitors so this
is from NuForce this is their everyday
carry
dynamic in-ear monitors you guys know me
I love me some audio so we're gonna have
to give these all a shot and we'll let
you know how it goes alright we dropped
the box but I'm not dropping any
products today all right so now on to
the next guy area actually just stepped
out so she is forfeiting her chance to
choose so Jay my man go ahead and pick
one this guy what is this anyway this is
from the peel box bellroy so let's see
what this is guys awesome nice packaging
these are some pretty cool cases though
this packaging is insane
oh this even comes with a sim ejector
holder that's kind of cool so you got
something right here this is to hold
like cards and stuff you can hold a sim
ejector tool even a sim card that's
interesting and this one right here is
the phone wallet this is for the pixel
too so cool
solid cases for all kinds of phones
so let's actually open up some of these
smaller envelopes that we've got here
this is a lens cap that can just be
flipped open when it's on your camera so
that way there's no losing it you don't
have to worry about where to put the
lens cap you just flip it open and
you're able to do whatever you need to
do and get your shine when you're done
you just kind of close the door
oh this is from one plus this is their
cracka Bulls game yeah so here we have
it got little buttons over here little
switches too and I'm not even going to
lie to you guys and try to act like I
know exactly what this thing is for so I
will have the crackles website link down
below in the description so you can
learn more but this looks interesting I
guess you plug the USB cable down right
here - cool thanks at 1 + oh I forgot I
ordered this Shenmue 1 &amp;amp; 2 guys let me
tell you back in the Dreamcast days
Shenmue was like the future of gaming
you could do so much in this game I had
to pick it up for the ps4 because I
wanna you know who doesn't want to
relive their childhood deal some
nostalgia Shenmue 3 is coming out you
know I got that pre-ordered I cannot
wait to see what they do with that one
alright so next up we've got this from
Amazon oh yes this is a bluetooth
adapter for the Nintendo switch so that
is one of the biggest problems with the
switch it doesn't have Bluetooth built
into it and check this out guys not only
can you plug this into the bottom of the
switch with the USBC connector but it
also has another USBC connector at the
bottom so it doesn't cut off your USB C
port so now you can still charge your
device do whatever you need to do with
that USB C port while still having this
on I really like that that's that's a
good thinking ah this is gonna go in my
Nintendo switch little travel case
alright now we got this guy from Rokan
true wireless headphones Qi wireless
charging included this almost looks like
a chromecast this logo right here so
this is these are the this is the
charging case for it anyway oh that's
nice these wireless Willie wireless
earbuds always have these unique
charging cases I like that
just like that these are actually pretty
small - all right so these are it they
seem to fit just fine so this is a dang
it I dropped something
ah I said I wasn't going to all right so
this is the wireless charger you can
just plug this in here and I guess you
can just kind of throw this on I've
never seen a truly wireless pair of
earbuds do that so that's actually a
unique feature now we just got to see if
it actually sounds good
all right now we do have something
really cool over here guys this is from
Nvidia mm-hmm I know what this is yeah
buddy
and we have it guys let's get it out the
plastic this is it y'all
nvidia geforce r-tx 2080 Ti so for those
of you who don't know this is a graphics
card for pcs and with this guy you'll
get really really good graphics on your
computer today you can do all kinds of
things from gaming to gaming maybe some
more gaming but this is the bad boy out
right now so this is going to be perfect
for I guess leaked we've got to turn him
into tsunami so this is one of those
pieces I was gonna help him get there
and Joe this this is a clean car guys
this is a very very clean card I don't
even want to take it out the plastic
until I'm ready to install it so of
course you guys have to keep an eye out
for that video I'm going to be upgrading
the PC that I built not too long ago if
you guys didn't see that video I'll have
a link down below in the description to
so you guys can see all the trouble I
went to building my own PC for the first
time but this is going to be its first
serious upgrade so we'll have more
details on what this thing can do in
that video but just to give you guys an
idea of what it looks like if you
haven't seen videos already this is the
RT X 28 ATI so we got this giant box
over here
from my buddies at Microsoft for Forza 4
so let's take a look I don't know if you
guys have been following me on social
media but we recently went out all the
way to London to see some awesome
awesome cars as a good time right
yes so good so many great cars but let's
see what they actually sent here Aikido
and McLaren I would take it video would
be done we will be wrapping it up nice
walks always has like the best product
boxes for like video game launches so
let's see one right here don't make a
mess don't make a mess I'm gonna make a
mess
spring changes everything so seasons are
a big deal in Forza 4 and as you can see
spring it's kind of amongst us it's got
the English flag on it okay I guess it's
just a regular blue umbrella underneath
but this is cool
check this out guys let's see oh oh this
is a some metal case right there English
country garden check that out guys see
this box that's detailed baby what else
do we have in here yo these guys kill me
of course since it's spring
we got a water you know you got a water
two flowers guys these guys so let's see
what we've got here
oh is this T these are seeds that you
actually have to water in this metal
okay wasn't is this soil guys it's
actually soil legitimately soil I will
start a garden at the new crib just for
you I am inspired well this was the most
fun unboxing of the video so far so
thank you xbox if you guys haven't tried
out for the horizon for yet you got a do
so they got some awesome cars in there
now I gotta clean all this up alright so
now let's check out this box is another
big box that I have no idea what's
inside of so let's see holy yes this is
a portable charger I love me some
portable chargers so this is the nimble
portable charger and what's this thing
right here Wireless pad with dual USB
wall charger so this thing is a wall
outlet with two USB ports on the side
this is not your typical design though
so I I have to sit down and take a look
at what all of this actually does and
how it all works together
nimble will recycle one pound of e-waste
for every one product sold oh snap
there's a lot more inside of this box
and this is also a portable charger I
like this this is a nice quality it's
it's blue it's almost teal the color
scheme has got me that's for sure the
color scheme is definitely got me so
that one is 10,000 milliamp hours what
is this a wireless stand oh okay so you
can just pull this little guy out at the
bottom so you pull out this little tab
here you got the kickstand in the back
and you can charge your phone just like
that this is the wireless dual pad so
with this you can charge more than one
device Apple so many companies now let's
see what else they've got so this one is
a little bit bigger than the 10,000
milliamp hour one and we have a 20,000
portable charger as well so let's take a
look here so this one's nice and slim so
we got a bunch of wireless charging pads
and a bunch of portable chargers that is
a lot of juice all right so we've got a
couple more things let's try and get
through this pretty quickly okay so what
have we got here
oh so it's like a drone so this is a
hovering drone with this barrier around
it so that kids can play with it and
whatnot and you can kind of keep it even
between your palms alright so let's see
what we had satisfied the ultimate
gaming grip elite bundle this is for the
Nintendo switch so here we have it this
is the case this is a solid case my
goodness this is like something a
briefcase that you walk around with
that's when you're a hardcore heavy-duty
proce which player this is supposed to
be like a grip for the Nintendo switch
okay now this which is a pretty big
handheld and this thing kind of adds to
it but this is legitimately comfortable
oh snap erage check this out right isn't
it feel like you're holding a console
controller don't know video game your
skin is back
ah listen don't listen to her satisfy
this is awesome I actually really really
like this this is definitely something
you keep at home though right I mean you
could walk out with it if you want
because you got this travel case but man
it adds a lot of a lot of size to your
switch over here you have a USB cable
this is actually pretty legit cable
right here and you also get thumb grips
oh I love playing with thumb grips on my
switch so the fact that they've included
some here is very nice as well and you
have also have these slots here for your
games you can put some cables and stuff
in here you put whatever else you want
inside of here so this is this is a
legitimate case here now I like this a
lot so I'm going to be trying this out
and I'll let you guys know if this is
actually worth while but I am really
liking it so far it is very comfortable
alright and last but not least we have
this black box incipio I know what this
is this is a lot of phone cases for the
iPhone tennis and tennis max what is it
guys let me know was that right it's you
know just it threw me off because it
says new iPhone 6.1 inch the 6.1 inch is
the 10s but I thought I said iPhone new
iPhone 6 I was like wait a minute what's
going on here they have a ton of
different options I'll even have a
little star glittery one for people who
are into that alright
but that about wraps it up we have a lot
of cool stuff here I'm actually really
excited for the switch controller case
as well as the nimble portable chargers
and of course those new games the new
gaming heads a lot here guys but that
about wraps it up hopefully you guys
enjoyed it let me know what your
favorite product was down below in the
description I'll have links to
