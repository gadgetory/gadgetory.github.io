want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at your average consumer this
is my girlfriend hi and today we have
another sound leak and sound isolation
test for you guys aka the girlfriend
test and today we're going to be doing
these with the ATH M 50s so that's not
wasting time let's get right into it so
we're going to start off with the sound
loop test and we're going to listen to
music from 50% of volume
75% of volume and then 100% of volume
and we're going to see how much the
sound leaks from the headphones at those
different volume points so let's start
off at 50%
make your hair for you well not much
help there but let's see that 50% right
yep okay
a slightly here like very tiny tiny
that's a complete pass for me I barely
hear anything good job so let's bring it
up 75 percent right yeah I mean I hear
it a bit more clearly now you guys might
hear it definitely not a point where
it's bothersome to someone next to you
though so not bad so cool you ready for
say yeah so now we're going to hundred
percent and guys like I said don't
recommend this and hey listening to
music on a hundred percent body might
hurt your earring depending on your
headphones but don't recommend it right
I mean this is you can clearly hear this
this is a larger percent but it's
actually not too too bad we've heard
some pretty bad hundred percent okay not
that like I said it leaks a lot a
hundred percent but we've we've seen
worse this isn't the worst and the other
two volumes were pretty good so I'll
pass on the sound leak test all right so
now we're going to jump into the
girlfriend test okay so your context is
basically a time where I do something
that will annoy him and then he sees if
his headphones can block out the
annoying sounds I'm making and today I'm
going to be doing something I do I think
a lot annoys him so stay tuned and watch
all right so we're going to start this
off of course at 50% then we're going to
jump to 75% and then of course 100% so
let's start off at 50%
okay ready yep he's on I wish me luck
guys
so I'm going to brag about myself um so
yeah I've just always been really good
at math you know just like that's just
one of the things I've always been
really good at and I really think those
who are really good at math and science
and those types of things are just
naturally smarter than a lot of other
people because we can think in a way
that's very analytical oh okay
so alright I slightly heard her I think
she was bragging yeah I don't know here
we go
so I did hear her a good that um I heard
math and I know how she is about that so
I did hear that so the sound did um
didn't isolate sounds completely but
like I said it's quiet it's a quiet room
and um she's right next to me I think
she would look for they'd probably be
alright but I did hid I was able to pick
up some words so that says something
alright so now we're going to start it
out I mean now we're going to go to 75%
ready yeah
all right guys like she's bragging to
you but it's what she does yeah
so started off that you know I really
like how I decorated this room I just
had the vision and I just went with it
but you messed up with your stupid text
stuff but you know I just had this
vision and I just you hear me all right
so I still hurt her a baby did he
represent I say first I did a bit I
didn't really make any make out any
words she said but I did hear that she
was talking so that's something I love I
was talking about my created by
creativity and a vision I had for this
room so let's get sometimes a percent
guys alright so now I hundred percent
we'll see if we can completely block out
what she has to say
ready yeah all right
I'm so happy I told you to get that
shirt it just looks really good on you I
just have impeccable taste for a girdle
clothing and for guy clothing I just I
just know how to do it all and you just
so lucky that you have me to dress you
what you do okay I do so at a hundred
percent I was able to block her out nice
job there I wish it did a little bit
more at the lower percentages but oh so
I was just talking and that I was
wondering am i singing anymore like
anything like that
so is it Lika good but um it didn't
actually sounds completely was pretty
surprising these are over ear headphones
I mean yeah these are over ear
headphones and um they typically seem a
bit loud to me so it's actually pretty
surprising that sound was able to get in
but that's what it is so I mean it did
um like I said it did well on the sound
weak test but not as great we would have
liked for the sound isolation and not so
great for the girlfriend test I guess
yeah sorry I'm 50 lovers but um that's
about it for this video guys if you
enjoyed it please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and we'll catch
you guys in the next video till then
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
