in the TV section of Best Buy and
there's no area here she's at work but
I'm picking up some new tech for the
office and I can't not vlog right now so
I'm going to show you guys what I plan
on picking up I came in here thinking s
uhd that's what I have in mind but there
are just so many options here that I
think I've really got to take my time
with this and of course you guys know
assets check out the gaming section I
actually found something that's pretty
interesting this is some game called
little battlers experience I've never
heard of it but it's got robots and you
guys know how I feel about robots and it
looks like you can customize on whatever
for the 3d s looks pretty interesting I
think I'll pick it up I'm hoping that's
gonna be like a little gem that I've
never heard of that actually turns out
to be really fun check this out
Pokemon Sun and Moon you know I'm you
know I got those on pre-order which one
do you got if you play pokemons though
which one do you guys have unlock this
guy looks awesome so me and Ari are
gonna be fighting over who gets that one
check this out I went to the mall and
ran into this guy at the North Bay store
now I'm not sure you guys have heard of
this but this is the North Face access
pack now this is supposed to be their
take on like a tech backpack as you can
see kind of just clip it open it's
actually really cool and very
interesting I haven't really put
anything in here just yet but I'm gonna
fill it up and you know see if it's
actually worthy of the gadget backpack
title or maybe tech travel backpack I
don't know it's a little big for the
tech travel backpack I'm gonna see if
it's you know it'll do the trick for a
gadget backpack I'm so super super
height when I saw it because I've been
looking online for it and it's always
out of stock or I said notify me when
available
so I walked into a North Face tour
casually saw it right at the entrance
was the last one I dashed for it are you
laughed at me but it was worth it picked
it up and now got it in hand I could
pick a video about it so happy there and
also check this out for my fellow geeks
out there you already know what this is
I was surprised I posted I posted a
photo on Instagram and Twitter so if
you're not following me there you should
be but I posted a video a photo there
and some of you guys said it look like
pizza Airy was a culprit as well like
how do you get pizza
I guess pepperoni the yellow I get it
but come on man these are the dragonball
show some respect
things are dope we got three star right
there
now what I plan to do I don't know maybe
five maybe I don't know if I want to
leave it like this but I was thinking it
would be really cool to have all seven
scattered across okay studio or maybe
this little office area right here that
would be really awesome if you guys know
Dragon Ball Z then you know what that's
all about so pretty hype I got them
weren't expensive I'll have links to it
down below in the description if you
want to grab a set for yourself so guys
this is it but I have no idea I'm
bringing this into the car not gonna be
fun just jump into an uber and I'm
actually on my way to a meeting where
I'm going to be discussing some really
cool ideas that I have for some
very soon actually so I'm pretty excited
about that
but you might have noticed we're in a
fancy shirt I actually got this from
ministry of supply which happens to be a
sponsor for today's video and actually
the timing is pretty awesome considering
I'm about to go do some business stuff
right now ministry of supply is a
clothing brand they use a ton of tech in
their manufacturing process to make wear
to wear clothing like you see me in
right now and they actually do this so
that they can create something that's
really comfortable and a little keep you
cool during the summer and these guys
using phase change materials developed
by NASA and to my average consumers out
there who don't know what that means it
means you get some nice quality stuff
right now I'm knockin the Apollo dress
shirt and the aviator to pants and one
thing that I'm loving with these clothes
is that it's super comfortable very very
stretchy so it gives you room to breathe
you can move around without feeling like
you can rip your shirt or your pants
which is awesome now I've never ever
experienced pants like these I might
have been buying the wrong ones all my
life but this is an eye opener if you
guys want to pick up some gear from the
strip supply I'll of course have links
down below in the description and a
coupon code if you want to say 15% off
your first order
and that's UAC 15 so definitely check
that out and this actually makes a
really great gift for Father's Day
that's coming up so if you want to get
your dad something to go to work he's
gonna feel great in I highly suggest
picking these up but now I could go to
this meeting feel like a boss and not
feelings all stuffy like what I like I
would with a regular suit and tie I like
this alright guys so the meeting is done
I've got some awesome stuff planned for
you guys I can't wait for you guys to
see should be really happening all in a
couple of months well not even months a
couple of weeks so that's going to be
really exciting but if you can't tell
right now I'm gonna Ikea and I have to
get almost tripped I have to get some
furniture for the studio man you got to
finish furnishing it
and this part sucks honestly I mean it's
gonna be cool to put everything together
but the procurement part of the actual
stuff has to go inside of it that's so
fun alright guys so this right now is a
contender I like something like this the
material is pretty nice my only issue is
that it's super short look at this then
that's not much distance at all but I do
want something comfortable and this
definitely will do the trick is wide
enough so just sit back and relax so I
don't know I think I might go with it I
like it I know I asked you guys some of
your opinions on what kind of desk I
should go for and a lot of you mentioned
motorized desk which are a really solid
option but pricey IKEA has this really
inexpensive option but it just doesn't
seem like it's that sophisticated I can
only can pretty much just do up-and-down
no presets or anything like that and I'm
not really too sure if I'm crazy about
needing this kind of hammock deal for
cable management there are some
motorized that's out there that provide
cable management as well but those those
desks are pricey I think the one I
configured one and it was up to like two
G's plus so I don't know still figuring
it out
I keep getting asked questions about
some of the products around here so
apparently if you look somewhat
professional people think you work at
IKEA
so I set up the TV 65 inches might be a
bit too big for this room the party but
I'll probably go down to like 55 inches
that are probably suited a lot better
but I'm not going to show you guys
simply because I want there to be some
kind of wow factor when I actually do
the video showing off everything in here
so I'll leave some stuff to the
imagination both check this out look
what I got in this is the j-bird
freedom's now you guys have been asking
oh yeah well I got the alien if you guys
watch the last vlog you know I was on a
hunt for it so I got that in but either
way this are the jaybird freedom
wireless now jaybird comes out with some
dope dope earbuds so I'm really happy to
see this now these are super sleep you
guys can see how thin these are how
small they are so I'm pretty excited in
the design looks pretty good I think the
the gold color looks pretty good I wish
they had ocean I couldn't get my hands
on the ocean color but this is a pretty
good alternative so I'm going to be
working on that review actually right
now and by the time you see this it'll
be out later in this week so you guys
can stay tuned for that but this isn't
the only a pair of headphones or earbuds
that I need to get a video out on I also
got to do these got this guy right here
these are the sony here on virus-like
where am i pointing this but here they
are now this is another video I think
I'm going to try and aim to get this out
this week as well so that's two videos
that you guys know are coming but these
I'm really really digging these my only
complain about them you have to see in
the video Hey
alright guys so I unboxed it and here it
is so let's nice and sleek what do you
think huh I like it I love the colors
the gold and the white reminds me of
I don't know it's not good anime like a
robot oh that weird where did that come
from
if I thought it color does I hear you
are getting this but I like it
well you're talking my language anyway
it's smaller yeah if you're supposed to
for women like more feminine thing I
don't say that I know are the Queen
let's see what this looks like you want
all this oh they are nice-looking look
at how nice they look in your ears
well testing will begin for those who
like Power Rangers like the white and
gold one ah like Tommy
there you go that's what it is alright
guys so new Best Buy but I'm here with
my boy edge what's going on news guy
since like elementary school so I'm
gonna get the 55 inch since the 65 was
too big so I would put the 65 in the
game room
55 should be cool in the office living
room
so guys what do you think honestly it's
not a bad option we should go with
Samsung with their a series of thousands
so you're gonna have a lot of thousand
it's a brand new snow as far there you
have the folks so don't mission
accomplished got the TV in hand pops in
the back it's not that yes all right so
we're all good no more trips the best
buy by the way it's this guy's birthday
so we thought we'd go to the voted best
diner and get them some breakfast
how's the food dad food is good yeah you
like it yes I do
this doesn't compare the top but it'll
do it'll do this right here is going to
be the most epic room I've ever created
if not much now but it's going to be
something soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
