consumer and today I'm going to be doing
a demonstration of the galaxy s4's
camera and this thing has some really
great specs so 13 megapixels and we're
just going to see how it fares in
different lighting conditions outdoors
indoors just a lot of Sun no Sun low
lighting cuz all kinds of stuff so I'm
gonna show you guys what this works like
and hey let's not waste any time let's
get right into it and alright guys right
now I am testing the camera for the
samsung galaxy s4 and I have the little
window up front which is the front
facing camera and then of course the
rear camera is showing what's in front
of me so it's a cool little feature
samsung added definitely can be very
useful if you want to show your reaction
to something or show someone or talk to
someone while video recording and
showing them what's around so it's
definitely pretty cool and you can
change up the way that this looks into
all different kinds of shapes and sizes
so you got a lot of customization for
this really neat feature and just taking
a look around you guys can see the
quality of the s4 it's a pretty regular
day out a little cloudy but overall just
does have some good did you finish that
overall this does have some good video
quality so can't complain here
whatsoever and of course I have to show
you guys what it looks like to have the
front-facing camera as the fullscreen
picture here so like I said this looks
pretty good
really good stuff either way this phone
is impressive on both ends front facing
camera rear camera all good stuff this
is of course with some really great
lighting it's sunny out so
it's good good conditions so of course
this performs as you would expect it to
with a high-end phone like this
yeah links a muffin guy so here we have
TS for at in the evening as you can see
the Sun has gotten down but it's not
quite nighttime yet so you guys can get
a good look at how this performs I think
this is doing actually very well it
looks nice and clean on my screen can't
really complain here doesn't look too
dark so in low light
it seems to be doing pretty well and you
guys can see here so in this kind of
situation if you have to use your camera
gotta fix your car buddy but in in this
kind of situation where you'd have to
use your camera at this kind of
condition I don't think anyone would be
disappointed with the outcome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
