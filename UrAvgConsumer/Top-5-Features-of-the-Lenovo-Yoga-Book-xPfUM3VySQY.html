and today we're gonna be taking a look
at the top 5 features of the brand-new
Lenovo yoga book now this is a
surprising laptop tablet combo and huge
shout out to Lenovo for sponsoring this
video and sending one of these for me to
check out now the kicks are my list of
favorite features we're going to start
off with the design the yoga book is a
twin one with a really sleek and
flexible design and the one we've got
here is running android marshmallow
it features an incredibly thin 10.1 inch
display and has a built-in keyboard that
lenovo is calling its halo keyboard but
more on that in a second the display and
keyboard are kept together with Lenovo's
watchband hinge which is pretty sturdy
and allows for easy positioning even
when closed the entire profile of the
yoga book is incredibly thin which makes
traveling a simple task it only weighs
about one and a half pounds which makes
it really convenient in terms of
portability and if you want us to go
into tablet mode it actually feels like
a tablet and not just some laptop that's
cold all the way back you've got your
power button and volume controls on the
right side of the keyboard as well as a
headphone jack and on the left side
you'll find a micro USB port to charge
it a micro SD card slot which is a nice
bonus as well as a micro HDMI port and
you also get stereo speakers on both
sides of the keyboard something I really
like about the design is that it stays
true to its name and actually looks like
a book and it can be held like one now
the second isn't really a feature but it
has to be mentioned and that's the price
at about $500 for Android and 550 for
Windows the yoga book is priced pretty
affordably while some other products in
this space usually charge at least a
hundred bucks for the keyboard or the
stylus so having everything you need
right inside of the box while still
costing less than the other options out
there price gets a thumbs-up for me now
number three on this list is that halo
keyboard now this is a flat surface that
actually lights up and gives form to the
keys it also includes haptic feedback
which allows you to have this super flat
keyboard but still feel like you have
the experience of typing on a physical
keyboard it's also worth noting that the
halo keyboard isn't always on it's there
when you need it but if you're the
creative type and you also enjoy drawing
the halo keyboard becomes a black blank
canvas for you to draw and design on
with a real pen graphic designers and
creators should feel right at home with
this tool now for number four you've got
the ability to digitize notes with the
real pen simply take the pen out of
stylus mode by popping out the stylus
tip with the pen cap and inserting the
real pen ink cartridge and boom you have
a legitimate pen to write with and once
you place your book pad on top of the
halo keyboard it captures your notes in
real time so now you can have
handwritten notes or drawings captured
digitally and you can do this in a way
that's familiar to everyone by using a
real pen and paper rather than drawing
on the actual screen which can be a
little weird if you're not used to it
and what's even cooler about this is
that you can use any paper you have
lying around and not just the one from
the pad with this you can immediately
see how useful this can be for students
or creators and last on this list is the
battery life one of the most important
things for people on the go like
students is gonna be a long battery life
Lenovo state says you can get up to 15
hours of battery life which is pretty
crazy in this tiny body that means this
thing will last you a full school or
work day but if you guys want to check
out the Lenovo yoga book for yourself
I'll of course have links down below in
the description and I'll catch you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
