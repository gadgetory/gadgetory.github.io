consumer and as most of the tech world
knows CES 2014 is happening right now in
Las Vegas and one of the announcements
that stood out to me was of course
Sony's announcement of PlayStation now
and you guys know I love my Playstations
and PS Vita and all that good stuff so
the PlayStation now was announced and I
was very excited for those of you who
haven't heard about it yet it's all over
social media tons of people are talking
about it on Twitter even a couple of
other youtubers and it's actually a
pretty cool service that reserves the
kind of buzz that it's getting right now
and for those of you who don't know what
PlayStation now is it's basically a
gaming cloud service that all stream
games to your PlayStation 3 PlayStation
4 PS Vita all kinds of devices and Sony
even has it lined up to be on 2014
models of the sony bravia televisions as
well as tablets and smartphones in the
future so sony has a lot of plans for
getting the streaming service on to a
ton of devices and they're even saying
that it's not going to be limited to
playstation devices or Sony devices so
that's gonna be really cool to be able
to pick that up and you know play a game
on a tablet or a TV that doesn't have
anything to do with Sony so it's gonna
be pretty interesting to see that in
action the streaming service is going to
start off with PlayStation 3 titles like
The Last of Us which they demoed over at
CES and it seems like it's going to run
fairly well depending on your internet
connection of course I still have a ton
of questions about how this is going to
perform for the average consumer who
might not have a really fast internet
connection and actually unbox therapy
had a chance to talk to one of the Sony
representatives on his channel and he
was able to find out that you need at
least 5 megabits down I was very
surprised to hear that you're only gonna
need 5 megabits down I think that's
really great I think that most tablets
and smartphones that have data services
will definitely be able to handle that
I'm not too sure how it's gonna function
with the PlayStation Vita with 3G I'm
pretty sure it's gonna get the same
treatment that the Remote Play feature
has where you're actually gonna have to
be on Wi-Fi but I don't think 5 megabits
down is too much to ask for so I'm
pretty sure that most people will be
able to take advantage of this and get
some decent performance at least so like
I did mention it's going to be coming
out for the PlayStation 3 Playstation 4
and the PS
at first and then we'll come to sony
bravia television to the 2014 models and
then we'll see how it rolls out with
other smartphone devices and tablet
devices and the beta is gonna be
starting at the end of January and we'll
actually see this rollout to everyone
and around the summer time so we've got
a little bit to wait and I'm really
interested in seeing how this is going
to pan out there are still a ton of
questions about the service that I would
like to know about such as the cost what
the cost of games are gonna be since
it's all going to be cloud-based I don't
know if you'll own it digitally with
your PlayStation account and if those
games can actually be purchased on your
Sony devices I'm not sure how that all
is going to work but I'm gonna be
interested in finding out I'd also like
to know if older devices are going to be
able to work with this as long as the
hardware is decent so if you've got like
a Galaxy Note 3 will this eventually
come to something that can support those
features or are they only going to be
rolled out on future devices so these
are all just little questions that I
have but it's gonna be interesting
nonetheless I'm definitely going to get
on it when it comes out but let me know
what you guys think of PlayStation now
if it's a feature that you're interested
in is it something that you would sign
up for do you have a good enough
connection to take advantage of this
service let me know in the comments down
below and if you guys want to see me
talk about any other CES events that
happen let me know down below as well
and I will give you guys my opinion on
those and before we close out this video
