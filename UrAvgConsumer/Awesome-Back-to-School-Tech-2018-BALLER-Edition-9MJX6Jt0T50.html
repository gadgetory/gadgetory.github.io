and we all know is back-to-school time
you can't run from it but today we're
gonna be checking out some awesome tech
for back-to-school and if you guys
didn't see it I actually did a budget
version of this video I'll have it
linked down below in the description if
you missed it but today we are checking
out the baller edition maybe I saved up
a little money from your summer gig
maybe you got paid during graduation
today we're gonna check out the stuff
for those without a budget but these
still aren't that expensive I'm not
trying to make you guys go broke and the
bag that we've got right here is from
ghost tech this is the NRG 2 bag now
it's got the name NRG 2 because it
sounds like energy and that's because
this thing has a built-in portable
charger now that is an awesome feature a
lot of backpacks these days have a
little USB port where you can purchase a
portable charger connect it to your
backpack and then kind of use it on the
go
this one has the portable charger
already built in so no buying an
external one and it's actually 16,000
milliamp hours so you've got tons and
tons of juice you'll be able to charge
your phone at least four to five times
and you're gonna be able to do that
without having to hold a portable
charger and you just plug it into the
backpack and you're good to go
and not only that but you've also got a
little feature right here which has an
LED indicator to let you know just how
much battery you've got left so there's
no guesswork you don't have to go inside
of the backpack figure out if your
portable charger has juice or not just
check right here on the strap and you
know when to charge it and actually
speaking of charging it on the other
side you'll notice there's a little
micro USB port so it does you'll be able
to charge your backpack at night just
like you would your phone or anything
else and you'll have a ton of juice to
take with you to school and even though
this is a video for the ballers this
thing only costs 80 bucks
exactly so you paying for the backpack
and the portable charger and it's still
not that expensive
first flap boom these are a pair of
earbuds from Sony so here we have
the Sony here in wireless earbuds now I
love these earbuds because not only do
they sound great but they've got the
little neck band design so when you're
moving around walking around maybe
you're going in practice you don't have
to worry about these falling out of your
ears they'll stay nice and secure and
they look good they got a ton of
different colors to choose from so maybe
you got a special backpack that you like
or you want to match your outfit at
school you just want to look fresh
Wallace can afford to look fresh and
switch it up with different colored
earbuds you can do that right but also
excite I do like these because they
sound good they got pretty solid build
quality and one thing that I think is a
real bonus here not only can you use it
through bluetooth but let's say the
battery dies on you these are one of the
unique pair of Bluetooth earbuds that
allow you to attach an audio cable so
right here in the micro USB port where
you would charge it you can just plug
this in and with this you now have a
regular audio cable so you can plug this
into your headphone jack and listen to
your audio not to mention these also go
for under a hundred bucks right now
think the red ones a little more but
that's still not so bad so first up
we've got a couple of things going on
inside of here now for those of you who
haven't seen my series called the tech
survival kit this is a tech survival kit
and I made it so that it has all the
essential pieces of technology that you
would need lots of backup stuff lots of
things that you can depend on in case
you have some kind of tech emergency if
you haven't seen it I'll have it linked
down below in the description I'm not
gonna tell you guys everything that's
inside here because this is obviously a
video in itself this one's a bit on the
larger side but I've made three of these
all in various sizes so you can pick
which one works best for you and now we
got access to some of our compartments
now the very first one that you'll see
this one behind this zipper is where you
actually have access to the portable
charger that's inside of here now I'm
not gonna pull that out because it's
unnecessary right now but let's talk
about what else we've got right here we
have some external storage this is by
Seagate this is a five terabyte external
hard drive this small 5 terabytes and
with this kind of store
you can take this thing from freshman
year all the way to senior year and save
all of your projects all of your
homework assuming you don't drop it if
you drop it then you kind of kill it but
with five terabytes you probably won't
take up all of the space unless you're
downloading a ton of ton of videos and
putting it on here but five terabytes
guys and I think it cost maybe a little
bit more than 100 bucks so that's a
really really good deal USB 3.0 so you
did decent speeds definitely worth it
the only drive you'll need for school
now honestly that thing will probably
last you longer than some of your
friendships in high school I'm just
saying put whole jokes aside here we
have a pair of bluetooth headphones
these are the sony xb9 50 and ones so if
you're not crazy about Bluetooth earbuds
that's not your thing you want a regular
pair of headphones these let me tell you
easily my favorite pair of headphones
right now they're bluetooth so they're
wireless all the controls are right on
the headphones they've got amazing sound
quality if you love bass are you like
jamming out I'm telling you nothing
nothing beats these these are just
amazing if you love bass and you can
even turn the bass down if you don't
like it too much with the app that's
included this way you can fine tune the
sound quality that you get out of these
and they're extremely comfortable so if
you're on the train you join your bus
ride to school however you get into
school you can have these on for as long
as your trip is these sounds so good and
they have a noise canceling so if there
are a bunch of people on the bus or
train man all the chatter ah lock it all
out block it all out with these they go
for about two hundred and fifty bucks
but surprisingly these always go on sale
so you can probably find it for a lot
less but even if you pay full price it
is absolutely worth every penny now one
thing I will say you might see some
overlap like two headphones but you
don't have to get every piece that I
mentioned here these are all just
options for you to take a look at some
of them will overlap but you don't need
to get them all
if you abala ball out so of course we
got a little zipper Department where
we're gonna have a bunch of cables and
these are some of my favorite ones now
you guys might have heard me talk about
nomad cables in the past
I love nomad cables these are like
rugged durable cables and they've got a
variety of them you've got like regular
lightning cables
you've got cables with adapters so we've
got USB C with micro USB regular USB
this one that has all three cables that
you could possibly need this one is
actually the same but much much shorter
so if you have a portable charger that
you want to carry in your hand maybe you
don't want to go for the backpack
you can carry a portable charger and
your phone without having a long
dangling cable but another brand that's
worth taking a look at is native Union
they've got these nice good-looking
cables that you can kind of keep
together all nice and tidy so these are
also an option for you to take a look at
native Union now what we've also got in
the front up here is a phone now nobody
puts their phone in their backpack at
least I don't think so but for the sake
of the video I got to put it in there so
I can show you guys this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 and let me tell you guys
this is a really good phone my real day
in the life video is coming out so you
got to stay tuned for that but spoiler
alert the thing is awesome one thing
that I'm really liking about Samsung
phones these days is that there are
really no compromises when you buy them
you still have your headphone jack
waterproof while I was charging great
display honestly the only reason why
this might not be everyone's top choice
is you know preference maybe you like
iOS maybe you like certain manufacturers
phones all things go into it but also
price but this is the baller Edition so
I'm not taking a look at the price when
it comes to a phone recommendation but
why this is good for students is of
course the s-pen so if you're in class
you can easily start jotting down notes
sub to you a see boom so quick
that's a good message but still you can
pull this out drop down some quick notes
maybe you see a lady you want to talk to
you want to bet get her number you can
go old school a hat but ya know nine is
a great option back to school or not but
like I said we'll talk more about this
in the next video now another thing that
we've got inside of here and this is one
of those little repetitive items but in
case you don't go for this backpack here
we have a portable charger you guys in
yo is coming but this one is from
ravpower
so this is an insane portable charger I
know I know
this thing is it's a brick but this is
their power station this is their twenty
thousand milliamp hour portable charger
I think more so for like college
students this would be great because it
has a wall outlet so with this you can
plug in your laptop maybe you don't have
access to outlets I know for me I back
in college I used to hunt for an outlet
and there'd be so many people just
taking them all up here you don't really
have to worry about that
and it's 27,000 milliamp hours you won't
have to charge this thing for a hot
minute unless you're charging your
laptop this thing will last you a really
long time and it also supports USB
type-c as well as two other USB inputs
so you can potentially charge up to four
things at once maybe even more depending
on what you plug into the wall outlet
but this is just it's a crazy portable
charger what can I say so we've got all
our juice right here but on the side
we've got this little guy so this is
actually a new speaker it's nice and
discreet very small compact this one is
by Harman Kardon you can fit this thing
almost anywhere feels almost like a fix
cell phone I really like the sound that
you get considering its size and it has
a really cool feature where it has a USB
port so that you can charge up your
phone it works like a portable charger
multifunction items are always good and
if you're in college and got some
friends over in your dorm room to play
some music jam out to this or you can
even take it on the green listen to some
music
outside it doesn't hurt to have some
audio with you at all times
that doesn't take up a lot of space now
of course we've got a laptop in this
backpack but right here we have a mouse
to go with it and this is the logitech
g930 s' now this is an awesome gaming
mouse it's wireless it's nice and
lightweight it has RGB lights for those
of you who love RGB and I've got your
typical mouse buttons all over but one
thing that's special about this is that
on the right side you can remove the
little piece here and add buttons to
this one and then the mouse looks
exactly the same on both sides
meaning it's ambidextrous so for you
lefties out there oh you no longer have
to conform to the right-handed Mouse you
can use this one which will work in
either hand and it's also got this
really cool feature with its counterpart
mousepad that allows you to pretty much
use this and wirelessly charge it on the
mousepad so that way you never have to
go for a USB cable to make sure you
charge it up at night as long as you
have it on that mousepad to charge this
guy and uses no energy now this ain't
cheap and neither is that mousepad but
again we ballin now inside of here this
is quite a bit redundant but I just want
to show you guys right here we have a
rack do sleeve this honestly is probably
the best laptop sleeve that I could
possibly find online I really like this
one lots of functionality great
protection and it looks really good but
this is a really great laptop sleeve in
case you don't want to bring around a
big backpack maybe you're on campus or
you just want to carry something
lightweight this is a really good option
and it's like 20 bucks but enough of
this let's talk about the laptop we've
got inside and that is the Dell XPS 15
now this is a laptop that I've recently
fallen in love with it's got a great
build quality and you can even get some
really good specs on it
so if you want to do something a little
bit more intensive a little bit more
serious maybe you're an engineer of some
sort you can actually take this and
bring up the specs to actually keep up
with your work and honestly something
that I love about this is the display
it's a 4k display and it's touchscreen
it looks amazing like one of the best
displays I've seen on a lot
and the overall feel of this guy is just
premium good stuff
and it's even got a dedicated graphics
card is packing the NVIDIA GTX 1050 so
you can do some gaming nothing
super serious on it but if you want to
play a couple games in medium settings
you can definitely do that
thus the gaming mouse but yes the XPS 15
if you're looking for something solid to
take the school running Windows this is
definitely worth looking at but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed I don't think this
was too bad we ain't breaking any banks
yeah yeah and the mouse and the laptop
yeah all right somebody's bank is
getting broke but hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video if you did be the
cool guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then is your average consumer pace
and I bet you thought I forgot but
there's actually a small little secret
compartment in the back that's of course
holding our microfiber cloth you know we
got to have one of these we want to keep
the tech clean you need a sponge
microfiber cloth there are absolutely
not a sponsor
but I just love their microfiber cloths
the best in the game that I've tried so
far you need this
