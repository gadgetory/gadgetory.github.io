own a galaxy note5 well let me start off
by saying this phone is big but not
quite as big as something like the
iPhone 6 plus if you're used to using
the note series or most other
smartphones if at least the 5.5 inch
display you won't be surprised here but
coming from something smaller it'll take
some getting used to but I think for
anyone it's absolutely possible
it may feel a little big in the hands at
first but with time that'll pass Samsung
really stepped up their game in the
design department and make this a good
looking and feeling phone people have
been begging Samsung to go the premium
feeling route for years and this is the
year that they did it with the note 5
and s6 from earlier this year while the
looks and feel of this device are great
there are some drawbacks you no longer
have access to the battery since it's
sealed in and there's also no expandable
storage option which may be a pretty big
deal to the power users that the no
series is usually targeted at it's also
quite a bit slippery due to the all
glass back which also has some curves on
the sides so it'll fit nicely into the
hand but it might not always stay there
however I do find that these curved
sides help the phone to not be so
prominent while in my pockets not only
is it a bit hard to get a grip of but
this thing is a fingerprint magnet if
you're a microfiber cloth using junkie
like me you're not in for a good sign
luckily there are some ways around it
you can use a case like I have here on
the galaxy s6 but as you can see it does
take away from its great looks your
other option is to throw a skin on it
I've got some here from slick wraps and
it definitely helps to add some texture
and grip to the phone so you can safely
hold it and avoid those crazy
fingerprints and if you're big on having
a phone that isn't like everyone else's
there are tons of different options for
you to choose from on the sides we have
familiar button placement which should
make them easy to
and they give a nice click when you
press them now we've addressed that it's
a big foam but that also means it comes
with a big beautiful display
as with most Samsung phones the screen
is great we're looking at a quad HD
display that's vibrant bright and really
a pleasure to look at from all angles
the large screen makes it perfect for
media consumption and even do normal
things like texting and using your
everyday apps as well as web browsing
and no matter what you plan to do with
the note 5 it'll handle it pretty well
it has some killer specs so you can
expect a very fluid and buttery smooth
experience I've encountered no issues in
day-to-day performance bodily that's to
be expected nowadays so whether you're
word-processing playing your favorite
games or even taking advantage of the
multitasking capabilities the note 5
will handle it with no issues I
especially like gaming on a phone like
this because you can really appreciate
some of the great colors and detail
you'll find while playing some of the
better-looking games and speaking of
killer specs this thing has a 16
megapixel camera that takes amazing
photos a good camera is one of the most
important features to me on a smartphone
and the note 5 is easily one of the best
I've ever used you'll be able to get
some great photos with honestly very
little effort and if you do want to put
some effort into it you can pull off
some really great shots with the pro
mode that allows you to use the cameras
manual controls now when it comes to
battery performance a full day has been
pretty typical for me but of course this
varies depending on how heavily you'll
use it compared to the note 4 it does
have a slightly smaller and no longer
removable battery this could be a
problem for some power users but Samsung
makes up for that with the notifies fast
charging with the included fast charger
you'll be able to get up and running
from 0 to 50 percent in about 30 minutes
that makes it pretty easy to get back
some serious
juice while at work or anywhere else
you'll have access to an outlet and some
downtime it even features wireless
charging so that adds to the list of
convenient charging features now I don't
think I forgot about good ol s-pen now
I'll be honest I'm not a huge s-pen user
I did find myself trying to make use of
it but it simply isn't something I'd use
on a daily basis however that doesn't
mean there aren't useful ways to use it
it has a new design which no longer
needs a fingernail to pull it out simply
push it in and after an extremely
satisfying click you'll easily be able
to remove it the pen does have some
awesome features like the ability to
simply pull it out while the phone isn't
awake and immediately start taking notes
this could be really useful when you
just needed to jot down a quick note
there are also some cool features like
being able to make much longer
screenshots perfect for those hilarious
conversations you want to save without
having to use four or five different
screenshots or you can simply use the
pen to access shortcuts to your favorite
apps there are quite a few features
available for s-pen but how you use it
everyday will really be up to you
considering this is such a great phone I
wouldn't make a decision based on how
much you use the pen think of it simply
as a bonus and while on the topic of
bonuses here's a bonus for you I'm
teaming up with slick wraps to give away
a brand new Galaxy Note 5 to one of you
guys it's a pretty simple giveaway and
it's being held over on Twitter so be
sure to follow us both fair I have links
in details in the description if you
guys are interested you should be
interested but the note 5 is definitely
a top dog in the smartphone world right
now and it's definitely one of my
favorites today hopefully this video
helped and if it did be the cool guy
that gives it a thumbs up until the next
video is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
