consumer and today I'm gonna be doing
another comparison video for you guys of
the B spider executives and the monster
inspiration so let's not wasting time
let's get right into it
alright guys in here we have the monster
inspirations and right here we have the
beets executive now if you know my
comparison videos you know I like to
talk about the case first because I
think that's a pretty important factor
we have headphones now the monster
inspirations come in this semicircle
kind of shape and it's got a nice little
feel to it natural what the material is
but it feels really really um nice and
I'm very impressed by the case it's got
a tough feel to it and it's um pretty
sturdy it's not gonna help with like
hard hard impacts or anything like that
but it's definitely got a lot of good
protection here and the beats executive
come in this flat rectangular shape
which is pretty nice in the fact that it
can just be easily thrown into a book
bag or briefcase or anything like that
where you won't really be able to do
that with the monster inspirations but
it does have a clip and it also has this
handle that you can kind of use to carry
it if you feel like it so now when we
open up the cases themselves you can see
a big difference here the executives
when you open it up this is what you get
you just have your headphones your cable
there's no pouch or anything like that
it's just a place to put in your
headphones which I'm not really a big
fan of I like the look of the executives
case but as far as functionality it's
kind of disappointing that there's no
pouch for the cable and the fact that
you have to put in these um the
headphones awkwardly in order to get it
to fit whereas the most inspiration has
got a ton of space here that you can add
you can put a couple of your accessories
you can put another band for the
headphones you got the actual headphones
themselves and you have a pouch inside
of here that can carry all of your
cables and all that good stuff so
there's a lot of functionality with
these with this case that you don't
really get with the executives case and
there's got this nice soft material in
there as well where this one it's a
decent material it's nylon really but
you there's no real protection there so
I do like the fact that this gives you a
lot of space and you know storage
options now you just don't get with the
executives case but now let's put the
cases aside and get to the headphones
all right so the first thing we're gonna
talk about is the design the beats
executive have a really nice design I'm
a big fan of it I think they have some
really nice metal accents and the
leather is not a nice touch on the arm
your ear cups and the headband as well
so I think it's got a really nice look
to it it's not flashy like all the other
beats and it's just really got a good
feel and look for it so I think the
design aspects is really this does
really really well where's the the
monster inspirations I think they look
pretty good to them it's a little
different it's a different shape to it
it's got this these like rectangular ear
cups that you don't typically see on
headphones usually you see these oval
kinds of shapes so monitor you know when
a little bit of a different route with
these and had these um square these
rectangular ear cups and overall doesn't
make for a bad experience um as far as
getting my ears inside here it wasn't
too bad but for some reason my right ear
just didn't really sit too well inside
of these but I didn't have any issues as
far as fitting them in the executives
but as far as like the look of the mom
the inspirations I think they're pretty
good looking pair of headphones they've
got tons of colors it doesn't just stop
at what you get you can change up the
headbands as you can see here you can
kind of just pull it out and you know
add a different headband to it and
switch up the style so I think that's
really cool aspect that they've got
going on with
inspirations kind of reminds me of the
soul republic tracks so it's really
really cool thing that they've got going
on so you don't have a static design
with these you can um you know change
them up as as you go so I really think
that's pretty cool
and in comparison I gotta say I think
that the executives look a little cooler
than the monster inspirations but that
doesn't mean that these look bad I just
think that these probably look a little
cooler in my opinion so I did touch a
little bit on comfort like I said before
my right ear didn't fit too well with
the inspirations but there's still very
comfortable pair of headphones they've
got a really nice soft cushion for the
ear cups and they do have a soft cushion
for the headband as well so overall
these aren't bad I just wish my ear fit
a little bit better in this ear cup but
that could just be me as far as the
executives comfort was not an issue
whatsoever these are very very
comfortable headphones probably the best
the most comfortable out of the beats
line because these have like extremely
soft your cushions and the padding is
very soft as well
so definitely I'll probably give that to
the executives in that department
now as far as durability goes the
executives are made of this aluminum
they have this aluminum finish on the
ear cups and have all these things like
aluminum accents around the headphones
so they feel very sturdy they're very
solid feeling so definitely good in the
durability Department yeah I don't think
you have to worry too much about the
snapping or breaking on you and the
headband has is it soft at the touch but
when you press a little deeper inside
you feel that it's um got a pretty
sturdy band on the inside now as far as
the inspirations go they're pretty solid
pair of headphones too you do get this
swivel movement with the ear cups so
that might make someone think that
they're not that sturdy but they
actually pretty sturdy I think and it's
got a pretty sturdy headband as you guys
can see it's really thick here so this
you can't you don't have to worry about
this snapping on you anytime soon or
anything like that well
you might feel a little something in the
hinges this might get a little loose
over time but overall these are pretty
solid I think um I take pretty good care
of my headphone so I wouldn't see these
giving me an issue whatsoever as far as
like Falls or anything like that maybe
these will stand up to Falls a bit
better because of the metal but um I
definitely think these are both good and
durability Department and now of course
to talk about the sound quality between
the two I gotta give it to the
inspirations I do think that the
inspirations sound a bit better than the
executives where the inspiration sounds
like it's a little clearer and it's like
you know a little louder
the executives could sound like it's a
little further away like the sound seems
like it's a little further away it's not
as clear and the noise cancelling hiss
doesn't help it at all in that regards
it kind of muffles out the music if
you're really paying attention where
that's not an issue with the
inspirations noise cancelling isn't an
issue here with this it can you know
carry over into music which you know
really can make it sound a little muddy
not really a fan of that but overall on
their own regard like not even doing a
comparison on their own regard they both
sound great they like I said the
executives the hissing it's a problem
but it's something you can either get
used to or you might not even notice
yourself but it is there and a lot of
people will probably notice it but on
their own regards that both great
sounding headphones but in this
comparison I gotta give it up to the
inspirations they do sound a bit clearer
to me and um pretty much that's about it
they this does sound clearer
this doesn't they don't have them I
think the bass is pretty even but um and
that pretty much wraps it up between the
two of these um as far as durability
looks design and stuff like that I'll
give it to the executives I do think
that these look a little better and
because it's made out of this aluminum
it's probably a little sturdier than
these are but I must say that these
aren't bad headphones in that regard as
well these are good-looking headphones
and they're durable as well but it just
in comparison these
we have the leg up on it but of course
when it comes to sound quality I
definitely think the inspirations are
better than these I think the noise
cancelling is better and for a sound
like if you're really going for sound I
say inspirations if you just want to do
this style thing then go for your
executives but that pretty much wraps it
