want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone to traverse consumer I just
want to say thanks to the person who
commented and let letting me know that
the Sol Republic track ultras came out
so I went out and I got my hands on them
and here they are today I'm going to be
doing an unboxing for you guys and it
was not wasting time let's get right
into it alright guys so here we have the
Sol Republic track ultras I know you
guys have been asking me a ton about the
Solar Probe track hd's and the regular
ones well don't worry i also have the
soul public track HDS here i'm going to
do an unboxing and review of these two
but i just really wanted to get this one
out cuz i'm really excited about the
ultras so just stay tuned for that
that's going to come very shortly but
let's not wasting time let's get right
into this ultra one and let's see around
the box you know it says Sol Republic
tract also Republic I'm sorry says that
on both sides it's got this link
interesting little um see-through
packaging and the back here shows you on
some of the features you got
interchangeable headbands they say that
the headbands are virtually
indestructible I'm not sure about that
i'm not one to test these out too well
um too much but we'll see how that goes
and they offer incredible sound these
retail for 179 99 and that's a bit of a
step up from the hds i believe which
costs 129 99 50 bucks so this one has
really good bass very interested in i'm
trying these out so let's get to opening
this box you open here our this offline
so it has this little paper on here here
it shows you some pictures of what comes
in the box got the headband for the two
ear cups and the cord that connects them
this seems to have a control and inline
remote so you can control your music and
your you know I phone and stuff like
that so that's going to be interesting
and I think it also comes with a cat
in case so let's see what we get inside
here seems you have to pull here to open
it but there's a little sticker so let's
get that off of there so now we'll just
grab my handy dandy unboxing night pop
open the sticker here and see if there's
any other stickers I have to take off I
think that's about it so we only got one
sticker on the bottom then you can pull
out this tab here and then proceed to
pull it out from the bottom okay nothing
else besides up to some little case here
and I see alright so here we have the
headband and I'm going to say this feels
pretty thin surprised that this is
supposed to be virtually indestructible
considering how thin it is but that
that's pretty cool this is the left side
the right the top cushion feels pretty
nice I this is the blue version in case
you guys can't tell these are the only
ones i found online so i guess this
might be the first ones that they're
selling and they have these little white
cushions hopefully these don't get dirty
too easily and as you go deeper inside
the box we have the ear cups and they
seem to be held together by this little
flap and this is such an interesting
little dynamic that they have going here
with the like a whole assembly feature
of these headphones and being able to
change up the ear cups and stuff like
that so I'm very interested in seeing
hobby is work um so these are the
earcups these are wide cushions the
Christians feel pretty nice so I'm going
to put these on the side here and I see
further there's a little box on the
bottom here it says keep on going more
inside so I think there's something here
and it might be something inside of the
vaccine so let's see if you can actually
push this is not for a second I actually
opened it up from the side here assuming
the cable is going to come in again and
yes this seems like the cable so let's
try and get this open alright so now
that we got that off let's see it's a
pretty interesting cable it some pretty
thick not as thick is like beats or
anything but these are still pretty
thick so it's not bad and of course you
have the two it's like a that why
formation cable because it plugs into
both ear cups so that's pretty cool and
this is the little inline remote that
can be used with your ipod iphone stuff
like that and let's see that's one side
I believe there's another little box
here thanks to the carrying case which
is very very interesting and of course
you have your warranty and quick start
guides and stuff like that and a little
sticker too so it's all very interesting
this is a very interesting pouch kind of
case for it looks like those little
sleaze that you can put your iPad in or
your tablet so this is very interesting
well now that we've seen everything that
comes inside the box let's get to
assembling this headphone and then i'll
give you guys a close-up so this is the
left side we're going to put the left
side up on here and it's nice that you
can kind of adjust it however you want
to fit your head so that's pretty cool
i'll put this
here as well oh and you got to make sure
to keep the headphone jack part at the
bottom alright cool so I thought I can
fill these little stickers off get these
out of the way and now i'm going to plug
in the cable and these also indicate
which side is left or right so i just
plugging the right side here website
again very simple easy to use I like I
really like a color the styling was
really nice pretty impressed so now let
me give you guys a close up of what
these look like ok guys so here you have
the Sol Republic track ultras and they I
think these look pretty similar to the
regular ones like the hd's and they're
your standard trac ones so i'm not sure
if there's much of a difference here but
i must say I'm pretty I like the size of
this and it looks pretty nice the feel
is pretty good it's smooth at the top I
liked how has like an aluminum finish on
the earcups themselves so that feels
pretty cool and the little logo looks
nice I'm just a little worried about the
white padding kind of reminds me of the
Smarty blue solo hd's and um hopefully
it doesn't get too dirty but the
material feels really nice it really
does feel nice in the hands very
impressed by the look and your guys can
just see the inline remote got your
volume controls and of course you're
playing pause answer calls and stuff of
course you have your mic in the back
here and it says so republic and pretty
much that's about it for these on the
ultras guys you look like some pretty
solid headphones I can't wait to see how
the sound quality is on them I know I've
been getting a lot of requests to try
out for Republic so I can't wait to give
you guys my input and for those of you
have been asking about the tribe hd's
forever don't worry i got them they're
going to be unboxed and uploaded as soon
as possible so definitely can't wait to
try these out and i'll let you guys know
where
