to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video what's going on everyone to
Traverse consumer I just want to say
thanks to the person who commented and
let letting me know that the SOL
Republic track ultras came out so I went
out and I got my hands on them and here
they are today I'm going to be doing an
unboxing for you guys and hey let's not
wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the SOL
Republic track ultras I know you guys
have been asking me a ton about the
Solar Probe track hd's and the regular
ones well don't worry I also have this
on public track HDS here I'm gonna do an
unboxing and review of these two but I
just really wanted to get this one out
cuz I'm really excited about the ultras
so just stay tuned for that that's gonna
come very shortly but let's not wasting
time let's get right into this ultra one
and let's see around the box you know
that says Sol Republic tracked well so
Republic I'm sorry says that on both
sides it's got this interesting little
um see-through packaging and the back
here shows you on some of the features
you got interchangeable headbands they
say that the headbands are virtually
indestructible I'm not sure about that
I'm not one to test these out to welcome
so much but we'll see how that goes and
they offer incredible sound these retail
for 170 $9.99 and that's a bit of a step
up from the HDS I believe which cost 120
999 50 bucks so these are suppose that's
a really good base very interested in um
trying these out so let's get to opening
this box you open here I order this
offline so it has this little paper on
here here it shows you some pictures of
what comes in the box got the headband
with the two ear cups and the cord that
connects them this seems to have a
control and inline remote so you can
control your music and your you know
iPhone and stuff like that so that's
gonna be interesting and I think it also
comes with a cat
okay so let's see what we get inside
here seems you have to pull here to open
it but there's a little sticker so let's
get that off of there so now let me just
grab my handy dandy unboxing knife pop
open the sticker here and see if there's
any other stickers I have to take off I
think that's about it so I only got one
sticker in the bottom then you can pull
out this tab here and then proceeded to
pull it out from the bottom
okay nothing else to divide up this um
little case here and I see alright so
here we have the headband and I must say
this feels pretty thin surprised that
this is supposed to be virtually
indestructible considering how thin it
is but that that's pretty cool this is
the left side to right it the top
cushion feels pretty nice I this is the
blue version in case you guys can't tell
these are the only ones I found online
so I guess this might be the first ones
that they're selling and they have these
little white cushions hopefully these
don't get dirty too easily and as you go
deeper inside the box we have the ear
cups and they seem to be held together
by this little flap and this is such an
interesting little dynamic that they
have going here with the like a whole
assembly feature of these headphones and
being able to change up the ear cuffs
and stuff like that so I'm very
interested in seeing how these work um
so these are the ear cups these are
white cushions the questions feel pretty
nice so I'm gonna put these on the side
here and uh see
further there's a little box on the
bottom here it says keep on going more
inside so I think there's something here
and it might be something inside of the
factory so let's see actually this is
not for a second I actually opened it up
from the side here I'm assuming the
cable is gonna come in and yes this
seems like the cable so let's try and
get this open all right so now that we
got that off let's see so pretty
interesting cable it's um pretty thick
not as thick it's like beets or anything
but these are still pretty thick so it's
not bad and of course you have to - it's
like a Y formation cable because it
plugs into both ear cups so that's
pretty cool and this is the little
inline remote that can be use with your
iPod iPhone stuff like that and let's
see that's one side and I believe
there's another little box here and I
think it's the carrying case which is
very very interesting and of course you
have your warranty and Quick Start Guide
and stuff like that and a little sticker
too so it's all very interesting this is
a very interesting pouch kind of case
where it hmm looks like those little
sleeves that you can put your iPad in or
your tablet so this is very interesting
well now that we've seen everything that
comes inside the box let's get to
assembling this headphone and then I'll
give you guys a close-up so this is the
left side we're going to put the left
side up on here and it's nice that you
can kind of adjust it however you want
to put your head so that's pretty cool
but this
here as well and you got to make sure to
keep the headphone jack part at the
bottom all right cool so I thought I can
fill these little stickers on out of the
way and now I'm going to plug in the
cable and these also indicate which side
is left or right so I'm just plugging
the right side here very simple easy to
use I like I'm really like a color the
styling looks really nice pretty
impressed so now let me give you guys a
close-up of what these look like okay
guys so here you have the SOL Republic
track ultras and they I think these look
pretty similar to the regular ones like
the HDS and they're your standard track
ones so I'm not sure if there's much of
a difference here but I must say I'm
pretty I like the size of this and it
looks pretty nice the feel is pretty
good it's smooth at the top I liked how
it has like an aluminum finish on the
ear cups themselves so that feels pretty
cool and the little logo looks nice I'm
just a little worried about the white
padding kind of it reminds me of the
Smarty blue solo HDS
and um hopefully it doesn't get too
dirty but the material feels really nice
it really does feel nice in the hands
very impressed by look and you guys can
just see the inline remote yet your
volume controls and of course you're
playing pause answer calls and stuff of
course you have your mic in the back
here and it says soul Republic and
pretty much that's about it for these um
the ultras guys you look like some
pretty solid headphones I can't wait to
see how the sound quality is on them I
know I've been getting a lot of requests
to try out for Republic so I can't wait
to give you guys my input and for those
of you have been asking about the track
hd's forever don't worry I got them
they're gonna be unboxed and upload it
as soon as possible so definitely can't
wait to try these out and I'll let you
guys know where I
thanks for watching guys if you like
