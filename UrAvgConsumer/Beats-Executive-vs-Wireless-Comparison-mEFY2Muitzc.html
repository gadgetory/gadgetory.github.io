soon where and today I've got a
comparison video and for you guys of the
beats by dre executives and the beats
Wireless
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the executives and the beats Wireless of
course you not like to start off my
comparisons with the cases that they
come with and the executives come in a
rectangular hardshell case which is
pretty good for protection and it's
pretty easy to throw into a book bag
briefcase suitcase whatever you want to
throw it into it's pretty simple to
throw that in there whereas the beast
Wireless they come with this soft pouch
kind of case it offers no real
protection it'll protect you from like
scratches or anything like that but um
it's not gonna help with impact or if
you sit on it or anything like that so
you know definitely a plus with this
hardshell case for the executives but at
least the wireless you can actually um
take this little bend this little strip
here and um put it around your bookbag
handle or something like that and or you
can just hold it in your hands while
walking whatever you want to do with it
and you can just do that but um when we
open up the cases as you can see the my
biggest gripe with the case of the
executives is that there are no pouches
so your cable is just kind of hanging
loose and you kind of have to sit your
executives in a weird position to get
them in here so that's my biggest gripe
with the case of the executives where's
the beats Wireless all you have to do is
kind of fold them up and throw them in
here and it also has this little pouch
so that you can keep your cables as well
as your USB charger for the B wireless
so that's pretty cool that this has this
but like I said no real protection since
this is so flimsy but it at least gives
you that pouch and makes it pretty
portable so enough about the cases now
let's talk about these headphones the
executives cost about two ninety-nine
ninety-nine 300 bucks and the wireless
cost to seventy nine ninety nine so
these are almost 300 bucks but these are
slightly cheaper the executives are the
newest out of the beasts line and
Wireless are fairly new but they've been
out for a couple of months now almost a
year almost and like I said the beats
wanna start my current favorite pair of
beats and this comparison should give
you some insight as to the reasons why
so let's talk a bit about the features
the Beats executives are have active
noise-cancelling and they run on two
triple A batteries while the beats
Wireless have bluetooth capabilities and
these run on an internal battery that
you can use the USB I just showed you
guys to charge them up and you don't
ever have to worry about your batteries
dying and having to get a new pair
inside all you have to do is charge them
up if these die on you you can always
plug in your cable and still listen to
music even if there's no battery or you
don't want to use bluetooth where's the
executives if you give your batteries do
die on these that's about it for the
headphones you gotta wait so you get new
batteries inside and you can't listen to
them without the power so that's my
biggest gripe with these and one of my
favorite things about the beats Wireless
but it has a rechargeable battery and it
doesn't rely on it
so definitely bonus points for these as
far as the design goes I'm a big fan of
both of these designs I probably give it
to the executive since they just look a
little um a little nicer I think that
these have a really cool design I'm
still a fan of my beats Wireless I think
they look great but I still definitely
got to give it to the executives I think
this was a really nice cool look this
really does hit that executive theme
that they're going for with the little
leather accents on the ear cups and the
actual band and the ear cuffs right here
so that's pretty cool where's the beats
these look like pretty standard beats
they look very similar to the solo HDS
but of course they've got these buttons
on the side here and these are a little
bigger than the regular solo HD so
though if you're a fan of the beats look
and this is a pretty
look since it looks like the solo HDS
and I'm a fan of those so in Luke's
apartment still got to give it to the
executives just a bit now as far as
durability goes because this has this
aluminum finish on the ear cups it's got
a lot more durability for it where this
is me out of plastic I've had no issues
with the durability of these even though
they're made out of plastic but it's
easy to see that these are the more
durable pair as they're you know got the
aluminum finish and these are thicker
bands as you can see here and comparison
to the wireless these are a lot thinner
compared to these so this definitely
wins in the durability department as
well as far as comfort goes these are
both very comfortable I do like that the
cushions are so soft on the executives I
think the beach walls are like the
second most comfortable pair some might
even find the beats Wireless a little
more comfortable because it's not your
ear doesn't have to go inside of the
actual cups so it might not squish them
but I do think that these are very very
comfortable they're both very very
comfortable III still probably give it
to the executives in that department
though because the band is a little
softer than these even though you know
it's really a big a bit of a difference
as far as on ear headphones versus over
ear headphones but they're both great in
their departments now my favorite thing
about the beats Wireless is of course
the fact that they're Wireless they're
used Bluetooth to connect to cell phones
tablets computers your PlayStation Vita
if you have one all kinds of stuff and
it's really nice that it can do that I
really love an of wireless headphones so
sometimes I don't like using you know
the cables they can get in the way for
me sometimes so I really am a fan of the
wireless features so this really it's a
good point a good spot for me as far as
like functionality goes so that's one of
my favorite features about them and it
doesn't take away from anything it
doesn't affect the sound quality I've
heard tons of people say that the sound
quality diminishes when you're using the
Bluetooth features but I have not found
that to be true at all what I do think
though is
that where people use the Bluetooth
features they don't keep they don't keep
in mind that there are two volumes that
you have to control the volumes of the
headphones as well as the volume of the
device that you're using so if you keep
the volume of the headphones low and
then the device high it might sound like
this is outputting lower sound quality
but the sound quality does not change
between those two so I see it as simply
a bonus that these have the Bluetooth
feature and of course you know you can't
range all the tracks from the ear cups
you can power these and do all kinds of
fancy stuff skip go back pause so I
really like that functionality I don't
have to even pull out my device to
control my music so definitely some huge
bonus points with that and that brings
me into the next part of where the sound
quality
now these both have some really good
sound quality the when it comes to the
wireless I got to say that these the
executives are a bit clearer these do
have a lot of good bass and the
executives have a good bass as well I
just do think that these have some you
know better overall quality but the
hissing on these really is a factor to
consider from the owner active
noise-cancelling did like I said that
hiss can travel into your music and it's
just a bit of a bother it can kind of
make the sound the music sound a little
muddy and by muddy I mean not as clear
because of that hiss these are both
great sounding headphones and like I
said the beats ones are my favorite
headphones so it goes to show you that
even though I said that these aren't the
clearest they still do sound good enough
for your average consumer on they sound
a lot better than the solo HD some
people think that these are like similar
to the soleus T's but just have them
Bluetooth features but that's not true
but like I said I do think that these
sound a little better but that hissing
can interfere with that sound quality a
little bit but overall the average
consumer will find both of these to be
great sounding headphones they both pack
a lot of bass really a good big fan of
the bass on these they both sound great
so in the sound client Department
I do give the edge to the executives a
little bit but um I'm still gonna go
with the beats Wyeth has my favorite
pair of headphones even after being
exposed to these simply because of all
the features that these has and the fact
that it doesn't rely on batteries or
anything like that and it's also just a
little a little smaller in design so
it's a little sleeker for me it's easier
to carry but pretty much that wraps it
up guys if you have any more further
questions about these or the differences
between the two of these feel free to
let me know and I'll answer that down in
the comments below
and pretty much thanks for watching guys
