consumer and as you can see we've got
another massive tech unboxing oh this is
number nine I believe things are gonna
be a little bit different this time
though because I've got a peel box now
so some companies are sending me things
without me even knowing so we've got a
couple of surprises here but of course
grab your snacks grab your drinks let's
relax and check out some tech so we got
to keep the tradition going
ere you go ahead and pick one of these
which one this guy okay and I know this
box this is from Microsoft so you know
this is about to be a controller oh you
did design alright so let's see oh I
think it is Wow you picked yours on the
first shot good job
ready to see your controller this is
actually really nice take a look at that
it does it does match your ear pods oh
you did a good job picking the grip and
the little triggers here oh this is a
good combo
alright so good job - I for opinions
good controller there so this is one of
those packages that I have no idea who
it came from or what it is so we'll see
what's inside of here
they put an ADD tape on this listen this
thing is killing me
I swear it's just like some kind of case
I'm gonna lose it what is that
is this a is this some kind of
phone it is a phone okay interesting
this looks just like the Galaxy s8 and
s8 plus okay not really
wait a minute this does not look like
the front at all let's see what we've
got
Wow 720p HD display
- yup okay okay yep no I mean I found
the harbor and this thing has no juice
though you know I I don't know maybe it
might be okay I'll have to charge it up
and see but okay I'm gonna let you guys
know if some of the stuff that I get is
bad and I don't have high hopes for this
one but we'll see all right so next up
we'll take a look at this guy this is
from Aki what's this
Oh a portable charger you guys know I
love me some portable chargers it comes
with a pouch now okay Aki leveling up
here so this is similar to the thirty
thousand milliamp hour version that I
have but now it has an indicator to let
you know how much battery you've got
left which is actually pretty cool and
this now features a USB PD so if used to
BC cable that you can use to charge up
your devices but USB PD allows you to
get fast charging with your iPhone's
well the new iPhones so this is actually
really nice huge shout out to occupy
sending this out I am very happy about
this I'll of course have this and
everything else linked down below in the
description so you guys can check it out
if you want so that was the first thing
in here and this fella mouse 2.4
gigahertz wireless mouse interesting I
wonder how much this costs I wonder how
much that power bank cost - interesting
it's a very interesting design I don't
know if this is the first of its kind or
anything but it's very interesting to me
I've never seen it like I've never seen
one that looks like this before I don't
like how it looks I like how it feels
though it feels very comfortable not
crazy about the look but the feel is
good I guess I'll have to see if it's a
worthwhile uses a USB dongle to plug
into your computer house you check it
out this one yeah
interesting this is you you just used up
your pick for the next video all right
so let's get this open so this is for
the both of us huh from the labs of nano
magnetics okay so they sent this to the
both of us let's how do I open okay open
it like this it's this thing okay so we
these this is supposed to be desk art
based on what they're saying here yeah
it looks like you can change up the
shape based on what we're seeing over
here okay we might see who has the
better art we'll probably post some
pictures up on Instagram or something so
this would be fun how do you actually
use it though I guess you got to go
online this is the link of the QR codes
to see a video guide for this man cave
where the creation okay
well we'll have to test this out follow
us on social media we'll post an update
on these once we figure out how to
actually use it I'm actually really
interested in seeing what that's about
all right we've got another thing from
Aki a mini RGB light not on mine some
RGB lights so obviously this is made to
just sit on your desk alright so I can
hit the power button Oh interesting
this includes these magnet discs that
have adhesives on the back so I guess
you can like kind of place this in here
maybe like inside of a closet and then
you kind of just have this sitting there
so I don't know if it does other colors
oh it does okay oh okay it's just blue
okay so this is kind of cool I have to
find some way to put it but cool
nonetheless this is from moment
oh ho all right so these guys what they
basically do is they have these cases
that you they allow you to put on these
different lenses to your phones if you
want to take your smartphone photography
to the next level this is the kind of
stuff you want so cool you've got a
wide-angle lens a Tele lens a super fish
eye lens and a macro lens
what phone cases did they send though so
okay this one I can already tell this is
for the iPhone 10 and this is for the no
eight are this used they have scratches
all over okay oh this one's from
Activision huh I've never actually
spoken with anyone at Activision let's
uh open this up
destiny to Guardian meet ghost oh I've
heard of this so if you guys ever played
the game destiny you got this little
companion called ghost it's like a
little robot that follows you and gives
you help and whatnot so this is actually
supposed to replicate ghosts but in a
helpful in actual helpful way by
integrating Amazon oh nice
this is an actual ghost can I turn it on
please tell me it has power oh I don't
think it has any power just yet so this
thing connects to your Amazon account
you ask command you can ask for your
clan summary all kinds of stuff like
that you can even tell it to equip stuff
like your a best weapon and then it's
supposed to go ahead and do that I
haven't been able to get it to connect
to my account so I can't really use any
of the commands so for now this thing is
just gonna stay here all right but next
look sorry we got another Xbox
controller we we have yours what's this
one so it's a whole nice so this is the
seat of these themed Xbox one controller
let's take a look
that is clearly oh look at this little
gold button is this like a good gold
tooth for a pirate or something
this is awesome Joey I swear Xbox and
Microsoft they make the best hardware
this thing is nuts
oh is this like part this is like partly
see-through do you see this re yo the
attention to detail hold this you can
even see like this thing is engraved
here at that bottom even the joystick is
like a compass yeah I guess if you look
at the treasure or something you use a
compass it's got the north east south
west US awesome my goodness this is a
good looking controller if you're
excited for sea of thieves this is gonna
be worth picking up this this thing was
awesome
this one's from IOT I don't know what
they sent me actually use their car
holder for phones with the wireless
adapter oh okay it looks like they sent
me another one this is probably their
latest version so this is the EZ touch
one Qi wireless fast charging now so
this one has the fast charging built
into it oh okay so this one is a bit
different than this this has a lot of
functionality in terms of moving it
around and it has like this arm but I
think this one is just like a standard
one that you place on your dashboard and
you can just hook up your phone to it
cool I got to see if these are any good
but can you shout out to I Adi for
sending me these to check out huh this
is a new key I 100 wireless earphones so
I don't know I've absolutely never heard
of these guys before okay this comes in
a little case and let's see if he's
looking at you good okay what's all this
the USB cable okay so you know
interesting and interesting all right so
we did a quick Amazon search and this
goes for about thirty six bucks a little
pricey for what the build quality feels
like but I'll give them a shot I'll
listen to them and see if it's worth
mentioning in another video I actually
think this is something that I ordered
but I don't remember what it is to be
honest oh yes I have been waiting for
this my collector's edition of Xenoblade
Chronicles 2 now I'm actually pretty
excited for this because this is like
the first real RPG for the Nintendo
switch oh this is like a steelbook case
whoo so you have the game right here and
this is the actual case that it comes
with so compared to all of these this is
much much cooler oh this is a CD so if
you want to listen to some of the music
you can listen to it on the CD I'll have
a CD player anymore they should just
keep like a thumb drive or something
that holds all the songs and you've got
a booklet so this is the booklet is
probably an art book so you can go
inside and check out all of the designs
and whatnot for all the characters all
right that's it for what you get inside
of the collector's edition let's see
what we've got here
well what are the chances the Xenoblade
Chronicles 2 pro controller nice alright
so we've got the USB type-c cable oh
this is nice ok this is good I like that
the little sword or accent colour that
it has here I think this is for the
sword oh and you can see a sword here on
the right side okay this is awesome I'm
gonna be taking this and that game with
us on Christmas break I'm gonna be
enjoying lies
oh I remember this remember you got this
for me a while back but this is the
Super Nintendo version of the 3ds XL you
know Nintendo is all about that retro
stuff right now
so let's actually take a look at this oh
this looks nice all the colors are
really good yeah you feel like you can
actually mess with that right but you
can't oh I like this a lot of the colors
are ok I like the little purple accents
here so the buttons are like a dark
purple and a light purple and even the
slider for the 3d is purple oh the power
buttons purple as well and you have a
grey stylus this is nice this is
actually a very very clean looking 3ds
now if they sold this without the Super
Nintendo stuff in the front I think it
would make an awesome awesome color so
this looks really good about to add this
to the collection let's open this up oh
they sent me one of these too
nice so this is a player unknown
battlegrounds it actually came out for
the Xbox one already I'm just super
super late so I got a little mask here
this is like one of the stuff that you
can get inside of the game when you
actually play it got a little mask here
what else have we got ammunition yeah it
smells good though right re oh it comes
with a controller nice I've got one of
these this is legit though it comes with
a controller that's awesome oh this is
funny so this is like a little frying
pan because that's one of the weapons in
the game so you can pick up all kinds of
random weapons you get guns and whatnot
so you've got these ammunition here and
you can hit people with frying pans
what's this
oh is this a map so this this game has a
gigantic map
and this is it if you haven't heard of
player unknown battlegrounds you're
gonna want to look into it it's not very
expensive either I don't think so if
you've been curious it's all the rage
right now
to try it out and okay so this is my
code okay so that's everything inside of
here
I'm definitely saving this this is
awesome look and you can even block it
so this is awesome so huge shout out to
Microsoft for sending this out thanks to
Microsoft for something on everything
they sent out alright guys now we're up
to our last product I don't know what
this one is either hopefully we can end
off on a good note any guesses re Oh
what if there's a Gundam no what is this
oh it's a keyboard app interesting so
it's got a bunch of different emojis and
whatnot interesting okay listen my peel
box I guess is open to all kinds of
stuff huh since snacks right a little
shirt a little frisbee of some sorts
like a little disc and we've got a
little plush pillow thing and we have a
poop shades getting my Kanye on alright
so I think that about wraps it up for
this video now you guys I want you to
let me know what you think of me opening
just some of the random stuff that I get
in my peel box so this one was a bit
more random I didn't know what to expect
here with a lot of this stuff you like
it so you guys you know let me know if
you want to see more of this stuff I'll
be sure to include it I don't know if
all these things are worth it now but at
least it'll be on your radar but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one
