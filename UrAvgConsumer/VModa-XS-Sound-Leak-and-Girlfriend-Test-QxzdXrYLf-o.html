your average consumer and this is my
beautiful girlfriend hello and today we
have another sound leak and sound
isolation test aka the girlfriend test
and today we're doing this with the
v-moda XS so let's not waste any time
get right into it alright guys so for
the sounding test we're gonna start
playing music f values of 50% 75% and
then 100% and then we're going to see
how much it leaks from the headphones at
those different volumes so just a double
check to make sure her hair isn't in the
way do have your left on your left on
the right on the right yep oh good
everything should be an order all right
so we're gonna play some music now and
we're gonna start it off at 50% and then
we're gonna see if we can hear it so
here it is that 50% I do hear it a
little bit that's not it's not too bad
though it's very quiet room but I do
hear it a little bit so ready for a 75%
yep alright so now we're gonna play that
75 and all right so here goes 75% mmm I
definitely hear that anymore
I hear that quite a bit more so now
we're gonna do it at 100% are you ready
I am ready okay and everyone I
definitely warned you not to listen to
music at 100% as it's bad for your
hearing so here it is at 100%
Wow
we don't need to do that much longer it
was very loud clearly hear it
so guys overall for the soundly test I
did hear it a bit at 50% and I did hear
it very clearly at 75 and 100% and it
could be because they're on ear
headphones but we did hear it pretty
clearly so it is super silent in here
right yeah so now it's time for the
girlfriend test we'd like to explain
what the girlfriend test is for the new
viewers of course welcome new viewers um
so the girlfriend test is a test to see
if my girlfriend likes things my nagging
my annoying sounds today my singing can
be blocked out by these headphones so
yes today I'm going to be at singing a
very popular song from frozen uh I made
the mistake of introducing just gonna
say that the mistake made the mistake of
introducing that movie to her and man oh
man am i paying for you I have been on
this song for like the last two weeks
constantly singing and I belt it out I'm
not gonna belt out for you guys today
I don't you guys getting jealous of my
wonderful voice but yeah we're gonna say
he can block of that with his headphones
so of course we're gonna start this off
at 50% 75% and then 100% and see how it
doesn't adjust at those different
volumes okay so hair does have 50% and
go do you wanna build a snowman
come on let's go and play I never see
you anymore so it ended the trick guys
fortunately so yeah we're going to try
it at 75% and we're gonna see how that
fares ready mm-hmm
this is really how I feel when he's dead
in his videos so here it is at 75% like
you've gone away we used to be best
buddies and now we're not I wish you
would tell me why you wanna build a
snowman all right
I don't wait to into it so a 75% I heard
her very slightly but I'm going to say
that that's because she is right next to
me she even got a little close so I was
she was all up in my ear haha but this
is it pretty well though I didn't really
hear her until she got really close so
that's actually quite a big difference
between 50% and 75% so you can actually
just bump it up a bit and start
listening and start blocking things out
so of course we're gonna try it out one
100% just for the fun of it all and
let's see how that goes if I can
completely block her out and if you want
to get close again
Halon you can try it do you like it see
if it completely blocks that out alright
so here it is at 100% empty rooms just
watching the hours tick hi
well no surprise is there out my ears is
for a long time
this thing is piercing man who could
really hear the vocals on this um yeah
that's about it so for the sound
isolation test I think I listen to my
music a little bit more than 50% so I
think I'd be fine but I think it did
pretty well but the sound leak test it
did leak quite a bit so I and you know
what I think that that's been a trend
for on-ear headphones on the channel so
yeah I wanna I wanna you know say that
that's why but nonetheless it does leak
bit of quite a bit so and that's about
it for this test but we've got some news
guys we're getting Majesty here anyway
so we're actually bringing your average
couple back to the yuzu I guess yeah
back to YouTube it's been gone for
months yeah and in typical US fashion we
haven't updated that channel for quite
some time but what we're gonna be doing
now but what we're going to be doing now
is actually bringing it to the your
average consumer Channel and we're going
to be releasing those vlogs on Sunday so
great so before you guys get upset we're
gonna see vlogs it's not only gonna be
once a week on the weekends uh if you
don't like them you can just bypass them
and wait for the video to come up on
Monday a difference I got tagged video

vlogs they're coming back they're gonna
be on Sundays try to put it in the day
