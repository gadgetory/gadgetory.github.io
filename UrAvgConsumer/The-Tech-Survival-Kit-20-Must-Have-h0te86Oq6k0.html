it's time we made a few upgrades to my
tech survival kit for those of you who
aren't familiar with the tech survival
kit it's a very inexpensive kit I put
together to help with any tech emergency
first thing you'll notice here is that
we've got a new case - how's everything
and this one is by bag smart and it
offers a bit more flexibility than the
Amazon basics case as it doesn't have a
hard shell which allows it to fit more
easily in a bag or backpack it's got to
strap on the side if you're into that
sort of thing but what I like most about
it is that it's tech focused and well
organized so it's designed to carry a
variety of gadgets and very securely
with the built-in straps everywhere kind
of like a gritty organizer but let's
talk about what's inside first up we've
got this multi connector USB cable by
chiffon and guys this thing's nut it's
got two micro USB a meaning USB which is
actually kind of nice because you won't
find anyone who's carrying that anymore
but it also has a lightning cable and
even a USB type-c cable as long as this
is in your kit all your bases will be
covered and you won't be caught without
a way to charge or connect to most of
today's portable devices while the chip
on cable can connect to almost anything
unfortunately it isn't very long so
we've got this limousine cable from the
first tech survival kit to make up for
that this guy packs micro USB lightning
and USB type-c cable and has a standard
cable length so things like wall
charging won't be an issue and it also
has a medic cable to give it some extra
durability with these two you'll always
be ready to offer a lending hand so
anyone who's looking for a charger
regardless of what home they're using
next up we've got a pair of ear buds
from G chord now ear buds were added to
the tech survival kit in case you've got
your real headphones at home or maybe if
you wanted to listen to something on
your phone you can do that without
disrupting others or maybe if you wanted
to stop others from disrupting you you
got those ear buds at first we used some
amazonbasics earbuds which didn't have
the best sound quality but it was cheap
and it got the job done for lucky enough
the G cords are only a few bucks more
and offer a better build quality so it
should last longer and in
and remote and might and some pretty
decent sound quality for the price so
you could at least enjoy your music
while you're trying to block out that
crying baby in the back you've also got
a basic headphone splitter in here but
those times you want to share what
you're watching or listening to you with
somebody nearby and honestly this kind
of thing is perfect for long plane or
bus ride next up we've got this four
port USB 3.0 hub from anchor which works
well with laptops or tablets with one of
the USB port if you ever find yourself
in a situation where you need to plug in
multiple things to your laptop or tablet
this will definitely come in handy and
trusting and never hurt to have access
to more USB ports with your laptop and
even though we're living in a very
gentle age it also goes in here to have
a pen or pencil nearby and so I've
included a Curatola
mechanical pencil through the use of
some internal gears is able to have auto
rotating lead which allows you to have a
sharp point when writing so you don't
end up with a dull and flat tip over
time it works well it looks really good
so I decided why not
now something you'll notice with this
case is that it has some slot for SD
cards and some other little cards you
may want to carry so in this kit I've
included a micro SD card adapter in case
you use one with your phone or any other
device that uses one as well as a 128
gig SD card if you're a photographer
videographer vlogger you know how much
it sucks to leave the house without an
SD card so it's always great to have a
nice backup right in the survival kit
and while we're on the topic of corage
here I brought back the 64 gigabyte
kingston flash drive from the first kit
this is the tiny flash drive that takes
up very little space but it's often
because it can connect to a standard USB
or even a USB type-c port and sense the
USB type-c is getting so popular it's
nice to have an option that is versatile
and you can work as a replacement to the
micro SD cards but those phones that
don't support having one and since the
world is going in a way of USB type-c I
decided to add some adapter
these are by Aki and if you're a new
MacBook Pro owner you'll definitely be
glad to have some of these
on hand they add little bulk or whatever
you're plugging in and it allows you to
be sure you won't have any issues
connecting to any of today's newer
devices
and honestly one of my favorite things
in this kit there's this microfiber
cross by spider I'm personally a bit
obsessive when it comes to having a
clean phone screen so having something
like this in the kit is an absolute must
and this bugs microfiber cloth is great
because it's larger than the last one
which makes it great for cleaning
laptops or a large tablet screen and as
somebody who loves microfiber cloth as
weird as that may be this is some of the
best quality coffee I've seen in a while
now we've also got the smell concerns
detector that's definitely making a
return to the kit because it's just that
awesome this guy can turn any outlet
into three while also providing two USB
ports so if you're at a library or
somewhere where you don't have access to
a ton of outlets you can still charge up
all your stuff and even share with
someone you may be with with no problem
not to mention listing is flexible you
can turn the plug from a vertical to a
horizontal position with the push of a
button and vice versa and I'm telling
you guys this is a definite must for the
kid and you guys already know and we
can't make a survival kit without a
portable charger and this time around
we're using the 1x1 charger
this thing has 10,000 milliamp hours so
it'll charge your phone multiple times
with no problem whatsoever and with two
USB ports you can share that charging
goodness with a friend too now what I
like about this portable charger is that
it has a screen that tells you exactly
how much juice you've got left you don't
want to pack up a giant portable charger
away into the kit so this it'll let you
know when it's time for read up and I'm
telling you guys that kind of knowledge
is power if you're a dude there so I've
got about wrapped up to the gear in my
new tech survival kit and take my word
for it this is an awesome thing to have
in your backpack or even your car and
like I said before I made sure
everything on this list was pretty
inexpensive so you should have no
problems going to pick up some of this
gear on your own and making your own
survival kit and I got to say I was
supposed to see that tell me if you guys
spent pics of you going to make your own
types of
okay with your own little spin on it
that's awesome shoes out to all of you
but I'll catch you all in the next video
till then it's your average consumer
