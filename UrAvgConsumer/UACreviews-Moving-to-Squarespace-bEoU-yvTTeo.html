consumer and as you can already tell by
the title I'm moving you a see reviews
calm over the square space now I've
brought you a see reviews to the channel
about let's say last summer and I never
really got the ball rolling as i would
have liked with it there are a lot of
bugs on the site a lot of things wrong
actually had a friend build a website
for me and he's been pretty busy with
other projects so I never really got a
chance to get him to dedicate full time
to the site and as some of you may know
you might have tried to register on the
site and all it says is registrations
will be up in July of 2013 I think we
kind of missed that deadline and the
site still says that I haven't been able
to get that changed there's a lot of
stuff that I wanted to do with you a see
reviews calm but I just wasn't able to
do because I didn't have to know how
myself to mess around with a site on you
how to do was make posts I didn't really
know how to fix any of the bugs that
were found on the site so i finally
started working with squarespace and now
i'm going to be moving UAC reviews over
to that platform and i'm pretty excited
guys I'm finally going to be able to
give you guys a functioning website with
all the stuff that I hope to bring to
you before whether it's you know
articles on new things that's happening
in tech maybe some written reviews on
some of the products that you see on the
channel or even just posting up some
interesting things that I've seen
throughout the net so I'm definitely
really excited to have a working version
of UAC reviews com it's under
construction as of right now so it's
going to take some time for me to get it
all perfect and looking just the way I
want but luckily with squarespace dat a
ton of templates that make it really
easy to just jump in and start
customizing your site to make it look
the way you want so I'm really really
excited and I can't wait to get down and
start messing with this thing and when
it comes to websites guys I'm just like
everyone else I don't know anything
about coding HTML
as web server hosting all that stuff I
have no idea what that is these are just
things that I've heard my friends say
when he told me about the site and all
the stuff that he does I would typically
just pay someone to do this stuff for me
but Squarespace makes it really easy to
jump on and start customizing already
built out templates so I'm really
excited to kind of take the reins on
this kind of thing and start bringing
you a see reviews back to you guys so
hopefully I'm gonna be able to get it to
the point that I wanted to get it before
when I first initially announced that I
was going to have the site so i wanted
to let you guys know that it's finally
going to be up and running soon
hopefully I'm gonna be working on it
really hard throughout the week and
trying to get it up maybe I don't know
I'm not going to give an ETA just yet
but I'm really working on and I'll let
you guys know when its up and finished
and you guys can run over and start
messing with it now what I want to know
from you guys is what kind of content do
you want to see on UAC reviews of course
I'm going to have my YouTube stuff there
as well as interesting things that I see
going on in tech so you'll see posts
about that as well and also i'll be
featuring some items that I think you
guys should look into there are really
cool pieces of technology but if there's
anything else that you guys want to see
that youtube might not be the best place
for let me know and i'll try to see if i
can get that to be something that's
going to be on the site so let me know
what you guys think down in the comments
below and also if any of you are already
using Squarespace feel free to leave me
tips because like I said I'm new to this
whole website building thing I'm not
sure all the ins and outs of it just yet
i'm still learning still checking out
Squarespace but I'm loving how easy it
is but if you guys can share some tips
with me I would greatly appreciate it
and if you're like me and you want to
build a website but you don't have to
know how or don't know someone who can
build one for you you should try out
squarespace com and take the journey
with me you can actually go to ww
airspace calm / your average consumer
and actually use the coupon code
consumer and save ten percent off so we
can take this Squarespace journey
together I'd be pretty interested in
seeing some of the websites you guys
bring up whether it's for a business or
for personal views or a blog whatever
i'd be interested in seeing what kind of
psyched you guys come out with so
hopefully you guys have some
tips or have some suggestions as for
what you want to see on UAC reviews calm
and I'm just really really excited to
finally have this come to fruition into
a functioning website I can't wait till
it's finally done and up and i'll be
sharing that with you guys as soon as i
get it finished and that's about it for
this video guys i just wanted to update
some of you who've been asking me what's
going on USC reviews.com especially
those of you whose been trying to
register and you get that stupid message
that says it's going to be up in July
2013 but hopefully you guys have some
suggestions for me and some tips and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
till then it's your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
