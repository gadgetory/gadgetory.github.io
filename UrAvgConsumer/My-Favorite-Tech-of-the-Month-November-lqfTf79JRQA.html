going on guys it's your average consumer
and today we're gonna be taking a look
at my favorite tech of the month for the
month of November and for those of you
who have never seen one of my favorite
tech of the month videos we're pretty
much gonna be looking at tech that I've
been personally using for the past month
whether it's old or new but before we
actually get started got a quick message
from our sponsors over at Intel and
right here guys we have the Lenovo
ThinkPad t4 ATS and if your company or
workplace is serious about efficiencies
then they're gonna want to upgrade to a
machine like this that has the new v pro
processor there are tons of Windows 10
apps that can help you out work but they
require more processing power for faster
computing to take full advantage of them
with the v pro processor you get exactly
that as well as better options for
security IT departments are definitely
gonna be thrilled with more folks
running updated hardware since it means
it's going to be easier to run
applications as well as help
troubleshooting so if you guys are
running around with a really old work
laptop this is something you definitely
got to consider and I'll of course have
links down below in the description so
you guys can learn more about Intel vPro
processor and what hardware you guys
should be upgrading your systems to so
you can get on Windows 10 and have a
very smooth experience at work but now
let's talk about my favorite tag so
first up is something I'm actually
really excited about these are the
surface headphones now these are really
cool bluetooth headphones that have a
lot of cool features and a pretty
interesting design so first up if you
just take a look at these it looks like
some marshmallows they're actually
really comfortable they've got that
surface book gray going for it so it
really matches well with you know the
surface products is what you come to
expect but these marshmallows though
these things feel really nice guys lots
of comfort but what makes these things
special not only do they sound good but
they've got some interesting features so
on each ear cup they have a dial on the
right ear cup this one controls the
volume so whenever you're listening to
your music you can just control the
volume or a video whatever audio it may
be control it right here and on the left
side over here you can actually control
the active noise-cancelling or the
ambient sound so with this dial if you
want you can turn it all the way down
and that allows you to hear more of
what's in your surroundings so let's say
someone's talking you you can hear them
very clearly and when you want to turn
the active noise-cancelling up you just
turned it all the way up and you have
completely wiped out everything around
you what's also nice is that each ear
cup has a touch panel on the side so
right here you can control your audio
one tap will play and pause your music
double tap to skip to the next song and
triple tap to go back so just like any
inline remote those are the same
controls but what's nice and unique
about these headphones is that each ear
cup has this touch panel and what's
awesome about these headphones is that
you can connect them with up to ten
different devices and it has a swift
pairing mode with other surface products
like the surface studio or maybe the
surface book so if you have that family
of products that's thinking pair pretty
quickly and easily with those but being
able to pair with 10 devices guys that's
crazy
I've been really enjoying my time with
these and I'm gonna have a full in-depth
video about this so you can learn all
the ins and outs of it all the good in
the bad but as of right now guys I
really really like it so for Microsoft
very first headphones I think they did a
pretty good job but more than that in
the future video and what we've got
right here guys is the Google home hub
and you might have seen my video with
the Google home hub versus the Amazon
echo show too but the Google home hub
has really got my attention for it a
nice compact small device like this I
think it does a really good job at
providing information on a little small
display and it gives you access to a lot
of controls especially if you wanna hook
up a smart home and that is something
that I clearly want to do so it is nice
to have all of these controls here take
a look at this guys I can view my rooms
and I can access all of the lights and
cameras everything that I have inside
here the speaker's all controllable
right from this one display and not only
that I can see my calendar I can see the
weather there's just lots of information
that you can get here at a glance but of
course it's a voice assistant so I can
call out to Google and say what's the
next thing on my calendar
sorry I can't find anything on your
calendar for them I'm doing nothing
folks but those are the kind of things
that you can ask it I can ask her to set
a reminder I can ask her to pull up your
average consumer videos there's all
kinds of things that you can do with
this and I've actually really been
enjoying it and the sound quality's
actually not that bad considering it's a
small device now it doesn't hold a
candle to the echo show too but that
thing is a behemoth for me I really like
this because in a kitchen like this
where I know Aries not gonna let me go
nuts nuts I'm gonna have to be as
inconspicuous as I can with the
technology that I put inside of here so
this is something that I've really been
considering since it takes up like no
space and it kind of fits with the whole
look here and alright guys it has been
way too long since I talked about
portable chargers so we got some really
cool stuff over here from the guys over
at nimble now they sent over a few
things back in a massive tech unboxing I
forget which one we've done so many but
they sent over a huge package with all
the cool things that they make and I
really really like what these guys do
first off kudos to them for being a very
eco friendly tech company but these
portable charges though these are so
cool because they have a few USB ports
and by that I mean four which is just
unheard of but you get three regular USB
type a ports a one actually has quick
charge 3.0 and you also get a USB type-c
port and why this is cool is because it
has USB PD which is what you need to
fast charge devices like the iPhone and
what I really like about them is that
you have that ability with a portable
charger this small usually you have
those big power bricks to do something
like that but you have a really compact
body here this one right here is 13,000
milliamp hours and they have an even
smaller one which is about 10,000
milliamp hours so if you want something
even smaller and more inconspicuous you
can kind of just put away that one's a
nice option too but if you want a really
large one you can get something like
this that has 26,000 milliamp hours I
think it's almost 27,000 million
powers which is insane this thing will
charge your devices over and over and
over and over again I like these
the quality is amazing I like that it
has this nice rubberized design up top
as well kind of makes it easier to grip
but not only that they've got these cool
little magnets at the bottom of it and
check this out I can grab one of these
so these are also included and what you
do is you just strap this onto here and
the USB cable that you're probably gonna
use the most you can just throw onto it
and just tie it up you can do that I'm
fumbling right now but you get the idea
but in all seriousness guys you can just
just put it here and then snap it in
place and it just makes it easier to
have a little cable management so you
know exactly where the cable that you're
going to be using is and you just take
it around with you I think that is
really cool and something we don't
really see with portable chargers and
they make other cool things as well over
here we have wireless charging pads so
this guy is actually a long one which
can charge two devices at the same time
so that's always cool Apple is never
gonna come out with their what is it air
power device so you got this as an
option it also uses USB type-c this guy
right here is a regular wireless
charging stand so you can put your
device here and kind of just kick out
the stand and boom your charging your
device and something else that they've
got is this cool wall adapter which
allows for two USB ports you just kind
of plug this in and then it's got a nice
way of hiding those cables keeping them
from breaking off or anything by
shielding them in here a little cool
design I like it but they just seem like
a cool company so I wanted to feature
them in this video since I've been using
them since I got them in the massive
tech unboxing I'll have them linked down
below in the description as well as
everything else I mentioned in this
video but hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video I don't have a huge list of
products here but these are the ones
that I've been using that you guys don't
know about yet so I just want to let you
guys know but till the next one guys did
your average consumer base let me know
what your favorite piece of tech was for
this past month in the comment section
