consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day into life with the
Oppo find X now if you've never seen one
of my real being the live videos you're
pretty much gonna be spending a full day
with me and the find X and we're gonna
see how it performs the battery life
we're gonna put it through its paces and
of course we got to see how that new
flip up camera works but let's check out
how it did alright guys so we are
starting our day with the Apple find X
and I will just say this is one of the
most beautiful phones to come out if not
the most beautiful phone to come out in
my honest opinion but we're starting off
our day is 1052 right now I've been
using a teeny teeny bit we've got about
96 percent left off battery and we're
gonna talk about this thing and see how
it lasts all day all that good stuff but
one thing I'm gonna start off the video
saying this is a very very scary phone
to use because it's super thin and it is
super slippery probably the most
slippery phone I've ever used so I'm a
little worried about today it scares me
to the point where I feel like daily
usage puts this thing at risk without a
case I mean look at this thing guys I
think this is easily the most beautiful
phone I'll probably even ever made in my
opinion this thing is just amazing to
look at and in that screen the screen is
really nice let me see if I can unlock
it and y'all saw that y'all saw the
camera pop up but it's a tall display
screen it's got the tiniest of bezels at
the bottom but this thing just looks so
so so good it's missing a few things
though with a body like this you would
think it would have wireless charging
but it doesn't so that kind of sucks and
waterproofing you know is not gonna
happen because that camera check this
out in a way to waterproof that folks
and now guys we are actually about to
head out and go and check out a
potential with a top secret potential
news studio space maybe we might move
the office got a couple of new people on
board so we're gonna see what that's
like but I'll make sure to grab some
pictures with the fine decks
alright guys so right now we've got the
GPS going but the slipperiness of this
phone is actually coming into play right
now because this holder that I'm using
it has no bottom to secure it so just
using the sides in the clamping grip but
it is slipping right through I can see
the phone sliding downward so I'm gonna
have to switch over to the ayat that I
typically use because this has like the
bottom to hold it I really didn't think
that the slipperiness would come into
play this much but it is but just to
give you guys a quick battery update
we're looking at 86%
we still got 18 minutes of driving left
to do so I'll let you guys know what the
update is after that alright guys so we
just got to our destination and in terms
of battery we're looking at 82% and
let's see if I can pull up some stats
here am I not gonna be able to see the
screen on time oh you know these you
eyes have different settings so I don't
know if I'll be able to see screen on
time okay and we have a wild cookie over
here it's crazy but I'm gonna keep
looking for this setting but I gotta
jump into this meeting with the new spot
okay guys so we wrapped up the meeting
check that a potential new space for the
studio and I did take a lot of video and
photos and for those of you who aren't
familiar with the Oppo find X the camera
has a really cool pop-out feature there
so when you want to use the camera
you'll notice that there's none on the
back until you hit the camera app and
then you'll see a pop right up so that's
a really awesome feature with aqua find
X that's what helps it to look really
futuristic and I really like it
now the concern that I have with this
when I was shooting everything I would
hold the phone like this and I would
feel this slightest wiggle I don't know
if you guys can see that here but I
would feel this thing wiggle so that's
something you got to keep in mind if
you're looking for really stable photos
you can actually physically move the
camera so you're not only worrying about
keeping it straight here but you're also
keeping it here and what I also notice
is I'm not sure if this has image
stabilization optical image
stabilization but it felt like my videos
were shaking quite a bit
so I'm going to see right now how it
looks on camera so this doesn't look as
bad as I thought it did so that is a
really good thing but I'm not sure I'll
put Judd says right here so you guys can
know if a desert doesn't but I was a bit
concerned when I saw the actual video
being shot it looked like it was jumpy
so I thought there was no stabilization
but with all of that shooting we do have
74 percent battery left and it is what
2:24 so not bad it's been holding up
pretty well we've been using it since
what 10:00 in the morning so that's
actually pretty good battery life this
has it 37 hundred million power battery
I think it's thirty seven thirty so it's
on the higher end not quite 4,000 but
it's up there alright so we're back home
but while we're on the topic of cameras
cookie come here she just got groomed
check her out
cookie say what's up if I yeah alright
so come here let's take a picture
alright sit yeah good girl okay so we
got a couple of pictures let's take a
look at them it's not a bad photo a
little bit overexposed up top the most
part it's not bad though not super sharp
or anything but it'll get the job done
not the best camera I've seen out there
but you know definitely gets the job
done so in terms of camera quality this
thing definitely gets a pass takes good
shots not the best that I've seen out
there and doesn't compete with something
like the note 9 or the pixel XL but
definitely does get the job done so
we're back in the studio I know we've
been jumping around a lot but we're back
here we have to get some work done still
but I was just sitting here looking to
see if I can find the screen on time for
the offal find X so the color OS skin it
doesn't have screen on time so I can't
tell you guys that but more importantly
I know I'm being a dead horse here but
I'd like you to just take a look at this
phone right now do you guys see that
it's moving by itself the things started
off over here on this side of the
mousepad so it found its way over here
and this is not the first time this has
happened I've had it on the coffee table
that I have over here just randomly here
a slip-and-fall
I'm like oh why is it on the floor
it's so slippery guys so if you pick up
this phone or plan to pick it up the
slipperiness is it's it's a big deal you
got it throw the case on this guy
because the glass back to that thing has
this didn't were to fall this way and
hit the floor who knows what would
happen so you got to be really mindful
of that look at this it's just moving on
its own so it's about 1017 we've got a
43% battery left and I'll be honest the
later half of the day I spent doing a
lot of work so I wasn't really on the
phone that much but so we still got a
good amount of battery left so if you're
not a heavy user someone who's not going
to be on their phone 24/7 you have an
idea of just how much battery you have
left then this is with taking photos
running around doing all kinds of stuff
using the GPS so they'll get bit of
usage here I wish I could tell you guys
to screen on time but this thing doesn't
measure it but so far the battery life
has been really solid but there are a
couple of things I want to talk about in
terms of the overall UI now I'm not a
fan of this color OS I do wish that it
had a bit more flexibility
one thing that I'm seeing here that you
can't access is you can't even change
the wallpaper right from the screen this
is like basic Android right here where
you can hold down the home screen and
you get to change up the wallpaper add
widgets all that kind of stuff you just
can't do that here if I go into
something like Nova Launcher you see
that kind of flexibility right there so
I can add wallpapers widgets all that
kind of stuff but you're not even able
to change the default launcher which is
really frustrating so you're pretty much
stuck with what they give you and man
it's just super disappointing so if you
want to go ahead and change your
wallpaper you have to go into something
like your Photos app hit set as and then
do it from there
and that's just a little too much for my
book I just wish it were a bit easier I
don't know just really weird roadblocks
there overall though the skin isn't that
bad it's pretty standard stuff going
into the settings it's ok but you guys
have seen throughout the day that just
certain things you can't act
at a win which I find pretty unfortunate
and guys check this out something else
I've been noticing and I don't know if
it's going to show up well on camera is
if you tilt the phone you can see a big
shift in terms of the color it
definitely goes super warm or to this
like pinkish color
whenever you tilt it back now people
used to complain about this on the
pixels the pixel XL the pixel 2xl and I
didn't really see a big deal with that
another since it wasn't noticeable to me
unless people spoke about it but this
one as soon as I got this in hand the
second i toted it I noticed immediately
that shift that magenta shift which just
I don't think is OK at the price range
that this thing comes in so if you're
sensitive to that that shift in color
you'll definitely notice it here
especially on anything with a white
background so that's something to keep
in mind as well did I mention this phone
is pretty though
look at this thing and that was pretty
much the day guys now I'll say this
again and again this is probably the
most beautiful phone that I've ever seen
in terms of the design and the concept I
am absolutely in love with this phone
and that motorized pop-up camera is
really really cool I think it's an
ingenious way of hiding that and also
allowing us to have a full screen
display and it's really just a cool
party trick to show someone who's never
seen a phone like this before how the
camera pops out it's really really
awesome but it does have its faults
within my first day of using it I had a
ton of dust and lint rolled up inside of
there so that's going to accumulate over
time as you keep your phone in your
pocket or anything like that so you are
gonna have to be vigilant and wiping it
off and making sure it's base clean and
the only other gripe I have with this
pop-out camera is that it is a little
shaky so if you're someone who tends to
hold the corners of your phone when
taking a picture there is a chance that
you might shake the camera and that
could result in a blurry shot or even
some shake in your footage if you're
recording a video but the phone does
have optical image stabilization which
should help but being able to save the
camera like that does introduce another
element that could ruin your footage or
shops still though I will say guys
I love the innovation here this is just
an amazing concept I love the phone and
it's more than just a concept it's a
factual phone you can actually go out
and buy it but I'll be honest with you
guys I don't think it's ready from
mainstream just yet performance-wise it
performs just as well as any other phone
that you have out right now
it's got flagship specs great battery
life it lasted me even longer than the
day that I was using it so it spilled
over into two days with moderate usage
but it's still just not completely
perfect even though it performs really
well like you guys saw throughout the
entire day I was dealing with how
slippery it was this is a phone that
absolutely needs a case I don't care who
you are and how careful you are this
phone needs a case if you don't want to
babysit at 24/7 now when it comes to the
software it is running Android but it's
using the color OS skin that's apples
skin I got to say I'm not really too
crazy about this
it seems they lock you out of a lot of
things that should just be normal being
able to change the wallpaper right from
the home screen you kind of lose that
functionality unless you go into certain
settings or you go into your Photos app
not crazy about that at all I don't know
why they would even take that away but
it just kind of sucks that you got to go
do this roundabout things just to do
something that's the most basic part of
Android they also don't allow you to use
different launchers so if you like Nova
Launcher or maybe even the Google
launcher you're not gonna be able to
just switch it out you have to use the
launcher that it comes with and to me
that's that sucks because I feel like a
lot of issues that I had with the
software would be okay if I at least
could use a different launcher so the
fact that they took that away is just
mind-boggling
so I do hope that they fix that with a
future update or something but that
functionality should definitely be there
and not lock the way now when it comes
to the camera quality I definitely think
that it takes some decent photos
definitely nothing mind-blowing not to
me anyway the front facing camera tend
to overexpose a lot of the shots that I
took with it so a lot of the selfies
that I took it came out a bit
overexposed but the rear camera
definitely got some nice shots out of it
it's what I used to take all the shots
of this new space that I'm checking out
and those came out very nice and clear
its overall I definitely think this
thing has got a decent camera and one
thing that's pretty cool is that the
camera has a
built into it so that when you pick take
a picture of something it'll identify it
so if you're taking a picture of an
indoor location like I was it actually
says it right on the screen if you're
taking a picture of a pet or something
it'll do the same so that's actually a
pretty cool feature how much these AI
features usually benefit these phones
honestly don't know but they say it does
help and it's actually able to identify
what it takes a picture of so that's
good but I pretty much gave you guys
what I think of the phone overall like I
said I do think that it is a very
innovative phone it is the best-looking
phone that I've ever seen but it does
have its quirks I don't think the
motorized system is completely perfect
just yet I wish you were a bit more
rigid and didn't shake or move whenever
you kind of held it also the dust that
gets around that area not that good
definitely don't want dust around your
camera lens so that's something that
also needs to be worked on maybe like a
better seal I also wish this thing had
wireless charging you would think with
that kind of back that it would be able
to do it but that's also a feature
that's missing don't even think about
water resistance because with this
design it's not possible and while it's
got that beautiful beautiful screen that
content looks so good on it's got that
weird color shift that happens where it
gets really pink like I said never used
to be an issue for me wasn't even an
issue with the pixel but for this phone
it's actually pretty drastic and it
happens really quickly and guys I really
don't want it to seem like I'm just
crapping all over this phone because I
honestly love this phone I love the way
it looks I love everything about it but
like I said it still has its quirks and
that's why I don't think it's ready for
mainstream but if they can fix some of
those issues I think this can be a
really killer phone
honestly like I said it is the
best-looking phone I've ever seen so far
the cool functionality that you get out
of that pop-up screen I just I love
everything about it I just wish the
actual hardware just worked a little bit
better but that about wraps it up for
this video guys the Apple 5x is the
coolest phone out so far at least in my
opinion I just wish that certain things
were a bit better on it so that everyday
people could enjoy it but hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video if you did be
the cool girl that give this video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
Oppo find x2 or whatever you're gonna
call it
just fix those issues and you got a
killer phone a really killer problem
