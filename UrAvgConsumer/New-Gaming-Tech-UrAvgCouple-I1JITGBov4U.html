so I'm so sad always on the phone oh so
right now we're in best bye I am trying
to get my hands on a few gaming headsets
because I want to test them out and make
some videos on them so these are the
options right here I definitely think I
want to grab this guy in turtlebeach
elite 800 I want to get the Astro a 50s
I know that a 40s are pretty popular as
well so I'm planning on getting just a
bunch so I can work on a couple of
gaming headset video if you guys are
interested in that let me know if you
have any suggestions because there are
tons of gaming headsets out there let me
know which ones are the best which ones
you use that you like so I can start
looking into those a lot of you guys
gave me some suggestions on Twitter but
the more the merrier so I could do some
thorough researching so you guys could
get a bit of an idea of what's going on
inside my head as I try to pick one of
these headsets to bring to the channel
right now is difficult because the Xbox
one has a funky controller and you can't
just use regular wireless headsets for
them you gotta have a special one that's
why a lot of them are designed for the
Xbox one as you can see here while all
the other ones will work for like
multiple systems whether it's ps4 ps3
and mobile so Xbox Microsoft has to go
and make it
but now the new Xbox one controllers
have a 3.5 millimeter jack so you can
plug a headset into that but you won't
be able to be completely wireless you
have to use a cord so I'm reviewers
dilemma but that's what I'm going
through right now so I was looking at
these you pretty interesting has glowing
lights on the sides but this is a bad
thing to showcase I don't know the brand
but this makes me not want to look into
it justise best buy your display lost
your sale I think I've decided on a
couple of headsets I'm gonna get try
some of these guys out but there's still
a couple more that I'm gonna get my
hands on so you guys will see that once
I pick them up on a pedigreed people
dogs what's his name also cute
so as usual Jenna's finished but
definitely he's done because he went to
be register and pain and is carrying
tons of bags but he still wants to walk
around and give him spiration this is
what we're doing instead we're walking
around listen I might be inspired
like this before having I'm gonna side
the biggest side in the world like he
does some you were shopping I got candy
stomping I'll be occupied for the next
five minutes
what he doing
so I'm trying to open jet stage making
the person people say hey there we go
through the problem with this is not
promoter excited about you but you know
windows tunnel he just spoke Spanish I
don't Windows 10 what kind of tech wise
will you be okay
I'm making a tower will you Cheryl oh my
so greedy they're gonna be all gone now
yeah where are you pointing oh I don't
know that's it you're done alright guys
so you guys to all the shopping Jen did
and now look at him knocked out
definition of shop till you drop if you
follow me on instagram you probably have
that picture already on instagram so if
you don't follow me go and see the
picture it's funny
he definitely knocked out he's so
you saw all the stuff that I got from
Best Buy I got some more stuff from B&amp;amp;H
and I still got some more coming in but
I just got a bunch of gamer tech so here
it is you guys know that I got the Astro
a 50s and the Turtle Beach elite 800 X
you guys saw my whole thing about you
know Xbox one headset versus regular ps4
headsets but either way all of this is
what I got and I've still got some more
coming in I think I got like two more
headsets coming in but I've got quite a
bit I want to test a full range of them
I've got some from Asus razor I've got
my pulse wireless headset again because
I love the first one so much
look it's not completely broken but I
wanted to get a another one just in case
it goes all the way I've got some stuff
from Logitech and some of these are PC
headsets but I'm going to be trying a
full range of them just so I can make
sure I know which ones are the best got
one from Triton and I even got my hands
on some racing wheels because me and the
girls are going to be playing some Mario
Kart 8 so we wanted the full experience
so we got some racing wheels but yeah
this is the Xbox one controller that I'm
hoping will make a lot of this stuff
possible because with this it comes with
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
just like the PlayStation 4's controller
I don't know why they didn't do this in
the first place but we'll see
this is a must but yeah guys that's all
the headsets that I have in right now
I've got more coming in so I'm going to
be doing my research I'm going to be
trying to find some of the best gaming
headsets you can buy a couple of
different price ranges good question
what price range would you guys want to
see these gaming headsets in some people
will take it more seriously we'll be
willing to spend a bit more those who
aren't probably one spend less I want to
know what how much are you willing to
spend on a gaming headset definitely let
me know down in the comments below just
so I can have an idea of what I should
be shopping around in so I can give you
guys my opinions on those ranges but
guys some of these headsets look freakin
amazing
look at these designs they're nuts but
you probably would look really silly
going outside with any of these but they
look cool for indoors oh yeah I forgot
to mention I got this cool mousepad from
a course here this is actually similar
to the one that I have here but I like
the design a bit better and it's a bit
thicker so should have a little bit more
durability these are pretty flimsy so I
got this guy not expensive either like
16 bucks you know what why not unbox one
of these guys I think I'll take out the
razor timet how about that mine as well
if I'm showing you guys all this stuff
might as well unbox them right so let's
unbox this guy guy keep catching my
attention anyway alright guys so this is
gonna be a quick little unboxing I got
the camera up on a monopod so let's get
this going oh so I might not even need
my little unboxing knife let's see just
pull this little sticker up screw it
right boom and boom so here's the box
alright so let's open this up and boom
some nice presentation here I must say
so this is it this is the headset it's
got an amp a mix amp right here so let's
put this out man these headsets are huge
so let's see if we can pull this out
okay I'll strap in okay take camp out
there we are all right so here we have
it this is the laser TM it 7.1 surround
sound man look at this does something
check this out guys this thing looks
nuts so these are all the drivers inside
so these are the little speakers that
deliver sound now typically depending on
the headphone there's usually one inside
of the ear cup on each side but this one
has five I believe so that's ten
different drivers that's going to
deliver some insane surround sound
hopefully so this is gonna be pretty
crazy I am amazed I love to see through
design Wow razor good job and with
something like this you can control all
the sounds that you're getting from your
headset so you can control quite a bit
lots of dials here buttons so it's
pretty interesting I've never used a
gaming headset with one of these before
so it's going to be a first for me now
like I said this is a PC gaming headset
but I'm going to try it out with all
different systems see what I can make it
work with and here it is look look at
all these cables guys this is how you
know you're into some serious stuff this
is insane I took this little girl out
her name is cookie we just got her a
couple of days ago this is her debut
she's actually going to the groomers now
these girls are about to take her but
this is her welcome her your average
Yorkie she's actually has an Instagram
page as well she's only four months old
aw over general does hair in her
face so she's gonna get groomed up so
follow her on your average Yorkie and
she'll be interacting with you guys that
this wants me so we'll catch you guys in
the next one this is just her a little
debut yeah my place don't think we're
crazy
we're just a little
we are those people who have an
Instagram for their doggies but it's fun
whatever there are lots of accounts like
that okay so then later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
