so as you guys know I've been playing a
ton of Xbox lately thanks to Apex
legends and the team and I had a little
fun thinking about what a chill setup
would look like and here's what we came
up with now this isn't a permanent set
up in the ultimate gamers paradise we
took bits and pieces from other setups
to just have some fun and to create a
vibe that was calm and relaxing and
would be the type of spot where you just
want to kick back and relax so the TV
stand we found was perfect it had a
built-in electric fireplace and that
surprisingly isn't just for show it
actually gives off heat and it features
some LEDs to really showcase things that
are on the shelves like a bunch of the
different Xbox one controllers we've got
here on top of the stand we have a 65
inch samsung q 9 4k TV and I've had this
TV for a couple of months and man I love
it when people were complaining about
that dark Game of Thrones episode I
couldn't really relate because the
brightness and image quality of this guy
is so good and it's much better than the
TV we had in our old studio
but this TV actually lives in my living
room at my house and area and I just
love it it's connected to the Samsung
smartthings platform so you can control
it with your smartphone if you ever lose
the remote and it'll even give you
alerts to other things that connect with
Samsung smartthings like the smart
kitchen appliances they make and even
things like the ring doorbell like I
mentioned before it's 4k and it has HDR
and has great image quality and it's
gonna be in my full Smart Home Tour
video and I'll explain a bit more in
that video why it lives in my living
room and Samsung if you're listening
only my firstborn baby after you if you
send that 8k my way just sayin but with
good visuals you know you need some good
audio and when gaming you're gonna need
a dope headset especially if you're
playing a first-person shooter like apex
legends so right here we've got the
SteelSeries artist 9x and they are crazy
good I featured the Arctic pearl
Wireless last year and one of my ps4
videos and now they finally got
something of similar quality but for the
Xbox one but it has a cheaper price tag
now what makes this headset special
though is that it connects directly to
the Xbox like a controller would which
means no need for special docks or
anything
since it connects directly to the Xbox
you don't have to worry about this thing
having any kind of faulty connection and
for the PC master-race out there you can
use them too by connecting over
bluetooth as well as any other device
but I definitely recommend just grabbing
an Xbox wireless controller adapter so
that you can get better connection and
better my quality but on top of that
since this thing has bluetooth you can
be connected to your Xbox and something
like your phone at the same time so
while you're gaming you can answer calls
listen to music or even chat on discord
while you're still hearing your game
audio shout-out to the discord fan link
to our server down below and this
headset is rated for about 20 hours of
battery life and I don't play games
straight for that long anymore so that's
more than I'll ever need now the sound
quality is dope it's not superb AC but
definitely clear enough to hear
everything going on around you so at 200
bucks this is a premium headset but if
you take gaming seriously and could use
the flexibility of these working as a
gaming headset and a normal pair of
headphones thanks to the Bluetooth
they're worth checking out I'll of
course have links down below in the
description for you guys to learn more
and on the other side of the TV we've
got the Xbox one X sitting on this
insignia of vertical USB stand where
this thing will actually get you four
more USB ports on your Xbox one so if
you've got a lot of devices or
accessories you want to charge up you
can have them all connected with these
four extra ports now something else
we've got connected to the Xbox is this
power a charging stand for the Xbox one
controller now this right here is a must
guys you got a cool charging stand with
these nice LEDs around it to let you
know when it's charging and when you're
done playing all you have to do is drop
your controller right into it and it
charges it up ready for your next
session now what's great about this
thing is that cost less than 20 bucks
and comes with a rechargeable battery
for your controller if you don't have
rechargeable batteries already guys it
is a must have for any Xbox player I
really like it I think it looks cool I
only wish that the USB cable was a bit
longer so that you don't have to have it
so close to the Xbox and we do have
another little twenty dollar accessory
this is the Talon media remote for the
Xbox now this guy pretty much gives you
all the controls that you would get from
your
standard controller but in a regular
remote-control form factor now I like
this because it gives you access to a
ton of buttons if you have your Xbox
connected to your cable or something
it'll give you access to all of that you
can of course go through your TV Guide
with it change channels since you have
the number pad at the bottom it's a
really convenient controller and if you
happen to have guests over that aren't
familiar with like using xbox
controllers this remote will make it a
lot easier for them and I gotta say this
is probably the best Xbox remote control
that I've used so far and as you guys
can see this is modeled after your
typical living room setup with the TV
stand the sofa but here we have a coffee
table that just blows every other coffee
table out of the water this right here
is the sober Oh coffee table and this
thing has an insane amount of features
first of all it's an awesome coffee
table but what's really dope about it is
that it has a built-in refrigerator so
once you open up this guy you'll see you
have access to a pretty big fridge where
you can store some drinks of course you
guys know we've got this stocked up
ready to go whenever we want to have
some xbox action and on the right side
you also get two drawers where you can
put things like remotes but we of course
have snacks and snacks on deck now while
this thing is great for storing food and
drinks you also get a touch panel at the
top where you can access all the cool
smart features so not only does this
thing have a built-in fridge but it also
has a built-in Bluetooth speaker so if
you want to connect something like your
smartphone or whatever has Bluetooth you
can play music right from the coffee
table you can also change up the fridge
settings this thing has LEDs built
around it so you can change the color
their their RGB so you have multiple
colors to choose from just being an Xbox
setup you know we went with green this
is crazy what this coffee table can do
but I will say though this thing is not
cheap but the features are awesome but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it hopefully
this gave you an idea of all of the cool
things that went into this Xbox set up
if you guys are interested in the tech
and the furniture that we've used to lay
this place out of course have links down
below in a description so you guys can
kind of get some ideas for yourself
hopefully you enjoyed it and if you did
be the cool guy or girl like this
revealed
I'm gonna catch you guys in the next one
so then it's your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
