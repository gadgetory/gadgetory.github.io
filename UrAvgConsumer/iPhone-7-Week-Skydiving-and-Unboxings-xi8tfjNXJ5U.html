since the last vlog but I figured no
better time to start them up again then
with iPhone relief so of course I'm out
here in LA you know I'm going to meet up
with the guys John Austin marques team
Chris B and a couple of other youtubers
as well and we're going to you know pump
out iPhone videos you guys are going to
see a ton on the channel but right now
I'm actually staying at the highest I
reached out to me because they knew I'd
be coming out here so they decided to
let me cash in their spot so that I can
I have a nice location to get some of my
work done so I'm going to show you guys
how to set up in the room Aries already
up there but what I'm really digging
right now is that this place has some
nice shooting locations check this out
they've got a little waterfall I think
I'm gonna do something with the iPhone
here since it's water-resistant
definitely a nice nice shooting location
gonna do that and if we got this cool
little wall over here it's like the
lobby area so I'm going to be turning
their Lobby into a shooting spot but
this looks good I'm sure this is gonna
just look great on camera
alright so here's the room that we've
got so you guys can get an idea of kind
of the setup that I've got going on to
get some video work done here it is it's
got a nice cool little desk area so that
I can you know just get settled and do
my stuff so I've got my MacBook Pro here
another g6o - got the Bose qc3 fives
over there so this is my little setup of
course I've got the fs7 and all the rest
of my camera gear right here so you know
this is what I'm getting work done Aires
over here hello Ari I'll tell you say hi
to the vlog but this is the gadget
backpack that I've been actually walking
around with for a bit I've been testing
this guy out been using it for a while
and I'm loving it so far but if you guys
want to see a video on that you let me
know it comment down below but yeah this
is the UH
but this is it I mean you know pretty
good with your room you know but yeah
guys this is it it's a pretty solid room
we're comfortable
we're gonna get even more comfortable
once we get all unpacked
but I'm height this is the way you do
iphone7 week yeah right back in the day
well last year we did an iPhone coverage
he all right you say awesome it has a
crash Austin so now you got this based a
sauce you have your own spot you can be
real comfortable yeah get all my video
work to be here yeah yeah yeah magic
both of us camping out at Austin's
Austin can be like your average couple
in please honestly I'm just excited that
they have an awesome Lobby because I'm
gonna get some shots down there it's
gonna make it into the video and I'm
just happy that there's another bet
because I can just be a little back all
right guys we're at the Apple Store are
almost there
that was the worst uber ride ever so
slow even in the ho Blaine he was like
crawling
and of course look we've got here two
youtubers and BB yeah your old time is
still good
alright Matt with the world season I
wish you're not gonna box it my old sim
still works you know come on Matt you
heiped us up for no reason
do you definitely gen-y Apple switched
up their design they're blue
so thankfully we're still waiting we
weren't that late so sorry
but this guy we don't let me to
everybody he's got his iPhone 7 already
hey man it's about that pre-order true
that right good point alright guys so he
pretty much my wrapping up the day very
long day is my first iPhone launch date
ever
yeah so right now we're trying to wrap
up the video going up so you guys can
see what we've been spending our why
they doing and just show you guys a
couple of things that we picked up we
got the black iPhone 7 and we also got
the smartphone I mean the smart battery
case for this one yes I usually don't
make fun of me I love it
I stayed juiced all day so I'm good
you'd be surprised there are more people
who use it in here than you think
yeah it's okay personal preference and
then we got the oh yeah I'm sure this is
asking for eight but the beats solo 3
because these are the first Thursday
these are the first headphones that use
apples w1 chip with the new iPhone 7 so
I gotta test it out see what the
connectivity is like if you upload
the unboxing of the Holmes the plus of
the regular seven and we have much of a
giveaway so we trie go visit that video
comment what you like or whatever and be
entered you better do it it's a free
phone why not alright guys so right now
I'm in the hotel lobby apply it but
check this out we've got an iPhone 7
plus and a beats solo 3 Wireless I think
I'll do an unboxing here at the Y of the
beats and you kind of give you guys my
impression so far and maybe I'll do
something with this on Instagram stories
or snapchat there same thing alright
guys so here's the box we sold to be
Wireless this costs where's the porn
price time ninja bucks right but what's
different about this is that it has
Apple w1 chip which is like the new chip
so that it can sync with new iPhones
pretty easily just like the air pods so
we're gonna see how that works
Oh check this out something I did not
like about this guy's that it still
comes with the 3.5 millimeter cable
which I get because you want to be able
to use this with other devices outside
of the iPhone but it would have been
awesome if I have Apple included one
that has the lightning cable they didn't
do that and they actually included
included a micro USB cable instead like
what if you're going to make a change at
least change the way this thing charges
to so that it could work flawlessly
i phone right you put a w1 chip in there
you might as well pay anyway enough
ranting let's see what's inside
pop this open okay no hardshell case you
get a soft shell case that's it
oh no there's a top here so don't you
get guys give the care of being a clip
for the case so you can attach it's like
a book bag or something you get you a
microUSB cable okay and you get your
three point five two point five
millimeter cable so you can plug that
into other phones and other devices your
computer all that good stuff I mean they
look pretty good
let's see here
am i a winner huh you're a winner but
it's really about that w1 chip and
seeing how easy it is to pair with one
of these so I'm gonna open this up for
snapshot or something so let's do that I
didn't jump into any settings on the
phone because you're not supposed to
supposed to be that just that simple so
let's try it out
just turning it on so it's on and boom
check that out immediately
can that done okay
can't complain that was super simple so
right now me and Harry are in John's
office I am shooting some stuff for the
iPhone of course and it's just us here
so we have like free reign almost to you
know try to use this as much as we can
it hangs over here against him top and
done - boo I feel good I had Mexican for
lunch so she's like passing out over
here
but she's chopping away IRAs been
learning to edit and I should've been
helping out a ton killing them chops
right boo yeah she's like let me get
back to work oh yeah guys I'm just
trying to get this stuff going right now
man John stuff is insane stuff with this
madness and this light I don't know if
you guys can see it but it's a given up
my favorite color
I'm trying to get that into the shot
alright guys so that pretty much wraps
up I guess iPhone house with the guys I
still got some more iPhone 7 content
coming out so you guys will see that if
you didn't see what I posted already I
have links down below in the description
but I just want to give a huge shout out
to Hyatt Place for having me out and
giving me some more cool shoot somewhat
