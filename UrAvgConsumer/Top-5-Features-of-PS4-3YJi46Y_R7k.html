average consumer and today I'm going to
be going over the top five features of
the brand new Playstation 4 so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
and a kick start this list at number
five we have being able to upgrade your
hard drive now this is not necessarily a
feature exclusive to the ps4 tons of
systems can do it but it's still really
great now that you can do this with the
ps4 and you can upgrade your hard drive
to have more space you can take out the
initial 500 gigabyte hard drive for
something that's like one terabyte and
what's really great with this is that
with game downloads taking up tons and
tons of gigs you want to be able to have
as much storage options as you can and
the PlayStation 4 allows you to do that
what's also really great with the ps4 is
that you can change it from a standard
hard drive to a SSD which is the solid
state drive which is gonna bring you
better performance you get faster
application openings and all that kind
of stuff so overall better performance
with its SSD just like you would see on
a laptop or a computer so having those
options available to everyone is great
and Sony's made it pretty easy to get in
the system and change out your hard
drive with little issues and it's really
great that you can do this because there
are game downloads like battlefield 4
that takes up to like 30 gigs of hard
drive space so as games are taking up
more space you want to be able to
increase your hard drive capacity and
being able to do it on the ps4 is simple
so that's a really great feature at
number 5 and for number 4 on this list
we have sharing now sony has made it
quite obvious that they really want to
push sharing and the social aspect of
the ps4 now you're able to do is quite
simply by pressing the share button
that's on the controller of the ps4 and
it's actually a really nice feature you
can show your friends how to do certain
things like walkthroughs how to beat a
certain stage or pretty cool things that
you've done inside a game that you're
playing so you've got tons of bragging
rights you have the option to send that
stuff to Facebook share it on their feed
all kinds of places twitch which is a
streak and stream online so sharing your
gameplay
really simple now Sony has done a really
great job at being able to share with
everyone just how good of a gamer you
are so for all of you hardcore gamers
who want to show off your skills this is
a great great feature and you can even
show off some highlights of certain
games that you're playing to kind of
convince your friends to buy it or pick
it up and I think that's just amazing
and that's number four on the list and
for number three on the list we have
being able to play games while
downloading it so this is really cool
you might not be able to jump into a
game as soon as you start downloading it
but after you reach a certain threshold
the game will allow you to start playing
it and after as you play it it'll
continue downloading so that's really
cool for those of you who are really
eager to jump in the game that you just
purchased or something it's really
really great feature and as digital
downloads are getting more popular you
really want to be able to just grab the
game and start playing it right away so
if your friend tells you hey go pick up
NBA 2k14 you can go ahead and download
it and try to play as soon as possible
you don't have to run to a store or
anything so I think that's really really
great so that's something really cool
we're seeing with next-gen consoles and
I'm big fan of it because I like to do
digital downloads myself so I can
actually download a game and jump into
it right away so that's what we have for
number three and for number two on this
list being able to use any headphone or
headset to listen to game audio from
your ps4 now this is a really really
cool feature you can plug in any
headphone whether it's beads
Sennheiser's any brand any headphone as
long as asked at 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack you'll be able to listen
to audio from your controller on the
bottom of the controller you'll see that
there's a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and you can essentially plug in anything
into that and listen to all of the game
audio now you have to go into the
settings of your ps4 and actually switch
that on before it on before you switch
it it'll actually only have the chat
audio but you can switch it to all audio
so that's game play audio chat audio all
going through your headset and what's
really great about this is that it's
making any headphone wireless to your
ps4 the ps4 controller goes anywhere you
go so it essentially makes it all
Wireless so that's pretty cool
now of course you will have the wire
going from your
phone or earbud to the actual controller
but I don't think that's too big of a
deal because you can still move around
with no problem and what's also cool is
that it can work with inline remotes so
if you have a mic on your headphone
cable then you're able to use that as
the microphone for your game chat audio
people already have headphones or
earbuds that they like and they can just
use that with their ps4 with no problem
they don't have to go out and purchase a
whole new headset to have to increase
their gaming experience and what's also
really cool with this is if it's late at
night you don't have to worry about
bothering anyone from loud audio or
anything you can just plug that write it
up get it on your ears and start playing
so I think that's a really really cool
feature you guys know I'm a headphone
freak so you know I love that so
definitely really cool stuff there and
for number one on this list you guys
guessed it it's the PS Vita remote play
with the ps4 that is a mind-blowing
feature it's completely amazing I don't
know how this isn't getting more and
more press it's the best feature acting
of the ps4 altogether because you
essentially don't have to be playing
your ps4 to be playing ps4 if that makes
sense so you can be anywhere as long as
your internet connection is pretty solid
with your ps4 and your internet
connection is solid on your Vita you can
be anywhere in playing your ps4 games
with no problem so that is a huge
feature I've been playing Assassin's
Creed from very far away I've actually
been using my cell phone as a hotspot to
mice PS Vita and playing wherever I go
without having to worry about it
stopping what's unfortunate is that
those with the PS Vita 3G won't be able
to take use of the 3G feature and the
Remote Play from anywhere they want you
still have to be on a Wi-Fi network so
that's a little unfortunate but to play
it remotely you have to make sure that
you initially hook it up with the ps4
and get it all configured and then
you're free to go wherever you want play
your games no problem an amazing feature
it's very smooth I'm a real huge fan of
that and a lot of people who I know if
tried it love it too
so you definitely want to make sure that
you're using an ethernet cord with your
ps4 so you can get the best streaming
quality when you're using
you're PSVita now the graphics are of
course as great as they are on the ps4
because it's streaming and it's a
condensed screen so you're not gonna get
all the detail all the visuals that you
would get but it still looks absolutely
amazing and it looks like you're playing
your ps4 just on a much smaller screen
and I have a video that goes over remote
play features and you can find that in
