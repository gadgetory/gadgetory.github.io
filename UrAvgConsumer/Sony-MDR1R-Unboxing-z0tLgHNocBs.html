average consumer and today I've got an
unboxing for you guys of the Sony mdr-1r
headphones now it's been a while since I
featured some Sony branded headphones so
hey let's not wasting any time
get right into it ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum
and all right guys here we have the Sony
mdr-1r headphones now this is a pretty
standard box you got the picture of the
headphones right here nothing much on
the sides but the back of the box does
give you some information and it also
shows what's included so out here we got
a detachable cable a travel case and
this is also going to be able to work
with the iPod iPhone and iPad so all of
your Apple products this should work
just fine with the inline remote so
enough blabbering let's get to the
actual unboxing we've got some plastic
here so I'm going to use my unboxing
knife to get this stuff off so let's see
if you guys get that right through boom
so there we go
the first piece tear this off let's see
here some pretty good plastic pretty
strong and all right there we have it so
I can put this thing away and let's see
what we get inside so I'm pretty sure we
can just slide this off let's see here
alright so we can just slide this off
it's not the easiest thing to slide off
but here we go
jeez guys this is actually pretty tough
alright there we go it's finally off got
that out the way so let's see if what we
get inside hopefully the rest isn't as
hard so boom here we have them these are
actually really nice looking headphones
I'm surprised these are brown I thought
they would have been in black but um hey
they are so just a brown version and I'm
pretty sure we've got some other stuff
that's going in here too this is really
nice packaging guys it's got a nice
little cloth here
hold up makes it feel very luxurious so
let's see what else we got on the left
side of course we have an instruction
manual and we've got the travel case
right here and this is a really solid
travel case I like this let's see what
else we get inside it's got that new
smell and we've also got a brown tangle
free cable and this is a very
interesting cable I've never seen one
like this it's got these ridges coming
straight down and you also have the
inline remote with the volume controls
as well as a play and pause button and
it's also got a l-shaped
input so you can plug this into your
device when it's gotten L shaped like
this is always really nice because you
can put this in your pocket without
reading about it bending and breaking or
anything so pretty good stuff now let's
see what else we get inside let's see I
think this is it you also have another
cable here and this this cable is
without the inline remote so for some of
you who are like crazy into audio and
you feel like the remote will deter you
from getting the best sound quality as
you can you got this so this is cool too
and I'm sure that the instruction
manuals inside of this just have like
warranty information and stuff like that
nothing too crazy this isn't Bluetooth
or noise cancelling so nothing too crazy
in there no batteries so let's put this
away I do like the packaging though and
let's take a look at the actual
headphones now these feel very solid
very premium and very very lightweight
these are very lightweight headphones
um the headband feels really soft the
cushions are very very soft and it's got
a really really large ear cup so you can
fit your ears in here no problem I can
definitely see that and you can actually
see the drivers inside of the ear cups
and the drivers being the actual like
speaker part that you know plays the
music it doesn't have a foldable design
so this is going to stay like this but
you do have the travel case so when you
put in the travel case let's see how
this
works so it fits and no problem and boom
there you have it so this can actually
go into a backpack or a book bag no
problem so boom on the Left air cup you
do have the part where you can actually
put in your cable so you can put it in
there and this is how you have it so it
looks pretty nice looks feel very solid
so far I'm liking this I'm going to of
course have some more videos there's not
much more to go over here you only get
the two cables and the headphones as
well as this travel pouch so that's
pretty simple unboxing if you ask me but
that's about it guys I'm going to have a
girlfriend test as well as a review for
these so definitely be on the lookout
for that and I'll catch you guys in the
next video till then this was a really
quick unboxing if you enjoyed the video
be the cool guy that gives it a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel for more
content from me till then it's your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
