and I am here at Xbox III and today we
are checking out some of the awesome
stuff that they announced and of course
guys we've got to talk about project
Scarlett so this is the next-generation
console that Xbox is coming out with and
it looks very promising
so we're for seeing things that are
pretty similar to what we saw with the
PlayStation 5 announcements or not
really announcements but for interviews
but we're getting things like 8k
resolution 120 frames per second and
supposedly this system it's going to be
four times more powerful than the Xbox
one x Xbox one X is a beast already so
it'll be four times more powerful to
really push things to the next level now
in terms of specs we're gonna see a
custom AMD processor on this guy and
something that was also very interesting
is that they're fully dedicated to an
extremely class solid-state drive and
based on the interviews that they were
showing seems like they're trying to
eliminate load times and you guys have
heard me say it before but eliminating
load times is going to completely change
the landscape of how we gain now I'm
sorry we're gonna get more details on
project scarlet in the future but I'm
telling you guys next game consoles are
looking very promising and it is going
to be released holiday 2020 so we're
gonna see that around you know that
December time or maybe November and that
has me so pumped and something that I
was really pumped for was the
announcement of the new Xbox Elite
Series 2 controller they changed up a
few things here and this is my first
time actually holding it and it feels
awesome something that they've changed
is the new wrap around rubberized
texture so this has a more grippy feel
to it and of course they've changed some
things to impact gameplay so we've got
shorter hair trigger locks for faster
firing so it'll recognize that you're
actually firing a lot sooner which means
you're getting off your ammo faster and
over here we've got everything that
comes inside of the case as you guys can
see there's a bunch of different
joystick options and they even have this
thumb stick adjustment tool
so that when you want a tighter more
precise shot and you go ahead and just
tighten it over here so that's what's
that's what the big thing is about this
controller customization and getting it
fine-tuned to the way you like it
now another notable change which is a
small one is now it has a USB type-c
connector and not only can you charge it
with that but there's also a dock
included so when you want to go ahead
and charge this guy you can just throw
it down on the dock and boom and
something that's cool about this dock is
that you can actually place it right
inside of the case that it comes with so
that you can charge it inside of the
case and you have all of your like
little thumb sticks right next to it
whenever you want and this should get
you up to 40 hours of usage on a single
charge we're gonna have to test that out
IRA's gonna have to let me play Apex
straight for 40 hours so we could get
some factual numbers down important used
to be to profiles but they've actually
upped that to three so as you can see
here three notches to these profiles so
if you want to have a certain layout or
configuration for a certain game maybe
they showed Apex Forza and something
else but if you want to have like three
games that have a different layout you
can have that all map to those different
profiles but overall guys I'm super
pumped for this this is probably one of
the most exciting things until we
actually get to see a little bit more on
project scarlet but right now the fact
that I'm actually able to hold this has
me home okay so we've actually got a
game in front of us and got Gears of War
4 and we're gonna see how the controller
feels to play oh I'm getting bombarded
here oh no just this it feels great
I'm seeing the whole goal oh this is
cool alright so this feels great
now I'm just curious to see how
tightening it and turning it up with a
little tool is going to impact you know
kind of performance that we'll see from
it so of course that's going to be
something weird once you have to try out
once we get it in the studio but as of
right now guys this thing feels awesome
the grip is nice being able to access
the triggers at the back it's a good
feel alright guys so it was great to get
my hands on it to get to play with it
for a little bit I am pumped for this
thing to come out
of course pre-orders already starting
now so if you want to get your hands on
or learn more I'll have links down below
in the description but men this thing is
something I'm looking forward to but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
be that cool guy or girl that gives this
video a thumbs up I will catch you guys
in the next one if you guys want to see
more III content I'll probably have a
bunch of stuff posted on my social media
so be sure to follow me there so unless
one guy's your average consumer
