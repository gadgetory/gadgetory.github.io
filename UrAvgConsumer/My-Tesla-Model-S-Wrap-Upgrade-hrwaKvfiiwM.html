consumer and today we are checking out
oh they got the pedals all over my cart
start over what's going on guys
travelers consumer and today we are
taking a look at key Lola it is finally
back on the channel and as you can see
it looks a bit different
I got it completely wrapped and I'm
gonna tell you guys all about the
choices I made but shout out to marques
for putting me on to the idea of even
wrapping a Tesla and shout it's a
phenomenal vinyl they're the company
that did it for me but let's talk about
the choices that are actually made so
right here what you're seeing guys this
color right here is anthracite gray and
one more shout out for all of you who
jump on instagram live and help me make
the decision picking a color can be
incredibly overwhelming there are a ton
of options out there and I think to the
naked eye you might not be able to see
the difference between this and the
midnight metallic silver that I had
before but take a look at this and what
we're looking at right here this is the
original color this is midnight metallic
silver and right next to it is the
anthracite grey so this is the wrap and
this is the original paint color of the
car so subtle but when you put them
side-by-side it's pretty big difference
so I went with this for the entire color
made the car a little bit lighter but I
know you guys saw it up front we've got
some awesome teal accents all over the
car this is the very best part this is
the very front and I'm telling you guys
it looks so good this color is actually
called atomic teal that sounds amazing
I know till is a weird color to put on
the car I was super worried about this
choice I didn't know if it was gonna
look good or not but I think it turned
out well I wanted it to be really subtle
and I think that this is subtle enough
now it's not the only part where we have
teal we actually got it on the sides as
well so you guys can see down here we've
got teal and this is really cool because
this is you this used to be chrome just
like in the front but we took the chrome
pieces and made them teal and honestly I
just love it look at this when you're
getting out of the car
it's just an awesome reminder that
you've got those teal accents this thing
looks so so good and not only do we have
it in the front and on the sides but we
got it in the back you guys can see
right under my license plate I've got
this little teal border at the bottom I
think that looks really cool but the
kicker though is this guy right here the
P 100 D the parts that used to be red
are now lined with teal and I just love
it feel like it represents me my love
for teal you know but that's not the
only thing I changed I also did what
they call a chrome delete so for those
of you who aren't familiar with a chrome
delete it basically takes all the chrome
parts on the car and makes them black so
these parts around the windows are all
deleted even the camera sensors that we
have on the sides this used to be Chrome
as well but now that is also black and
we've even got Chrome deletes under the
rear view mirrors and you even got it
right here on the handles we've even got
the logo that's chrome deleted and this
is actually paint you can't really wrap
these so they painted this thing black
so that's kind of like the look here we
got the anthracite gray the black and of
course a little bit of teal now for
those of you who have never heard of
wrapping your car or you're wondering
why would you want to the most obvious
answer of course is to change up the
color like you see that I did and the
second is to protect the paint that you
have under the wrap so I heard Tesla's
have like really soft paint I don't want
it to get damaged up I like to preserve
my stuff you guys know a rocker case on
my phone so of course I had to get a
little something for the car to imagine
somebody try to key a car and you got
this nice wrap on but this of the wrap
is supposed to last for up to about five
years so about 4 to 5 years so that's a
long time and you can always switch it
out when you want to switch up the color
I think there are a lot of cool benefits
to having one of these can't lie I'm
very happy with this now when it comes
to the actual process of getting this
all done and took about four days for
them to complete the entire job and it
was actually a pretty good experience
the guys over a phenomenal vinyl talked
me through the entire process and they
actually have this really awesome
simulator where you can pretty much get
your car
in the simulator and pick different
parts of the car to be wrapped and
whatever color options you're looking
for it is really really cool so if
you're looking to wrap your car at any
point definitely look out for that kind
of feature that is something that is
insane and I think they're one of the
very very few people who are even doing
this so shout out to them but yeah guys
that about wraps it up for this video
hopefully you enjoyed it hopefully you
learn a little bit something about
wrapping cars and hopefully you got to
enjoy mmm that let me know what you guys
think down below in the comment section
if you enjoyed it be the cool girl that
give this video a thumbs up I'm gonna
catch you guys later until then is your
average consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
