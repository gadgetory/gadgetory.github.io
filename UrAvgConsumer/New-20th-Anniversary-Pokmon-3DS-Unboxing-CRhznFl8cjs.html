another unboxing for you this time I'm a
boxing this guy I'm super excited to be
unboxing this as you may or may not know
Pokemon is celebrating its 20th year
anniversary so 2016 is a beautiful year
to be a Pokemon lover we have Sun and
Moon coming out the holiday season and
we have pokken tournament coming out in
the US and now we have this it's out
it's ready to be unbox so let's not
waste any more time let's get right into
this
grace let's take a look at the box first
before we actually see the beautiful
console we have on the front Charizard
and Blastoise what's really cool these
plates have the original art from the
cartridges red and blue on the side it
has a little outline of Pikachu with a
2-0 on it to show the 20th year
anniversary of course in use Pikachu and
that's why he is here because he's the
mascot women have easy but I think
Pikachu is more fitting for this this
occasion and on the back we see some
specs that come with in new 3ds the
previously released new 3ds so there's
nothing different about this particular
guy with the Pokemon on it but it just
has the new specs 103 yes and
unfortunately today I do not need
unboxing knife so I'm sorry for those of
you would like to watch me fumble
through opening boxes with that knife I
always gonna pop this open and somehow
still fumbling there we go so let's just
open this up and these things are pretty
hard to find right now pretty much sold
out everywhere but I got this from
Walmart so it might be worth checking
out from check that out grapes knots
take a look in this little pouch here
see what comes in here I already see a
booklets I know we're gonna toss to the
side your average consumer style but
let's see what else is in here a booklet
to replace the cover place which I might
need to look at because I'm not sure how
to do that but what's really cool is
that cover plates come that you can
switch out for red and blue we'll get
into that a little bit later and we also
have some AR cards we'll put that to the
side as well and last but not least in
that little package we have the download
code for red and blue and pause right
there if you think I'm giving away this
code it's already been claimed and
downloaded down lastly and we have the
plates this around already fell out but
that's okay uh this is nice
both takeout packaging to really see the
beauty of it all
bumble is packaging this is ridiculous
these are the face plates for the
Blastoise version and it has these
beautiful blues really really cool I
love that it's the original artwork from
the cartridge and you also have again
the Pikachu 20 anniversary logo and now
for my favorite one the theme of this is
Harry can't figure out packages we have
the Charizard plate the top half wide
open so the face but a second face plate
is in here somewhere real find it it's
not in here John it's not in here oh my
god it's not in here oh all right so we
have one face plate here we have the top
face plate for the Charizard version and
again original artwork really nice I
just really gets to the 3d s so you can
see it very very pretty great and out
for the main attraction another big new
3ds
okay well it looks pretty incomplete
right now but you see on the back is
that missing the missing face plate
right here already installed they must
know me they know I'm going to put this
one on anyway and then the front is
blank so I could install the place the
actual face plate and because I want to
have the full experience and make this
like nice and super complete and
beautiful we're going to just put the
faceplate on now so I'm just put this
here nice that was pretty easy they need
a booklet for that and now you can see
it in its full glory this is the front
with Charizard and the back again you
have the Pikachu logo 20 year
anniversary
great and now let's open this bad boy I
can't quite see that but oh that was so
cool that looks really really nice cool
and just in case don't know much about
them to 30s the new PDS includes a
better 3d because there's face tracking
now at top and then we also have a sea
stick here for games that support it so
you can use it to change the different
camera angles there are some colored
buttons here for the X Y V a buttons and
you also have a me bow so that you could
use now and NFC so that about wraps it
up guys I'm loving this new 3ds and
loving these Charizard plates I also
love that I could customize it and
switch out if I want to if I want to put
black lights on I can do that and if
you're not a Pokemon lover and I'm not
sure why you wouldn't be you can still
customize this as you see fit if you
don't want Pokemon please so while I'm
very very happy with this I am a little
bit disappointed that they don't have a
3ds XL version I got used to that I
really wish it came out like this and I
also wish it included a charger you guys
know
that there's no charger in here the box
says no charger included so if you do
not have a 3d X already that means
you'll have to go out and purchase car
charger which is kind of sucks it's not
really fair so that's just a short list
of things I'm a little bit disappointed
with with this new release but I am
really excited about this new 3d s and
all things coming up this year to
commemorate the trained anniversary of
Pokemon if you're also excited for
things coming up this year let me know
in the comments down below what you're
excited about
pokken tournament Sun or moon let me
know down below and give me a thumbs up
if you enjoyed this unboxing and want to
see more unboxings from me and that's
about it
till next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
