time we talk about the best tech of the
year I'm covering headphones obviously
but if you guys want to see coverage on
tablets smartphones and gaming some of
your favorite youtubers covered them on
their channels so be sure to hit the
links down below in the description to
check out the whole deal
first up we've got the v-moda crossfade
Wireless you guys have no idea how
stoked I was to hear that these were
coming out v-moda took one of my
favorite headphones ever and gave them
one of my favorite features ever
Bluetooth this means you can sync this
up with a smartphone or any other
Bluetooth enabled device and listen to
your favorite tunes with v-moda m100
quality but with no wires one of the
biggest selling points to me when it
comes to v-moda is the build quality
these things are built like a tank and
since they share the same build as the
m1 hundreds you can expect them to last
you a few years only drawback with the
wireless however is the fact that they
aren't foldable luckily they aren't huge
on their own but this is something I
missed from the m1 hundreds on the right
air cup you've got your standard volume
controls as well as your playing pause
button that you can use to control your
music and answer calls double tap it to
skip to the next song and triple tap to
go back if you're wondering where the
mic is it's actually well hidden at the
bottom of the right ear cup and keep in
mind just because this thing is
bluetooth doesn't mean you need to use
it you can still use these with the
included audio cable if you need to use
them with a device without Bluetooth or
maybe even if you forgot to charge these
and your battery dies
speaking of battery these will get you
about twelve hours of playback so you
can have a long listening session with
no problem now I know you want to hear
about the sound quality and as I've
mentioned earlier these have the same
sound as the v-moda m100 thus these
sound amazing you get super rich sound
with some really deep bass and I can
listen happily to whatever I throw at
these which is what I loved about the m1
hundreds these are easily one of the
most versatile pair of bluetooth
headphones i've ever come across and
with the quality and customization
options the motor brings to the table
they're definitely a solid Buy if you do
pick these up I highly suggest getting
the XL ear pads as they bring a whole
new level of comfort when using these
next up we've got the audio technica ath
m50x
these didn't come out this year but at
the end of 2005
team they still rank in my top three the
M fifties really need no introduction
but if you haven't heard of them they
should definitely be on your radar if
you're looking for some quality
headphones they've got a very thick and
solid build quality so you don't have to
worry about babying them and for a pair
of headphones on the larger side they're
actually quite flexible they have a
foldable design that allows them to get
pretty compact which makes them great
for traveling and storing you're also
able to rotate the air cup so you can
listen to these with one ear on or even
lay them completely flat on a surface
the cable is also detachable so if
anything happens to it or you're more
comfortable with the other cable that
comes with you'll have options to take
it out and swap it them 50 X also comes
with super soft leather at ear cup
cushions which is leagues better in
comfort compared to the originals with
these on long listening sessions aren't
an issue at all I actually use these a
ton for editing videos which takes quite
a few hours but with the size and
overall comfort of these ear cups I've
had no issues with them but most
importantly I know you want to know how
these sound
these are studio monitors so there are
very balanced pair of headphones they
don't have completely neutral sound as
there's the slight emphasis on bass and
I mean slight so you can use these for a
wide range of things from listening to
music doing any sound editing work using
them to play your favorite games which
is actually a pretty nice experience or
anything else you can think of one thing
I do have to warn you about though is
that if you're looking for something
bass heavy these might not be the ones
for you and while I am a huge bass lover
I still love the clarity that the m50x
offers but there are different
headphones for different situations and
if you want bass you need to look at the
sony xba-40
these are probably one of my favorite
discoveries of the year the 950 bt are
another pair of bluetooth headphones
with head-shaking bass literally but
we'll get back to that in a second these
are a pretty good looking pair of
headphones although they are a bit on
the bigger side they've got huge but
extremely comfortable ear cups and they
honestly feel like marshmallows when you
have them on
I do wish these headphones were foldable
though so you'd have an easier time
storing them but they do at least lay
flat with the swiveling ear cups so
throwing them into a book bag or
something isn't a big deal they've got a
nice black and red color
game so the overall looks are a pass in
my book they're mainly made out of
plastic but this doesn't feel like the
cheap kind this gives us some good flex
and keeps a pretty light weight now
since these are bluetooth headphones
you'll find all the controls you need
along the ear Cubs the right side has
all the music controls on a slider as
well as some volume controls while the
left side has your power bass boost
button microUSB an input if you decide
to use the included cable instead of
bluetooth and of course a mic battery on
these lasts about 20 hours so you can
forget to charge these after a long
listening session and not even worry
about it before the next one now in
terms of sound these are one of the most
fun headphones I've ever listened to I'm
definitely a huge bass lover and these
really deliver they're definitely geared
towards a very prominent low-end but if
you're looking at these that's probably
what you want now this isn't the muddy
kind of bass that makes everything else
sound horrible
vocals and sounds on the higher end
still coming clearly and not only are
they great for listening to some
thumping music they're awesome for
watching movies as well and if you like
to live dangerously there's that bass
boost button while the bass sounds
amazing on its own when you use this
feature your head is definitely gonna
feel it tread lightly with this feature
my friends it's insane
I've gotten tons of tweets and tags on
Instagram from those of you who pick
this up based on my recommendation and
I'm happy to see that I'm not the only
one who loves these but that about wraps
it up guys to finish off the year I'd
say that these are the headphones that
do it for me the most if you want to see
more tech of the year hit the links in
the description to see videos from guys
like John over at TLD mkbhd and mr.
Austin Evans if you enjoyed be the cool
guy who gives this video a thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
