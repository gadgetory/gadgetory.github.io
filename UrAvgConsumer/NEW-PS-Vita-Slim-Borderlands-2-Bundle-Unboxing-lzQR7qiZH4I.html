consumer and today I've gotten unboxing
for you guys of one of my favorite
gadgets period the new PS Vita slim now
we're going to go over all the things
that you get inside of this box as well
as all of the new changes that the PS
Vita has undergone with this new slim
version so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
Bob Bob and all right guys so here we
have the PlayStation Vita slim bundle
with Borderlands 2 now there's a small
box you don't actually get the copy of
Borderlands 2 you won't get a physical
copy anyway you'll actually get a game
voucher that you can go and use that in
the PSN store and actually download your
copy also included in this is an 8
gigabyte memory card which is pretty
cool because the original Vita did not
come with a memory card you have to go
and purchase that separately so this
bundle does feature an 8 gigabyte memory
card and it also has 1 gig of on-board
storage so it's really cool this comes
ready for you to throw some games on
there and some game saves so that's
really nice around the box you can see
you've got a bunch of Borderlands
artwork and in the back you get pretty
much some information about the system
itself nothing really interesting but we
do have some tape up top here so I'm
going to use my unboxing knife and we're
going to pop this very very easy and
let's get this open and boom so it's
just a little white box so far let's see
so down here we have a little tab we can
actually just fold this down get this
thing open and here we have it so inside
you'll find your PS Vita 8 gigabyte
memory card and you also have your
Borderlands 2 voucher so you can use
this to going down little gear in
Borderlands 2 copy
on the right side here we also have a
new micro USB cable which is really
really cool because the original PSVita
PSVita
you didn't you weren't able to use a
micro USB to charge it this now allows
you to use a micro USB cable to charge
your Vita this is probably the biggest
feature I think that comes on the new
slim this is amazing because micro USB
cables are easy to find everyone has
them you don't use a proprietary cable
to charge your Vita anymore so that's
amazing so here we have the wall plug
you can plug it into the wall and we
have the adapter right here so pretty
basic stuff all good stuff but like I
said that micro USB cable great stuff
for the Vita so of course you've got a
bunch of paperwork says welcome to the
world of PlayStation just a Quick Start
Guide QuickStart guide in other
languages in French and also here we
have some AR cards now this used to come
as actual cards but I'm guessing there
it's a bit cheaper to just put it on a
piece of paper and use it like this and
it's actually pretty nice because you
don't lose them as well but these are
your AR cards that you can use in
various games to do different things so
very interesting that they did this now
it's a bit cheaper um yeah our play
cards and here we have the safety guide
so that's all the boring paperwork you
can get this stuff out of the way let's
put all that stuff aside and let's see
what this new guy is all about and
already I can feel that this thing is
much much lighter much lighter so um
let's get this thing out and see what it
looks like
Wow guys this thing is very different it
feels very different it's so much
lighter I do have my PS Vita right here
so let's take a look so here we have the
original and here we have the new slim
and guys this is a real a pretty
significant difference in weight so this
is much much lighter and it's a lot
rounder huh
this it feels like I'm holding up my god
just a fake smartphone doesn't even feel
like a gaming system it's nuts this has
a lot a bit more heft to it and this is
something I've always liked with the
original versions of like even with the
PSP I did like the first one a bit
always liked it a bit more because it
had a more heft to it it felt more solid
this is super light now I'm going to see
if there's a huge difference between the
screen quality now this is an LCD screen
instead of a OLED screen I believe so
this is going to be quite quite
different as far as the quality goes but
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
this out first and just see what my
first impressions are without checking
on this original PS Vita to see if
there's a huge difference but you can
expect the same stuff you've got two
analog sticks you got your L&amp;amp;R buttons
you got your regular d-pad you're
printing your triangle square X and
circle button your start and select
buttons are actually a bit different now
now they're circular before we had them
as ovals and the ovals were a bit hard
to press so this is a nice change these
circular buttons are very easy to press
you don't have to like stick your thumb
in there so this is really really good
change
you have both speakers on the sides you
also have your front-facing camera up
front and your rear camera these aren't
any these aren't really good cameras
they're not that great they don't have
great quality but they're just pretty
much used for the augmented reality
stuff you have your volume buttons at
the top along the right side and you
also have your power button now one
thing we want to note is that special
micro USB port
down at the bottom which is already like
I said great
you have your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and also right here is where you on
the right side and the bottom is where
you'll put in your memory card so that's
that and also at the top let's see here
this is where you put your games I
believe so let's see if I can get this
thing open so up top is where you're
going to put in your games so one thing
that I'm noticing is that this does not
have the accessory slot that the
original hat so I don't know Sony is
just doing away with the possibility of
using accessories well you're not going
to be able to use any accessories with
this so maybe accessories are just dead
for the vina which is pretty
disappointing I would have liked to see
some new stuff come out for it but just
like the PSP it didn't really have any
real accessories so I guess that's why
they took that out and you also seem to
have some LEDs right here so I'm
guessing with to power this thing on
which I'm going to do right now little
power on so there you go now one thing I
want to note guys is that this thing has
a matte finish on the side at the back
especially on the parts where you want
actually going to hold it so it provides
a really different feel whereas with the
original it was more of like a it was
also a map but it's not as mad this is
like a real matte finish where this was
just like maybe just just plastic but um
here you've got matte finish pretty
interesting in the hand alright guys so
I'm going through the setup process
right now and the screen doesn't look
bad but I do see it the tint of it looks
a bit different it seems to be a bit
more you like a yellowish tint more so
than anything alright guys so I finished
the I setup process and now it's playing
the intro movie and so far the screen
doesn't look bad it does have a bit of a
yellowish tint though in my eyes but
maybe it might be because I'm really
used to the original Vita but I'm let's
see how it is on the main home screen
alright so I'm going to try and pump up
the brightness and I'm going to see if I
can change it to a pretty vibrant color
background
let's see here alright guys so I've got
the color change the bad changes around
some of the colors just the background
so it's a nice blue and to be honest
just looking at this if I never owned a
Vita I probably wouldn't have any
problem with this this would probably be
just good enough but as someone who is a
Vita owner I can see a difference as far
as the screen quality goes and the LCD
screen is a really big change so just to
go over all the changes that kind of
happened here it's definitely a lot of
the buttons the buttons have changed up
quite a bit the starts select the home
button via volume buttons at the bottom
and the power button the matte finish on
the back here is a completely different
feel now of course the size is very very
thin it's very very light it's much much
lighter other changes are the one
gigabyte of storage that you get
automatically so now this vita if I took
out the memory card I have no storage
this has 1 gigabyte of on-board storage
you also have an extra hour of battery
life and that's probably because of the
screen the screen isn't taking up as
much juice as a screen like this would
so that's probably what got that extra
hour of battery life and that's pretty
much all the big changes that you'll
find on the Vita slim let me know if you
guys want to review I never reviewed the
Vita and you know it's one of my
favorite gadgets period so if you guys
want to see why I love it so much and
you guys want to review if the slim let
me know or if you guys want a comparison
like a more in-depth comparison feel
free to let me know and I will get to
those alright guys hopefully you enjoyed
this video and till the next time it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
