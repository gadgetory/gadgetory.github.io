consumer and this is my girlfriend Hey
and today we have another sound leak and
sound isolation test aka the
girlfriend's ass and today we're gonna
be doing it with the boats QC 15s the
much requested very much requested
headphone so we're gonna be doing this
today and hey let's not wasting any time
let's get right into it so first we're
gonna start off with the Soundlink test
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
play music from volumes of 50% 75% and
3rd 100% so we can see how much the
music leaks from the headphones add
those different volumes so you ready to
start yep alright so I think we may have
to switch on the side that's it turn it
on yeah noise canceling alright so now
we're gonna start it off at 50% ready
yeah let's go I hear slightly definitely
not a bother for anyone close the room
this close doesn't matter not bad at all
alright so ready for 75% all right so
here we are at 75% still I can hear a
lot more now but still not too bad I
can't imagine anyone complaining about
it so once I'm ready
and of course guys we recommend nobody
listen to your music at 1% it can hurt
your hearing all the good stuff so
alright 100% I can't hear very clearly
out 1 2 % so this would bother someone
if they were right next to you if they
didn't want like your music or something
but they'd have to be pretty close but I
think overall not too bad not too bad
alright so that was it the sound test I
say this definitely had passed we did it
did leak a bit but it wasn't enough
there anyone so you ready for me
girlfriend times yes can I explain
what's gonna happen today nothing no
okay so I think I'm sucking so loud
because it's like canceling um so so
instead of a girlfriend test say you're
actually doing the boyfriend test
because let's be real boyfriends and
girlfriends as well and sometimes we
need to cancel out their annoying sounds
annoying everything so today I'm gonna
be testing these headphones these
QuietComfort headphones to see if I
cannot cancel out off his right bracket
alright guys what I'm gonna do what I
normally do and that's play a little
video games here and there all the time
so we're gonna see if she can kind of
block that out and let's see how it
works
all right so here it is at 50% okay
ready yeah I hear it oh you like I hear
everything
oh really yeah okay so let's crank it up
to 75% okay okay alright so here do the
75%
I'm sorry um I heard in a little bit
yeah I did a little bit okay so let's
try it out of 100% ready yeah okay I did
not hear a thing and I was getting
really too into this song it's a dub you
for those who can't hear it alright so
yeah 100% it finally worked which is
actually pretty surprising because this
is supposed to have some really good
noise cancelling and I've experienced it
myself it does have really good noise
cancelling so maybe this was just too
close to valid and no notes but
typically it does have good noise
cancelling but he's definitely ignoring
me with them yesterday so it didn't pass
this girlfriend's house that well but I
can vouch for it at least a bit that it
does have some really great noise guess
what guys
alright so that pretty much wraps it up
guys we hope you enjoyed it feel free to
rate comment and subscribe if you
enjoyed the video and we'll catch you in
the next one till then is your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
