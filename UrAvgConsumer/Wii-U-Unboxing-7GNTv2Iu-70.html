consumer and today I'm gonna be unboxing
a brand new deluxe set Wii U so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it
and alright guys here we have the Wii U
I'm sure this doesn't need any
introduction but it is Nintendo's newest
counsel um it's got the giant gamepad
here this is the deluxe version 32
gigabyte the regular basic one comes
with a kit because I buy 8 gigabytes of
on storage but enough talking let's get
right up into this and open it up
there's a giant box oh it's kind of hard
here but let's see we open it up pull to
the side and I'm gonna grab these drop
box falling apart but I'm gonna grab
these two okay here we are
I'm gonna grab these probably just pull
the whole box off there's nothing left
inside the box so I'm gonna put it down
there and turn this over and alright so
first off we have a Nintendo land this
is the deluxe set so it does have this
um let's see what else we have got some
instruction guides as well we have our
power brick giant power brick this here
and this is I believe this is the
charger for the actual gamepad we're
gonna take all this stuff open up right
here this is attached this is I believe
the stand these have the little two
pieces that make a stand for the a Wii U
so that's this right here I'll take
these all out the plastic of course this
is actually the actual cradle for the
gamepad I'll start taking them out now
there's a cradle for the gamepad as you
can see here it says Nintendo pretty
simple put this to the side
and let me get rid of all this I'm gonna
get rid of all this plastic now all
right so we cleared up a bit of the
plastic this is the cradle and let's see
we've got the HDMI cord that just comes
with so we've got that here let's see
we've also got this is oh this is the
actual charging dock for the gamepad so
that's pretty cool - the charging dock
put that to the side and we have our
sensor bar of course just like the we
came had one this is also the one that
comes with the Wii U so we have this
here that size and that's the first
layer now the second layer let's see
this is the actual Wii U I believe so
let's pull this out and on first
impression I must say this is pretty
hefty not bad definitely heavier than
the original Wii and let's see here and
of course we've got a glossy finish here
this is going to be a fingerprint magnet
so let's finish unwrapping this there's
a very sticky styrofoam all right cool
so here we are this is the Wii U this is
the back and here we have the front lots
of plastic covering everything let's put
this down for now well let's make some
space first all right so there's a lot
of stuff that comes with the deluxe set
so just have declutter of the and move
things around so that was the system and
this is the actual gamepad let's get
this cardboard out of the way and take a
look at the actual gamepad
and it's tearing right through the
styrofoam that's all right so this is
also plastic and shiny so it's going to
be another fingerprint magnet but this
looks pretty cool pretty light very
light actually very big of course gonna
be pretty interesting to try this out so
pretty much this is it guys we have the
gamepad the actual Wii U here we've got
some the actual stand for the Wii U so
if you want to stand it up you can just
kind of put it out like this boom there
you go and of course we have this little
cradle so that can go sit right there
and we have the charging dock boom kind
of redundant actually to have these two
things but I mean whatever it's two
pieces no big deal and just to give you
guys a quick close-up of the actual Wii
U here it is
now alright guys here we have the Wii U
of course we have the CD slot right
there here's where you have two USB
ports and an SD card slot here's where
you sync your controllers you got your
power and eject button there as well and
to the sides we got some fans and of
course we have the HDMI slot back here
the censor bar the AC adapter goes here
censor bar right there here you have
your AV multi-out and two more USB ports
as well as a fan to keep it cool so it's
got a lot going on but this is a bit
it's just quite a bit bigger than the
actual we so it's gonna be pretty cool
to see but it's not too big smaller than
a ps3 of course and of course here we
have two gamepad we've got two analog
sticks front-facing camera d-pad home
button TV control this can be used as a
universal remote for your television so
that's why it's got this as well as some
TV features but this has been pretty
cool that you can use this with your TV
you got your start and select button you
know standard control
and you've got your stylus right here in
the back so you can use it here and
you've got your volume controls as well
as an AC adapter port and a headphone
jack and the sensory right there and
you've got your L&amp;amp;R and your ZL and Zr
buttons in the back and I must say guys
this feels pretty pretty nice in the
hands um it's really big but it doesn't
feel uncomfortably big so it's pretty
cool
here we have the where you charge it in
the back and the bottom there so you can
charge it up top here as well as right
here through the actual dock and alright

unboxing of the Wii U I'm going to have
