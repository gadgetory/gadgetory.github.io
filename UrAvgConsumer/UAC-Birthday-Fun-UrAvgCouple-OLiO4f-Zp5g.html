underneath my nose I don't know where it
came from but it's like just really it's
like it's a huge piece of like just
bunch of powder and it looks like I just
like wet and did some kind of drugs or
something before I went in there and it
was just really embarrassing this is why
I miss Chad if Jed were here he would've
been like re-check yourself for the
mirror you look weird he wouldn't let me
