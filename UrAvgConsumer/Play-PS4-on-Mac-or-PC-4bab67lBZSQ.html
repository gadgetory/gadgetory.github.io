firmware update for the ps4 version 3.5
they've introduced an update to remote
play but not for the Vita or even
Android phones which is pretty amazing
but this time for the Mac and PC let's
stop right there for a second because
this is a big deal
sony has made it possible to enjoy your
favorite ps4 games from a device that
just about everyone has access to
craziest thing about this is how
insanely simple it is to set it up all
you need to do is head to the
PlayStation site and download the Remote
Play app to your computer and as I
mentioned it's compatible with both the
PC and Mac so just choose whichever
works for you once you get signed into
the app you'll have to register your
computer with your ps4 so you can start
accessing remote play from it it's a
super simple process if you're on the
same Wi-Fi network as the ps4 and I
definitely recommend registering this
way something you might want to know
before you hit that start button is the
preference menu and the Settings button
depending on what system you're on here
you'll have access to the resolution of
your Stream framerate and you can also
change the ps4 and account your
computers connected to Sony says you'll
need an upload and download speed of
about 12 megabits for the best
performance but I'm sure you can mess
around with the settings to see what
best works for you now when it comes to
actually playing you'll need your ps4
controller and the USB cable and you're
good to go
from my experience playing like this has
been really smooth and depending on your
speed you might see the quality drop for
a second every once in a while but for
the most part it looked pretty decent by
no means should you expect the same
quality that you get when you play the
actual system but if you're in a
situation where you can't be near it and
you still want to play it'll be more
than good enough to get the job done I
probably wouldn't recommend it for any
hardcore online gaming like with Call of
Duty or any other game where every
second counts due to the super slight
delay from this being a stream but aside
from that you won't really notice any
impacting gameplay now my absolute
favorite part about this and why I think
it's a really big deal you can be
anywhere and I mean anywhere and have
access to your ps4 once it's been
registered and is on a good-enough
connection and if you've watched what
I've done with remote play in the past
you know I had to try this while using
my phone as a hotspot with this kind of
setup you can be playing ps4 in places
we never thought possible and to me
that's pretty amazing so not only are we
getting the ability to play the ps4 on
the John we're able to play it anywhere
so I'm you just keep springing the heat
with the ps4 and I've got to say it's a
good time to own one and if you already
do and you're digging the look of mine I
actually teamed up with slick rap to try
out a couple of their ps4 skins and
found some awesome ones to pimp mine out
