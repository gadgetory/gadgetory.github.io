going on guys Travers consumer and today
we finally have this year's what's in my
travel backpack a video where I go over
in my backpack that I take with me for
day trips where I'm not really trying to
carry my gadget backpack which is filled
with a ton of tech this has some tech
but I try to keep it light weight so
jumping right into it here we have a
really slim backpack from OG oh this is
the og o sly now this is a laptop
backpack which allows you to put in a
15-inch laptop not a ton of compartments
here very thin profile but I kind of
like it because it helps me not to
travel with too much it gets a little
silly when I'm going to a meeting with a
giant backpack so something like this
allows me to have the essential pieces
of tech that I need now we're going
through it we'll start off with the very
very front so here you'll notice we have
some lenses now these aren't your
typical lenses that you see on a DSLR
camera these are actually meant for
moment lens cases so right here I've got
the moment lens cases on my pixel to XL
and my iPhone 10 these are the phones
that I always carry with me everyday
pixel to XL has the best camera on any
smartphone right now and when you pair
it with some of these moment lenses you
just up the experience now I'm not gonna
spend a ton of time talking about each
lens but just to let you guys know which
ones I'm carrying around with me I have
the 18 millimeter which is a wide angle
lens something like this allows you to
get more in your frame so you don't have
to like move back all the way this I
took some really great photos with this
so I really like this one it's my go-to
and I also have a 60 millimeter
telephoto lens so this is great since
the pixel too only has a single lens so
with something like this I could throw
it onto my pixel too and then get a more
zoomed in shot without actually having
to zoom in on the camera that makes my
photos a lot sharper and closer to the
subject that I want I also have the 10
millimeter now this is a 10 millimeter
macro lens and if you want to get some
really fine detail you can bring this
thing up to any subject and get a ton of
detail see things that you probably
wouldn't see with your normal eye so
this is an awesome lens if you want
something really creative and there's
also I got this fish island
but it's not my number one lens 18
millimeter and the macro though I love
these now of course I've got those in
the front compartments like I have easy
access to them but I also have my
portable charger which is in a sent
hyzer pouch don't pay that any mind but
this is the Omni charge 20 now you might
have seen me talk about this in a
favorite tech of the month video that I
did a while back but this is absolutely
the best portable charger that I ever
used now it is a very expensive portable
charger don't get me wrong but it has a
ton of features this thing has got
20,000 milliamp hours which isn't the
most that I've seen on a portable
charger but it's definitely up there
it's also got two USB ports and one of
them is quick charge 3.0 so you'll leave
it as quick charge any phones like my
pixel 2 I'll be able to do that with no
problem let's talk about what makes this
thing cool so it's got a OLED display up
front that gives you a ton of
information like how much battery you
actually have left how much juice it's
cranking out how much it's got left all
that kind of stuff this thing can
actually be used to charge up anything
that you want to plug into it right here
on the side it has a wall adapter right
here built into it so if you want to
charge up your laptop or something you
can do that with no problem that for me
is a crazy feature I don't have to worry
about using a USB port I can straight up
plug something that I want inside of
here but not only that this thing also
has wireless charging so if your phone
supports that you can just throw it on
top of here and have a charge that way
the actual device can be charged using
the Sun it has like a solar charger I
don't know where the solar panel is but
the website claims that it has one I've
never used it that way but I don't know
how they put in all of these crazy
features they also come with a ton of
cables and different attachments this
thing deserves its name as the omni
charge it's amazing I love it best
portable charger that I've ever used but
it's just super super expensive and
inside of this pouch I've got a small
USB cable this one is actually by Nomad
and it's pretty much made for portable
chargers it's got a micro USB cable and
adapters for a lightning cable and also
USB type-c super durable cable I love
that in shorts I don't have
cable dangling from my portable charger
so this is great I'm not always branded
with me everywhere that's what I keep
right here and in the next compartment
there's where I've got a few more things
now this is the boring stuff some pens
and pencils so if you know me you know I
love my pilot g2 cor took a mechanical
pencil and I've even got this stylus
here to go with the laptop that I've got
inside and this thing is great for me to
get business stuff done because I can
sign contracts and pdfs which is really
useful right here we've got the
Microsoft art mouse and with this guy
right now look how flat this is this
thing is off and when I want to turn it
on I just crunch it like that you make
it form a little arc and this is where
it turns on the Bluetooth kicks in syncs
up with your laptop and you can just use
it this is actually pretty comfortable
it also has a touch panel on top so
you've got your left click your right
click you can also scroll if you want so
this thing has all the functionality
that you get from a normal Mouse but it
just has this really cool ergonomic
design and look how flat it is when you
put it inside of your backpack and this
thing takes up no space so it's perfect
for having in a small backpack like this
whenever I'm traveling because it
doesn't weigh me down and of course I
carry around this Satechi hub with me
pretty much anywhere so just to give you
guys a quick rundown
you get three USB 3.0 ports you also get
a little mini display port an HDMI port
you also get an Ethernet port as well as
a USB type-c and you also get a micro SD
card slot as well as a regular SD card
slot so you get a lot of ports with this
guy this thing is great for someone like
me obviously because I'm a content
creator and I'm a tech head so I gotta
be able to plug in as many things as I
want to my laptop and this thing allows
me to do it and it looks good and last
thing I've got over here are my custom
air pods
color we're actually made these in space
grey these things are great I love them
I love the features that they bring to
the iPhone I love how easy it is to
connect with these they don't sit in my
ear too well
but I've been making do with it I've
been trying it and it's been working out
pretty well for me I just love how
reliable it is with the iPhone so I've
been carrying it around with me
it's been a pretty good experience now
you've probably never seen a pair of air
paws that look like these before and
that's because color wear custom-made
these this is their space gray version
so they can do this in a ton of
different colors
those guys they do great work so I'm
really a big fan of this all right so
now we look at the bigger compartments
we check this out now this is my laptop
charger so I don't even worry about that
we'll talk about that later aside from
that I've got you know a notebook
because you know I'm old I still use
paper notebooks and it's teal so you
know it's only right and the very bottom
here I got this Joby Gorillapod and I
actually really like having this around
in combination with the moment lens
cases and moment lenses because if I
want to get some really nice shots I can
easily throw this on so check this out
so you guys see here I've attached one
of the moment lenses to the case and
I've got it on this Joby Gorillapod and
I can pretty much do whatever I want
with this maybe I want to talk to the
camera use my phone for some vlogging or
whatever it may be I can do that with no
problem here not to mention check out
all the flexibility that you get with
this thing so if you're trying to hit
them angles you can definitely do that
so I like having one of these around
these things are great and even though
I've got those air pods I always like to
carry around a pair of over ear
headphones with me this is the sony MDR
wh 1000 x mark ii i'm pretty sure that's
what it is sony's got these crazy names
for their for headphones but this thing
is amazing it's one of their
top-of-the-line bluetooth headphones you
guys have seen me talk about this this
thing is awesome it's got touch panels
on the side so you can control your
music with swiping your fingers right on
the ear cups you have ambient noise
features where you can listen to your
music and still hear what's going on
around you if you're outside you don't
want to be completely oblivious to the
world you can do that it's also got the
best noise canceling feature that I've
ever experienced on any pair of
headphones sony knock this one out of
the park this thing is definitely
premium but i tell you if you get your
hands on them you'll be stowed you'll be
very happy this thing that's not
disappointing and of course the laptop
that I've been taking around
hey me with the drumroll the HP Pavilion
x360 now you guys might have seen me
talk about this in a previous video but
the reason why I'm still walking around
with this guy is because intel has got
some pretty interesting new things going
on with their eighth generation chips
and they're obtaining memory and for
those of you who don't know this is a 2
in 1 laptop and you know I typically
carried my surface book - which also has
an Intel processor in there and I love
my surface book - but I've been testing
this guy out and it's honestly perfect
for the travel backpack because like I
said it's a twin one so I don't have to
bring around my tablet you guys know I'm
crazy I'll bring it around a laptop and
a tablet always but with a tool one
don't really have to do that and with
this thing having some solid specs and a
virgin processor I can have a ton of
tabs open even play some games if I want
to and yes I am a firm believer in tuned
ones you can carry fewer devices with
you if you're crazy like me I definitely
cosign it but if you guys are interested
in learning more about it I'll have
links down below in the description to
this as well as everything else
mentioned in this video hopefully you
guys enjoyed it if you did leave the
cool girl like this video thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
