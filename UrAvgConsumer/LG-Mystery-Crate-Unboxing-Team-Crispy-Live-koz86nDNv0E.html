she's not all prettied up because she
wasn't expecting to vlog right now so
yeah Harry hyeri
okay anyway so check this out I've got
this giant crate here I believe this is
from LG I have no idea what's inside of
here so I'm going to have to pop this
thing open this site is open but this is
bolted on a couple of sides I've got to
get my drill let's see what's inside of
here I've seen Lou and Mike lioness open
up stuff like this before so I'm curious
what to expect I'm not sure exactly but
it should be fun
oh my god exciting so this was a this is
part of their whole thing for the Super
Bowl
alright so let's pop the top now they've
got a very interesting commercial that
goes along with this I'll have a link
down below in the description so you
guys could check it out well looks like
I'm Hunger Games is having views they
have a good seal yeah so check this out
yeah so it reads do your average
consumer we hope you're enjoying the
enclosed game with your valuable people
as the big game is coming soon the more
you play the closer the answer for the
mystery of February 7th 2016 will
approach you best LG OLED TV team I
guess and a deck of cards a dove
comedian
humming one two three four five six
you sound like the only kid just now
sorry I just really like that
combination so guys check it out there's
an adhesive under here this plastic it's
adhesive so I'm guessing the game aspect
of it is to throw the cards alright guys
so this is what we came up with this is
how you play the game and we decided
that we have no idea what they're
talking about so I guess we'll have to
wait and watch the LG ad during the
Super Bowl so
our guys right now we're at the airport
our way to California 13 first we live
she was passed out she's tired
we spent yeah we pulled an all-nighter
get it ready because last minute kind of
people
I'm staking my favorite greenhouse you
have to get yourself dolled up my curly
hair bun and it wouldn't be us if we
didn't stop for some food before the
flight look at her she hasn't had a
burger in a while
flagging it
alright guys so we are in al
what idk so you guys saw when she was
watching Westside foolery
she loves that it would be so much I
wasn't planning and
seven predominately
man she got so into it and it's crazy
she just started crying at the end even
though she's watched you so many times
of course so guys check this out these
tiles light up as you walk on them and
that is having a good time
oh yeah you doing something no you can
do it do whatever you want man go for it
one leg loose bump lose got a bum knee
right now oh this man move alright guys
so it's day of team crispy live
so I got the banana foster if you guys
haven't been to our house and tried to
get our foster I haven't suggested you
if you're a fan of life you know banana
flavored food this stuff is great I love
french toast love bananas good combo on
there
uber crispy pie I just thought we should
blog because keeping with the theme from
the last leg of old-school gun is old
bazooka gum bubble gum this is from way
back in the day opened it and then I
remembered they come with the comic
strips oh well sort of comic strips this
time it's a two truths and a lie and has
like little factoids like that's on it
an TV you don't need to go anywhere else
in LA right here this is your one-stop
destination
alright guys so start to fill up I will
be the one supporting when I live
through events still it looks a little
bit off
not believing on him like mommy I'm
trying to show you guys so hard starting
to fill up a little bit and now there
are ten minutes left to go and it's
filling up this is cool
meteor what's your name I'm sorry Ellie
loves your buzz Marquez
for these guys what's really important
to me is to insert something into the
video today's uniquely yours something
that you mentioned it's a problem of
eating such a competitive space where so
many people are battling for the same
keywords in the same product but if you
continue to insert personality or
something that specifically belongs to
you and not any of those other channels
then you can help to ensure that people
are going to click through because
because of that decision it is not
strictly because of the product of the
wind story I like to attend if I can to
branch out maybe as other random stuff
that people might not search about and
then you get back and realize there's
levodopa tech videos coming to watch
those two hopefully people can come back
in you know a couple dozen episodes down
the line and just watch them all I saved
myself the my favorite kind of videos
are the videos I do on my gadget
backpack so I
and the Commons that I only thought of
it but I really do I'm a porter when it
comes to these types of attest to that
idea situation so I have to use a lot of
tech I go at the backpack I look like a
turtle with it but I love my son
you shot you guys they did this just for
you they just wanted to do something
special and we really hope you thought
it was special can we just give them
around
now
so we have what's your name I'm Jack
Jack nice check this out this is pretty
amazing this is what this is a fan Bobby

didn't make a whole video about two
crispy alive but hopefully we gave you
some insight with this vlog you guys got
to see and shout out to all the guys who
came out and said hello to kickers

selfies that I was there are so many
phones that I signed it broke my heart
of it but you know like a wash off Oh at
least hopefully but anyway guys
hopefully you enjoyed it oh you do have
a question for you what do you now we
always oppose the idea of make putting
the vlogs on a separate channel but how
many of you would prefer to see it there
or do you want to see it stay on this
channel or does it not matter let us
know down below in the comments and my
channel a channel your average
girlfriend telling this video guys oh
