consumer this is my girlfriend I'm back
and today we have another sound leak and
sound isolation test aka the girlfriend
test and today we're going to be doing
this with the new beats by dre
executives so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it so first we're
gonna start off with the sound leak test
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
play music from 50% volume 75% and then
100% just so we can see how much the
sound leads from the headphones while
we're listening hello first we're gonna
start off 50% ready yes tuck my hair
behind my ear this way we don't have to
worry about carrying it away and we're
all good to go
so now let's play it at 50% that was a
hundred percent
all right so 150 percent okay I hear
slightly very slightly but this is a
very quiet room and we're right next to
each other so in if I wasn't so closer I
would not hear this at all that's
definitely pretty good the studios at
this at 50% sounded terrible
so this is definitely an upgrade right
here so you ready to hear at 75 yes you
trust me
75% now I heard that a lot more a lot
more
yeah that's pretty clear umm yeah good
chance people might hear you depending
on where you are indoors someone good
chance someone might hear that outdoors
probably not but that did leave a good
bit so now 100% are you ready now yes I
have to get myself into prepared for
these things but I'm good
gave me no chance you can clearly hear
that all right so that's 100% definitely
a lot of leaking right there but overall
50% wasn't that 75% was man and a 1/2
percent of it was 100% so but this is
definitely an upgrade compared to these
studios so definitely a good job there
all right so now we're going to do the
girlfriend test okay so those are really
comfortable though
uh-huh so the girlfriend test is
basically when it's a test for people to
see if they can block out any kind of
annoying sounds and for him his annoying
sounds tend to be me so we're gonna see
if these headphones can block out my
annoying sounds my noggin my whatever
alright so and we're just like the
soundly test we're gonna start this from
50 % in 5% Emma 100% great and with that
I think we're ready to get started
alright
boom wait doc hmm fellas
okay ready okay so lately I've noticed
that every time I come home you're
always on your computer always on that
YouTube always doing some kind of video
editing or recording and I just can't
deal with it anymore
all right so nothing she said at all no
this candidate link I'm in it so this
definitely does a pass on the girlfriend
test so far let's see a 75% and whatever
that comes down to is attention you know
I love attention now you know I don't
like when attention isn't that on me so
now we have a problem
are you listening to me alright boom
this is Sarina
well a 75% you can hear a thing it did
well at 50 % 5% was definitely okay and
we're gonna try on 2% test to see miss
like learning I'm ready
alright and then we want everyone else
to play music how much percent we did it
okay guys I don't recommend with me
music got one 2% as it can damage your
hearing and we want to avoid that
believe me I know me too
alright so here he is at a hundred
percent and it just seems like at this
point that you love YouTube you love
your subscribers or do you love me and
that's giving ultimatum because that
doesn't work for me at all
it's having YouTube or me alright I'm
kidding guys I had a hundred percent I
couldn't hear her at all I couldn't hear
myself think
don't know all right well a hundred
percent it definitely did the trick did
the trick from fifty percent so
definitely a good job with the noise
cancelling here
so overall guys he definitely did a good
job at sound leaking and the sound
isolation test at 50 percent it wasn't
so bad the studios were just terrible we
should show them yeah let's turn it to
them 50 percent with studios yeah I
think I really hear that I hear it all
the lyrics want some more you know I
can't like sing along with it it's
ridiculous how did you hear that yeah I
did could I get hear all the lyrics
crazy I don't know why this do that you
know a party we have a carnie in here
and be fine okay this is way too loud
madness okay alright so that about wraps
it up guys just wanted to show you a
quick little comparison there of how
much at least compared to these studios
just crazy but um overall definitely a
good job there I think this is an
upgrade in the sound League and sound
like well found isolation they're pretty
much the same but sound leaking
Department the executives are definitely
a win and that about wraps it up for
this video guys til the next video is
your average consumer these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
