excellence what's going on guys to
Travers consumer and today we're gonna
be taking a look at a laptop that I've
fallen in love with recently the msi
gs70 mning laptop with a very thin and
sleek design and at first glance you
wouldn't even think that this is a
gaming laptop typically those are
usually a lot bulkier and they're black
and red
I heard that MSI's older laptops tend to
look like that but they seem to have
gone in a different direction here and I
am all for it
it's got a very much more black and gold
colour scheme with the gold accents
being on the logo around the trackpad
and even around the perimeter of the
laptop itself and you can even find some
more accents on the vents on the sides
so all know I really like the way this
thing looks it feels great and it's only
4.14 pounds so it's pretty lightweight
especially for something as powerful as
it is it is very light so whenever I had
to throw it in my backpack carry it
around with me the whole thing with one
hand it's not been an issue whatsoever
so it's a nice powerful lightweight
gaming laptop which is just not a
combination you typically see and an
actual material that is made out of just
feels really good in the hand it feels
nice and premium it's aluminum alloy
that's been sandblasted but my only
gripe with it is that it does attract
quite a few fingerprints so if you're
one of those folks like me who tend to
obsess about that you will be pulling
out your microfiber cloth and cleaning
this guy up quite a bit and I've seen
some people complain about it having
some flex in areas kind of like around
the power button honestly it does flex
hasn't really impacted me by any means
whatsoever this is not gonna be that
much of an issue it might bother you
just a little bit but it's definitely
not a deal-breaker and with that more
compact design this is pretty much a 14
inch laptop body but it manages to fit a
15.6 inch display onto that 14 inch body
and they managed to do this by shrinking
down the bezels by a ton it's got an 82%
screen to body ratio so if you like
really thin bezels you're definitely
gonna love what you get with the stealth
and it does have a little bit of a chin
at the bottom of the display but I feel
like I'd be nitpicking if I actually had
a problem
that in a display that we're working
with is actually pretty nice with a 144
Hertz refresh rate so if you're into
gaming you know how important it is to
have a nice high refresh rate
it's a 1080p display which makes that
kind of thing possible but like I said
it does look really nice when playing
games
this has to be touched on gaming let's
talk a bit about performance for you
spec heads out there - packing in the
Intel eighth generation core i7
processor with six cores so this thing
has a ton of power it's also got 16 gigs
of RAM as well as an nvidia gtx 1070
that is a lot of muscle to fit inside of
a compact body like this
- also packing a 512 gig SSD and with
that kind of power i've been able to
crank up the settings on all the games
that I've been playing whether it's
ultra or epic whatever this setting may
be I've been able to really push it to
the max and still get really really good
results and I'm not a pro gamer by any
means but I can tell you guys the
quality and performance that I was able
to get out of this guy has just been
amazing I have a few other capable
laptops that I've been taking around
with me and playing games on them but I
honestly haven't been able to push them
as much as I'm able to push the stealth
and in terms of ports you get quite a
few on the stealth on the left side
you'll see a full-blown Ethernet port as
well as two USB 3.1 ports a hi-fi
headphone jack as well as a microphone
jack and on the right side you'll get
another USB 3.1 port and a full-blown
thumb about the report as well as a mini
DisplayPort HDMI port and power port and
I really am happy to see not just a
regular USB port but a thunderbolt port
which is a very nice addition and with
the addition of a thunderbolt to report
hdmi port and the mini DisplayPort you
have the potential to connect up to
three different displace to this if
you're crazy enough and we'd like to
talk about the typing experience which I
found to be pretty comfortable this is
actually an RGB backlit keyboard
it runs the SteelSeries Engine so steel
Sirius is powering all of the RGB s each
individual key can be custom lit so you
can make all kinds of crazy designs or
you can use some of the presets that
SteelSeries comes up with within their
software and the trackpad is pretty
solid it's pretty responsive has a nice
decent size to it so it was comfortable
to use and you get some pretty decent
speakers on here they're definitely not
mind-blowing
if you want a good audio experience of
course some desk
speakers would always be the best way to
go but this does do his job so I have no
serious complaints now in terms of
battery life you're supposed to get up
to eight hours of battery I found that
through my usage I got around maybe six
to seven hours depending on what I was
doing definitely not gaming if you're
gaming on battery that number is going
to drastically change but the chances
are you're gonna be plugged in when you
want a game and if not I suggest you do
so and it's a pretty nice color accurate
display so viewing content on here is
definitely enjoyable even if it is just
1080p and for those of you who didn't
know the stealth is a Taiwan excellence
awarded product which means it went
through a ton of steps to get to judges
that will judge it on its R&amp;amp;D design
quality and even international marketing
and these guys just look through over a
thousand products to make sure only the
cream of the crop are the ones that are
awarded with this award and it made the
cut
so I'm not gonna lie I'm glad I'm not
the only one who thinks that this thing
is an awesome product I think if you go
and watch a ton of other reviews on it
you'll see that a lot of people share
the same sentiments this is honestly
just one of the best laptops that I've
used this year and if you guys want to
learn more about the Taiwan excellence
award and other cool products that were
able to get the award I'll have it
linked down below in the description for
you guys to check out and learn more but
I gotta say guys this thing has
definitely earned and secured a spot in
my gadget backpack like I said I've been
taking around for more than a month now
and I've been thoroughly enjoying it so
I'll be using it until something just as
light and thin is able to knock it off
its place but we'll see when that
happens hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video hopefully I helped if you were on
the fence about picking up one of these
but till next video guys if you enjoyed
it be the pool guy or girl that gave
this video a thumbs up I'll catch you
guys in the next one so that is your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
