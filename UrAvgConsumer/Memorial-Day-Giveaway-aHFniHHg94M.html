consumer as you can already tell by the
title of this video is going to be about
a Memorial Day Giveaway that myself and
all about Mac 27 are putting together
and we're putting this together pretty
much to give them a thanks to our
subscribers for subscribing and being
supportive and we just wanted to give
you guys a little something in return
for the feedback and all support we've
gotten from you
now what we'll be giving away are a pair
of sony MDR xb 500 headphones which is
some really nice headphones they have
some pretty good sound quality as well
as some really strong base so if you
guys can get your hands on like beads or
any of those other fancy headphones
we'll be giving you guys a nice girl
headphones that will make you forget all
about that now along with the x x.b 500
we'll also be giving away an invite
Avani envelope iPhone 4s case as well as
an iTunes gift card well not sure how
much exactly is on the iTunes gift card
but it's a nice ins gift card and it
free to use it however you want now you
might be wondering how do you enter in
this giveaway all you have to do is
subscribe to myself as well as all about
Mac 27 and comment on this video and I
think all about Nightwing 7 as a video
as well so be sure to leave a comment
there and that's pretty much all you
have to do now we want to make sure that
everyone only enters one comment at a
time to keep it even for everyone
everyone has equal opportunity to win
these headphones and other things as
well
so make sure you only leave one comment
and the way we will be choosing our
winner is by using a random number
generator on they paint on the pages of
comments that we do receive so if we
have about let's say 20 pages of comment
we'll use a random number generator to
pick between the
20 and we'll also have to use the random
number generator again to choose between
the 1 through 10 comments that will be
posted on that page so after we choose
the winner from from there we're gonna
view all comments and kind of like
control find to make sure that that
person didn't leave more than one
comment and if they did we'll move on to
the next person we're using the random
number generator so pretty much that's
how we'll be picking our winner and as
the title suggests we'll be choosing our
winner on Memorial Day or the day after
and we're hoping to have a thousand
winner I mean a thousand views on our
videos as well as about two hundred
entries if we don't have two hundred
entries or a thousand views on the video
by Memorial Day will probably extend it
a little bit to make sure that we reach
that amount just so that we can be sure
that everyone's had the opportunity to
see the video and take a chance to enter
so that's pretty much how we'll be going
about this giveaway so you'll be getting
three really nice things the headphones
the nice iPhone case as well as the
iTunes gift card so be sure to enter
guys and I wish you guys the best of
luck I'm also going to be adding some
links down in the description to kind of
point you guys in the direction of the
items so that you guys can see them out

know if you want to internet but it's
free so why not and pretty much that's
it guys we really want to thank you guys
