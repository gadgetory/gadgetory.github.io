girlfriend here re and I'm so excited to
bring to you the unboxing of the Destiny
glacier white ps4 bundle so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba so here I
have the ps4 the glacier white ps4 and
here's a box it is decked out in a
destiny theme so I just want to show you
the front of the box and then we have
the side of the box most impressive is
the back of the box look at these guys
here kind of Awesome um so that's just
like how the box select the side tells
you what's included and yeah let's get
right into it
be a trusty unboxing knife let's pop
this thing open that was seamless I
think that's the best I've ever done
okay
when it comes like this
so let's close out
Oh
I feel like I'm being tested with
something so like valuable right now ah
this is even better than the box alright
guys and before we actually emboss this
thing I have got to show you the box
it's awesome
I booked at the front you see the ps4
the main event in an attraction it's
gorgeous and then on the back you have
these characters from destiny the game
looks super super cool and gorgeous the
artwork is just really nice
so let's actually emboss it here we go
so here we go we have a box full of
stuff let's get to the easy stuff and
then we'll get to the main attraction of
course going to make you wait a little
bit so first we have the QuickStart
guide here tells you how to set
everything up and now let's get into
some of the plugs so we have the USB
port we also have
the AC power plug right here and the
HDMI port of course and then we also
have a mono headset so this is probably
not the best quality but I mean you get
a free headset not really free paper but
you get this sword in there it's pretty
cool it's nice to have two around um and
that's all the plugs we have let's go to
this controller here this controller
looks awesome look at it it's all white
with like black accents looks really
cool
let's take this guy out out of the bag
you may have it give you a little
preview of it it looks just like the
standard ps4 controller all the buttons
are the same you just have the theme the
Destiny theme with the white and black
now I'm just going to move everything
out the way so we can get to this bad
boy and now the moment you call let's
see them all so if you guys did not get
a chance to watch this p8 your options
you miss ps4 coverage you can go and
take a look at that from last year he
did a review and some other like videos
on the ps4 so you can go back there and
see that come before in boxes thing you
can see we have destiny the game so we
highly anticipated destiny games really
cool they gave this to you and kind of
like their mouths off awesome alright
what son dressed as a guy it always
feels like you're peeling off clothing
of some sort it's very weird but it's
just fun she'll so nice
ah it is gorgeous my goodness look at
this guy's this is pretty beautiful
again it's your standard ps4 it's just
white this is clean I love this this is
clean so you have your standard things
here I'll turn it around for you and it
just looks really nice like really
really cool I like it a lot
all right guys so I just gathered
everything and put it out on display for
you so it's nice and clean you can see
everything it came in the box oh and
before we go I just want to show you a
quick tour of the ps4 I'll just in case
you're not familiar with it it really is
just the same thing as the old black ps4
go into a quick tour anyway before we
start the tour the math kickin me has
got to point out this is the gorgeously
constructed device a console here it is
a beautiful parallelogram and I just I
appreciate it it's awesome let's our our
tour let's turn to the side here you
have your power button and your eject
button and right beneath that you can
see you have some USB ports turn to the
back and at the side you have all the
plugs you need for your gameplay you
have your HDMI port plug you have the
USB the power plugs everything that you
need on the back for your gameplay and
what's also cool about this even though
it has a 500 gigabyte hard drive you can
actually just pop this up it's a good
program we guys just like pop this up
and change out the hard drive for
something larger if any more space so if
you're like a heavy-duty gamer and you
need more space you have this option
right here for you so that's also really
nice you have that ability to customize
it in that way
so you guys should definitely check out
your average consumers coverage on the
ps4 he did a lot of videos he did a
review on the ps4 he the top 5 features
of the ps4 and he offered this really
cool video where he shows you how you
can actually play the ps4 on your PS
