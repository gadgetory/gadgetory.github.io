want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey everyone today I
have another unboxing here for you I'm
gonna be doing the Canon Rebel t3i let's
unbox this thing
alright so here we have for the t39
shoot some 1080p I think is 18 21
megapixels give it a good look around
the box nothing too fancy regular Kevin
box but open very top you have warranty
information software CDs some
instruction manuals comes to us when
something goes deeper see inside the box
you have your strap to go around your
neck
we've got the cork for your outlet the
powerplay which is actually pretty nice
because um usually you just have to
charge it that you plug in directly into
the wall so if you know you want to have
some space comes with some cables
clinton television this is the battery
charger like I said as you know you can
plug this directly oh actually no this
one has to use the power cord so there's
no option of plugging this directly into
the wall here you have your battery this
is the lens kit that came with it it's
18 millimeter by 18 by 55 millimeter and
here is your USB cable this is the body
itself I've been coming from nicely
wrapped oh let's go some of this manuals
are never fun so I suppose I was back
it's got a nice little cloth look like
spider webs but because I have to keep
it from getting scratched or anything
here you are
it's pretty nice feels really sturdy I
currently have the t3 and this
definitely feels a lot sturdier than the
t3 you have the swivel LCD screen the
back I like the little grips that this
has the t3 does not come with that my
actual reason for getting this um I
realized my t3 wouldn't take you know of
course it doesn't it into 1080p picture
I mean a video counter but it also could
take stills in sixteen by nine so it was
doing I think only 3 by 2 I'm not sure
that's not that's not resolution of
course but um I think that's the ratio
and 3 by 2 it doesn't come out perfectly
on all devices so I wanted to have the
option to you know go between 3.3 by 2 4
by 3 or 16 by 9 and just gave me that so
that's why I pick this up I'm just gonna
and you see a little white in the Kerr
hair marker and another one here line
them up there you go take your guy I'll
turn it on for a little bit for the
first time it's gonna ask me to set up
some stuff date and time
all right little Cardin camera but um
yeah pretty much this is it this is what
you get I really like the feel of this I
like the grips you can see the has AV
out and HDMI out
it has the nice data Mike and I guess
the remote shutter and let's see the
memory card slot goes over here on the
side
unlike the t3 the t3 you can put the
memory card along with the battery but
if they go a little differently here all
right you guys just a quick unboxing of
the Canon t3i I just want to give you
guys a look around show you what's
inside the box you get the you get the
t3i the strap the the battery charger
and cabling I've already put my battery
inside there for the USB cord and some
cables to plug it into the television
along as well as some manuals and
warranty information all right well
that's pretty much it I hope you guys
enjoyed the unboxing I'm gonna get her
cleaned up and I hope you guys rate
subscribe comment like maybe I do have
the Canon t3i in case you guys have any
questions between the t3i and the t-34
