this is the Samsung Galaxy s8 and si+
now these phones were just announced
today a Samsung unpacked event and I was
actually able to go to that event and
get some hands-on time with them myself
but if you guys want to see a giveaway
of each of these phone be sure to give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe to
the channel so that you know when that
video is happening but now let's jump
into these phones and see what's new
compared to the last generation first
thing you'll notice is that Samsung is
trying to kill all the bezels and I love
it
unlike with previous galaxy X phones
where I personally feel like Samsung
took away too much off the sides these
have the right amount I think it looks
better and it feels a lot more
comfortable to use they're actually
calling this their infinity display and
I think it has a nice ring to it
I just really love that these flagship
phones like the s8 and the LG G sticks
are trying to kill the bezels this year
but what's awesome though is that you're
still going to get access to some of
those edge features we saw on the
previous phones while still having this
new body now they really did shrink down
the bezels on the top and bottom of the
phone which kind of led to them getting
rid of the physical home button but the
bottom of the screen is actually now a
pressure-sensitive home button so it
kind of feels like there's a button
there but there's not that also means
that the fingerprint scanner got moved
to the back now I'm not so thrilled
about this because it's right next to
the camera which could lead to finger
prints on your lens which could
potentially mess up some photos or at
least add an extra step of you having to
clean off your lens before you take the
shot but this is undeniably a beautiful
phone and I like the direction Samsung
is going here they're even offering
quite a few colors like coral blue Maple
gold midnight black or two gray and
Arctic silver
so if you're looking for variety they've
got it but I'm going black though now
what's crazy is that the smaller s8 has
a 5.8 inch display and the s8 plus is
6.2 inches that's a lot of screen on a
small body I compared the SI to an
iPhone 7 plus and even though the 7 plus
is bigger the s8 had way more screen
real estate to offer and when looking at
both models of the iPhone 7 and the
Galaxy s8 is clear that the si plus is
much
bigger but what's nice is that it still
manages to be narrower than the iPhone 7
plus and not only are those displays big
but they're packing HDR so you're going
to be able to enjoy some great content
some great colors and contrast and it's
it's a galaxy phone Samsung kills it
with their displays so there's no
surprise here and when I was messing
around with the phone I was pleased with
the UI it seems super clean and snappy
of course this is one of those things
that time will tell if it's actually
legit so far I like what I see and I'm
really glad Samsung is taking a step
back when it comes to those skins now
you have your typical power button on
the right volume buttons on the left but
under that you'll also find the big
speed button when you press this button
it'll launch bixby Samsung's new smart
AI it'll pull up on its own pane which
looks very similar to Google now where
it has a ton of personalized daily
information and with time it will learn
your habits and provide information
based on your frequent activities
honestly I think it's safe to call the
Samsung version of Google now a cool
feature that I did like though is that
you can use your camera to scan objects
and Bixby will pull up information on it
once it detects it overall big speed
looks cool honestly it's nothing really
tween you here but if you're looking for
options outside of Google now hey at
least you got it I will say though I
hope we can map that button to another
feature or application in case we don't
want to use big speed now speaking of
cameras the front-facing camera was
upgraded to an 8 megapixel shooter with
autofocus so that is awesome for people
who want to take selfies again detect
your face get to a good shot in but I
didn't hear about any real significant
changes to the rear camera but hey if it
performs like last year's model I am NOT
going to complain that camera is a beast
now something new to the galaxy line is
Samsung decks by simply placing the s8
into the additional flex dock you can
turn it into a desktop PC now this is of
course running Android but it still
feels and looks like a traditional
desktop and based on the presentation of
what I saw in person it looks like
you're still going to be able to do
things like web browse and soar emails
and even work on some presentations with
no problem just the way we're used to
but what's cool is that even in this
mode you're still able to access those
Android application
the doc comes with two USB ports an
Ethernet port HDMI port and a USB C port
but that's used for charging there's
also two different versions of this dock
the standard goes to one $49.99 and the
quick charge version goes for 10 bucks
more but seriously for ten dollars more
I think the quick charge version is a
no-brainer now actually fine is really
impressive not because it's the first
time we've seen a feature like this
there's been phones that have this
feature before but what I like is that
it's on a main flagship phone that a lot
of people will get their hands on even
if you have to go out and buy the dock
people will now have that option to use
their phone as their primary computer if
they choose to which i think is actually
really cool there's other cool features
like the eye in face scanner so you can
unlock your phone or access important
apps not a lot of other phone
manufacturers aren't using right now so
it gives the Samsung Galaxy s8 a bit of
an edge when it comes to security pun
intended these are the main things that
stood out to me after checking out 2 Si
and si plus but I'm not going to lie I
was pretty excited to spend some time
with this phone I can't wait to get my
hands on it for those of you who don't
know pre-orders actually happen March
30th tomorrow so if you want to get
yours make sure you get that pre-order
in and it officially drops on the 21st
so definitely be on the lookout for that
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives it a thumbs up and make sure you
subscribe so you know what I'm going to
do that giveaway but I'll catch you guys
in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
