consumer and Black Friday is almost here
and you know what that means
booze girls so you know we all love some
discounts so I'm gonna be letting you
guys know some of the best tech deals
that I could possibly find online right
here in this video but first we've got
to give a huge shout-out to our sponsor
Canon who actually has some pretty nice
discounts themselves and poof here we
have one of canons bundles for Black
Friday
featuring the canon eos 70d now this
camera has a very very special place in
my heart because this is one of the
cameras that I started off with and I
loved it and the bungle also has some
other cool stuff like the 70 to 300
millimeter lens so this is a telephoto
lens so if you're trying to get really
close to a subject you're gonna be able
to do that with this guy and it also
comes with a speed light for 30 ex3
which is actually something that I did a
video of my very first video on I did
the second one this is the third one I
did the second one it was a car listen
that was that's a pretty bad video guys
so when you combine all three this is
the beast that you get out of it you've
got an awesome DSLR which is great for
video I personally really love that you
get some really great colors autofocus
is awesome and you also get this crazy
lens so you can get those close-up shots
like I mentioned and if you're doing
photography you've got just serious
serious flash right here the bundle also
comes with a 16 gigabyte SD card as well
as this awesome awesome bag to carry
everything in so this bundle pretty much
comes with all of the essentials that
you'll need to get started and I think
you'll save about 300 bucks but if you
use the code Black Friday 17 you'll save
an additional hundred bucks which means
you'll get 400 bucks off the entire deal
as somebody who used the Canon 70d for a
long time I think that this is a great
deal you're only gonna be able to find
it on the Canon website so definitely
check the link down below in the
description if you want to check it out
so that was a good camera option but
let's talk a bit about gaming and first
up we've got an Xbox one s and I think
you can find the Xbox one s pretty
heavily discounted at a lot of different
places you can get it for about 180
$9.99 which i think is a really good
price and depending on where
pick it up you'll be able to get
different kind of bonuses from the
Microsoft Store you'll get a free game I
think that's from a select number of
titles and you also get one month of
game pass over at Target you'll get the
same price but you get a $25 gift card
so you can either put that towards this
or something else at Target so you got
that option and I think Amazon just has
it straight up for 180 $9.99
speaking of Xbox you also got these guys
the customize control is from their
design labs you say 15 bucks on your
controller and considering that these
are customized controllers tuned to the
way you want it to be I think that's a
pretty good deal and as you can see
right here with these two controllers I
picked out the very design of this if
the teal didn't give it away but these
look great because I chose them and next
up we've got a PlayStation 4 slim which
I don't own but it is discounted at 200
bucks right now it might be a good time
for me to pick one up
so I never went for it because I have
the regular ps4 and I went to the ps4
Pro either way thank you thank you
but yeah the Black Friday sale for the
ps4 slim is a one terabyte model for 200
bucks which is $100 savings so that's
pretty nice and I believe you can get
them pretty much everywhere Amazon
target gamestop all those places and you
can even pick up a DualShock 4
controller for about 39 bucks
close to 40 bucks I feel like Walmart
has some really nice colors available
that are only on Walmart so you
definitely might want to check those out
but of course I'll have them all linked
down below and last but not least when
it comes to gaming there are some game
deals that are available there's stuff
like destiny 2 which just came out which
you can find for about 27 bucks which is
really nice and I think that even comes
with a figure Ayari there's also horizon
zero dawn that are thinking and pick up
for like 20 bucks that is a great game
there's a ton of titles I'll be sure to
have as many links to as many games that
are discounted down below so be sure to
look down below for those links I'll
give away I have a code for destiny too
I'll give one away over on Instagram
yeah so be sure to follow me on
instagram by the time you see this I'll
probably have a post for a giveaway so
be sure to stay tuned for that and now
let's talk a little bit about audio and
we'll start with one of my all-time
favorites the song
xb9 fifty and ones now this is top five
easily for me i love these headphones
and they retail for about 250 but you
can find them right now for our 179 99
but i don't even think that's a Black
Friday deal I just think they're
straight-up discounted right now which
is nice that's something that Sony does
quite a bit so this is an absolute steal
at that price because you're getting
amazing bass the bass is so good you're
getting noise cancelling you're getting
wireless Bluetooth features all the good
stuff that you want in a headphone are
right hearing this baby
and speaking of Sony headphones these
are the MDR 1000x
which typically reads up for 400 bucks
but now you can find them for Black
Friday for 228 dollars which is almost
50% off and I think it's absolutely
worth it because these are one of the
best pair of headphones that I've ever
tried they have amazing noise cancelling
they have a ton of great features and
overall I think that they just look
really good I spoken about these quite a
bit on the channel so if you want to
learn more I have video links down below
in the description there is a mark 2
version out right now but at this price
you just can't pass this up and the
brand that everybody loves to hate here
we have a pair of beats X these go for
just 100 bucks during Black Friday which
is a really really good deal not only do
these sounds really good but I like that
their design allows you to easily put
them around your neck into your ears
without you having to worry about them
falling out at all and not to mention
these have the w1 chip which means if
you have an iPhone and other Apple
products you'll be able to switch
between any of the products with only
pairing it one time but these are just a
very solid pair of headphones and I love
them and if you just can't bring
yourself to buy a pair of Beats but you
still want wireless earbuds you can
always go with these the jaybird x
threes is usually needs up for close to
200 bucks but you can find them now for
$100 which is this round same price
range SD beats X I actually did a video
comparing the jaybird X threes and the
beats X so if you need a little
something to help you choose I'll have
that video linked down below but this is
also a very good option you got 8 hours
of battery life
you got an app where you can customize
the sound these fit really well in the
ear and overall they're just a great
pair of earbuds so these are definitely
worth
look at and you know we got to talk
about some smart home gear so over here
we have the Amazon echo dot and the
Google home mini and these both retail
for about fifty bucks which is a really
good price but on Black Friday you're
gonna be able to find these for $30 and
at Target and Best Buy if you get a
Google home mini you'll also be able to
get a $10 gift card when you purchase it
which pretty much brings it down to $20
which is mind-boggling and even if
you're not big on using these for smart
home stuff you can always just ask it
questions that reminders make it call
someone you know there's a lot of good
features that come with these things
very very good options and before we
were talking about the Xbox one s and
that has 4k capabilities but you might
not have a 4k television so here are
some pretty nice deals Samsung actually
has a 49 inch television that's going
for 5 49.99 and that's actually a pretty
good deal because you've got HDR and 4k
built into it which is pretty much the
standard that you want to go for when
you're picking up a TV nowadays and if
you want to take it to the next level
and you want to get an OLED TV LG
actually has a 55 inch version that's
retailing for $1500 and that may sound
like a lot but if you saw the prices of
OLED TVs you know that's a good deal
but I know TVs are a hot item for Black
Friday so I'll be sure to include these
as well as a few more that I come across
down below in the description I'll make
sure to update the description with more
links as I find them they might not even
be mentioned in this video but if I see
a good deal I'll be sure to keep that
list updated and a deal that I found
that I actually really like is for the
Samsung gear s 3 frontier edition and
you're gonna be able to find this for
$70 off which brings it down to 2 $79.99
and while that may sound like a lot for
a SmartWatch trust me I think it's
absolutely worth it this is one of my
favorite smartwatches ever pairing it
with a galaxy device like my node 8
really ups the experience and honestly I
like it so much that I sometimes pair it
to my iPhone because I just can't let it
go so if you've been waiting for the
price to drop on this now's the time I
definitely think it's worth it and I bet
you didn't expect this one but there's
even some discounts on Apple products
B&amp;amp;H is actually having a bunch of sales
on the MacBook Pros with touch bar I
believe there's a late 2016 models but
that's what I currently still use so
that's not
problem they're really heavily
discounted and I think they have a few
bundles one of those bundles is a
15-inch MacBook Pro touch bar that also
comes with a year of Microsoft 365 as
well as these JBL Bluetooth earphones
which typically goes for twenty four
hundred dollars but you'll be able to
find them for just eighteen hundred
dollars which is a $600 savings if
you're student looking to get a macbook
pro you'll definitely want to hit a bnh
they got some really good deals and
while we're on the topic of computers
bnh has another sale for a 32 inch LG 4k
monitor and this is a pretty good deal
because you save 200 bucks and it brings
it down to 360 $9.99 I think that's a
great deal for 4k monitor especially at
32 inches that's a big old screen and
last but not least we've got the Amazon
Fire HD 8 which typically goes for a
hundred bucks
but with Black Friday sales we're
getting it for just 50 bucks and you can
find this over at Best Buy and Amazon I
have $50 that's an amazing deal and the
HD 10 is going down to a hundred bucks
so if you're someone who wants a tablet
but you just don't want to spend a lot
of money or maybe you even want to get
it for a child you can definitely pick
these up without breaking the bank those
are really great deals but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you found some of these useful
like I said definitely pay attention to
the description because I'm gonna have
links to everything and the stores that
have the best deals but I'll also be
sure to keep it updated with things that
I find throughout the week so you're
gonna want to check back in even after
you've watched this video because there
might be even more deals later so
hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guy or girl that gives this
video a thumbs up I'm gonna catch you
guys in the next one till then is your
average consumer piece somebody go buy
me something please peel boxes in my
