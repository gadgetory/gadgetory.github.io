good luck to you folks also let's see
what else do we

phones no no no we're not gonna do we're
not gonna do that yet all right so we're
gonna have like when we're picking the
winners for the giveaways it's gonna be
random we're gonna throw it all into it
we're gonna do it all into this teal
sack all right he's so hard for that
guys like it took us a good 10 minutes
room to find his bag so we got a teal
sack we're gonna be throwing some names
in it and then we're gonna be picking
our winner so uh let's get to the first
phone though
so MetroPCS since a few phones my way or
our way so that we could check out and
let's get to the first one we've got
Galaxy j7 Prime baby so have you seen
this before
well I'm not gonna just see a nice
little color yeah it's got that gold
look to it
now I'm not gonna lie to you guys I took
a peep I took if you get all the phones
so Airy hasn't seen any of them but I
definitely have to take a look at them
let's see what we've got here so when we
unbox it mmm look at that oh this is
this is nice baby pink it may be a
little bit slightly but this is this is
pretty awesome phone because you can
actually get a pretty sweet deal with
MetroPCS if you pick up one of these
guys so if you're switching over from
another carrier you unless you're with
t-mobile you'll be able to get this for
free are you with the legal but sales
tax not included and you also get a year
of prime so you get a year of prime
membership Amazon Prime and if you know
us you know listen love prime like if
that is not a deal I don't know what is
if it's not Amazon it doesn't exist so
this is the first phone this is the j7
Prime and of course I love there's some
spec heads out there who want to know
what this is all about
Xiaomi not the specs don't shame him
what there's a lot of phones here we've
got four phones to unbox they're all
different but this is not this is a
pretty cool phone though because it's a
5.5 inch display this actually is a full
HD display and what I like about this is
you can actually get this like the fact
is you can get this for free but yeah
this is the j7 prime I like this though
because and it has a nice feel in the
hand is solid and the screen looks
pretty good
look at those colors I think I'm gonna
actually use this to read review guys
comments and shoes gonna be smart smart
so we're gonna grab comments and
everything from here and then whoever is
leaving a comment will just throw it
into the hat from break this guy that's
awesome alright cool
no all right so for some of the specs
we've got a 5.5 inch display Full HD
like I said no you know what I like is
that I think this thing has a it doesn't
say here I know I I don't remember the
milliamp hours off the top of my head
but what I like about the budget phones
how many phones do this anymore you
can't take off the back and get into the
battery so this thing has a removable
battery that you can always throw in add
another battery whenever your phone's
dying this video is actually timed
perfectly and I think about it because
it's supposed to happen a little bit ago
but the fact that is happening so close
to Christmas is awesome for those of you
who try to have a budget yes that's not
what you got a little little money to
spend or even not if you've done since
you got these awesome deals that you can
jump in and you know grab your free so
the comments the questions are coming in
make sure you guys are asking some more
in hashtagging it Metro contest and
we're going to go through listen Lucy
yeah okay we also have
how long does it take to make a video
and this is a shout to Peter if I
butcher your name I'm so sorry
Peter Rumeli Otis how long does it take
to make a video it listen it all depends
yeah
a video can take so many hours but now
that I have a very on board it's
actually a little bit easier having
someone on the team don't get full use
it but it can it can honestly range from
a few hours if it's an easy video to
maybe even taking a full day like start
to end multiple days I also think it's
because we tend to like get off track to
we just have too much fun doing the
video you guys write me on social media
what can I say
my ghosts are like 9 a.m. and then like
by the time it's too early so I mean a
video usually takes about maybe a few
hours I'd say at least 12 or so yeah
however that spread out throughout the
two days next oh this is a good question
this is from NASA Trinidad what is your
favorite Tech ever ever I can't I can't
answer that that's tough that's like
really really hard I think mine has to
be my smartphone like definitely I mean
that's like a tablet I have a laptop but
99% of the time I'm on my smartphone
it's definitely a piece of text boring
but I said my phone is probably second
to my laptop camera huh oh I like this
if you could switch places with any tech
youtuber who would it be
Jimmy 89
I would say Austin Evans you want to
know why why because he already got to
play with all the phones and so on so he
already knows all the awesome stuff that
we've got going on over here so what's
Austin I would say Marquez because he
has that longing for TV no it's because
he's tall and you're like super short I
think at some height though that's fire
don't start anything guys all right so
we got the Jason prime MetroPCS also has
a few other phones they've actually got
quite a quite a few deals actually if
you want to pick up some of those phones
let me actually let you guys know I'm
sorry he's seeing a little bit ahead of
himself you guys came here probably for
a giveaway and he forgot to give away
okay how could how can I forget so we
got to pick one out there here's the
bags deal like I say and we're gonna
pick gem row please oh this person right
here oh we should say what they're
winning uh-oh
right hmm I got the goods over here
let's see I think let's go with this guy
now just to let you guys know we're
giving away all of my personal favorite
pieces attacked so you guys gonna be
seeing or using or winning what I love
to use on a daily basis so let's see
we've got here the Bose Soundlink mini 2
which is going to be an awesome awesome
gift but let's see who our winner is
Slayer Alex 94 and you've also got a
question here so let's see if you had if
you had to use one of these phones as a
daily driver which would it be
you know what honestly I think it'd have
to be the j7 prime I mean I haven't seen
the other ones so I
no no no the other ones are awesome but
the j7 Prime is kind of nice because
like I said you've got that awesome
display
you've got the removable battery a lot
of these actually a lot of these budget
phones have removable batteries which is
awesome and something you're not seeing
at the Crazy
super-expensive you know super high
expensive tiers so this is functionality
that we're actually seeing on the budget
phone that we just lost on the higher
end so I think that's awesome
but you guys you what is the name super
slick layer Alex 94 you win this and I
would definitely be going with the j7
Prime but we do have a really cool
runner up though in terms of a phone
that I would pick as a daily driver and
just so you guys know this is not there
anyone you'll be getting oh god there's
a brand new one this is just his
personal ones yeah yeah we have a brand
new one that we'll be shipping out so
Alex Slayer Slayer
Alex 94 make sure you're checking your
DMS because I think you have now at this
point 10 minutes so yeah you've got 15
minutes to respond to the message and if
you don't answer within 15 minutes we're
just gonna select a new winner but
hopefully you're paying attention and
you answered the DM now one thing I want
to mention is that metro pcs we actually
we actually did videos with metro pcs
phones in the past which was really
awesome it offers what is it it covers
99% of the US population so that's
insane and we actually remember when we
were so shocked when we did the speed
test yes yeah if you mention veryvery
what was it it was a real day in the
life video we were parked somewhere we
did a speed test
I forget the phone so we did a speed
test and we hit like a crazy number and
we were just like what yes sometimes I
think people sleep on it but those
numbers were better than those it was
pretty amazing so let's get onto the
next phone let's see what we've got over
here oh you're gonna like this one area
yeah you're going to like this one
so we're gonna keep this one over here
so right here we've got the LG k 20 plus
this this phone I'm telling you guys
take a look at this attic I see some
copper
yeah that's pretty looks awesome this is
pretty you know what to do with all the
stuff that he gets guys sometimes if
he's not giving away I just take it for
myself and you know what she does with
them absolutely nothing it collects dust
no that's not sure I use I use a lot of
stuff I do I know yeah okay so one thing
that's cool about metro pcs is that you
get four you can get four lines for
isn't this that's pretty nuts I don't
think I've seen any I don't know I think
that's like probably one of that's an
awesome deal yeah especially you
consider that it's unlimited LTE that's
makes it a really really good deal yeah
and you can choose from one I think like
Samsung phones LG so I could get bunch
of different carriers so yeah if you're
switching so if you switch to metro pcs
you can get four lines for under 100 but
for a hundred bucks which is just sick
so this is but now this one has a 5.3
inch display it's an IPS display which
is really awesome it's also got 32 gigs
of the storage fingerprint scanner so
that's what I like you're still able to
get phones that are very inexpensive but
with some of the best features that we
expect from you know all the highest
top-end smartphones today gotta say I do
miss being able to unlock my phone with
my finger yeah the fingerprint scanner
is it's it's awesome I think it I feel
like it's a must and it's cool to see it
on a phone that's super affordable yeah
now one thing to talk about this as well
is that it has a/c
you know what no nevermind I'm changing
your answer from the j7 I'm wondering
like do I want like this form looks
awesome but the j7 is like legit okay I
think the fingerprint scanner makes the
fingerprint scanner is an awesome
feature that's a must but uh I don't
know I love the look of Vista what do
you think I mean I like it too I mean I
just love this standard color
yeah I do miss this color to like nice
bright colors on my phone that date
doesn't really matter because I put a
cover on it but yeah missing grippy good
thing is these phones are usually more
durable you know they're look it's
grippier it's not like the glass that
you know usually slipped out of
everyone's hands they're grippier the
materials that it's made out of just
last a bit longer yeah I mean either way
you're good with everywhere you get you
four phones for a hundred bucks yeah
yeah so you want to throw in some
questions
oh yeah I'll check the you want to read
it no go ahead take my job all right all
right go ahead
Oh such good questions um oh when did
you first get into tech and why shout
out Heather Krauss first question is
hack oh man I've been intact for a while
but I would say in high school is really
when I kind of went nuts with it when I
got my first smartphone you couldn't
tell me I wasn't the man if you guys
have seen
like my high school tech man I've been
telling you I was the man with the phone
I was rocking back then but no seriously
I've I think high school of the years
and years ago phones were just starting
to really blow up they weren't as big as
you know I'm not that old
they were like small compact and that's
when I really started falling in love
with tech starting to see phones like
when I started seeing phones evolved I
honestly just couldn't wait to see what
was coming out next and that's what
always grabbed my attention I'd argue
though your phone wasn't your favorite
piece of tech back in high school like
you were a heavy heavy gamer with Final
Fantasy like you were you were yeah I
was I was big on the gaming I was big on
the gaming but I don't know
I think phones are what really brought
me into the tech world I feel like
dancing like gaming and you know tech
are the same but they're also kind of
different throw me another one thanks
for your question Heather shout-out
superpower hey thanks for watching
because girls like texting um
whoo okay let's see hmm this is a good
one this is by Damian Cady face ID or
touch ID well we kind of just said it uh
having that fingerprint scanner it's a
it's convenient man it's really
convenient and that's why I'm so I love
it when you can get it on a phone that's
super affordable being able to just
press the button just press the
fingerprint scanner unlock your phone I
mean it's super convenient I have to
agree I do miss touch ID but I think
these IDs is a good concept and maybe
like that share to be even faster and
better I do
I kept it I can't even lie I really do
miss touch ID fingerprint scanners all
the way to go give away my other phone
tuned up so sad because I won't have
access to that anymore
all right last question okay um
for the section we'll come back to q and
A's
ooh which piece of tech that you guys
unbox has been the most memorable shout
outs who Sully
Dulli ELISA nice name sullied led so the
most memorable that you know what
honestly I think it was a mattress
really yeah it was that I guess this
technically tech is the technology they
use in it but that matches that it blew
up out of when it came out of the box
I've never seen a mattress come in a box
and when we took it out it just blew up
I think that was kind of Awesome yeah
what would you say is the most
interesting piece attack piece of tech
oh I mean I think the the presentation
of the Xbox that you got was like really
cool because it was like a game I think
that was pretty memorable you don't you
don't forget that oh yeah that was
special
yeah that was definitely special so
let's see what else
and one more oh cool
Seifer 1571 if you could grab different
aspects from different phones which
would you incorporate into your own
design okay so different aspects okay so
a bezel is display for sure I would
definitely say a bezel is display a
fingerprint scanner on the back
headphone jack because it baffles me
that we keep losing the headphone jack
with a lot of phones
this phone of course still has the
headphone jack is that one of the phones
that just went on yeah yeah okay cool so
you know these phones work but yeah I
have to have a headphone jack honestly
those are like the main pieces I would
love to have the bezels display
fingerprint scanner maybe a camera that
does all the like you know facial
scanning stuff but the headphone jack
and USB type-c those are the kind of
things that I would really really want
in a powerful speaker oh it's coming
with the bag again this time this time
what are we gonna give away a portable
charging yes yeah I wouldn't be me if I
didn't talk about one you liked it too
well I mean let's get it
so we have right here you see we've got
the Aki thirty thousand milliamp hour
portable charger now I love these
because everybody loves their phone
we're all glued to it all day or you
know we're using it 24/7 and if it dies
on you you're pretty you know upset so
with a portable charger you never really
have to worry even if you see your
battery running low it's just it's nice
to feel safe what a portable charger and
something with 30,000 milliamp hours
you're gonna be charging your phone over
and over let me talk to your friends
phone you recharge your mom's phone you
guys know how much he loves portable
charger I can go on and on about this he
has been ranting about the fact that you
know the book backpacks can't have
built-in portable chargers or the oh
yeah he's been like oh I think you don't
like you you need to take a day off it
sucks but this is what we're gonna be
giving away I think this is an awesome
probably one of my favourite portable
targets ever so let's see which lucky
person is going to get it and again
you'll be getting this dusty one can get
a brand new you'll get a brand new one
and remember you're gonna get a message
letting you know that we're giving away
this item and then you got it respond
within 15 minutes or we're gonna pick
someone you so watch your okay I'll go
pick them I'll pick one look at you yeah
oh yeah so let's see here
you doing all right you did all right
listen his whole crew back there Jimmy
I'll see you buddy
see Jimmy teach me your ways and teach
me your ways all right so let's see all
right so we have Heather crosses Krauss
okay have a Krauss congratulations you
get this but you also have a question
here when did you get the second one you
said high school I didn't even really I
didn't read the question first now okay
well Congrats Heather tell me that's not
luck we randomly pick the question the
answer and you randomly got soco's into
window and fries and I'm seeing people
just hashtagging Metro contest please
make sure you are leaving a comment or a
question you got it you got ad to
comment or other question so have there
two for two
congratulations alright so we got our
winner there hopefully respond now let's
jump into the next unboxing see I told
you I'm not old but um mention pcs sent
us this the galaxy j-3 prime so this is
like the little brother to the j7 prime
now this is great because if you're
opening if you're switching over to
metro pcs and you've got your four lines
maybe you have you know kids you got
some you know younger people who want to
have a phone but you don't want to break
the bank
yeah this is what you're looking at
parents this is what I would get for
like you are your middle schoolers at
under yes I can't stand when I see like
12 year olds and 13 year old rocking the
crazy expensive seriously you know they
don't have the right grades the math no
offense to all the 12 year olds another
driver watching you should be in school
though
but yeah this is definitely a great
option especially if you're considering
a family plan this is definitely
something you want if you've got like
those younger kids this one is in the
more traditional color about the black
but you see how similar they look they
look almost exactly alike but this one
is the little brother it's smaller so
how big is this display it's a 5-inch
display compared to a 5.5 inch display
that we see on the j7 prime so this one
is still easy to use you hold it in one
hand with no problem little hands big
hands shouldn't be an issue
actually think this would be better for
me cuz you got tinier yeah you either
one you'll probably be fine but this is
like I said great for pretty much
anybody who wants to just use a phone
one especially one-handed and this is
one of the options for the four lines
400 bucks mm-hmm yeah so and that's
what's great you got options from
Samsung LG options are you changing your
favorite yet I'm not changing my
favorite I'm not gonna lie that it is a
battle between the LG and the j7 the j7
I feel like is the big boy here
especially when you get back Amazon
Prime I'm telling you guys if you switch
over to MetroPCS and you get a j7 you
get that Amazon Prime deal like I hope
our parents our families aren't watching
because like let me just just what their
Christmas could have some time makes
that all possible so yeah it's awesome
that MetroPCS is offering that so the j7
I mean the j-3 is like I said little
brother to it a great option I think so
let's see this is a 5-inch display this
is a 5.3 inch display and a 5.5 inch
display so you got a range you got papa
mama and the baby brother
it's like the berenstain bears well you
wanna drop it in might as well use it
we've got yeah and we just want to see
what the giveaways to at the end of the
sections it's like I think mostly all of
them came from the favorite of the month
videos oh absolutely because they're all
my favorite pieces of tech so things

awesome phones all right what is what is
the most expensive tech I've ever bought
my new camera
I'm still eating beans guys listen it
was expensive but it's worth it I think
so yeah I know but you know what's not
expensive these metro pcs phones yeah
like that I do yeah
when I think my most expensive piece of
tech hats have had been for him I think
it was would you get me your chair is
that tech I don't know I spent that much
on the chair probably the table your
motorized desk oh I also bought a lens
back in the day listen
either way expensive all right let's get
another one ooh if you weren't doing
tech videos on YouTube what would you be
doing this is from Dez so if I wasn't
who knows really back in the day I was a
Quality Assurance analyst which was a
very very boring job but you know I've
always had this love for tech so
thankfully I was able to branch out but
I might have been still doing that
that's what I did when after I graduated
college so who knows what that would
have evolved into it could have been
anything but all I know is it was a
pretty boring job and I'm glad I am
doing this with you guys
yeah actually like that you kind of like
slid in after you graduated college
because people tend to think that like
he didn't graduate college but he and I
are both called Brad so let's see should
we one more question let's do a few more
okay I would
answer if I weren't doing tech videos
because I'm okay
I could tell them that go on
fun fact I don't how many people know
this it see I'm important to fun fact I
actually should be an algebra teacher
yeah for five years I taught algebra to
eighth graders your teacher yeah yeah
your absolute favorite kind and that
doesn't mean that you guys need help
with math problems you start know you
know you know what kind of math mean you
talk about some specs some deals from
MetroPCS well let's do one more question
okay um did you work because you have to
work ooh
from sod Tech what is your favorite
backpack that's not fair I have a what's
in my gadget backpack video coming up
but I'm going to say that in case
backpack I used in my last one
amazing backpack great it has so much
storage can carry phones no problem
it can carry all kinds of tech so uh I
like I like that one the most I would
say I feel like you you keep like
wanting to go back to that one and yeah
yeah it's a great it's a great backpack
yeah Oh what pair of headphones are
using are you using the most right now
okay
so that is an awesome Segway I can just
show you guys so right here excuse me
our next giveaway yeah you like that
right so over here we've got D Sony xb9
50 n ones and this is the next giveaway
prize so we're gonna pick one lucky
winner to get one of these but this is
an amazing headphone it has a ton of
base which I'm personally a fan of is
bluetooth so all those phones without
headphone jacks
you can use it with this
thankfully all the phones down here have
headphone jacks
I listen they all work they all do it so
if you want to use the cable that comes
with this you can do that too but this
is definitely one of my favorite
headphones probably the one I'm using
the most and let's see if we can pick
somebody to win them just count it - oh
yeah yeah yeah there they can be
expensive at full retail but you get
from pretty cheap okay so we have NASA
Trinidad isn't the thing we pick this
person did he yeah
did we pick the answer this question doc
collection oh we still win the game this
is awesome but what is your favorite
tech ever yeah so I mean congrats - for
- yeah alright so NASA you get to win
the Sony xb9 50 and once these you're
gonna love these I love these you're
gonna love them too but let's talk about
last one the next phone yeah we got a do
it
are you ready for this one area yeah I
don't think she's ready for it guys
I'll wait come on over so right here
we've got the Moto e for now what I love
is that you're able like you sometimes
forget how good the phones can be at the
lower price ranges and this is like I
feel like the perfect example Motorola
really kills it when it comes to
inexpensive phones and it's pretty great
that you're able to get them on if you
switch over to metro pcs is you can get
the family lines the four lines for
under 100 bucks
for a hundred bucks and this is part of
it so that's really great that's really
really good that my dad would jump on
that no heartbeat listen if he's
watching my mentor switch you already
know so this is the Moto e 4 this is a
solid smart phone turn out it's got that
gold look to it so you know I don't
think we've had one of these in this
video we haven't gotten a Motorola phone
in a while so it is great to see ya know
no fingerprint scanner but that I mean
honestly that's fine and with the size
that it comes in I feel like this is
also something that would be great for
you know someone younger even if you
don't have to be younger than appreciate
it
but I just feel like it would be a great
option for that as well especially
because of the build quality
I feel like this thing is a tank this
thing can handle a couple fault I want
you honestly out of all of these phones
I rock all of these phones without a
case yeah right especially this one is
nice and like the grip that texture has
the grip even though this is the LG K 20
plus is a bit on the thinner side in
comparison to some of these it has that
grippy back which allows you to use it
with one hand with no problem
gonna slip out this too sick I think for
like sometimes with like lower budget
phone sometimes the screens aren't the
best but when I'm looking at these
things really that is one thing as well
yet all of these screens have been
really vibrant yeah and they look good
so that's one thing yeah he's definitely
I don't think that they're lacking in
terms of quality they're think this is
solid so the Moto e for let's see where
some of the specs are here so let's see
we've got a five blade just like this is
a five inch display of course got the
eight megapixel rear camera five
megapixel front facing camera 16 gigs of
storage 2 gigs of RAM so I mean this is
this is gonna do whatever you really
throw at it unless it's like super super
crazy which is you know finest I feel
like anybody who picks this up it's
gonna be able to do what they need to do
no problem so your social media all that
good stuff yeah and of course since uh
MetroPCS covers 99 percent of the US
population
you know like that yeah sure all right
so I think that was our last phone yeah
so this is awesome so this is pretty
much the lineup guys so we've got the
Samsung j7 Prime but don't leave yeah
because we still have another giveaway a
Q&amp;amp;A but we've got the Samsung j7 Prime
you've got the LG k 20 plus and the
Samsung j-3 prime lower brother to the
j7 and of course we've got the Moto e 4
so all very solid
these are definitely like honestly could
you imagine like just during the
holidays somebody coming home with this
for the family yeah free free phones you
know I switch over and you get all of
these just like that yes yeah the j7
comes with one year of Amazon Prime if
you switch over from another carrier and
it actually you got it for free if you
switch over from another carrier
if you're not with t-mobile if you don't
come from t-mobile so this is actually
just tons of great savings all around
tons of good stuff here yeah so we're
gonna have a nice a nice little Q&amp;amp;A
session so make sure you guys are still
giving in those comments and of course
you know you guys gotta use the hashtag
Metro contest to make sure that you guys
are eligible to win one of the prizes
cool
so we'll go right into the Q&amp;amp;A and then
we're gonna do the giveaway so then this
one is by I think Michael bacon
Michael bacon I like that too what's the
question what is your favorite non tech
activity my favorite non tech activity
oh that's that's easy I like building
Gundam the model kits super nerdy it's
all good but I like putting them
together I feel like it's really
relaxing being able to see little pieces
come together and make these awesome
robots which is still kind of tech
related but you know I love that thank
you
I have quite a bit of an obsession with
like a handbag collection the collection
so I to browse this account from
browsing forums online
that's not tech activity using tech but
for a non tech product yes like going on
forums and looking at like the latest
things or things on a limited edition I
like to still have browse and
window-shop
and then sometimes I'll actually step
out into the real world and look at look
at she likes vitamin D you guys she
doesn't go oh what we also like you guys
if you guys follow us on Twitter or
Instagram then you know this we love
going into like into restaurants to get
like ramen or bubble tea yeah that's
that that like honestly that's like our
favorite thing to do yeah if we have an
hour to spare we're like let's go curry
I want to go back to Japan so bad
yeah that would be nice that would be
very nice if you guys are interested in
like a unique Japanese tech kind of
video let us know we can definitely next
time we go we want to go in like
February March we can jump we try to
make some really cool video yeah what do
you think about air pods
this is by alina highs I can't use them
honestly they have weird ears guys they
fall right out yeah
funny story a company actually used my
ears as a marketing tool as a marketing
tool because I can't hold earbuds in my
ears yeah they stole it from John's
video and put it into their little like
promotional video you guys know I was on
it I escaped up the most legal counting
yeah it was pretty rough but yeah I I
don't I can't give an opinion because I
can't use them yep I love mine mine
thinks they charge for pretty long run
of time I love having the case to put in
them and I have mine customized so this
makes it extra special
mmm I don't ever use any other
headphones or earbuds with that um what
oh are you a case guy or a skin guy ah I
think it depends if I really want to get
a feel of the phone if I really want to
just feel the you know the way it is I
think a skin is nice typically I go for
a case as a slim as it can possibly be
just so I don't add so much bulk that's
why I kind of like the idea of skins but
a a case that doesn't add too much bulk
is something I gravitate towards because
I like to protect my stuff too yeah like
when you see a nice little fantasy skin
you tend to go towards it yeah I'm
definitely case all the way I'm clumsy I
can't take any kind of dispersing that's
why with these phones you don't have to
worry as much natural pcs has those
phones that can take a beating all of
these right here next question what is
the best
to the speaker of 2017 oh that's a pens
you tested so many this I know but it
all it honestly really just depends on
what kind of quality you're going for if
you're going for like a giant Bluetooth
speaker if you're going for one of those
super small ones let's say sub $100 sub
100 bucks
that's that's tough I don't know I
really like that little I like this
little Sony I forget the model number
but yeah yeah well either way i like i
like that speaker i think i think that's
a pretty legit one cool see what else we
got here oh and that was from your boy
your boy which has the best camera which
has the best camera on these phones for
vlogging oh let's see
well let's see the highest rated in
terms of megapixels oh you know what
let's just do a straight-up selfie test

selfie I listen she will not waste an
opportunity at all all right let's do it

facing the camera to have your picture
taken out there for us today seven right
there hey J seven I see you yeah this is
how it goes in the line oh I like this
that's cute I like sometimes I'm like
with the selfie camera is a little bit
softer because you know hides of
blemishes doesn't have a special Oh show

with this one yeah and okay and then
it'll be the last one and then we'll
tell you which one is the best one one
