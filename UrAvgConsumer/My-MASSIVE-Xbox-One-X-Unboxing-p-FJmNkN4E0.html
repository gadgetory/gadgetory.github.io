and today we have a very very special
box here
it's from our buddies over at Microsoft
and the title gives it away you know
it's inside of here I stopped playing
now I don't have my typical unboxing
knife so I got to use like one of my
gundam swords so let's see if we can get
this open I am so excited for this it's
not too bad oh it says Xbox already Oh
see I thought there was gonna be a box
inside of here to get to the actual
retail box but this is the this is it oh
this is official I never get excited for
booklets oh but this is dope so this
tells you everything there is this is
probably the reviewers guide but all
right so books with all the details here
this is not the retail packaging that
you'll probably see in stores this is a
little bit different but uh it's an Xbox
one nonetheless okay so we got a little
bit more here so over here on the left
side we've got what is this car these
cards okay okay so it's got this welcome
card saying welcome to the Xbox one X
and it's oh these are cards that show
all of the games that are gonna be
supported in 4k now of course the Xbox
one X is extremely powerful it's gonna
be able to support true 4k so no upscale
and none of that mess this is the real
deal
so you've got all the games here that
are gonna be Xbox one X enhanced holy
mess I just realize all these cards not
only do they give the details they have
the codes so that I can go and download
them all this is all these are a lot of
games here that's a lot of games okay so
that's nuts I'm gonna have a fun time
downloading all of these so just to give
you guys an idea of which Xbox one games
are gonna be Xbox one X in hand we've
got Assassin's Creed origins Call of
Duty World War two destiny to Disneyland
adventures FIFA 18 Forza Motorsport 7
Gears of War 4 halo 3 halo 5 guardians
halo wars 2 holy crap killer instinct
definitive edition madden 18 shadow of
war minecraft russia pixar and disney
adventure quantum break report
definitive edition Star Wars Battlefront
2 Super Lucky's tale and zoo tycoon
ultimate animal collection wow that's a
lot of games this is insane so those are
the games that we've got here
that's gonna be nuts Wow now I'm not
really sure how well you guys got to see
the layout but here it is the second
thing we have over here is a 4k blu-ray
disc now not only can this thing play 4k
games but it is also a 4k blu-ray player
so over here we've got Planet Earth -
this is 4k support HDR because the One X
supports HDR and all that good stuff you
know planet Earth looks really good the
directors on this some crazy shots in
here but this is like the perfect
blu-ray to show off what this powerful
media player is capable of a C in this
third panel we've got okay Xbox Live
Gold Edition code here three months
another three months some Netflix codes
over here to Spotify EA access and Dolby
Atmos yeah man they really want us to
experience all the different aspects of
what this guy is capable of so thank you
Microsoft
you've got anything else over here no so
the thing Connect uh-ho-ho
okay so like I said this is the
reviewers package here but you also have
the retail box this is it this is what
you'll get in stores oh man so this is
the retail packaging guys but funny
enough while my friends over at
Microsoft hooked me up I actually bought
one of these myself so what do I do with
the second one you know what I'm told is
a second when I'm giving one away so if
you guys want a chance at winning one of
those be sure to stay tuned for the next
Xbox 1x video that I do so you got to
make sure that you're subscribed and got
to hit that notification bell when you
subscribe to so you know when that video
drops but I I'm excited let's get this
thing open right all right Gundam knife
let's do this so first off we're
presented with this little tab here so
we've got our paperwork I see what else
yeah so we've got our HDMI cable and
you've also got the 1x controller and
the power cable now what's great is that
there's no huge power brick here
it's that standard little cable you just
plug into the back which is a very nice
touch now from the looks of it this
seems like a pretty standard controller
I'm glad they didn't switch it up though
because I have a lot of controllers at
home I want to be able to use them just
the way I would use this one all right
so we've got all our stuff here the last
but not least we've got our 1x and man
this thing is so much heavier than the
1s it's crazy it's smaller like slightly
smaller but so much heavier and that's
because of all those crazy components
inside of here ready for the unveiling
a drumroll all right hit me one area you
coming over yes okay it's a big deal
folks all right so give me with that
drum roll baby right
this baby is Purdy so this is it this is
the 1 X it is tiny little body but let's
take a look at everything that we have
here yes it does is it's crazy because
even though it looks kind of similar to
the 1 s it feels sexier because we know
it's so much stronger all right guys I
think it's pretty safe to say that this
is a massive xbox 1x unboxing we've got
the 1x itself we've got its cable
controller this one Xbox 1x guide the 4k
blu-ray 20/20 freaking games and we also
have xbox live subscriptions and like
Spotify EA access Dolby Atmos oh oh you
know I'm missing my hard drive I'm gonna
go find it alright guys so over here
I've got a 4 terabyte Seagate hard drive
which is supposed to hold all of my
games even though this has a 1 terabyte
hard drive inside of it
storing your games on here will make
your system a lot better simply because
there won't be a bunch of games taking
up space in your heart so I'm making it
work a little bit harder if you offload
them all onto this hard drive
maybe the game says you don't play as
much as you would play some of your
favorites you could throw them on here
and having something like this also
makes it easier to transfer between
systems so you can transfer from
maggin transfer from my old xbox right
over to the 1x with no problem oh and
this one comes with two three months of
the Xbox game pass so if you guys want
the link to this particular hard drive
I'll have the link down below
as well as the 1x and I would be just
crazy if I didn't show you guys a
comparison between the Xbox 1s and the
Xbox one and when you've got a stock
like this you can definitely say they
came a long way from the original Xbox
one it's so much smaller but when
compared to like the 1s it's a bit wider
it comes out a little bit more on the
wide end but it's actually shorter than
the 1s when you've got them side-by-side
so like I said slightly smaller than the
1s but it is still heavier then you'll
notice here that they have vents on the
tops of the Xbox one and the 1s but they
don't have that here with the X the
vents are actually on the sides so I
actually like that in case you want to
stack something on top of it or maybe
just play something on top you don't
have to worry about cutting off the
ventilation and inside of this guy we've
got a 6 teraflop GPU 12 gigs of gddr5
Ram also a custom 8 core CPU clocked at
2.3 gigahertz so all crazy crazy specs
for a gaming console and for all of our
average folks out there who don't know
what these specs mean what they
translate to into the real world is
smoother gameplay faster load times
bigger worlds and a lot more detail and
developers are really gonna love this
guy since they can go nuts and they have
a lot more power to access so that they
can make the games look as good as we
want them to now in terms of the i/o
that you get onto 1x you'll get your
power adapter you have two HDMI cables
of course so you can plug in something
else like a cable box you also have two
USB ports and I are out as well as an
optical cable input and then you have
your Ethernet input and you've also got
another USB port right here up front now
I did get to try this out back in like
June at e3 but I can't wait to actually
use it here in the USC gamers paradise
so it's time I love this guy up alright
so I got this baby in hand all the
cables are ready so Simon put this in
have to join the gamers paradise if you
haven't seen the gamers paradise I have
the link down below in the description
all right I guess all guys turn it on
all right
