savage consumer and today we're gonna be
talking about some of the worst tech
that I've come across and actually got a
recommendation from one of you guys and
it's pretty bad
so guys right here we've got the Emerson
Bluetooth stereo earbuds the worst
headphones you could possibly buy so
these are actually one of the
recommendations that I got from one of
you guys I heard it was terrible so I
ran and scooped it up and you did not
lie my friend so let me just read off
some of the features I got the box right
here premium sound that's a lie there
are light well that makes sense because
they're cheapest high-definition
wireless sound another freaking lie they
just wriggle I answer calls while
listening to music aluminum casing for
modern look yeah you're gonna look real
modern with teens and blah blah blah a
bunch of other lives now you know what
they didn't feature on this a play and
pause button how the heck are you
supposed to use Bluetooth earbuds
without a play and pause button now I
could be wrong I gave these a solid
tried press all the buttons I could to
stop the horrible sound that came from
it and I couldn't do it I have to
actually use my phone which defeats the
purpose of having a bluetooth earbud and
that baffles me
why isn't there playing pause button now
you do get volume controls so you know
that's a plus now I tried this out
briefly to see how horrible they were
and I honestly could not believe my ears
so I stopped listening and we're gonna
give it a full listen right now alright
so I'm gonna play some humble I'll see
the case it's next don't worry oh my
gosh oh my god
just like turns your music bag let me at
least try something else
everybody likes this song huh shape of
you why not
okay why why would anyone do this to a
paying customer it's not right Emerson
I'm calling you out you know when you're
a kid and you got that experiment where
you got two cups in a string and you're
trying to spy on somebody put against
the door you try to hear how it sounds
think of that but 10 times worse these
are absolutely be worse sounding
headphones or earbuds I've ever heard in
my life hey peace I hate you so much
figure money folks oh don't think I
forgot about this this had to make the
list this is what what what I even call
I don't care what they're calling it
this is the worst case ever why this
should not count as a case what this is
trying to prove I don't know I would
rather get a sheet of paper and wrap it
around my phone than to use these - this
offers no protection it looks ridiculous
the cut like they don't even match they
don't even match why if this ball s8 is
done I gotta find out how much pot ah
okay this seems 20 bucks so let's put
that into perspective folks you got ten
bucks down here and you got ten bucks up
here screw your essay over for 20 bucks
you know what this kind of reminds me
else you don't wonder is like a naked
character on a cartoon and they usually
have like the little leaves to cover the
top and bottom or maybe just the bottom
that's what you're getting right here
you're still freakin naked there's no
point now I expect this from some
no-name companies we just want to fix
you no no I take it back I expect this
from no one this is just a bad decision
I do see one one act maybe two reasons
why you would pick this up one and a
practical joke for a friend who just got
it or maybe two you really want someone
to know how much you hate them
nevermind the fact that you just kind of
peel it off with these stickers and last
up guys we've got the music angel now
you might have seen this in a lot like I
did a long time ago my first massive
Gadget Hall whatever I picked it up I
unbox it there I thought it was so cool
everybody was doing these levitating
speakers they were a short but cool
little trend and I'm really thinking oh
that's so cool this could be a nice
decorative and functional piece to my
office why not
unbox therapy has this cool levitating
speaker Oh
m'kay PhD has this cool levitating
speaker your average consumer goes and
buys it and the thing won't be worth so
I try over and over and over to get this
thing to stay in its spot and it just it
won't do it listen I've tried every way
possible holding it in place really
still and trying to get my hand like it
just won't do it
oh god this is like the most fun size
okay oh oh you see some type you just
got to get a little savage with it so
essentially guys you're paying for an
$80 speeder that sounds really great
caller there's 80 bucks
I took a massive L so let's be clear
this is the music angel just throw some
text on there to be very sure don't buy
it
why didn't I return it because it worked
for a little bit at first and then it
decided no you know what I don't want to
levitate screw you UAC so hopefully you
guys enjoyed if you did be the cool guy
girl that gets us to go thumbs up be
sure to let me know what other tech
products are terrible that you've tried
out that I should go pick up those
Bluetooth earbuds were great
recommendations let me know some more
down below and I'll catch you guys in
the next one so then it's your average
consumer your stop your cyber consumer
