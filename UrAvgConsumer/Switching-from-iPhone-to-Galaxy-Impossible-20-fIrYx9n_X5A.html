consumer and if you've been a subscriber
since about may have earlier this year
you might have seen a video of my way I
switch from an iPhone over to the Galaxy
s8 enough to weren't making it my daily
driver
boom it's in there I gotta admit guys
I'm nervous and while I had a ton of
success with that I did run into some
issues due to some things I overlooked
so for today's video I want to show you
guys some of the best and easiest things
to do if you want to make the same
switch and huge shout out to Samsung and
Google for the paid partnership but
let's take a look at how to make that
switch so the first thing you're gonna
want to do is remove your phone number
from your iMessage and Apple ID I didn't
do this when I first switched and it
caused me a lot of issues so you're
definitely gonna want to do that and
this is especially important if you
happen to be in a group chat with a
bunch of other iMessage users once you
disassociate your number you're gonna be
able to have that same group when you
get to your new phone now another thing
you're gonna want to keep in mind are
your photos I know a lot of people are
probably fearful of switching to another
device because they feel like they'll
lose all their photos and memories but
there's an easy solution for that and
that's with downloading Google photos
alright guys so this right here is a
must so this is Google Photos I always
make sure that I have Google photos up
and syncing all the photos that I take
so that whenever I'm back on my note 8 I
have access to all the photos that I
took so you can see everything is just
right here and I've got a ton of my
photos here it even dates back to like
2013 look at young Airy look at you so
with that there's really no need to
worry all the photos that were on my
iPhone are now on my know date and of
course photos and videos aren't the only
things we keep on our phone so if you're
worried about your files and documents
you can also use Google Drive to keep
everything all in one place and not only
is it great to have Google Drive on your
phone for making the switch but you can
access it on any computer as well so any
documents or anything important that you
want to keep in your Google Drive you
can access on your computer and one app
that I'm low-key in love with is Google
Play Music
now with this I was able to take my
entire iTunes library and import it into
google play music and what's awesome
about that is being able to access
my entire library from anywhere my new
device my computer that is super clutch
and not to mention the note it does have
expandable storage so if you ever need
to take things from your computer and
throw it onto your phone that makes that
process a lot easier and if you just
straight-up need more space boom you got
that as well now another thing that
iPhone you just tend to worry about is
the loss of face time I personally used
it a lot to talk to Arry and even my mom
but there is a solution and that's
Google duo even though Eric isn't using
an Android phone right now
I can still video chat her in a
heartbeat using google duo so all I got
to do is head on over to duo press that
hit re and just like that I'm ready to
get into a video chat with her
oh it's cookie
oh so cookie she's like why are you
disturbing me right now
nope she's like let me nap oh that
that's fine you guys got to see for
yourself how quick and easy it was
cookies not about that life though give
her a treat so yeah that got her
attention
so with keeping all of that in mind when
you're switching from an iPhone over to
something like the Galaxy Note 8 you
don't have to worry about losing
everything and not to mention you also
get some really great hardware you've
got that amazing Super AMOLED display
that makes watching everything very
enjoyable I think honestly everyone
knows that those are one of the best
screens on the market not to mention
you've got that awesome camera for
taking sharp and vibrant photos now
there's absolutely no reason to be
surprised at the quality of this camera
because Samsung kind of kills that when
it comes to cameras in terms of the
selfie camera I'm pretty impressed as
well as the s-pen I personally don't use
the s-pen like crazy but it is super
convenient when I get a document that I
need to sign online makes my life a lot
easier to just have it they're always
ready to go and I feel like Google is
created in the ecosystem of apps that
make it really easy to switch between
devices and even access all of your
information that's on your phone right
on a computer and even if you're someone
who's not looking to make some kind of
switch I feel like having these apps is
very useful so that you can have your
stuff
backed up and accessible whenever you
want and with it being so easy to switch
back and forth it makes my life a lot
easier to be able to jump right back to
my no date even after testing other
devices so if you're feeling uneasy or
you're worried about missing some things
when you make the switch just be sure to
follow the things that I said in this
video get those apps and if you have any
questions be sure to leave a comment
down below I'll try to answer any
questions you guys might have but that
about wraps it up for this video again
huge shout out to Samsung and Google for
the paid partnership and I'll catch you
guys in the next one until then it's
your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
