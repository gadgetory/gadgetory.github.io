look like morning it's like the crack of
dawn you always complain about the time
I have to go to work every single of
course because I'm up when I don't have
to be up yeah it's what what time is it
6:00 in the morning
without actually looking unlike rap
genius or something so I looked up the
words oh my god did you really look up
the whole song rap songs are like so
having a good time the music you just
saw that then we turn on the radio with
in store for a bit and then we hear
about planes crashing the Bahamas and
whatnot some nuts
I was crying over there she had it
consoled her okay alright guys and we're
testing out this key copier machine
sorry all you do is insert the key right
there and then boom you should be able
to its got instructions and whatnot
right here
it's crazy with the kind of things that
it's like all right so it turns out okay
this thing doesn't copy the key and make
it all right here it pretty much scans
it gets the information it needs and
then from there you take it to the
person in the first place
waste of time that machine creates more
work well if they found just that it
creates more work yeah so the great
thing about coming into Walmart in the
morning and especially on the weekend is
that they're fully stocked check this
out when Walmart doesn't not usually
look this stop look at all those bananas
and all those potatoes right there
what's going on at Walmart Walmart
actually inside this reminds me of the
bread they hardly have the fresh bread
you know me and that bread alright guys
so we fell off with the whole healthy
eating thing yeah I gotta tell them then
I have to update them we've fallen off
with the whole healthy eating thing so
what so let me tell you Aries idea
this Friday what remember the whole
7-eleven run
making a mess out here but let me say
about the 7-eleven run it's like let's
pick out like we used to back in the day
all is a lie I think I can provide
evidence to back my claims water we
bought a ton of candy happens just like
slightly mentioned as a joke it's like
no big jump you know okay who brought it
up okay I follow it along I'm partial
with guilty but it happens we do eat all
of the candy though yeah we bought it
for $35 on funding this part about this
whole story about us picking now is that
we wish we'll spend the whole night
watching TV
picking out and aeri fell asleep while
when we open like the first bag of candy
yeah I did I was so tired I went to
sleep I woke up in the moonlight ate
some more candy and not back out it was
bad this was a bad weekend good you
swarm you were like brand-new adults who
just got like you just got the house to
themselves just have some freedom you
know if you know you would think that
we're some kids who just got you know
when like overnight like on those TV
shows where the kids turned into adults
or something and they're still acting
like kids yeah fake adults so I want to
get juice areas wants nothing to do with
juice but I'm thinking be a splash I
mean it's v8 it's got to be healthy
right even though I noticed like the
sugary kind that isn't really healthy
but it's got this v8 so I think it's
okay I think I'm gonna pull the trigger
