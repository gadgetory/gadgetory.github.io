what's going on guys to Travers consumer
and today I wanted to do something
completely different and that was create
the ultimate gaming experience but
instead of doing that with something
like a normal console or PC game I
wanted to try it out with virtual
reality and the goal for all of this was
to try and create the most immersive
gaming experience and of course to make
this a full-blown vr gaming experience
we need a VR headset and right here
we've got the oculus rift and a lot of
you guys know that I've been rocking
with the oculus for a couple of years
now as my VR headset and if you're
interested in picking one up I'll of
course have a link down below
oculus comm is having a sale right now
where you can pick it up for just 379
and that's what the touch controllers so
that's definitely a deal you want to
jump on and it's only on sale for a
limited time so if you're interested in
picking one up now's your chance and
honestly one of my biggest reasons for
going with the oculus rift is not
needing a ton of space in order to use
it now besides the oculus rift one of
the most important parts of this setup
is my gaming PC if you guys haven't seen
my ultimate gamers paradise video I
pretty much showed off my entire gamers
paradise as well as this new PC that I
could not name and you guys did it for
me and we're going with tsunami but if
you missed that video I have a link down
below in the description now that we've
got some of the essentials out of the
way here's where we start to spice
things up and I went with the pulse
wireless headset now this is an older
headset for the PlayStation that Sony
dropped a long time ago but I've always
loved it and it's based impact feature
which pretty much brings this rumbling
feature into the headset was just ups
the experience and I didn't want the
rumbling to stop there so I decided to
add the sub pack m2 that allows you to
feel an intense version of base for
whatever audio you're listening to so
the idea here is to be able to feel
everything that's going on in the game
so while you're completely immersed in
this virtual world you're also feeling
everything that's happening
now I've used all of these things
separately before but I've never used
them all together so we're gonna see for
the first time how that experience
actually is so this is a game called
Eagle flight and basically it's like a
simulation where you can fly it around
like an eagle but this is my first time
actually playing it with the sub pack
and the pulse headset so I'm gonna see
if this makes it feel any different so I
could feel the wind rumbling through the
backpack or the sub pack and the headset
no this is insane
like the being able to actually just
take a look around everywhere and see
what's going on around you and feel it
at the same time is nuts
oh that's dope and there's music so I
can feel the vibrations from the music
which is awesome you definitely don't
need all this movement but you kind of
can't help it
oh snap oh yeah you crash alright so
this is a game called aircar and I think
it's gonna be a similar experience to
the Eagle one but this is like a flying
car in the future
Paul yo this is a very different
experience it's feels even more
realistic than the the Eagle game oh
snap maybe oh oh oh don't crash I think
I can tell her
oh sure okay oh where am i I don't
understand
oh did I crash okay so that was it for
it okay guys so this is Lucky's tale I
actually played this on the Xbox one X
so this is like you know more of a
traditional game but it's cool because
it's like you're actually in it this
setup may have be a bit overkill for
this type of game but it's still fun
nonetheless on some coins this is you
see that's crazy
usually in a game that's like on the you
know Xbox you can't just look over and
see that you're missing something this
is awesome I just tilted my head and
noticed that I had more coins to collect
all right guys so the game we've got
right here is called the climb and this
is supposed to be a game when you're
basically rock climbing and you see my
hands that's me this really feels like
I'm out here and with the sub pack I
could feel like the rumbling from the
music and the wind now a game like this
actually feels like a workout because
you can't keep your you got to keep your
hands up the entire time and look at
this can feel the swings
oh and what's crazy is when I get really
tired I can feel my heart racing through
the sub pack like I can hear my
heartbeat through the headset but my sub
pack makes me feel it so it gets really
intense when you start getting tired oh
man alright guys that was intense I'm
like actually sweating from that a
little bit but this was supposed to be
the ultimate gaming experience and I
think there's some real merit to this
set up now the sub pack itself is a bit
on the pricey side but it absolutely
enhances the entire experience I've
played this thing with console games PC
games and now virtual reality
is absolutely worth it if you're trying
to get the best gaming experience
possible it changes up the game for sure
no pun intended and if you get your
hands on a pulse wireless headset do it
hopefully you don't have to pay too much
since these are pretty much discontinued
but man these this is a this whole thing
is insane combo re you're gonna try this
someday you gotta try it
alright guys but that about wraps up for
this video everything in the video will
be linked down below in the description
of course definitely check out the sale
that oculus is having you gotta get your
hands on this this is great if you're
having company over especially over the
holidays where the family visits if you
can think of anything that would make
this an even cooler experience leave a
comment down below but I'll catch you
guys in the next video till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
