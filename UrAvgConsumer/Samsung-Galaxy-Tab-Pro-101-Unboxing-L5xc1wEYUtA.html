consumer and I know I haven't been
posting a ton of videos on the channel
of the last couple of weeks but that's
all gonna change during March this is
what I'm calling March Madness on the
channel and I'm gonna start this March
Madness off with an unboxing of the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
and alright guys here we have the
Samsung Galaxy Tab pro this is the 10.1
version and there's also an 8.4 and a 12
point 2 so there's a really small one
and a really big one so there are
different varieties in typical Samsung
fashion they always come out with a
bunch of different version of their
products but taking a look around you
got a pretty simple box this is similar
to what you saw the s4 in so a lot of
the same packaging here and some of the
specs in the back is of course a 10.1
display and it's got a resolution of
2560 by 1600 so that's better than 1080p
and you of course have 1080p playback
GPS as an IR blaster so you can control
your television and things like that and
it's also got two quad-core processors
one o'clock that 1.9 gigahertz and one
is at one point 3 gigahertz so I'm not
sure how this will impact the actual
tablet and its functionality if it'll
make it really really quick but we'll
see how tool quad-core processors run
for it and we've got an 8 megapixel
camera in the back as well as a 2
megapixel up front 2 gigs of ram and
8200 milliamps of battery so that's all
the boring specs so now this gets it
actually opening the box I've got my
little boxing knife here so here's a
piece of tape can just run that through
there that should be all it takes put
that to the side and let's see if you
can pull this out alright gotta love
this eco-friendly packaging so I put
that there and here we have at the
Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 now this was just
announced in January I believe so this
is pretty cool should have the same kind
of back that
note 3 hat so here it is so before we
get into this let's go check out what
else is in the box with us while you
guys are here and let's see what we've
got
so we've got of course some guides we
got a really thick guide over here so a
lot of instructions a lot of paperwork
Quick Start Guide warranty information
all that stuff on the shore see what
else we've got here we've got the
charger so this is gonna go into your
wall and of course we've got the cable
to plug it into and I believe that's
about all you get in the box guys very
simple packaging so we'll put this to
the side as well let's do forget here a
little neat alright and here it is so
we've got a little dust on it but we get
rid of that so this is running of course
Android 4.4 so it's got KitKat and let's
see what else do we have here this is
just a bunch of plastic so let me get
this plastic off and I'll start showing
you guys around the actual device so the
back one and then of course what's up
front now one thing I must say guys is
that my first impression this is really
light this is not a heavy device at all
so that shouldn't make holding it pretty
comfortable considering this is 10.1
inches it's a little on the larger side
for tablets so having a very light
device is really nice when it comes to
this size alright so this is a full
leatherback so to me to feel like real
leather but it is in but it feels pretty
nice doesn't feel cheap at all so that's
one thing I'm definitely feeling from
this even though it's lightweight it
isn't cheap feeling so that's really
nice and let me give you guys a quick
tour around the actual device alright so
starting on the left side you have your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack as well as
one of the stereo speakers so this has
two of those and they come out on the
sides which is pretty interesting
because we typically see them if it's a
stereo speaker where two sides you
usually see them in the front
blasting towards you so these are going
to be coming on out on the left and
right side so that's gonna be
interesting to see and moving on in the
bottom we have of course a micro USB so
we can actually plug in the
right there and we've also got a
microphone down here so this is your mic
as well as on the front you'll see a
home screen button as well as a back
button and a button here this is not the
menu button but it's a task manager
button so when you want to switch
between apps and all that that's what
that button is and moving on to the
right we have a micro SD card slot here
which is really nice because a lot of
tablets don't really include that so
you're able to up the storage here if
you need to I have a 16 gigabyte version
so if I want to update throw a SD card
in there and I'm good to go and this is
the other speaker here like at the other
side so you saw that now we have the IR
blaster right here so if you have like a
samsung tv or anything like that
you can actually use this to control it
it's pretty interesting you also have
your volume rockers over here and as
well as your power button on the side
and of course you've got an 8 megapixel
camera as well as a flash and in the
front like I mentioned before you've got
a 2 megapixel camera up here so that was
a quick tour around the device let's
power it on and see what we get
now I've had the Nexus 10 so I'm
familiar with a tablet this size and of
course it has the same resolution as the
Nexus 10 and it's also made by Samsung
so there you have it so I'm really
interested in seeing how Samsung
delivers on these tablets I've never
used one before so we'll see how this
goes
and I'm gonna set this all up and I'm
gonna give you guys a quick rundown of
what you get when you first turn it on
alright guys so here's what you can
expect when you first jump into the
tablet I've got it all set up now well
it's still downloading some apps but I
signed in for the most part and I'm just
looking around you've got regular home
screens and if you swipe to the left you
have access to this new Flipboard kind
of app that Samsung has now it'll give
you access to all your articles you can
actually customize this to be however
you would like it to you can move it
around change it up put the kind of
articles that you would like in here so
you can change the layout so it's pretty
cool and so the left of that is access
to your calendar email
and all kinds of stuff so you can see
that Samsung is really trying to get on
a productive side of things and really
push that with this tablet I think the
other ones have the same UI as well so
you're going to be able to be a little
bit more productive with this and pretty
much the same stuff you expect to see
here is available or there's a couple of
changes as far as the UI goes you can
see that there's now a flatter design
with the icons if you go into the
settings you can see that it looks a bit
different
definitely flat icons here so as you can
see there's a couple of UI changes and
I'm gonna be going over all of this in
the full review so we've got access to
quite a few things here and yeah pretty
much this is it guys I'm gonna go in
more in-depth like I said in the review
and let you guys know exactly how it
runs how it functions
how so what you can expect from this
tablet first impressions is I'm liking
this definitely liking the feel of it
definitely liked the screen the screen
looks really nice it looks very crisp so
um yeah it looks so it looks pretty good
so far I can't wait to give you guys a
review and thanks for watching if you
enjoyed this video be the cool guy that
hits the like button and also leave a
comment down below if you're interested
in one of the new Galaxy Tabs if you're
interested in the 8.4 which I think a
lot of people are the 10.1 as well as
the 12.2 which is really huge so let me
know what you guys are thinking if
you're interested in this kind of device
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video
