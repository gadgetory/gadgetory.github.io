and this is going to be my top 5
favorite headphones that I've reviewed
so far so let's not waste any time let's
get right into it and alright guys so
first off all the headphones that are
going to be in this video I do have
reviews for and I'll leave an annotation
for those right about here or so so
whenever I'm talking about it the
reviews are going to be posted right
next to me now let's get into it the
number 5 on the list is actually the ws
70s by Audio Technica so these are the
88 ws 70s and my favorite thing about
these headphones is that they're very
bass heavy and they have a very nice and
sleek design now what's great about
these is that I can take these to work
with me and it kind of matches my attire
because usually when I'm going to work
I'm gonna suit and I'm all dressed up
and I don't want to carry I don't want
to wear Beats headphones or a sink by
50s all those big obnoxious headphones
so I don't want to wear any of those I
want something nice and sleek and classy
looking and these definitely fit the
bill while also being very base you like
I do like and they don't leak as badly
as a lot of other headphones so these
are exactly what I'm going for so I can
take these to work with me I can take
them to lunch and not worry about
annoying people by listening to my music
pretty loudly or anything like that
so these are definitely good stuff for
in my opinion I'm very happy with these
definitely some great sound quality it's
very clear and it's got some really
strong bass now the downside to these
headphones is that they can be a little
uncomfortable not everyone's ears will
be able to I guess will stand the
pressure these are very tight so to say
but I have been able to stretch them so
that it can fit comfortably on my head
and what's also great about these
headphones is that they only retail for
about 150 and I think on Amazon you can
find them for about 115 so you've got
some great prices to go along with some
great sound quality and build quality as
these look really great and sound great
and that's number five number four on
the list is the SOL by Ludacris SL 300
now I don't have the SL 300 to
demonstrate for you guys or anything
like that but I do have a ton of videos
of them on the channel so be sure to
check those out now the reason I
selected the SL 300 as the number four
is because they're just some awesome
headphones they've got some really great
sound quality and they're extremely
comfortable they're a little on the
larger side so that is definitely a
downfall to them they're quite a kind of
big but they do sound great and they are
very comfortable I have they have a ton
of bass they sound even better when you
at used to active noise-cancelling so
it's some really good stuff they've got
a bunch of cool features like they light
up all kinds of stuff so definitely a
plus in my book and the only bad thing I
can say about them is that they're a
little on the larger side and they've
got a initial plasticky feeling when you
first use them or see them so you might
feel a little uncomfortable with them at
first you might feel a little cheap to
some but there are quality headphones
that might throw you for a little bit
but they are quality and also they've
got a $300 price tag but the thing about
them is that you can find them online
for much much cheaper than that I've
seen them on Amazon for as low as 130 I
believe I could be wrong but it's within
that ballpark so they were dirt cheap at
a point so you can definitely find good
deals on those and you get you're gonna
get some great sound quality some great
durability they're actually pretty
durable regardless of the plastic feel
that you initially get and they've got
some pretty awesome features so
definitely check those out if you're
interested and that's my number for now
my number 3 choice is the audio technica
ath em 50s now some of you might be
going what the heck this should be
number one uh well these are my number
three these are without a doubt amazing
headphones and they're very very cheap
these retail from about between 100 to
150 on Amazon this is where I purchased
mine I believe I paid about 125 so these
are really cheap and they sound amazing
they've got some of the best clarity
that I've heard in any headphones so
you're going to get really good vocals
really good stuff they also have some
pretty good bass as well I don't know if
you're a bass head though these might
not be at
for you and this is kind of what brings
it down a little bit on my list because
I am base head but for those of you who
are it it's going to be hard to beat
these in sound quality this is going to
be amazing
and these are very durable they're
really good stuff I actually use these
whenever I'm editing my videos so I can
get the clearest sound out of everything
so I can really know what's going on as
far as my sound quality and while these
are some pretty good looking at phones
they're not the best I honestly wouldn't
take these outside because they're just
they're a little too big and the style
just isn't it there for me as far as
being out in public with them now this
could be this is a different story for
tons of people and they're not bad
looking headphones whatsoever these
aren't bad but I just wouldn't want to
go outside with them because I want the
headphones to look good when I'm outside
so that's one thing but like I said
everyone's opinion is different this is
my own so that's where I stand with
these but like I said these are amazing
headphones I use them all the time so
these definitely deserve all the praise
that it gets online and through a bunch
of people so definitely some good stuff
that's my number 3 now my number 2
headphones are the beats by dre Wireless
now some of you might be wondering what
beats by dre Wireless B audio technica
ath I'm 50 s well yes they beat them in
a couple of departments actually well I
do like the fact that these have a ton
of bass they've got a good sound quality
in my opinion and then definitely
delivering the sound that I like so I
really am really happy with these also
they look good I love the looks of the
beats by dre line so these are
definitely going to get a plus I would
go with these outside and wear them so
they have my vote also these are
bluetooth headphones I'm a huge fan of
wireless headphones so a lot of you know
that follow my channel I'm a huge fan
this used to be my number one for a very
long time and a lot of you know that
whenever it comes to recommending beats
if ever beats by dre Wireless are thrown
into the mix I almost always go for
these they have the best value than any
of the other beats in my opinion they've
got a small form-factor in comparison to
some of the others like the studios or
the pro
while delivering on great bass and also
some pretty clear sound and of course it
has bluetooth so that's something none
of the other beats have and it's really
great it it works with my computer
tablet phone all kinds of stuff so
there's no reason not to go for these I
just can't see what other beats by dre
s-- can actually really just beat it as
far as an overall value and they're
pretty durable it's good stuff now
what's bad about these is like anyone
would know it's very expensive these
retail for about 270 $9.99 so it's going
to cost you about 300 bucks it's gonna
be in that price range and I know tons
of people aren't going to be willing to
pay that much money for some headphones
but overall I do like them and I had
these as number one for quite some time
these are probably one of my favorite
headphones to take outside with me so
that's number two and now for my number
one favorite pair of headphones it's
going to be the sony pulse wireless
headset now these aren't technically
headphones but you can use them as
headphones and these have absolutely
wowed me as far as sound quality goes
everything I love everything about these
headphones now if you see my review I
sound like a complete fanboy and with
good reason
these are about 150 dollars so they're
pretty cheap compared to all the other
headphones or that you can get right now
that people are into so these are really
cheap as far as others go and they sound
great you guys know I'm a basehead I set
it like a thousand times in this video
and that's what these are all about tons
and tons and tons of bass so these are
really great as far as I'm concerned as
far as for sound quality and whenever
when I first tried them on I my jaw
dropped I was like are you serious these
things like if you love to feel bass and
you like the vibrations that you might
feel on your ears
these are gonna these been while you I
love them and I sound like a complete
fanboy here too but I do absolutely love
these headphones I think they look great
for a pair of gaming head for a gaming
headset these look great now honestly I
wouldn't take these outside
they're a little too big for me and yeah
I just I just want to take them outside
then they're not my style as far as what
I wear outdoors but if you don't care
about that you just want some good
sounding headphones you want to take
outside these are going to be great and
they're wireless I can use the little
USB plug them into my computer or
anything that uses a USB port well not
anything it'll work with the computer
and it will work with your ps3 you can
use them wirelessly you can actually use
this wirelessly with any device as long
as it has a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and you can do that by plugging the
little USB stick that it comes with into
a power source and plugging the cable
that it comes with between the device
and that USB um that USB stick so
there's a way to do it with any device
it's a little confusing at first but you
really get the hang of it so it's got
wireless capabilities with just about
anything but most things that make sense
just use the cable but like I said guys
I absolutely love these they're great
they sound great I absolutely recommend
them to anyone who's a basehead before
any beats by dre before it anything as
long as you really want really loud and
clear bass can't beat them can I beat
the metal and that's about it guys this
is my number one the Sony pulse wireless
headset really great stuff hopefully you
guys enjoyed my top 5 headphones now
these are by no means audiophile
headphones whatsoever this is completely
as an average consumer
so don't bombard me with you know all
the sine Heiser's and all that good
stuff
those are great headphones but these are
my personal favorites that I've tried as
an average consumer and I say guys
hopefully enjoy it I'll catch you guys
in the next video till then it's your
average consumer peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
