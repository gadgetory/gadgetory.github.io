consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the Logitech UE 4000s so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it alright guys here we have the
Logitech UE 4000s and as many of you may
know I'm a fan of the ultimate ear
headphones Logitech has come out with
such as the UE 6000 9000 and now the
4000 s what I love even more about these
headphones is that they all cost nearly
half of what they originally cost when
they first debuted on Amazon you can
find the UE 4000s for about $40 and I'll
have a link down below in the
description so you guys can see for
yourselves
hopefully this isn't a bad sign for the
line and if it is I suggest picking
these up while you still can
but on to the review the UE 4000s are
built like your standard pair of
headphones and have a pretty small
design no part of this headphone is
large but they aren't foldable which
hurts a bit in the portability
department however these are still a
very compact pair of headphones they
sported a pretty thin look and this is
great for travelers CENTAC also causes
it to be pretty lightweight they also
come with a very nice zippered
microfiber line travel pouch this makes
traveling with it a since since its flat
design allows it to be thrown into a bag
with no problem and to be honest I like
the all-black low-profile design these
offer - the fingerprints that tend to
show up on it it isn't flashy but it has
its own little style to it with the
different bends on the headband and the
ear cups however if you do want
something that stands out a bit more
there are other color options like white
or even purple available now don't let
the small frame fool you these are
actually pretty durable which has been
the case for are the other headbands in
the UE series as well I'm glad to report
that even with its lower price tag these
don't suffer from a cheap build it is
made of plastic but it can also handle
accidental bends and twists like a champ
for a headphone in its price range the
materials are pretty sturdy and also
very comfortable the headband has a
pretty soft padding at the top as do the
ear cushions they feature an on-air
design which means they'll be pressed
actually on your ears rather than around
them some people aren't fans of on ear
headphones because they don't like the
pressure of the headphone pushing
against their ears but I find that the
soft cushions make it really easy to
listen to these with no problem you can
even rotate the ear cups a bit to
conform to your ears and head shape it
does come down to personal preference if
on ears are for you but for headphones
in this category the UE 4000 are quite
comfortable overall the UE 4000s also
come with a detachable tangle free cable
with an inline remote that works with
all Apple devices and of course just
plain paws with Android devices the
cable also has a raised jack which is
great for mobile use especially if your
device has a case on it but it's finally
time to discuss the sound I'm actually
pretty happy with the sound considering
the price of these bad boys now I'll be
honest the sound is pretty much what you
would expect from a hundred dollar
headphones but what's great about these
is the fact that you can find these for
less than half that price it did
decently with most songs that I threw at
it and I found that the bass is
pleasantly present without being
overpowering by any means and for those
of you who love bass you actually get to
feel it a bit more due to the on ear
design vocals are somewhat clear but the
high-pitched sounds can come off a bit
muffled but I don't think it's too
noticeable
overall the sound quality the price
ratio makes these definitely worth to
buy especially when you consider the
overall quality of the headphones add
$100 I would think these are pretty
decent but at $40 this is an absolute
steal I think this is the perfect pickup
for the average consumer who just wants
a nice pair of durable headphones with
pretty good looks and sound as long as
you aren't expecting these to sound like
them Sennheiser Momentum's I'm pretty
sure you'll be happy at this price they
also make a great gift for someone
interested in some headphones as long as
they're not like an audiophile
now that we spoken about the quality of
the headphones let's take a look at what
they look like on so here you have it
very small compact design like I said
this is the hood bone very slim and
there you go like I said guys there's a
very nice out only 40 bucks so if you're
not willing to invest 2 to $300
some headphones he's a very very solid
option I would recommend them for the
average consumer who just needs a quick
pair of headphone to throw on and travel
somewhere or you know do whatever they
got to do so these are very nice of
$40.00 um I only the only thing I would
change about these is making them
foldable but since they aren't foldable
that's a only drawback but they do have
a very nice carrying case that you can
use to try and throw it in a bag or
anything and just take it wherever you
have to go so not a lot of drawbacks
with this especially at 40 bucks so they
do get my recommendation for the average
consumer and before we close out this
