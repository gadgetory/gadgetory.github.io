consumer and today I have another
unboxing for you guys of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 so it's not wasting time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
and this is really a beast of a phone
for all those who will understand what
these specs are it's got a 1.6 quad-core
processor it's got a 5.5 HD Super AMOLED
display eight megapixel rear camera 1.9
megapixel front-facing camera it shoots
in 1080p HD it's kind of a crazy 3100
milliamp battery for those who don't
know what that means as far as battery
goes it's going to last you a very very
long time this is a crazy battery I
believe most standard phones are
carrying maybe 16,000 million six teen
hundred milliamps and this is almost
double that so this is going to have
amazing battery life and of course it
has the S Pen all that good stuff so
it's gonna be really really crazy to see
this phone in action so enough of my
blabbering let's unbox this thing let's
pop it open here slide this off and we
have the seal over here and still can't
find my unboxing knife so I've got this
guy again and then we're going to slide
that frost make sure this tape gets cut
there we go and boom here we have the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this is a huge
screen it's very light right now because
it doesn't have its battery in it but
we'll get to that this is the Micro SIM
card that it comes with um if I ordered
this online so it has the micro SIM card
there nothing else inside of the little
case it came in and of course we've got
a bunch of booklets this is a do use the
Start Guide as well as some more
information
they're more t-mobile stuff let's see
here here we have some earbuds you know
I didn't know that these came with some
headphones so that's pretty cool comes
with some earphones it reminds me
this is shame to say this but it kind of
reminds me of apples in ear headphones
earphones rather so hopefully they don't
get sued there but um let's see here we
have the power plug and this is a very
interesting power plug let me give you
guys a quick close-up of what I'm saying
so here we have the power plug it's a
pretty long power plug here on longer
than what I'm typically used to seeing
and you kind of plug it in on the side
and pretty much this is it this is very
interesting design I've never seen one
like this I don't know if other Samsung
phones come with similar plugs but this
is the first time I'm seeing and pretty
interesting design also we have the
micro USB cable that it comes with this
seems like it's going to be pretty long
so that's always a good thing and we
have that behemoth of a battery 3100
milliamp battery so of course the first
thing we want to do is get this thing
inside of the phone so let's take off
this plastic now this is this battery is
just huge I've never seen a battery this
size before this is crazy and we're
gonna unwrap let's see if we can unwrap
this phone here what's the best way to
do it there we go so we take off oh this
is the screen protector but this is the
screen very cute mine's me there we go
and we still got some more plastic on
the sides and I forgot to mention but
this is for t-mobile so this is going to
be on t-mobile's network it also does
support t-mobile's LTE that will be
rolling out in the future is it's not
out yet but it's crazy that this thing
already has support for you know the
network that's not even out yet
so over here at the top we
and kind of pull this down pop it open
and here we'll also have access to the
SD card the micro SD card slot and the
SIM card so that's where you'll find
those and um let's see maybe I'll get
the sim card in now alright so I just
inserted the Micro SIM card and I don't
have an SD card to put in here right now
so I'm just gonna leave that and now
that that's over let me give you guys a
close-up of the actual phone and alright
guys here we have the 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera in the back you have
that 8 megapixel camera and as well as
the flash and on the right side you'll
find the power button the bottom you'll
find the bottom right you'll find that S
Pen so there's gonna be a lot of neat
features with the s-pen you also have
your micro USB port and on the left side
you have your volume rocker and the top
has your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
as well as another mic at the top and
you also have that mic at the bottom and
pretty much that's about it in the back
you have your speaker here under the
Galaxy Note 2 and yeah that's about it
for this close-up guys and alright guys
just to give you guys a quick idea of
how big the screen is
this is the Galaxy Note 2 and here we
have the HTC One S now the One S has a
4.3 inch screen this is a 5.5 inch
screen and yeah as you can see it's
quite a bit of a difference and in
comparison to the iPhone 5 here you can
see the screen difference the iPhone 5
has 4 inch screen and here we are right
there you can kind of see it this is a
lot bigger much much bigger and let's
see if this thing has any juice we'll
press the right side see if we can turn
this thing on of course it says Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 and I realized I didn't
give you guys a close-up of the
earphones that come with this so while
this thing is loading up I'm gonna show
you guys real quick what the earphones
look like and here we have the in
your headphones that the note 2 comes
with ever heard anything really about
these earphones from any reviews or
anything like that so I don't know if
they're noteworthy but if they are I'll
let you guys know it's not then you guys
know that it's not that special at the
the inline remote has a volume up and
volume down button as well as this
button here so I'm sure that is a you
can use to answer calls as well as press
play and pause and different things like
that and the mic is also in the back
here and the bottom of it looks like
this and pretty much that's it for these
um earphones guys let's get back to that
phone and alright so I'm not going to do
too much of the setup here but I want to
use the s-pen got a turn on the Wi-Fi
all that good stuff so I'm gonna get on
this wire I'm gonna set this up real
quick and then I'm going to show you
guys a little bit of the homescreen
alright guys so here we have it this is
the home screen since the s-pen is that
this um has been removed they came up
with this little interface right here
and as you can see is sliding through so
this looks pretty nice it seems very
fast I'm looking forward to seeing how
this works in everyday usage everybody
says great things about it some can't
wait to see what its gonna be like and
pretty much that's it guys definitely
stay tuned for my review of this phone
and yea if you enjoy this video please

til then it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
