want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at your average consumer this
is my girlfriend hey mister sister hi
and today we have another son leak and
sound isolation test aka the girlfriend
test and friends and today we're gonna
be doing this with the SOL Republic
tracks HD so let's not wasting time
let's get right into it so first we're
gonna start off with the sound leak test
and we're going to listen to music from
50% volume to 75% and then 100% just so
we can see how much the sound leaks from
the headphones at those different volume
points so let's start off with 50% you
ready yep you ready yep
so since we have an extra guest here
we're going to see if how sounds from
you know another person's perspective
you guys got a little idea of how it
sounds right yeah
I slightly hear it yeah I can make up
the lyrics yeah someone it's not loud
like a bothersome it's not really
bothersome but someone sitting next to
you would be able to hear it outside
another apology or anything so rated or
75% yeah okay it's a lot louder yeah
yeah that's pretty clear yeah and this
would probably bother someone if you
were sitting next to them yeah coffee
plays library this is no no bueno
outside you know who cares you're
outside so I think so ready yeah it
sounds so excited okay so I start a
hundred percent that that's loud that's
that's tiring so we're not gonna keep
that on so long but yeah you guys heard
it for yourselves it's really really
really loud at a hundred percent at
least quite a bit so I'm going to keep
in mind for you guys I'm sure that can
probably be heard even outside so
alright that's it for the sound leak
test it leaked quite a bit from not too
bad at 50% but it did leak and other
percentages were pretty loud so now for
the girlfriend test all right yes so the
girlfriend test is basically when I do
something that would annoy him like
something to do and he's gonna see if
these headphones are good at blocking
out my noise all right and this time I
have my sister with me here so it's a
girlfriend and friend test and yeah
there's to something that might annoy
him so you guys of course wish me luck
we're going to start this off at 50%
volume and then you know sorry five
minute hundred percent as well so let's
try it out
all right ready yes is that my lip gloss
that you're wearing
I believe all over for that lip gloss
this isn't your lip gloss actually I
bought this lip gloss you know I'm
pretty sure that's probably what you're
always taking my stuff I can't believe
this
alright so at 50% I wasn't able to make
out anything they said I did hear them
speaking of it but I didn't make either
thing they said and they're very close
to me so if they were a little further
away I probably wouldn't hear anything
so pretty good on the sound of isolation
all right so let's turn to 75% see if I
can block out everything all right ready
yeah you have some nerve blaming me for
taking your stuff when you always take
mine no but I spent way too much money
on my makeup for you just take that add
a Jake see you bye okay now those things
I can take my lip gloss is expensive I
love that okay so at 75% I barely heard
them at all
I slightly slightly but you know outside
if they were like I said they were a
little further away I wouldn't hear
anything at all whatsoever so now let's
try not 100% and see if I can completely
eliminate them ready yep you know I'm
gonna call mom and I'm gonna tell her
you're just always thinking myself it's
not right no it's even a problem since
we were younger I just can't take it
anymore maybe he lost I'd be like you
lose everything else if you check it
within the car maybe under your seats
now I found that very seriously I know
my stuff when I see it okay so all right
so that was a hundred percent I didn't
hear them at all so it did a good job
with the girlfriend test um like I said
before he isolated it sounds pretty well
I did hear them slightly but like I said
it really really close so I say it's a
good job when we go for it touches the
past
found leaking not so good
that's good so that's about it for this
video guys due to the Sol Republic
tracks HD with the sound of the leak and
sound isolations ice aka the girlfriend
test and we'll catch you guys in the
next video if you liked this one
