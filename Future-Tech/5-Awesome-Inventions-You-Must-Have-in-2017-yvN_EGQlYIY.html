build interactive lights powered with
clean energy here's the solar flower an
enchanting solar powered LED table lamp
using innovative solar technology we've
developed a unique piece of sustainable
art that doubles as a life
imagine the solar flower sitting on your
windowsill in the morning adjusts its
flexible stem to face the flower outward
so it can absorb solar energy throughout
the day as the Sun sets and light levels
fall light sensors will automatically
activate the LEDs hidden beneath the 3d
printed petals so you can face the
flower inward to illuminate your home
you can use your solar flower as an
accent light in your living room as a
dining room centerpiece where as a task
reading light to read yourself or a
loved one's asleep it's comprised of a
3d printed flower structure which are
wired to rechargeable batteries LEDs and
light sensors are integrated within the
flower the 3d printed structure is
inspired by the natural geometries that
exist in nature and acts as a light
diffuser giving the flower its alluring
glow join us in our final push to bring
affordable art and innovative technology
into your home we need help funding the
engineering of a custom circuit and
package design to ensure a safe delivery
to your doorstep at still alive lights
we approach lighting design based on the
notion that simply turning on and off a
light is not enough to not only be
functional but engaging and educational
to have a greater impact on the world
rather than just lighting an individual
room thanks for listening we hope you
like our product and if you're able to
help out even by sharing this campaign
with your friends and family we consider
you part of our team keep making
we're alpine labs and we make products
that allow photographers to see the
world differently and to capture its
most captivating moments with the help
of people like you we started building
our ideas here on Kickstarter and five
years later we're excited to introduce
SPARC our most versatile camera remote
yet
one device built for hundreds of
different cameras spark is designed to
go where you go it has three distinct
triggering modes Wireless infrared
traditional wired triggering and app
control the infrared beam sent to your
camera's built-in sensor allows for
ultra quick setup and complete wireless
triggering so that you can get out from
behind the camera and be in your own
photos by plugging spark into your
camera's trigger port you can also use
it like a normal wired trigger and if
you want to quickly set up a time lapse
hold the spark button down count the
number of links and you're good to go
for a higher level of control use the
smartphone app it gives you access to
the complete set of spark features
including HDR time long exposures and
bulb ramping time-lapse you can even
control up to 3 cameras at once for
synchronized triggering and with
Bluetooth for technology spark connects
immediately so you can get right to
shoot
we've launched four products on
Kickstarter and last year we released
pulse to give photographers complete
control of their cameras after
delivering to over 12,000 backers we
went back to the drawing board to
explore how we confuse the power of app
control with the ease and speed of
infrared trigger we wanted something
with extremely long battery life yet
nimble enough that we could always have
it with us so we created spark a device
that is super fast when you need it but
also has the power to take long
exposures time lapses and shoot with
more advanced techniques making hardware
can be challenging but your support on
Kickstarter has allowed us to build some
of the best photography gear available
we
people want to be creative but they
don't always know where to start that's
why we provide curated projects each
month with the materials and
instructions you need to get going
every month you get an interesting and
unique project to build one of the first
projects will be building is your own
USB video game controller every month's
project is different for example one
month you could get a conductive sewing
project so you can make a sock animal
that when you put the hands together the
eyes light up your box will contain
crazy circuits components and anything
else that you need to complete the
project for that month we will provide
written instructions and video guides to
help you through each project no matter
your age or skill level crazy circuits
is the ultimate inclusive system works
the conductive inks and paints
conductive threads conductive tapes and
there are a ton of great companies out
there that make these types of products
we're partnering with these companies to
bring you the best of the maker world
one month to get a conductive ink pen or
Bluetooth controller another month
you'll get specialized Lego components
all compatible with our crazy circuit
system you don't even need a soldering
iron if you can so snap stick or click
you can use crazy circuits one of the
best things about crazy circuits is how
its scales based on your ability level
you can start by making simple circuits
and activities and move on to robotics
or Arduino projects wherever your
imagination takes you
to meet our pricing and quality goals we
need a solid base to subscribers that's
where you come in we want everyone to
become a builder a maker and inventor to
go from I don't know to look what I made
we want people to have fun with crazy
circuits and we can't wait to see what
you come up with are you tired of
stealing your girlfriend's no-show socks
all wearing no-show socks that do show
and mess up your look or going sockless
with those stinky feet and finally when
you do find the no-show socks that you
like to find out that they roll off your
feet every two minutes
introducing William and Sterling
probably the best no sure sucks for men
in the world
our technical silicon solution with its
specific position in size make sure that
your socks stay up the whole day
designed in Sweden made in Europe we
only use premium fabrics to ensure the
same functionality wash after wash
we offer 12 styles one size fit all our
patterns are made to fit a whole range
of looks from formal to casual stop
wearing socks that suck William and
Sterling socks worth taking care of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
