simply by moving the pen in midair we
are now ready to take the next step
we love our product and need your help
to make marathan the next household name
in gadgets pre-order marathon before the
official release I fell asleep while
driving and since I was diagnosed with
sleep apnea years ago I've been a user
of a conventional CPAP machine I often
travel so carrying it in my luggage was
always complicated and very limiting I'm
always looking for good sensations and
for maximum performance I therefore need
to recover and to sleep well I used to
sleep using a big machine with a very
long tube
err mony is a portable autonomous CPAP
machine that keeps the users Airways
open for the treatment of sleep apnea
its compact size and lack of air hose
between the air drive system and the
mask provide the freedom to use it
wherever you wish by connecting it to a
USB power bank airman he also
continuously records physiological sleep
data they may be stored on a smartphone
and sent automatically to your doctor
via Internet the doctor can therefore
monitor your treatment adjust the
parameters and send them back to the
CPAP machine it's different now and I
carry it with me even on the plane
airman E fits into my hand luggage I
don't need to plug it in and it makes me
very independent it's like a good
training partner who's by your side to
help you perform just a bit better
it also shows my heart recovery rate
when I travel abroad to compete I always
carry it in my bag it's a lot better now
it's simply like putting swimming
goggles on if I disconnect it
it tells up me to my parents what's the
difference between a conventional CPAP
machine and aramony it's like night and
day
they say this is good luck but good luck
or not it's still a mess and a mess like
this can't be clean with just paper you
need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend what oh sorry
Pete not you buddy bathroom doors meet
your new best friend
the swash 1400 it's a new seat for the
toilet you already have that will give
your butt the royal treatment it
deserves with a heated seat dual
positionable stainless steel nozzles
adjustable warm water spray at the touch
of a button and a warm air dryer your
butt will think you've died in Gandhi
you get it so what's so great about bran
Del's new swash bidet seat
it's simple wash don't wipe it uses
water to clean the messes that can't be
clean with just paper he's always doing
stuff like that and with bran Del's
bidet seat p10 because it has a citable
lid you'd think that'd be standard issue
with bidet toilet seats right wrong
unlike most bidet seat lids brondell
supports a person's weight meaning Pete
can use it however he wants another
great feature stainless-steel nozzles
their positionable because they got to
hit you in just the right spot and
there's self-sterilizing I mean they're
washing my butt the washing Pete's but
you got to make sure those things are
clean man what's up Pete
Oh
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention Braun Dells new swash
bidet seat has customizable memory
settings that means I press one button
and get the seat temperature nozzle
position and water temperature I want I
don't have to remember anything because
my swash does it for me
are you kidding me
I think it's pretty clear now to
everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe if you're ready to
change the way you clean click the green
back this project button and pre-order
your very own brondell swash 1400 today
