grail of virtual reality but what is
presence is presents just feeling like
you're in another world well no I think
that's the bare minimum for me true
presence is about being a part of this
other world being aware of it as it is a
view
I'm Lachlan Wilson CTO and co-founder of
Verve and we are presenting to you the
world's first consumer eye tracking
virtual reality had not displayed one of
the keys to this is our eyes
communication for the first time virtual
characters will perceive your gaze how
about you lock eyes with a monster stare
them down or how about share a moment of
eye contact with a fellow hero a heroine
before they dive into peril gaze our
natural human reaction will become a
trigger for modern storytelling and
expand the possibilities of interactive
cinema - even in the field of healthcare
we enabled a boy with muscular dystrophy
to play music with his eyes and a 90
year old grandmother used our systems
remotely attempt to grandsons wedding by
a robot when she could not control aim
with your eyes accurately and faster
than with any other controller this
could give you a killer edge in intense
action games Ally tracking works with
the speed of thought
both can enable a magical UI experience
where the information you're looking for
is in front of your eyes before you even
know it depth of field a key to presence
is a sense of immersion by rendering
realistic depth of field in the fovea
region and appropriately blurring the
periphery
when foliated rendering is properly
adopted in the future it would be
possible to focus the GPU power where
the user is looking greatly reducing the
overall power required to render a scene
with no perceptible reduction in quality
we build a specialized state-of-the-art
eye tracking solution into a solid VR
hardware platform that boasts 42 percent
more pixels the current mainstream PC
headsets we back all this up with our
own compositing SDK and open VR and os
VR support to leverage existing content
and ensure developers don't waste their
time developing for a closed ecosystem
as a firm developer you will have access
to potentially up to 25 million users
per month at 7,000 internet cafes across
Japan and Korea that are using our head
mount display on their high-end pcs we
have finally finished something that
everyone here at float is proud of and
we are getting ready to ship our first
load to Kickstarter backers and then to
you VR developers around the world
interested in creating new experiences
let's push the boundaries of what is
possible data reality as paeonia
together older year for it
you're careful about eating healthy food
and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing the Spree MO personal air
monitor a keychain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iphone and lets you
see what you smell the app gives you
real-time readings for temperature
humidity and air quality based on
precision measurements of volatile
organic compounds a coloring number
scale tells you the quality of the air
around you opt into our community and
share your results and contribute to a
worldwide real-time air quality map we
are constantly surrounded by toxins in
the air around us from common products
like cleaners and dirty clothes to smog
pollution secondhand smoke paint and pet
waste the most obvious results are the 1
in 12 people who suffer from asthma or
the more than half of Americans who live
in areas with unhealthy air quality but
in reality almost everyone is subjected
to poor air quality at some point during
the day spree mo can monitor your air
wherever you are or confirm your
suspicions so you can do something about
it hello my name is dr. TJ Osborn you
know after 23 years in practice one of
the things that I have found out that it
separates sick people from healthy
people is that healthy people know their
numbers if you don't know your blood
pressure you're going to have heart
issues if you don't know the numbers
about what's in the air that you breathe
you're going to have breathing issues
that's why I find that a personal air
monitor is absolutely required for
people to be healthy supremo keeps you
informed whether you're at work home
school
outside a bar salon restaurant for the
airport spree mo was founded by Ray
combs and Harold Hahn Ray has helped
bring about products like the palm pilot
and Amazon Kindle and is passionate
about improving indoor air quality to
help his son who has asthma Harold has
been studying chemistry for years at New
York University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside thus primo air monitor lets you
be fully aware of those deep breaths
you're taking in Spri mo is helping
people breathe easy
wow the air quality here is so great
today ok everyone let's take a deep
breath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
