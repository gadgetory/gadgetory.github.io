wireless Bluetooth 4.0 MIDI interface
for musicians who make music with an
iPhone iPad or Mac yes bluetooth means
Wireless and thanks to Apple's Bluetooth
MIDI connectivity in iOS 8 and OS 10
Yosemite it's fast and stable and
enables multiple simultaneous
connections the puck plus supports both
the USB or 5-pin MIDI connections
enabling any MIDI controller to
wirelessly connect to apps on your
iPhone or iPad and di double use on your
Mac in an easy-to-use device
chances are you have more than one MIDI
controller so give each a puck plus and
simultaneously connect them all to your
iPhone or iPad or Mac if you haven't
already noticed iPads and iPhones aren't
exactly the easiest to connect cables to
and newer Macs have fewer physical ports
to hook up your gear the plum plus
connects to your controller and sends
MIDI to your app or workstation just
like you used to send MIDI over a five
pin cable or USB not only that but the
puck plus can also power most low
drawing USB controllers Bluetooth MIDI
is a major technology leap for musicians
and the puck plus takes those advantages
and makes it easy for players to use the
Apple tech that they love
if you back the puck plus here on
IndieGoGo you'll get into bluetooth
maybe earlier than the users who have
wait for retail availability and once
you experience how simple and reliable
the puck crosses wireless performances
you wonder why you had to put up with
wires for so long the puck plus it's
wireless MIDI made easy meet renegade
the first 3d pen in the world that
allows you to reuse your plastic bottles
bags and files and turn them into 3d art
renegade is highly reliable and breaks
material limitations thanks to its
robust design powerful motor and
adjustable temperature all other options
available in today's market use
proprietary filaments which don't
contribute to reducing waste and cost
you 10 to 15 dollars per pack but should
3d drawing and sculpting really be such
an expensive thing to do
renegade replaces a standard pack using
just two plastic bottles it will provide
you with perfectly stable 3d printing
you can significantly reduce the amount
of plastic waste your household produces
and you won't ever have to buy expensive
filaments again unlike other pens on the
market we're providing you with a nifty
accessory so you can create your own
strips at no extra cost this is the
trooper cut renegade secret weapon as
you can see in just a matter of seconds
it transforms plastic bottles into
plastic strips ready for your use
Chewbacca is really easy to use we'll
walk you through it in just a few
seconds start by warming up the bottle
we're using a heat gun but you can use
your hairdryer or stove then cut off the
bottom you can use scissors or any blade
if your bottle is large like ours you
can extend the telescopic holder which
keeps things stable then simply hold
onto the trooper cut and start pulling
it's that easy
chupa cut can produce strips three six
nine and 12 millimeters wide and with
our optional stand you can store and
house plastic strips for future use
we also provide an attachment which
holds the strips you're using in place
that's it you're now ready to start
creating 3d drawings sculptures and so
much more sometimes it's easy to forget

waste is you can help by making sure
that all of your plastic bottles files
and even plastic bags have more than one
life together with wrenegade you can
become part of the solution to one of
the greatest environmental issues we all
face today so yes it really is that
