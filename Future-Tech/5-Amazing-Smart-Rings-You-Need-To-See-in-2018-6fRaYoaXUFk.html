entrepreneur professional writer
activist friend mother and longboard
writer I'm here to celebrate the day
when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in 2000 I was attacked by a
complete stranger
he cut my throat opened my stomach step
three times into my heart area it
happened in a safe neighborhood in the
light of day 200 feet from the police
station
I fought for life with what I had tooth
and nail but what actually saved me was
the call for help
16 years ago I heard few options so I
used my voice I was extremely lucky the
help came to me
and vanilla is all the different since
that day have been thinking if anything
could have kept me away from bad
experience someone easy and smart to
save lives and give a warm feeling that
you and your loved ones are safe and
sound
at long last there is one this is NIMH
the ring with the panic button to send
an alert to friends people nearby police
and private security services with just
a touch of a thumb whether an emergency
simply push the button the message with
EMF coordinates immediately reaches your
safety circles NIMH helps you feel safe
in any situation of suspicion threat or
direct danger give it to your loved ones
and you will always know when they need
your help yes during emergencies
including fires floods robbery armed
attacks sexual assaults or health
problems
my ring it's the fastest and safest way
to send an alert with the ring you can
send the signal without no one no you
did that you don't need to dig around
for the device and then look at it to
find the button you don't need air they
had to be free you don't need to have a
long conversation with the 9-1-1
operator together a great team aware
that the system that drops the latest
high technology and designed around your
finger in the application you can manage
a list of receivers specifying non
health issues say frequent roads and
store other critical information we've
made thousands of product items to make
sure the ring is nice and comfortable to
wear the bottom is functional and the
false alarms are negligible we aim to
build community where people come
forward to apricot a hand to those in
trouble we call it krauser security and
we believe that society is ready to
protect itself name is available in two
colors to fit your style it looks and
feels good but the yeren a morning run a
business meeting or party it meets any
dress code and looks appropriate in most
situations of your active vibe I wear my
name every day I can work late and
writers do that all the time go for a
night ride or do anything entertaining
my daughter takes a ton to go out to
crazy causes and then let her go with a
lighter heart
I embrace then-known while feeling safe
and secure I want to share that feeling
with you imagine the world will help us
always there we can make it together
back out projects on IndieGoGo help us
to make the world a safer place for
everyone
no oil
yeah okay that sounds good I'll see you
in a bit so you might not be able to
hear that but using Ori I was able to
have a call and that's because Ori is a
voice assistant bring that turns your
finger into a smart phone all through
just a touch of the ear but why that's
because the way in which we're using our
devices is changing changing from a
world where we use screens and touch to
one where we talk now Ori uses a bone
conduction and bone conduction has been
used in many medical grade devices we
package it in a way that ascends
vibrations through your finger directly
into year so only you can hear and that
allows you to hear and talk to just your
finger hey man that's music thanks to
bone conduction and the dual noise
cancelling microphone you can hear and
talk even and loud places
so check this out
or is perfectly private and discreet
using it makes me feel just like a
secret information Inori is more than
just a neat gadget for taking and making
calls because behind it is powerful
voice artificial intelligence our friend
Siri and Google assistant it puts them
exactly where you need them think about
all the different things that you can do
and one of my favorite translation all
we have to do is just motion up words
you say alright how do I say where are
the burritos in Spanish understand lost
burritos and just like burritos come in
different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
an Oreo ring for every outfit and every
occasion and even better Ori is splash
proof - look guys I know how popular you
are and that's why you have the Ori app
because it helps you filter out
everything else and there's four LED
lights that tell you what kind of
messages are coming through come on
let's hit the streets to see what people
think of Ori
Oh
thousands of people have tried Ori and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the origin room with the rest of
the world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad he also happens to be
visually impaired Ori doesn't just help
the visually impaired access something
that had difficulty before smartphones
but in turn they have inspired us to use
our devices in new natural screen
freeways I really want our venture in
darkness to power the screen free
revolution thanks for watching guys
remember to pack us today because one
day with Ori you too can find your voice
introducing the new NFC ring the next
iteration in wearable technology that
can be used to unlock doors and mobile
devices transfer information link people
and much more if you've not heard of NFC
it stands for near field communication a
wireless technology that can transfer
data over very short distances the NFC
ring contains two NFC tags each
containing a tiny transmitter one for
public information the other for private
data and requires no batteries no
charging and no fuss following the
launch of our first Kickstarter campaign
we've been working hard on the design
and functionality of the Rings to
provide the most future-proof wearable
technology available so what can it do
it can unlock your NFC enabled phone
without the need to enter a pin or even
touch the screen lock and unlock your
NFC door lock personalize your digital
experiences by switching profiles at the
swipe of your hand use it to share
information such as Wi-Fi passwords

payments how about starting your car and
much much more so what's new the 2016
NFC rings

than the previous model so you can do
much more with your ring these rings are
made from scratch resistant advanced
ceramics which helps achieve a vastly
improved operating range work more
effectively with a wider range of
devices and stay looking great for a
long time to come each ring is engraved
on the inside surface allowing for easy
tag identification just through the feel
on your finger improved security
functions allow you to create a unique
code to lock your NFC ring so you can
control what data you share the new
designs sport a modern classy look with
just a hint to the power inside the
software we've developed is open source
so you're free to invent your own uses
and create applications to control and
use the ring as you wish with your
support we created the first NFC ring

revolutionize it thanks for watching and
