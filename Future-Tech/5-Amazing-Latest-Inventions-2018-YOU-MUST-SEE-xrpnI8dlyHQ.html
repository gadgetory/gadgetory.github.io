I'm Derrick and this is pal
a lighting solution that will change the
way you see the world on its own Pal is
a powerful light designed for rugged
applications it transforms by pairing
with accessories to deliver illumination
wherever it's needed it lets you get out
in the world in ways that you didn't
before because life doesn't have to be
indoors when the sun goes down as city
dwellers who double as outdoorsmen
we rely on portable lights to enable our
adventures
whether in the woods the urban streets
for our own backyards but traditional
single-use devices weren't working since
they're made for one purpose they end up
sitting in a drawer now when it's time
to use them the batteries are dead or
rusted solid we wanted a reliable
companion as versatile as our lifestyles
that delivered high performance a light
that can truly adapt to any situation
that's why we designed house pal
delivers fifteen hours of continuous
light with flood and spot modes three
brightness settings and an intuitive
four button interface when paired with
its accessories how becomes a flashlight
a headlamp a bike light a lantern and a
task light and in each of these
categories that performs among the best
in class we worked with an amazing team
of designers and engineers through
countless iterations of the design we
really focused on developing a
mechanical and electrical connection
that would enable a seamless and
delightful user experience and each of
the pals accessories makes it stronger
flashlights handled doubles the battery
life while the other accessories provide
limitless utility in order to bring our
products to the world we need your help
by supporting our campaign you can
ensure that we have the resources to
move into mass manufacturing and be one
of the first to use al we can't wait to
see where it takes you
hello Kickstarter
my name is noose three years ago my team
and I came to you with an idea we wanted
to let you know your home was safe
without invasive cameras or complex
security systems that's why we designed
point thanks to you
point is now used by thousands of people
across the world today we're launching
the next generation we've learned from
our community and we've seen from
families and neighbors come together
when the unexpected happens that's why
the new point is through home alarm
design for collaboration we think you'll
love it meet Susan Bob and Judy Anderson
and their neighbor
Alex this is their home would point
point consent smoke
point can sense noise
point consents movement
traditional alarm systems rely on many
individual devices and sensors the point
combines sound motion and environmental
sensors in one device through machine
learning it identifies what's happening
in the environment much like a brain
when point detects something important a
message is sent to a group of people
chosen by you so you can help each other
out when needed point is now serious
business and the team behind it is grown
after more than a year of hard work
we'll just a few months away from
shipping the new point will come with a
subscription when it hits retail but we
want to offer you something special
all Kickstarter backers new and old will
get free lifetime service so please
support us and join us on our journey
my hg2 is a culmination of some
fantastic technology it's really
creating bringing the analog watch made
smart and a digital display that has not
been in the market today
both of the SmartWatch guys are digital
arena and we are one of the very few
that is trying to make their analog
watch smart
like that you can initiate and intasc
from the watch all from your wrist hub
that is so convenient what's easier than
talking to your watch so when the screen
is off you can even care there is a
screen you still have a beautiful watch
design I think when you create a
timeless design is something that you
want to look in your door 10 years from
now and still say it's wonderful look I
really love that I bought it you know I
still think it has value to me it is the
first time in history that modern
technology along many dimensions have
converged to a point where all the
conditions are mature enough to make
this a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
