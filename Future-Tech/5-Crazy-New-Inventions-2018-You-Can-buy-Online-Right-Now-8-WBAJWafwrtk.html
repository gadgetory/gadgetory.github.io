okay bye you tell yourself you're gonna
change your diet stock your cupboards
with fresh fruit and vegetables you
follow all the latest health blogs and
all those new swanky kitchen utensils
you've got them but life gets busy and
in the way of treating our bodies how
they should be treated the problem isn't
a lack of motivation or desire to be
healthy the problem is a lack of time at
jusa we believe living healthily should
not be the difficult choice but the
easiest choice we have study the size of
habits in turns on you don't need 200
different things to be healthy you'll
need to well one habit a keystone habit
and everything else is start to fall in
place juicing is one of the simplest and
most effective forms of healthy living
yet the problem with home juicing is
that it's way too much work all those
cumbersome parts the weird angles that
seem intentionally designed to outsmart
your sponge so much effort every time
for seems to be so little reward until
now introducing juicer juicing without
the cleaning imagine a machine that
squeezes every single drop of juice from
the fruit to repress using 8 tons of
force a machine that is so beautiful and
so simple to use that it'd be a crime to
put it anywhere other than your kitchen
bench how does it work
simply chop your fruit and vegetables
and put them in the single use or
multiple use environmentally friendly
juicing pack and then into the juicer it
goes the machine is so simple to use
that all you need to do is press one
button and 90 seconds later you will
have the fruit squash - almost a paper
like thinness and virtually every drop
of nutritious juice in the glass simply
recycle or reuse the use back it's
entirely up to
you juicers uniquely designed juicing
bags means no fruit or vegetable ever
touch the machine which means no
cleaning no pulling the machine apart no
rinsing just juice at juicer we came up
with the ultimate solution simple
elegant and most importantly convenient
enough to make juicing a daily healthy
habit and we think we've gone beyond
just that we believe that everybody
should be able to maintain a healthy
lifestyle with ease leaving time for the
more important things in life and right
now we are ready to launch juicer to the
world all we need is your help to make
this product cheaper to produce
please help us
my supposed to throw that away this is
really cool
- very I like the name - great name and
the best thing is I've tried a lot of
different futures
but they always make a huge
it's amazing easy to use you just put
all the fluid inside then you get these
or some juice and also the most
impressive is that you could never get
to cutting up the machine again

repurposed gay four decks and recyclable
members we're introducing our most
unconventional collection yet the sticks

sunglasses out of rocks but more
specifically out of flight we chose
slate for its unmatched strength and
durability

sunglasses you'll ever own combining the
base of our classic wood frame with a
slate exterior these are some of the
toughest frames on the market

made with rocks these are some of the
most lightweight frames we've ever made

provides all the features that have
become standard with profiler with
polarized lenses two spring-loaded
hinges with three unique silhouettes in
