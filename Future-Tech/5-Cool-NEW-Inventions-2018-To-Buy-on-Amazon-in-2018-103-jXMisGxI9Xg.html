this puts hook into pairing mode take
your smart phone and open up the
Bluetooth preferences select hook from
Bluetooth options and BAM you're paired

mobile 3d audio open the hook smart

two faders on the left and right side of
the screen think of these as volume
matching faders if the sounds around you
and your environment are loud simply
slide the faders up to match if the
sounds around you are soft slide the
faders down it's as easy as that the
native volume up and volume down button
