climate change and air pollution will
impact all of our lives
globally seven million people die each
year because of exposure to air
pollution due to climate change flooding
hits coastal cities six times more often
now than in the 1960s and politicians
take a global human issue and make it
political
it's like record record cold and I keep
hearing about global warming now they'll
say he doesn't understand this is a
worldwide problem oh no I don't
understand
let's do IQ tests now we can either
accept that or we can get to work here's
the problem we need everyone to
investigate climate change and air
pollution in their own communities but
the equipment costs thousands of dollars
and climate change is a complex and
global problem in the face of
overwhelming odds were left with only
one option we're gonna have to science
it out of it my name is Clifton
Roseville and I'm the founder of pocket
lab we believe anyone can be a scientist
and that science doesn't just happen in
the lab we've delivered thousands of
pocket labs to educators worldwide and
now we're putting our focus on climate
change and air pollution we have
launched the climate education
initiative the initiative has three
parts one anyone can be a citizen
scientist by collecting their own data
on emissions and pollution using paka
lab air two users can contribute to
science through mission mode where data
can be shared with researchers through
the park a lot of software the data will
be open-source and freely available
three you can help educate the next
generation this Kickstarter will make it
possible for schools around the world to
use pocket lab air we have spent the
last year developing pocket lab air a
state-of-the-art sensor to measure
carbon dioxide ozone particulate matter
and atmospheric conditions that affect
climate
paka lab is wireless portable and rugged
so it's ready to go anywhere you can use
pocket lab air to measure emissions and
air pollution in your environment then
you can map that data to your GPS
location and you can join a network of
thousands of citizen scientists doing
climate change research
we need the smartest people of the next
generation to take on the biggest
problem
we'll find a solution if we can inspire
more young people to take on climate
change instead of inventing the next
snapchat teachers students and citizen
scientists love using pocket lab because
they can explore the world around them
ways that were never before possible
help us size the out of air pollution
and climate change we're back on
Kickstarter to ask for your support to
find educational outreach and
manufacturing purchase your pocket lab
today and share our project with your
local community to get more involved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
