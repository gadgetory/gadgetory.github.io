think adventure should be enjoyed until
the very last bite
meals are an essential part of being in
the outdoors and to us the sports on the
market have never quite measured it so
we decided to create one that does
introducing morsel a versatile utensil
for cooking eating and clean a tool
designed to rethink the way we eat on
the go
morsel has a unique rubber edge that
allows you to easily scrape every last
bit of food the ergonomic asymmetrical
shape its plates pops bags and bolts all
shapes and sizes the extended length is
perfect for digging deep without getting
your hands dirty more so also features a
full sized fork and a safe cutting edge
for slicing through tough foods
we spent last year designing prototyping
and testing
the result is the best camping utensil
we've ever used
if you've been hungry for a better
utensil your search is over
more so hi this is Harry my name is Paul
we are the founders of Mac pipe and we
would like to introduce you today our
magnetic pedal innovation
well it's a real new innovative panel
which was designed to give you solid
performance as you saw a club with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free by key this is one of our
first prototypes we had to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
panel we can equip with different magnet
sizes so what you see here is our
standard barrel this gives you a pulling
force of about 15 kilograms
you click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of critical situation you will get
up very easily in fact you will almost
not feel the magnet
on the show we have a metallic plate it
fits on every SPD comfortable shoe one
of the big advantages of this setup is
that it is totally insensitive to dirt
you will not scratch any floors because
this is all inside the sole without any
elevations it's a much lighter panel and
we have a strong neodymium magnet which
is the strongest magnet that is
available in the market we have a simmer
damper unit on it which gives us the
ability to adjust the magnet height to
fit the shoe and also to give you that
solid feel when you connect onto your
shoe and when you right
all the best for a safe ride really hope
to see you out there
hopefully view from Macbeth on your bike
hey I'm Katherine I'm so excited to be
back here with you on Kickstarter so
have you ever done this with your
backpack you don't realize it but your
backpack is straining your shoulders and
back and your neck and hips to a strain
is a stretching or tearing of your
muscles or tendons doing this day in and
day out causes serious damage so it's no
wonder that four out of five people will
suffer back pain and 45% of today's
office workers have neck pain pain that
totally disrupt our lives but it doesn't
have to be this way we've spent the last
year designing the perfect minimalist
and surprisingly effective solution so
today we introduce super straps the
world's first and only backpack booster
that instantly relieves shoulder and
back tension and lifts 27 pounds of
force off your neck
super straps will act as your super
muscle literally making your backpack
feel lighter it improves your posture
when you walk and instantly makes your
everyday backpack ergonomic we've tested
super straps all year long check out
what folks had to say Wow
what's the cute okay yeah it feels way
more comfortable it feels like I can
actually like walk around with this
without any strain or like I can run to
if I wanted my backpack feels lighter I
don't feel as much wearing care on my
shoulders feels a lot more comfortable I
actually I can't really feel that my
backpacks on my back anymore definitely
feels lighter and more balanced if that
makes sense I feel like it's like it's
almost like doing my posture for me it
don't feel slouchy I feel a little more
free in my back and my neck and my
shoulders as well there's less strain
it's great it's a magic trick cuz it
made a difference when you put it on so
how does it work super straps is minimal
so when you're not using it it's sleek
behind your backpack straps it activates
in one second flat and the arc
distributes the force of your backpack
on up to five times the surface area so
you feel instant relief in your back and
shoulders most of us use our necks to
counterbalance the weight in our bags
but even a 15 degree head tilt is like
walking around with a bowling ball on
your neck every single day super straps
fixes this our pulley system points the
weight in your bag moving it closer to
your spine where you can carry it
ergonomically so you don't need a slump
and hurt your body every step you take
many of us carry two three even four
times the weight doctors recommend in
our packs each day if your backpack ever
feels heavy throwing on a pair of super
straps will give you instant relief and
long-term comfort I've worn super straps
every day for the past five months and
it's a total GameChanger
so whether you're racing to a meeting
glass or the outdoors imagine feeling
pain free and light walking upright and
confidently able to truly enjoy the
moment so please hit the green back this
project button now
and help bring super straps to life
you'll be the world's first to wear it
and you'll get a Kickstarter only
