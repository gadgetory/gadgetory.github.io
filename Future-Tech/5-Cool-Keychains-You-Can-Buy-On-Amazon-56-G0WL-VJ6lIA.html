daily lives these digital key cards
often provide easy and convenient access
to all of the places that we frequent on
a regular basis our home office parking
structure pool etc but until now there's
been no easy way to copy these devices
leaving you vulnerable to expensive fees
should you lose one and inconveniencing
you when you need to share access with a
spouse friend housekeeper or dog walker
and having a different key card for each
location can be a hassle enter Kesey a
small device that fits on your keyring
allowing you to copy up to four RFID
devices the process of copying an RFID
credential onto Kesey is simple first
hold down the button you would like to
copy be RFID credential to when the LED
light turns red simply hold easy over
the key fob or keycard the LED will
blink red while Kesey is reading the
device when the process is complete the
LED will turn green to use it simply
press the button near the reader and it
will work just like the original easy
works with the most popular low
frequency RFID devices from many
manufacturers using different protocols
and if you move or no longer need access
to an RFID credential you can simply
reprogram that button to copy another
device and if you need to give access to
anyone it's as easy as holding your key
Z to theirs and holding down the button
the simplicity and convenience moves
with you hi my name is elliott fuller i
invented keys while living in downtown
san diego it has been a useful tool for
me and i hope others can benefit from it
as well Kesey has been tuned through
many iterations of hardware and firmware
and is working well but due to economies
of scale we need your help to purchase
components in bulk and bring the cost of
manufacturing down thank you for your
support and helping us bring key Z to
market
