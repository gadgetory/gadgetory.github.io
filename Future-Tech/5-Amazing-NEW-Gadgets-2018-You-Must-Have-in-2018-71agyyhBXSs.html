little companion he watches me carefully
following my every command he's always
waiting for me to take him outside
he loves to travel with me he's always
curious to see what's around the next
corner and thanks to him my travels make
much more sense meet turtle my
four-wheeled friend
and me TAS we're a team of both
engineers and travelers for some time we
thought about a solution that could help
people just like us develop their
passion of creating and let them easily
share all the adventures with friends
and that's how the idea of turtle was
born turtle is the world's first earth
rover a remote control open-source
platform capable of working in harsh
terrain turtle is the ideal travel
companion
helping you to rediscover this beautiful
planet in real-time allowing you to
reach new and unseen places with the
design inspired by NASA turtle easily
overcomes all terrain obstacles made of
strong aerospace grade materials turtle
drives slowly and steadily making it a
super stable and reliable mobile
platform driving turtle is just like
playing a video game but in real life
the only device you need to control the
rover is your smartphone or tablet if
something strikes your eye snap a
picture or record videos whenever you
like then share them with your friends
one Rover provides infinite
possibilities if you want to upgrade it
add more cameras or sensors no problem
thanks to turtles multiple waterproof
slots and open source software you can
add whatever you want to give you an
example we've included a robotic arm in
the price of the rover kit exclusively
for you turtle can be used in both
professional and personal scenarios
inside the case there's a special
watertight compartment for your own
electronics waterproof connectors in an
upper mounting plate allow you to mount
just about any type of equipment on your
Rover turtle is waterproof easy to
transport and can be driven for up to
four hours all turtles features were
designed with the greatest care by us a
group of people who like to create stuff
we made turtle to be a reliable open
platform that you can adapt to your own
needs
the only real limit is your imagination
ass turtle team we believe that everyone
should be able to expand in their
passion and experience wonderful
adventures after over a year of
development turtle is almost ready but
we can only launch this product with
your support join us and become a part
of turtle family are you ready to start
an adventure
at Planet computers we are passionate
about typing writing being productive
creating on-the-go since the
introduction of touchscreen mobile
phones and tablets we feel that it is
very difficult to type on these types of
devices we decided to reinvent the palm
sized keyboard mobile device that will
benefit many who miss using the keyboard
on the move from bloggers and creatives
that need to constantly write
professionals who need to read and write
email create and edit documents and
spreadsheets hi I'm Martin relief it I'm
a founder of the air 4 which is a
london-based design consultancy and we
in the past have made a reputation from
designing a lot of handheld electronic
equipment including scion PDAs in the
nineties PDAs
our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why isn't there a product like this now
planet computers introduces the Gemini a
modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm-sized keyboard
fully integrated into the device
it's sleek metal clamshell design both
protects the device and beautifully
tucks away the palm-sized
QWERTY keyboard and screen when closed
it fits into a pocket roughly the same
as today's mobile fame when open the
innovative clamshell also acts as a
support of the device the ultra wide 5.7
inch high-res touchscreen provides ample
space for creating on the go the full
tactile keyboard is recognized as the
world's smallest keyboard for finger
touch typing Gemini has a powerful 10
core processor a graphics coprocessor
and 64 gigabytes of storage it is fully
equipped with 4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
enabling both data communications and
mobile phone holes it is designed to run
the latest Android OS and all your
favorite apps as well as Linux with a
dual boot option all below 400 grams of
weight the double sized battery provides
two weeks standby and 12 hours talktime
Gemini allows you to work in restricted
spaces comfortably on planes on trains
in coffee bars you can also hold the
device and use it with ease whilst in
the car
standing up or on the bus I hope you're
interested in what we're trying to do we
think it's going to be a great device
