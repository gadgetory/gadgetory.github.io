Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people have you
tried to plug in it for 30 seconds yes
we unplugged it these machines work just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast and
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi little is
smart enough to know things like what
devices you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it and
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid 2g level websites
monitor make sure he's not up to any
shenanigans I can even set time limits
or pause the internet like during dinner
time yay awesome here I'll plug this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was ladies and gentlemen

reimagine how a suitcase for this
century should be blue smart is a
quantum leap for today's travel we
created a product that is beautiful and
powerful and yet remarkably simple to
use I am personally super excited about
blue smart because it's a product that I
would love to have myself I travelled in
the past and because of problems with my
luggage my troops got ruined and I know
that we do smart I'm going to be able to
travel with peace of mind so I'm super
excited on top of that my phone is never
gonna run out of battery anymore and

a mix a combination of what you choose
to play and what's around you
