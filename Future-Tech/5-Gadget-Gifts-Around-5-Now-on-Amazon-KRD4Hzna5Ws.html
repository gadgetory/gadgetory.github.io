a tock so we love to solve pet peeves
one of our pet peeves was the weak
plastic ties that hold bread bags closed
which is why we created the bag cinch
the octo bag cinch replaces weak and
cumbersome bread tags and twist ties
just squeeze the clip and grip onto any
twisted bag such as bread and bulk food
bags for a tight seal the generously
sized non-slip pads on the ends make for
a secure soft grip when clipping bags
plastic teeth on the inside of this
cinch hold bags securely and bright
colors make it easy to find in the
drawer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
