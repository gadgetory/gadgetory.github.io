anytime anywhere and without the need of
any messy cables let me show you how the
slim sure works to charge your slim

power outlet to charge your phone simply
plug it in and press the power button
the slim sure is designed to work with
most mobile devices with its built-in
micro USB for Android devices or
built-in lightning cable for iPhone slim
sure will be available in five colors
silver gold black blue and pink The Slim
sure is only 0.17 inches thick and can
easily fit into your wallet so you can
carry it around with you everywhere
slim jure is patent pending
we've already produced five prototypes
of the slim juror but we need your help
to finish with the final production
we're excited about the support and
feedback we've received from well-known
publications and we encourage you to
back up our IndieGoGo so that we can get
