doesn't have a touchscreen uh how boring
but now there's air bar just plug it in
and you have touch finally you can swipe
away unwanted mess or find a needle in a
haystack
wait is that a poodle cool now you're
the poodle scroll away the sky is the
limit just go bananas or I don't know
maybe you just want to eat a banana
anyway if you want touch on your macbook
air get air bar
you
in the fast-paced world we've got to
stand out my name is Nelson bales
Olympic champion first african-american
on the US cycling team I spent my entire
life on a bike for work for play the
road is my home on the streets essential
that you be safe about communication
about being see that's why I wear exact
E's turn-signal clothes
drivers nowadays and distracted by so
many things under smartphones the
streets are a dangerous place with Zaki
not only drivers no one come in and
indicate to save my life
I did by night keep yourself in sight
easy
Zaki's turn signal clubs my name is Ju
I'm entrepreneur from Cleveland Ohio and
the founder of Coco I'm obsessed with
being able to minimally transport
everyday carry items like a smartphone
tablet keys sunglasses
so I decided to design a bag that was
different from anything that I could
find on the market
the bolsters small carry bag is unique
because it tapers to a slim profile
towards the back of the bag so that it
has a more contoured fit around the body
as we build a dedicated sunglass pocket
made from faux felt that will protect
the bag from any of the other contents
easy access to a nice pointless shoe
sunglasses wallet or whatever else you
might want to put in there even a yo-yo
you can also put a lot of extra things
in there like extra cables an external
battery for charging up your iPhone or
iPad the elastic waistband allows you to
securely put the bag on your body so
that it won't be loose when you're
active we put a d-ring on the backside
of the bag to keep your keys away from
everything so nothing will get scratched
just clip it on and you have easy access
to your keys when you need them we built
this bag that could deter Superman we
actually had worked with a special
manufacturer to put a kryptonite film on
the I'm just kidding the bolts are small
carry is not only made for mobility is
also built for durability we made this
thing from the highest quality 1050 D
ballistic nylon that we could find all
of the webbing is military-grade we use
the highest quality fasteners that we
could find the zippers are all
waterproofed and all materials that we
are using for this bag are sourced right
here in America I started working with
an outdoor gear manufacturer in Utah who
are just crazy about quality so what the
final samples have proved from them
we're ready to start production we have
all of the materials ready to be sourced
and we are ready Faline kickstarter are
you ready to go minimal this summer
without getting a fun
like a man purse or fanny pack so you
never know when you're gonna need a few
extra pockets and it lends itself to a
wide spectrum of lifestyle needs a bag
that you're gonna get is gonna be the
best made in the world Thank You
Kickstarter we're really looking to get
this project going and need your help
spread the good minimalist word and help
us get this project off the ground thank
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
