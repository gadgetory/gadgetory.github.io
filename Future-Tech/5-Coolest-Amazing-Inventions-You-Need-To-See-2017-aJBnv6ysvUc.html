often too expensive or don't bolt smart
the quest have been to create a bicycle
that looks and rides like a normal
full-size bicycle yet can be easily
folded down to a tad larger than its
wheels
introducing foobie fixie foobie is a
folding single speed or fixed gear bike
having the performance design &amp;amp; price of
a normal full-sized bike it folds easily
and without the use of any tools the
folding locking mechanism has a double
action for safety the patented design
offers a stiff and cool frame and that
is designed to have the same riding
features as a normal fixie would the
bike comes with a flip-flop hub and rear
and front brake so you have the option
to use it as a single speed bike or as a
fixed gear bike sometimes you have to
lock your bike outside with foo be
folding locking your bike is safer with
wheels and frame lock together with one
you lock
boobie uses only available standard
parts so if you already have single
speed bike you can turn it into a
folding bike just by buying the frame
it fits in the trunk of most cars and
can be taken on public transport we're
folding bikes are accepted the bike is
designed on the existing foobie frame
technology that has been tested for many
years this frame design has proven
itself to be both stiff and safe we now
have well functioning prototypes so the
only thing that is now missing is your
support so that we can get into
production to ensure foobie fix you will
meet its deadlines and quality
requirements we have teamed up with an
established bike manufacturer that will
produce the bikes thank you for
supporting technology coating and stem
should be easily approachable and
accessible to help kids expand their
creativity imagination and knowledge
feed kids curiosity and natural desire
for learning through make block neuron
make Blanc neuron is a platform of
innovative electronic building blocks
they're designed for 21st century STEM
education that can help anyone who can
dream it up to build it up click connect
create neuron pieces easily snap
together to create a powerful electronic
Network each piece uses pogo pins which
allow for easy sturdy connection the
backs of neuron pieces are also magnetic
play with make block neuron without any
software and simply code with low base
programming make block has partnered
with Microsoft cognitive services to
bring you voice and face recognition
Sonny how you doing today neuron is also
compatible with Legos and make block
pieces so you can really bring to life
whatever you can imagine or create a
functional color sorter kids and adults
alike will have a blast building simple
solutions with neuron
neuron contains IOT and cloud connection
functionality allowing for remote
control and viewing went away neuron
isn't only about learning stem it's
about problem solving and working
together so whether you're an expert or
a beginning make block neuron can help
anyone achieve a sense of accomplishment
release your imagination and see what's
possible make anything make everything
not the campaign hello my name is Kirk
kjellberg and i'm here today to speak to
you about the pistol that i invented
called the ideal conceal we're here not
only to address the functions of the
pistol but also to address some of the
negative critiques we've been receiving
so i have the pistol with me or at least
a representative of it this is a plastic
model to demonstrate the size it is
approximately the size of a galaxy s7
with a protective case and what will
happen when you go to use it there's a
spring-loaded safety now this again is a
model so it's not going to operate
correctly but will depress this safety
and this handle spring-loaded will
deploy itself and snap open at that time
you'll be ready to defend yourself to
reload or load the pistol it's very
simply a Derringer it's a two-shot
derringer so there's only two bullets
that can go in here at a time and then
you close that up and to return it to
its safe mode that also disconnects the
safety mechanisms on the inside the
reason for this pistol is because a lot
of folks are finding the need to carry a
gun with them to feel protected in
today's environment for me I have my
permit to carry and only because I do
sell real estate and so I am traveling
in a lot of different remote areas
throughout North Dakota as well as
Minnesota and so I like to be able to
have a pistol with me at all times
sometimes the holsters whether it be in
your lower back or whether it be in your
boot I like them
ideal conceal because I can put it right
on my side it looks like its regular
cell phone with me everyone see in the
news incidents where random violence
just breaks out around you and you can't
find the time to wait for the police for
it to be solved and a lot of people are
having to do things themselves to
protect themselves one of the other
comments that we've been receiving is
how this will make things more difficult
for police knowing if you're holding a
cell phone at them or a pistol and again
I think it's our responsibility to act
responsibly and respectfully towards
police if you're in an interaction with
police officers you know don't reach for
things make sure they know where your
hands are act accordingly I mean I've
been pulled over before and when I get
pulled over I roll my window down I put
my hands on my steering wheel and I wait
for the officer to approach and then I
let them know that I'm going to be
reaching into my club box and I also let
them know that I have a pistol and a
carry permit so that they know a lot of
law enforcement folks are interested in
having this gun as a backup some folks
as a primary if they're an undercover
work we have a protective agency that
wants them we have some government
agencies that are interested in them
this is a four-year safety and for your
self defense I highly doubt you'll see
it used in any criminal capacity and
wanted to bring that up as well one of
the things about this gun and why it is
safe is when it is in its latched
position the safeties are in place so it
can't be fired it can't be fired in its
closed position and even if you drop at
the firing pins can't go off secondly
I've had a lot of concerns of from
people about this be coming in contact
with children and maybe I'm starting to
get a little bit old but in my time it
was our responsibility to keep things
away from children and if you can't keep
a gun away from children you probably
shouldn't have a gun we firmly believe
in personal responsibility as a mom I
have a pistol at home I don't leave my
pistol laying on my counter on my
kitchen table either I make sure that I
always have that in a safe spot you have
to treat this as a regular gun because
that is what it is you can't just let it
lay out in the public just because it
looks like shuffle I mean I am a mom
again and I don't want something to
happen to me what about showing property
a lot
times I take people with me as a second
person for safety reasons but sometimes
it's just not possible so that i do feel
protected by having that because you
never know exactly when you're going to
need it i also want to make sure folks
understand that this is not
representative of quality that we will
be selling in the end the polymer case
will be very well finished the fit and
finish the lines will be very tight it's
going to be quality manufactured will
have a lifetime warranty so you can feel
comfortable buying this gun and know
that it will perform for you we will
shoot it approximately 500 times in the
prototype phase before it goes to
production to make sure that everything
fires without malfunctioning and that
everything is working appropriately we
really believe in safety first
family-owned business I don't want
anybody being hurt by this product
leafless box what's the matter like
tomorrow what's a terrible day wake me
up at the seven o'clock maybe I set the
alarm at seven
hi Kickstarter's I'm mattia I designed a
realized reflex box it's the only Wi-Fi
charger that works with many additional
functions now forget the best and focus
on reflex box
what's the other like now remember to
take your umbrella
nice day is the way to begin your day
with a smile when we switch off the
alarm we could wake up watching your
favorite pictures or video
