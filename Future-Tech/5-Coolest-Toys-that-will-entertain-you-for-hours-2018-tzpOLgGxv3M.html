this is Harrison he loves a good game of
ping pong but finding a competitive
partner is hard
Shane is unbeatable not fun
catherine is still learning also not fun
and Matthew now there's a great partner
but he's not always around introducing
trainer 5 it's your new ping-pong
partner that's always available and
always competitive he can shoot any spin
anywhere on a table on any table it's
got the accuracy of a machine triple its
size but it fits in your back and it's
the first of its kind they'll let you
control all of this from your phone
trainer bot lets you pick a setting
that's perfect for you beginners can
practice beforehand with slow easy shots
just choose a location spin type and a
slow interval as you improve trainer
buck rows with you you can create a
sequence that involves multiple shots
like forehand and backhand and for
advanced players trainer bot becomes
unpredictable you can make it shoot
randomly and maximum speed in close
games there's no feeling like hitting
that epic shot those moments are rare
but they don't have to be because
trainer ba can recreate a me match
situation hit a hundred smashes slice a
thousand shots it never misses having
trouble beating your friends trainer
block and turn their toughest shots into
drills with enough practice we'll beat
them next time and never waste another
tutorial trainer bot transforms hours of
YouTube into hours of gameplay it's also
designed to help people connect
regardless of their experience level now
anyone can play together without holding
back or feeling outmatched
it's your ultimate ping pong partner it
was so much fun
especially that crazy setting where it
just shoots
I'm kind of sweating a little bit right
now within 20 seconds I was already
starting to make small adjustments to
how I was holding the paddle
it was very started out and it seemed
easy but then it got so much harder I
mean there's something for every skill
level I've actually played ping pong
robots before I actually blew my mind
hi Kickstarter I'm Alex and I'm Harrison
me and my brother always tried to kick
each other's ass while we play ping pong
so we start shooting first turnabout
with just a garbage can to just search
for us to smash but later on we find out
with app and software you can do a lot
more you can simulate games you can
create your own drills and the coolest
part is you can share those drills with
anyone in the world three months ago we
decided to join axe which is the world's
largest hardware accelerator we source a
lot of motors and we also designed all
the mechanism from the ground up to give
you the fun experience that we want you
to have we have talked to many
manufacturers now now the last part it's
just cooling and Kickstarter that's why
we need your help please back ensure
this campaign on Kickstarter so we can
bring trainer bot to you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
