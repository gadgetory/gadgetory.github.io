Victor around two years ago with the
help of the Kickstarter community we
launched the award-winning hidden radio
wireless speaker
we're amazed by the response from the
press in the community so we set
ourselves a new challenge we wanted to
design and build the most advanced audio
product of its kind with amazing sound
and be the simplest and most intuitive
wireless speaker ever we took everything
we learned from hidden Radio one and
made it even better the new design is
incredibly simple
we have strived to remove all our native
details and left only the essential with
no other visual distractions everything
is about the speaker and therefore
everything is about your music the new
design is a natural evolution and though
on the outside it may look similar under
the hood it's radically improved it
remains incredibly intuitive but also
somewhat magical simply touch the cap
and it glides up to reveal the speaker
we've spent the last 18 months
engineering the most advanced portable
speaker on the market today
one of the biggest changes is the
dynamically expanding speaker chamber
which has over twice the volume and
delivers an amazing bass response
normally big speakers can deliver great
bass but a poor on the high frequencies
and smaller speakers tend to give great
highs but have no bass at all for this
reason we've introduced the proprietary
neodymium dual speaker setup that allows
for the highest of highs and the lowest
of lows compared to the market leaders
we are significantly better in audio
quality pumping out over 90 decibels of
crystal-clear sound that will continue
to annoy the neighbors well into the
night
we have also added the most advanced
feature set of any compact speaker on
the market connecting your device is
simpler than ever
simply touch the cap to turn it on and
select the hidden radio - icon on your
phone iPad or computer and if you have
an NFC enabled phone just touch the top
of the cap and you're connected it's
that simple
we have added a touch capacitive sensor
in the cap so you can tap to play or
pause change track adjust the volume or
even activate Siri if you have multiple
speakers throughout your house you can
seamlessly switch between them
and to make it easier to recognize them
you can rename each one easily and as
many times as you want one of the
coolest things that hidden Radio 2
offers is the ability to link two
speakers together simultaneous audio set
them in different areas for an
incredibly simple wireless audio setup
for your entire home you can place them
alongside your iPad or computer for a
great true stereo cinema experience also
the hidden Radio 2 is a great way to
start your day receiving a phone call
just touch the cap and the hidden radio
to automatically turns into a great
speakerphone
my inspiration has been to combine the
best of our Swiss heritage in
traditional watchmaking with the key
features of a smart watch to persuade
the majority of consumers adopting our
world ball technology we wanted to
create a world without compromises the
one that is desirable and will be
accepted and word by majority of
consumers Z time will provide a 30 days
battery on a single charge and a water
resistant up to 30 meters when we first
started working under the time project
we knew from day one that the most
critical challenge for us would be to
offer users the opportunity to keep
track of the daily time without
necessarily having to turn on the
display and therefore have some battery
life issues this has been accomplished
with the time the perfect hybrid
SmartWatch it combined the best of both
worlds stainless steel watch case and
mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full-color
touchscreen that instantly shows
incoming calls smartphone notification
real-time fitness activity accounting
calendar events daily reminders and much
more right from the wrist the best way
to deliver make any cold hands
experience with a SmartWatch was
actually to use real ones but how and
how to make the background of a
traditional watch becoming smart while
drinking a hole into a TFT display was
the only solution we spent countless
hours with our engineering team an
industrial partner finding the right
solution to create a brand-new
touchscreen that could accept a
pass-through mechanical hand solution
and we finally did it over hundreds of
prototypes and design proposal by
combining a revolutionary TFT color
display together with ultra precise
touch panel and a high-grade quality
glass we succeed to deliver the best of
both worlds an amazing SmartWatch that
can offer both doctrine experience
together with the traditional timepiece
but we didn't stop here
with our ha noise we can tweak the
lowest level features to improve power
consumption in addition this who has
comes with lot of Princeton applications
and a white Surrey looked nice which
faces while using a traditional quartz
movement when we live into a brand new
smart work we work on gently with
several partners to create what we call
the smart movement built around two
micro motors this movement is capable of
not only providing accurate time but it
can more importantly be controlled by
the watch CPU to automatically adjust
time depending on times on where you are
and also move the ends where we need
them to be on a particular screen as a
result know if you are having hands
covering the text on your emails or
messages we can position them the way we
want to deliver the best reading
experience and they will go back to
their original position automatically
having orhan OS follow us to customize
our UX and the diverse with highest
level of compatibility for iOS and
Android users the time is also embedding
some of the most advanced technologies
like a three led heart rate monitoring
solution delivering precise and accurate
measures of your cardiac frequency
throughout the day or at a particular
point in time when you need it we also
decided to replace the traditional crown
with a very advanced smart crown helping
user to hand hence there are navigation
experience inside of Polish and nicely
design user interface so experience will
be improved and enhanced week after week
with regular of those year update
offering new watch faces new
applications and personal new features
the time is with no doubts an amazing
timepiece that will for sure
reset the future of the SmartWatch
industry when I started in early 2013
people thought that a West man why would
I start a SmartWatch company in
Switzerland in such a challenging market
he turns out and my vision and passion
have paid off has our company has sold
nearly two million smartwatches since
then
we have established strong foundations
in Europe and now we are willing to
expand worldwide today we want consumer
to embrace our amazing joining with the
time and be the first ones to get their
hands on this groundbreaking innovation
as we are heading soon to mass
production hey guys I'm Omri CEO of

little below your zone want to pick up
your face V pulls data from any sources
looking at your workout history goals
and apps including google fit and apple
health kit her bio sensors detect real
time physiology such as heart rate and
exertion she also knows your environment
like elevation location and weather with
this info we can deliver tailored
real-time insight as natural speech to
make sure V and your music sound great

that felt more human and more real and
more personal all right let's hit
another yield all right

take it down a notch okay we will now
include a basic cycling mode on its
first release with real-time feedback on
heart rate speed elevation and distance

commands to switch between run and cycle
modes also we will integrate with Strava
to import and export all basic
parameters the way that she was speaking

friendly very human one two one two one
two one two
first times I really don't

Cheers hi my name is Mike and I'm the
inventor of quicky quicky is a magnetic
belt that latches itself it's quick to
adjust locks in place and that's very
strong once it is locked in place it's
not going anywhere
but pinch and twist and you get instant
removal the buckle is CNC machined from
a single block of aluminum and then
anodized to protect against corrosion
and wear then we permanently press in a
neodymium magnet to start the magic
attach the strap using an industrial bar
jacker and quicky is ready for action
now we put quickly to the test to verify
its strength we made an extra long
Twiggy boat which we then use to suspend
my unsuspecting motorcycle
things that I mentioned that in a pinch
it also opens beer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
