coolermaster is proud to present control
pad the world's first keypad with
pressure-sensitive control designed for
gamers creative professionals and
everyone in between control pad comes
with 24 mechanical switches full RGB
backlighting magnetic wrist rest and
more but what really sets control pad
apart from all other keypads is the
revolutionary aim pad technology that
gives you unprecedented control aim pad
the brainchild of Lance Matson lead
engineer behind aim pad technology so a
name pad switch is different from a
normal mechanical switch and that a
normal mechanical switch is just on or
off similar to like how you're using a
light switch everyone's turn a light
switch on and they know that the lights
on your aim pad is different and that
it's similar to using a dimmer switch
based off of wherever you move that
switch up and down is how bright the
lights are and aim pad works in the same
type of technology that it can sense how
far down a key is being pressed based
off of how much light is being reflected
back to the sensor Coolermaster teamed
up with Lance in a bid to change how we
use keyboards both in gaming and
professional applications control pad
takes that tech and combines it with 24
mechanical switches of your choice
Cherry MX or gather on play games the
way they were meant to be played
maneuver turns seamlessly switch from
run to walk to creep just like when
using a controller without sacrificing
your aim with a mouse control that
doesn't need to be limited to gaming it
has the potential to be used with
professional applications and that's
where you come in we worked on the
product now it's time to develop the
software with your help
we want to work with the community to
see which functions you'd like to have 4
control pad we're sure control pad can
be used in ways we haven't even thought
of yet and with your backing we hope to
produce an analogue keypad that meets
your needs join us make it yours and
let's bring this project to life
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
