maybe bottom skin but as we go through
life being in the Sun exposed to
different chemicals and pollution things
we eat toxins our body's ability to
repair itself isn't quite to the job
that often can develop into skin
malignancies given that the skin is one
of the most exposed organs it's the
biggest organ in our body each year more
people get skin cancer from the Sun than
get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes
one American dies every hour from
melanoma and is one of the only cancers
the United States that still has an
increasing incidence but there's good
news unlike most cancers it is possible
to detect and treat skin cancer up to
95% of skin cancer deaths are
preventable by early action our mission
is to end all preventable skin cancer
deaths and it is possible that's why
we've created
so the hood is a polarized magnifying
lens that attaches to any smartphone
camera once attached it allows you to
take medical-grade images of your molds
together with our app you can track your
moles your skin cancer warning signs and
even share the images with the
dermatologists so now instead of waiting
weeks having uncertainty and concern
about your own health you get an answer
back within hours it gives you not only
peace of mind but you get a prioritized
dermatologist appointment instead of
waiting on three weeks where you go
through a family doctor and then to a
dermatologist the dermatologist will
tell you hey come straight into my
office and I'll get removed for you
right away so for the past 15 years
we've worked hard at developing the most
capable medical grade devices for
dermatologists now with houd we have
created a device specifically for
consumers that has been designed to be
friendly accessible intuitive we really
want to eradicate skin cancer and I
believe this is our best shot with your
help our vision is to add the dramatic
scope to the family of medical tools we
keep in the home with hood skin cancer
could become a thing of the past and we
can spend less time worrying and more
time enjoying the things we love
you
inspired by nature water Strider allows
your drone to land on water and other
difficult terrain now you can get unique
shots never before possible
white front pods stay out of the view of
the camera
an ultra lightweight design keeps your
drone nimble and in the air longer
carbon fiber and high-impact polymers
make a rugged and help protect your
drone
you
perfectly balanced center of gravity and
buoyancy means you can have confidence
both in the air and on the water water
Strider installs quickly and easily onto
a stock DJI phantom 3 &amp;amp; 4
it doesn't block access visibility or
the function of any part of the drone
plenty of clearance helps protect your
camera
now you can have confidence flying over
water
or landing at the worksite
eliminate those dangerous one-armed
caches and even land at a distance
just think of everything you can do with
water Strider

hi I'm Takahiro this is mess which we
are developing mesh is a creative
platform which enables everyone to
create an invention easily by kinetic
various wires math tags with your world
today it can be a real challenge to
realize your idea by using l2 links and
software we want to make it simple for
everyone which consists of two things
wires how to attack and video recording
camera
anyone can simply connect in size by
dragging and dropping on the tablet you
see it can also be connected to software
logical services and electronic devices
with open api then you can have the real
world using math in every possible way
for example by collecting asteroids on
sensors through an email function you
can enjoy communicating with your loved
one
so you can make something happen an
ordinary action can turn into something
speaker you want to throw a surprise
party we went to the Royal Opera
it will automatically take a picture of
that moment you can create entertaining
around crop for example he must exercise
to stop the around
you can add sense of humor to an
ordinary cake
these are only a few examples of the
mesh world so many applications are
possible depending on your idea and
lifestyles anyone can become an artist
or inverter your everyday life will be
more enjoyable half as exciting now see
Creole mesh and start we own invention
thank you for watching and sack for
being a part of this
oh man
honey mom did you get parmesan did we
get lines toilet paper butter banana
I got this
