improving almost there

efficiency swipe up to level 10 get
ready for your next interval keep moving
I am here to win I won't miss a single
heads

it's about knowing how you swim stroke
by stroke lap by lap so you can swim
better smarter
wouldn't it be great if we could wake up
every day knowing we'd never lose
anything again nomads scrambling at
breakfast or getting locked outside in
the evenings
well now you can there's a new little
tag called Qi polo Qi polo helps you
find things
heading to work and can't find your
phone simply shake your Qi polo to ring
it even when it's in silent mode
or always in a rush and want to keep
your valuables safe attach it you follow
to your keys wallet backpack or iPad and
you'll never have to worry again
in fact she polo is so compact easy to
use and child-friendly even your little
ones can enjoy them
finding your belongings is easy
if your Chi polo is far away you can log
on to the Chi polo network via any
device and find it on a map
the map can also show you where your
phone is
she polo also remembers where it's been
so why not look up its last location if
you're within a 60 meter radius of the
Chipola the app will count down the
distance letting you know if you're hot
or cold when you get close search by
sound and let your ears do the finding
the cheapo low battery lasts up to six
months but don't worry it'll send you a
friendly reminder when it's battery is
low on energy
replacing the battery is as easy as one
two three one two three done Qi polo
likes nothing more than to reunite
people with their possessions so if your
item isn't where it should be mark it as
missing and tap into the power of the Qi
polo community so that when your
belonging comes into someone else's
range their phone will notify you you
can connect up to nine G polos to any
iOS Android or Windows Phone so why not
collect one of each color

and perfect for
others too
