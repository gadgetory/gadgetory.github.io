first digital 3d microphone that plugs
us right into your iPhone as a musician
it's important I can have high quality
audio at a moment's notice
like when we need to record a demo the
second inspiration strikes and I barely
have to think about it because lolly
doesn't need a separate app battery or
memory card it's as simple as plugging
into your iPhone and recording lolly can
also be a great addition to a filmmakers
kit it'll instantly give you industry
standard 44.1 for 48 kilohertz audio
lolly is designed to be three feet so no
matter how you turn your smartphone it
adjusts the orientation so that when you
listen to it back it creates an
immersive feeling like you're really
there
and with the reversibility of the
Lightning port Raleigh can easily be
used with either camera we understand
that you guys are debuting a new song
tonight and for the podcaster a radio
journalist lolis portability means you
can always be ready to record
professional interviews and when you're
going to concerts
Lalli is a great way to document the
excitement getting crisp sound even when
your front row
Stud lace oh yeah that's what I'm
talking about
sexy ain't a no but that time there
easy comfortable just the way I like
endless personalization of film grab
them lazy lay some up get nice and
comfortable
time up
nice inside sniffing sniffing twice
wearing a watch means more than just
telling time I use my morning rides to
clear my mind and crystallize my
thoughts when it comes to watch design
they say stay within the structure don't
go out there it's the unknown to
innovate you must push yourself beyond
belief to get to the other side and when
you do it's amazing
my name is Chad I'm the co-founder of
live Swiss watches like you the watch
lover were always hungry for something
different something that stands out not
just another round watch introducing the
rebel and the name says it all we wanted
an exceptional look made from better
parts at a fair price the case is
machined out of a single piece of 316l
stainless steel and has some amazing
edges it's curved for comfort and
features a genuine sapphire crystal
front and back like old live washes the
eye-popping multi-layer dial brings time
to life in the tradition of fine Swiss
watchmaking the fifth finish and
construction are simply superb standing
behind our timepieces is key all of our
watches are fully backed by our
five-year international warranty every
rebel will be individually numbered as a
limited edition which means that once we
sell it that model it will be gone
forever
we're also redefining the word brand
live is about having that direct and
personal
connection with our fans besides why
should you be forced to pay three times
the actual market price just because of
some middleman
we need your backing to bring the rebel
to life and in turn you will receive one
or more than one of these truly
innovative washes so please back us and
join the revolution be part of the
thousands of happy backers from our tube
past campaigns we look forward to you
flaunting your limited-edition rebel so
don't miss out it sucks when we need our
phone the most and it runs out of juice
this is preserve the world's most energy
efficient mobile phone charger and power
bank combined the way it works is
amazingly simple you connect your USB
cable to preserve when charging once
your mobile is fully charged the
electricity stops going to the phone and
starts preserving the energy in the
power bank magic preserve is not just a
power bank but also has a removable
battery that fits nicely into any wallet
it will give you an extra 30% juice when
you need it most
this feature makes preserve the first
power bank in the world that can be used
in two different locations at the same
time these days power bank users carry
more charge than they actually need a
practice that is extremely inconvenient
when you use preserve you simply save
time and increase the efficiency and
longevity of your phone
hi I'm Hamza a year ago we started off
with a mission to create a unique and
innovative product to solve your problem
of overcharging we hired a team of top
engineers and designers posted several
service and went through a rigorous
design process to present to you an
optimal product in preserve however we
made preserves simple and ensure that it
doesn't change your existing habit of
charging your phone there are thousands
of companies making millions of
powerbanks but we have the most
efficient two and one product to date we
need your help to make preserve a
roaring success never have your phone
run out of power again when you need it
most
pre-order your unit and pledge your
support
planet computers we are passionate about
typing writing being productive creating
on-the-go since the introduction of
touchscreen mobile phones and tablets we
feel that it is very difficult to type
on these types of devices we decided to
reinvent the palm sized keyboard mobile
device that will benefit many who miss
using the keyboard on the move from
bloggers and creatives that need to
constantly write professionals who need
to read and write email create and edit
documents and spreadsheets hi I'm Martin
really fit I'm a founder of the air 4
which is a london-based design
consultancy and we in the past have made
a reputation from designing a lot of
handheld electronic equipments including
scion DDA's PDAs
our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why isn't there a product like this now
planet computers introduces the Gemini a
modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm-sized keyboard fully
integrated into the device it's sleek
metal clamshell design both protects the
device and beautifully tucks away the
palm-sized murti keyboard and screen
when closed it fits into a pocket
roughly the same as today's mobile phone
when open the innovative clamshell also
acts as a support of the device the
ultra wide 5.7 inch high res type screen
provides ample space for creating on the
go the full tactile keyboard is
recognized as the world's smallest
keyboard for finger touch typing Gemini
has a powerful 10 core processor a
graphics code processor and 64 gigabytes
of storage it is fully equipped with 4G
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabling both data
communications and mobile phone calls it
is designed to run the latest Android OS
and all your favorite apps as well as
Linux with a dual boot option all below
400 grams of weight the double sized
battery provides two week standby and 12
hours talktime
Gemini allows you to work in restricted
spaces comfortably on planes on trains
in coffee bars you can also hold the
device and use it with ease whilst in
the car standing up or on the bus I hope
you're interested in what we're trying
to do we think it's going to be a great
device thanks for watching please
