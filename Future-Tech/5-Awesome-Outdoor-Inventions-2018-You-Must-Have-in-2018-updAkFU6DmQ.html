camping hiking or even hanging out with
your family in the yard we added a
couple cool features like weighted
corners which holds it down on a windy
day like today one of my favorite parts
is when you're ready to go all you do is
reach inside the bag turn it inside out
give it a couple stuffs and it's right
back in its original form just like that
we left with a lot of extra room in the
bag you want to bring additional
belongings with you like sunscreen
lotion boots toys or whatever you prefer
we also added a side pocket to protect
your valuables like your phone your keys
and your wallet and when the beach sheet
is open and it's laid out the pocket is
actually on the inside throw it over
your shoulder and you're ready to go
that's Beach sheets
