this is the Ranger x1 backfires
all-terrain electric skateboard
backfires 96 millimeter wheels for the
g2 and g2 s opened up new possibilities
for street use and now with 165
millimeter wheels on the ranger x1
you're no longer limited to the streets
we haven't seen all-terrain hub motors
like these the - 900 watt motors along
with the powerful battery carry you
uphill with ease and without screaming
for attention
the airless honeycomb tires can handle a
multitude of terrains from jagged stone
tiles in the city to fair trails in the
woods all while giving you a comfortable
ride with its flexible double deck while
the Ranger x1 is both tough and rugged
it is still remarkably maneuverable the
double kings and trucks let you carve
and make sharp turns as well as any
longboard made for the streets and it's
incredibly easy to ride the combination
of large soft wheels a flexi deck and a
precise throttle and braking control
makes the Ranger x1 an exceptionally
stable and smooth ride
the backfire Ranger x1 is available for
pre-order on IndieGoGo starting June
30th at first it seems like a regular
top you give it a spin and it spins then
time passes minutes become more minutes
someone comes in to ask a question he
notices that it's already been 2 minutes
and this top on your table hasn't
stopped spinning you tell him that's
limbo and it's actually been 15 he calls
a friend or
more people gather you show them a trick
you can do you show them a few
someone points to the design you tell
them it's made from high-grade metals
you show them the video Powell was made
a delivery guy says that it looks like
that top from that movie everyone agrees
a few people finally ask how it works
maybe you tell them maybe you don't
maybe a friend who already knows tells
them that there's a battery-operated
gyro outside and that the entire thing
is rechargeable a girl who knows her
tech says wow that's pretty impressive
fuel there not everyone continues to
stare you go out to a meeting you come
back you type that spreadsheet you were
working on all afternoon people come in
and out limbo and keep suspended you go
home only after four
limp rests tomorrow it'll all start
again G robot is a personal posture
coach for your standing desk simply
stand on 0 mat and G robot will mocchi
duster throughout the day
ha I slip into bad posture G robot will
let you know what's wrong so you can get
back into proper posture again Oh your
leg is twisted to left
