my serial never gets soggy and with the
Oval you'll never have to eat soggy
cereal again either
mmm that first crispy bite is the best
and with the oval every bite is the
first bite let me show you the oval uses
unique spiral slide design all you do is
swoop and scoop it's not like an evil
you've ever seen before the oval is
perfectly designed to be held with the
textured rim and thumb shelf holding the
oval is easy it's great to use while
you're watching TV or eating in bed and
my kids absolutely love it plus I save
money because I don't pour out soggy
uneaten cereal my oval paid for itself
in less than a month but wait there's
more I always wanted to say that the
oval isn't just great for cereal it's
also perfect for soup and crackers
yogurt and fruit or my favorite milk and
cookies you never have to eat soggy
cereal again
what if your washer could be as pure as
it used to be hundreds of years ago
without any hormones chemicals or
pesticides
based on our experience from the
industrial water treatment we knew how
to get such natural and pure water but
we also knew it wouldn't be feasible in
the industrial sphere any time soon so
we decided to empower people at homes
and we developed a cocoon as far as we
know a cocoon is the most efficient
water purification device for our homes
in just 45 seconds your water is free of
any bacteria viruses chloride hormones
or chemicals if previously contained
anyone can use it
doesn't matter if you care about your
health health of your family or the
environment perhaps you just like clear
water but one of the most exciting
things about a quick you is that it
doesn't just filter the problem away but
it eliminates the harmful substances in
water so you are cleaning the
environment around you just by using the
device and purifying your own water aqua
coop is for everyone
I have a hereditary muscle disorder
similar to Reynaud syndrome that causes
me to lose motor function when I get
cold most people can warm their hands
back up fairly quickly and go on about
your business
unfortunately when my hands get cold it
may take several hours for me to regain
motor function this has been a problem
my entire life especially since I love
the outdoors I've struggled for years to
find a glove that was truly warm
waterproof and provided reasonable
dexterity for cold weather activities
that glove didn't exist until now the
steelhead glove
utilizing the one-piece patented out dry
construction process creates the
ultimate waterproof breathable barrier
in gloves this impenetrable layer is
permanently heat bonded directly to the
outer fabric leaving no seams no gaps
and no way for water to get in this
allows us to build a thinner lighter
glove with maximum dexterity and feel
traditional waterproof gloves use a
membrane that is nothing more than a
giant bag inserted between glove layers
moisture is trapped inside the glove
creating a cold damp feeling your hands
are dry but they are still cold because
you literally have a moisture barrier
that inhibits breathability and acts as
a cooling layer inside the glove how
much does this cooling effect have on
your hand temperature in a controlled
test we submerge to traditional membrane
glove and our steelhead glove in 50
degree water for 5 minutes and used a
military-grade thermal imaging camera to
record the results our steelhead gloves
outperformed the leading competition by
an astonishing 10.8 degree difference in
hand temperature
