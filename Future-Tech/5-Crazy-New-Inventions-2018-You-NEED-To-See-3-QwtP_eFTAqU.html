back it takes care of every move you
make but how do you take care of it most
of us sit for over nine hours every
single day and being honest it's hard to
avoid slouching eventually it results in
back pain stress affecting both
professional and personal life but don't
worry spino has got your back whether
you are sitting on the chair or floor
spino takes care of your posture it
provides constant support to the lower
back and let you sit comfortably for
hours spino is pretty simple to use
place the back pad around the lower back
knee pads around your knees and adjust
tension in the belt that's it
automatically you will sit in the
perfect posture but the best thing it
can be attached to the chair as well we
did the extensive product testing with
people from various backgrounds and here
is what they think about Spiner ah
guys but actually feels pretty good at
my lower back all right actually if it
goes add taking be complete pressure off
the lower back like you as soon as you
wrap it around and using like pull the
straps like whoa I'm sitting up straight
now you don't really notice it till you
put it on then these aren't I'm pretty
comfortable because of this I don't even
need the back part of this chair I'm a
cyclist so throughout the day our spines
are in danger basically because we're
always slouching so at the end of the
day I would love to just keep this on
for like a long period of time yeah easy
to figure out it's either like loosen or
tighten so it's pretty I would totally
use this wall gaming I got to use it at
work too so definitely help posture our
we referred research materials from
highly credible sources like Herman
Miller worked closely with amazing
designers physiotherapists and yoga
teachers to create a simple solution for
today's on-the-go generation when your
back feels good everything is better you
will be more confident and healthier
it's all about the strength and
confidence that you carry in your
posture life is not about surviving a
day anymore but to enjoy every moment of
it and now with your support we can
bring the spy know in reality thank you
so much
you
we first came up with the idea of
chalice for several reasons really we'd
been looking on the market to see what
was out there and although there are
some things a little similar there isn't
anything that has all the key
requirements that the chalice has
because we invented and designed the
only true snack and drinks vessel that
can be used domestically and
commercially the chalice has a thermal
barrier save get your chicken nuggets in
the top there and then you've got a cold
drink here by the time you get to the
bottom those chicken nuggets that are
still going to be warm the bowl is
sitting on top of the cup it's for your
snacks so we've had fruit salad we've
had fish and chips we've also had self
sir we tried everything that was the fun
bit about the talus we got to experiment
I don't think anyone likes food or
crumbs in their drink and what we have
here is a water tight connection to say
for instance you're eating that chose
nachos you've got those tiny crumbs
you've got salt you definitely don't
want that in the drink with the water
tight connection it's going to prevent
to any of that falling into your drink
or any of your drink coming into your
nachos all you have to do is pick it up
drink your drink eat your snack you can
be walking you can be sitting down and
watching your favorite sports game and
you never have to take it apart just
keeping it how you have it all set up
and good to go we've created
compartments so that you can put all
different snacks in your container at
any one time there are so many different
permutations of the chalice because in
everyday life we're always doing
different things so you're going to a
sporting event you want to load up the
large chalice with all your favorite
snacks and your favorite drink or if
you're going somewhere small you want to
take the smaller Talis because you don't
want to be carrying it around all day
you just want to have it around your
neck on the LAN yard you've got your
snacks in there and your drink and
you're good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
