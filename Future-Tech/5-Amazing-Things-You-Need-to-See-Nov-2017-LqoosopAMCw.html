with remarkable picture and sound when
we started building a powerful speaker
into such a small device without
compromising the picture seemed like an
impossible challenge so we had to get
creative we proactively built in a
360-degree speaker with enhanced bass
and boosted treble and cut 9000 holes in
the speaker grill to make capsule the
world's first pico projector with
omnidirectional sound but we didn't just
want it to be small and loud we wanted
to make it really smart traditionally so
called smart projectors come with TV
chipsets which makes them big and laggy

smartphone chipset ever used in a pico
projector into capsule making it the
smartest projector the world has ever
seen capsule is the first projector ever
