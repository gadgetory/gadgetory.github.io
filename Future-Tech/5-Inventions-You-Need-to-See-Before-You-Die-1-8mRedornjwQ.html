projector you already have into an
interactive whiteboard so you can share
your brilliant ideas learn a new
language
and use your computer like never before
work more quickly as a group whether
you're all in the same room or thousands
of miles away connected by the internet
and of course you can keep and share
what you create setup is easy download
the app in pair go touch with your
smartphone or Windows PC connect it to
your TV or projector and start creating
our team has been working on goals for
more than a year it's already working
hopefully and office and goes across
Korea but we want to bring go toast to
the rest of the world to do that we need
your help to scale up our production
beyond the body can make in our small
office please support us on Kickstarter
and you can make any TV or projector
interactive so this started about a year
ago where we have to measure the
contours of an organic surface turns out
that's a very hard problem the only
available solution cost twenty thousand
dollars and that that's ridiculous so we
set out to build a room we looked at
what was available out there at the
intersection of computer vision and
surface measurement and we couldn't find
a single solution that was compelling
the 3d scanners they were precise cost
tens of thousands of dollars and the
ones that were affordable one precise
level today at Kings
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it an industrial
revolution the eora Queenie scanner does
the exact opposite of the 3d printer it
lets artists makers and designers
captured objects and surfaces and turn
them into high-quality 3d models and use
them as part of the creative process we
knew we had to use a smart phone
Moeller phones are simply amazing we use
them to take pictures edit videos update
social media even for gaming the eora 3d
scanner is powered entirely by your
smartphone using it as easy just open
the app and press scan it will
automatically adjust focus and exposure
and drive a green laser to scan your
object as it sweeps we take over 1,000
photos and analyze them in real time to
give you a 3d model a typical scan takes
three to five minutes and gives you a
full-color mesh with up to eight million
points with a range of one meter you can
capture objects big and small accurate
to less than 100 microns that's the
thickness of a single sheet of paper
when engineering the scanner we had one
objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
lets you secure any module smartphone
the green laser let's just scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle we meticulously design every
aspect of the hardware and we've tested
seven different prototypes we've put
together a great team and we've lined up
several manufacturers now we need you to
help us put this together as acupuncture
positions it's our job to make sure that
patients feel comfortable and safe and
treatment there are times during
treatment when a patient may need
something and we are not in earshot they
may be feeling cold they might need to
use the restroom or they might just be
feeling uneasy but many patients for
fear of causing a scene or disturbing
others say nothing and power through
treatment and discomfort so with the
safety and comfort of every patient in
mind my colleague Rachel and I were
inspired to develop a simple device
introducing the roommate this small
wireless handheld button is given to a
patient in treatment and should they
need something they simply press it the
button sends a signal to an app on an
attending health care providers mobile
device then he or she knows the patient
needs help
currently there are many call-to-action
products on the market but much of what
is out there uses Bluetooth or other
forms of technology which makes it
susceptible to interference some of
these products are part of complicated
systems that require purchasing
additional software hardware or require
a subscription to a monitoring service
some of these products can also be noisy
and indiscreet the roommate is different
it's simple easy to use with minimal
setup straight out of the box since it's
designed to work with any Apple or
Android mobile phone tablet or smart
watch via an existing Wi-Fi network the
connections fast secure and reliable to
use the roommate all you need is a
button a mobile device and Wi-Fi the
roommates app can be configured to make
an audible a silent or a vibrating alert
though the roommate was developed by
acupuncturist for patient safety it has
potential for being used in other
industries industries such as spas rehab
centers childcare facilities and even
the gaming industry
over the past year our team of engineers
has been working hard to bring the
roommate to life we now have a working
prototype and at this stage are awaiting
your support so we can start our first
round of production and get the button
out into the real world so from all of
us at roommate thank you for your
consideration

at first but the smart top will make
dispensing pills easy measured and most
of all safe the smart top is invaluable
in helping ageing or impaired loved ones
maintain their independence their
dignity it's so easy to use here's a
phone video of a 93 year old grandmother
giving it a try I always knew there was
a way for people to take medication and
safe informative and cost-effective and
I always knew that there was a way that
people would get their dignity and
independence back and that's why I
invented smart tongue let me go through
the steps on how to prepare the top for
everyday use first simply screw on the
top
pop the top open press the record switch
and record your message
mom this is your blood pressure
medication take one blue pill with
breakfast don't forget that's it now
you're finished just close it when it's
time to take your prescription you
simply flip open the top and the
recording plays now this is your blood
pressure medication take one pill with
breakfast
don't forget tip the bottle twists and
the smart top dispenses one pill at a
time with smart top caregivers can have
peace of mind knowing their loved ones
can easily and safely access their
medication so caregivers never have to
worry about their loved ones taking
