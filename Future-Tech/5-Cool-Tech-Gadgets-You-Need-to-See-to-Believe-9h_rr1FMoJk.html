we are extraordinary we are innovators
we are leaders the future doesn't just
happen it is created by those with a
vision to change the world
sleep we spend winter our life sleeping
with only did and many of us wish we got
married yep technology which has
transformed so many of our behaviors as
done very little to improve the way with
late some would argue that technology
has been worsening sleep I can't stand
for I fidelity canopy and will change
this way of thinking back in two
thousand eight I can become the world's
first smart bed ever conceived we
believe it represented an icon in the
industry this first success give us the
motivation to go back to work and
concentrate all our effort for the past
years developing a new again that is
much better in every way while designing
a came bed I was thinking about what
kind of experience we could create in
order to reach people lives this
experience is the driving force behind
the design of the product and it comes
to life thanks to technology we named it
our beds I can because its design
suggests a new interpretation of the
classic canopy creating the ultimate
comfort zone around the bed and
expanding it to a new concept of Cocoon
the new icon is much more than a bed
combined with an entertainment system I
can is the first bed integrated platform
based on open source software every
feature can be tailored to individual
habits because few things are more
personal than the bed environment people
working on advanced research and sleep
technology we find I can to be a great
hardware and software framework for the
development of new sleep related
applications the new again is also
easier intuitive to use and will be
provided with the amazing new features
like voice control and the health
monitoring application your idea of bed
relaxin dreams and entertainment will
never be the same
have you ever dreamt of improving your
home with crown molding or refrain were
faced with the tricky business of
getting it right crown moldings are one
of the architectural features that
really add value to a home they had a
visual presence that makes a home feel
more upscale although until now
installing crown molding has been a task
that strikes fear in the heart of every
amateur carpenter even some
professionals because the molding sits
at an angle on the wall each joint is
made of compound angles and hard to get
rights the biggest problem has always
been cutting the angles rather than the
actual installation the angles in a room
of the shift slightly and very few rooms
have exactly square corners with 90
degrees because it comes out from the
wall it really is a 3d cuts not getting
it right makes a time consuming and
expensive because you get a lot of waste
and that is enough to make you lose your
mind luckily we have a solution for you
one cut is a world patented measurement
tool that lets you get it right at the
first try it makes no difference whether
it's an outer or inner angle you have to
measure you can keep the instrument up
against the salt or precise cut no more
calculations no complicated settings of
the saw no more trial and error but
perfect results each time without wasted
a failed efforts so say goodbye to ugly
gaps and crown molding joints this handy
little tool will help you take on crown
molding installations along with other
molding projects such as base molding
all kinds of frames and many other
woodwork projects after numerous design
iterations and prototypes we finally
have a fully functional world patented
solution we've worked closely with
industrial leaders to find the best
materials and refined details we have
manufacturers ready the only thing
missing is your support check below for
more information about the projects and
the various reward levels you can only
make one cut of reality if we reach our
goal so please support us now we're
super excited to see what you can create
with one cuts
thank you for watching
I've below hub we love cycling we cycle
everywhere around however cycling is not
always that safe in the city when we
share the road space with cars we are
not really visible when turning and
breaking that's why we came up with
linkers
the blinkers had a set of lights that
may cyclist be seen on the stood and
expected by other vehicles in the road
from every angle and in every situation
there is a real blinker and a front
blinker that show the direction of the
turn from the back and from the front
all these control with a path easily
reachable with the thumb two lasers
create a safety perimeter so cars
respect the cyclist space we have also
equipped over blinkers with smart
position lights and braking lights our
product has many functionalities but
it's simple to use blinkers are easy to
connect and remove because of our
magnetic system you can put our moans on
the handlebar under the saddle on the
rack or on the basket it has a powerful
battery that it's chargeable with USB
and of course it's fully water-resistant
we have been working hard with a top
design studio to build a product that
makes your bag like urban and dynamic
we're a team of students from ETH in
Zurich and we have fun developing smart
technology for cyclists we are ready to
start manufacturing but first we need
your support by back in this project you
will contribute to my cycling better
please help us spread the word by
sharing this prayer with your friends
let's make cycling safe thanks for
watching
what an amazing city I need to write
about this place did you ever miss a
flash of creative genius well you're
definitely not alone I need to bring
Jessica here she would love this place I
have to share that with everybody we are

your thoughts with a quick motion

focused on what really matters to you
organize your notes with hashtags and
integrate them with your favorite apps

removes noise and runs it through our
own AI system for noise pattern
identification

ideas with ease when you out for a walk
or run it works offline just fine so

station that can fit the device and all
of your interchangeable backs with all

so easy to forget a great idea sandstone
is a note pad built for your busy
everyday life it did the soil here to
build the first prototype now we need
your support to produce the first batch
hi I'm Jessica banks I'm a scientist
roboticist and founder of rock paper
robot design and engineering from out of
Brooklyn we make kinetic furniture
what's kinetic furniture well basically
decor that moves like these levitating
tables for this bouncing one or our
latest alley chair inspired by our
experience living and working in New
York see this is our office but this is
our office the city inspires us informs
us and acts as a constant reminder of
the diversity of people and problems
that we have to consider when we design
plus the responsibility we feel to not
create more
come see what we mean
the alley chair retracts 22 inches so
it's ideal for small spaces
at flat packs for transport and we all
know how important that is it's
lightweight so it's easy to move around
salli chair has a built-in lumbar
support so it's super comfy after a long
day on your feet
and because the chair body is made out
of aluminum and the default amber is
made out of teak it's great for outdoor
environments and because we're fans of
personal expression ollie is
customizable the tambor the flexible
slatted seat part is interchangeable so
you can swap it out to suit your style
and just for our kickstarter backers
we're offering some limited edition
finishes for your chairs including an
awesome silkscreen by our talented
friend Wisby no extra space no problem
store your holly chair on the wall like
a work of art and of course the chair is
perfect for home to ollie can be your
primary seating or accommodate your
space for extra guests so storing the
chair might seem like sleight of hand
manufacturing it doesn't take magic it
takes money that's where you come in by
supporting your Kickstarter campaign
you'll be the first to get your butts on
the ollie chairs but far lower than the
expected retail price and you'll be
supporting a female run manufacturing
company that's will manufacturing so
thank you from all of us at rock paper
robot support Ollie and let all I
support you and don't forget to share
the chair
pink cowboy here nyala chair get
yourself the Kickstarter a loser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
