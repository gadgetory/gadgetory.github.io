imagine this is where you live this is
your home security cocoon it takes you
seconds to set up and is all you need to
look after your home this is your family
getting ready for their day they are
noisy in an everyday kind of way
it's these sounds that make your house
your home and cocoon understands that
cocoon uniquely detects intruders
through the sounds they make as they
move covering more of your home than any
other home security device in the world
detecting movement most security cameras
would miss looking after everything from
here to here
kakouton sound-based security is so
smart you'll never have to worry about
your home again it understands that home
time is your time respecting your
privacy while you're there and standing
on guard when you're away so your home
security isn't something you need to
remember as you dash out at the door for
work when your home goes quiet cocoon
stands on guard looking after what you
care about most cocoons sub sound
technology is powered by an AI smart

sounds are that make your house your
home and filter them out learning about
your home to better protect it the

everyday sounds cocoon sends an alert

and the wide-angle camera works day and
night just like you wherever you are in
the world cocoon gives you a window into
your home so you can check in when you
wish you were there
cocoon is home security without the
hassle enjoy the things in life that
matter and worry less I thought it was
coming from the two speakers and when
you reveal what was actually happening I
was very surprised it's cool it's it's
like kind of nothing ever really heard I
was aghast and I haven't been that in a
lot of years really expert in rock the
core is the most advanced wireless
speaker system ever developed five
digital signal processors allow us to
render the audio in a way that is
totally revolutionary you're getting
stereo sound from this one tiny little
box the convention right now is that for
true high-end listening you have to have
two speakers the core changes that you
can have one and it truly sounds like to
throw a little box like this so trade
although imaging is very present
leveraging a combination of wave field
synthesis and beam forming allows us to
create an acoustic bubble in the room so
that the image stays stable no matter
where you're sitting you can almost see
each person in the band in the room with
you I can move my head around and the
location of the sound source remains
intact as if it was you know a hologram
there's no speaker that can do anything
like this
everything is smart but sound systems
art and this is the thing that we're
doing at mass fidelity is creating truly
smart sound systems if you have an NFC
enabled phone just touch the top of the
core and you're automatically connected
high density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the core is
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the cores USB connector
will recharge it for you
the cores control input makes it home
automation compatib
in fact the core has all the inputs
you'll ever need any smart device will
work instantly via bluetooth hook up
your Apple TV to add pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once for the past 18
months we've been developing the core
with engineers and factories to make
sure that we can deliver it to you a
beautifully designed wireless speaker
that gives you true stereo sound for any
room in your house the core will be the
only wireless speaker you'll ever need
and the most exciting audio product
you've ever owned there's something
about working out and the way it makes
you feel almost everyone when tasked
would like to have more fitness in their
lives but for most of us it falls to the
bottom of our priority list so we
developed the body boss 2.0
we wanted a product it would empower
people to reach their goals where you'd
be able to exercise more often and
consistently we want a product that is
compact something that could do it all
with no restrictions this equipment is
something that anyone could use no
matter their fitness level a product it
takes all these concepts from the gym
and combines them into one solution
bring in the gym to you the platform is
strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height there's even
cloth in the bands to protect you simply
clip in to get started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spin a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight
adding bands are like increasing your
weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor and
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live replay
