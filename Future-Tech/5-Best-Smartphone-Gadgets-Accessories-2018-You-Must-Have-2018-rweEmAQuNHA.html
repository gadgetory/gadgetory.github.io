two years ago we did a Kickstarter with
loom Cube and thank you for those who
backed us
okay we're stoked to be back on
Kickstarter bringing a July flight
we've engineered the life-flighted to be
a thousand lumens waterproof to 30 feet
half the size and a third the way we
want it to be the light that you take
with you anyway it's something that you
want to keep with you because you never
want to miss that moment
a couple years ago at my foundation
event I was introduced to the product
and from that point on I was very
interested in luma Q now we've had the
LifeFlight half the size 70 percent of
the light is still there it's an amazing
piece of electronics you forget that
it's in your pocket because it's so
small and so compatible with everything
as the company grows it still listens to
its customers and that's what's so
amazing and seeing everybody work
together out of absolute love for what
we're doing and the solutions that we're
creating
doing something different whether it's
photography or surfing with the lights
at night
this lights opened up a giant
opportunity for me I don't want to miss
one surf session after the Sun Goes Down
we're a software company with hardware
devices that solves problems in the
mobile imagery world there's great
companies out there that have created
great products but we're just that
perfect complement we realized that in
order to have the perfect image the
perfect memory you need the perfect
light I think life light brings that to
you
it's cool to be partners with a company
that allows you to make the product look
sick but to also have fun
I believe that's what Luna cube is all
about is having fun and trying to light
up things you normally wouldn't be able
to whenever I am or whatever we're doing
I'm finding that we're using the
LifeFlight for so many more things than
we ever intended the light waterproof
it's so small it allows us to do things
that we weren't able to do before and
yeah people night surf but not what
lights us bright not what the technology
of cameras these days we're capturing
things that were never really imaginable
this is so different to anything else
that's ever been shot and surfing like
this I'm just stoked to be a part of
this movement
just cool that you can tank LifeFlight
and put it in the ocean film Jamie
O'Brien and then you know you can take
it to some skate spot with me and films
an incredible scenery shot we need to
take you to the snowboarding you guys we
have to take it everywhere that's what's
great about life flight is that it's
bringing all these different athletes
together because now we can do unique
things that we weren't able to do before
because you couldn't see I'm stoked to
be with the loom cute family it's
allowed me to do some insane things
check out the Kickstarter light it up
have fun
please support us let us show you what
we got
I'm confident with the team around us
we'll continue to bring the most
innovative products to market
donate to Kickstarter let us bring some
light to your life
