Kyra light and I invite you to join the
revolution in custom savers by pledging
with khyber light today you know as
longtime Star Wars obsessed fans with
engineering backgrounds we set out to
engineer the very best combat ready
custom sabers in the industry as we
looked around the world of custom savers
we felt there was a huge opportunity for
someone to come in and really do it
right to not only provide a high quality
custom saber that's durable and built to
last but to make it affordable and
quickly available to fans of all ages
anywhere in the world and that's exactly
what we've done with kai.berlick
each khyber light custom saber was
designed to be combat-ready
our goal was to create a fully fighter
boat built to last custom Sabre
guaranteed in fact we do something that
no one else in the industry is willing
to we offer a lifetime guarantee on
every khyber light blade we can do this
because each khyber light blade was
created with our proprietary plastic
blend making it virtually indestructible
in addition to the revolutionary blade
each hilt is custom machined from 7075
aircraft grade aluminum nobody else is
doing that guys these are built to last
the khyber Lite hilt comes ready with a
screw off middle top and bottom overlay
that allow you to mix and match the
custom accessories you want now with our
initial release we will offer a 12-pack
accessory kit giving you nearly a
hundred custom build options to choose
from
next we've developed a cutting-edge and
proprietary LED technology that gives
off over 320 lumens making the khyber
light the absolute brightest custom
saver in the galaxy what's more each
khyber light custom saver comes with 20
colors built in at no extra cost from
red to blue to green to yellow and so
much more there's just not anything as
bright as the khyber light and that's a
fact add these multicolor features with
all the accessories and that gives you
over 1500 custom options with khyber
light another unique feature that comes
standard with every khyber lightsaber is
the rich quality sound including the
flash on clash feature creating the
ultimate saber fighting experience for
similar or even inferior products you
can expect to pay anywhere between six
hundred and fifty and all the way up to
twelve hundred dollars but for a
fraction of that price you get the full
Khyber Light custom saber experience

saver in the galaxy with its
indestructible blade in lifetime
