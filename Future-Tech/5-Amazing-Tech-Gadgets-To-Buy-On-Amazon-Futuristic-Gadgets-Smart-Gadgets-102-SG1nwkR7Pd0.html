Sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big their apps are
confusing they take too long to connect
when they're hassle to install I'm
pretty handy Sesame's different you can
install it in seconds literally no one's
screwing no replacing Sesame has a
patented design that fits any latch
anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this and I can
get the optional Wi-Fi access point it
plugs into the wall nearby so Sesame is
always on my home network and it's
linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries and with no
keys it's easy to let other people in
too
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't I get notifications when my lock
opens and closes so I can always know
what's going on no matter where I am and

if you love coffee and want to take your
brew to the next level you will love the
crew sifter great coffee starts with a
consistent grind brewing coffee with an
uneven grind is like cooking with
different sized ingredients to get the
best results all your ingredients must
be the same sadhus coffee is no
different an inconsistent grind will
result in an uneven extraction and
unwanted flavors even the best grinders
on the market can't produce a truly
consistent grind with the crude sifter
you get the perfect grind every time no
matter what grinder to use thanks to the
croup sifters multiple interchangeable
sins you can control the exact grind
size for your particular recipe and
brewing method the crude sifter uses two
tiers of sids
to remove particles that are both too
big and too small giving you perfect
when brewing that perfect cup you
control your brew down to the second
gram and degree now you can control it
down to the micron and taste coffee the
way it was meant to taste
the curve sifter many have tried to
affect the grinder we affected the grind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
