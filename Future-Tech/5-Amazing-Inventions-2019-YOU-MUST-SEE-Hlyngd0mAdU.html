straight down yeah Hajj excellent hi I'm
John a founder of hero inflatable shirts
in recent years we've been refining a
product to help save the lives of people
who experience difficulties in water
it's designed for children and adults
alike and is suited for all water-based
activities according to the World Health
Organization global estimates of 360,000
people die from drowning annually these
situations are preventable with
lifejackets but they're often stowed
away and not easily accessible and are
also bulky and restrictive we believe
we've developed an alternative solution
our hero inflatable Raschi has been
designed not only for boating but for
all water-based activities if the
unexpected occurs the hero is
user-friendly and simple to activate you
can instantly inflate the hero and
signal for help the hero is equipped
with an easy-access replaceable co2
cartridge for instant inflation and an
oral inflator for manual backup it can
be used for swimming snorkeling body
boarding surfing stand-up paddling pipe
surfing kayaking boating waterskiing I
think you get the idea
hero rushes are constructed using a soft
and flexible polyester lycra combination
and our double lining ensures your shirt
will not rub against you the adjustable
waistband fits this shirt snug against
your body preventing it from riding we
are certifying our prototypes to iso
standards to provide where is confidence
in knowing a hero
in the last 12 months we've been
refining the look of the shirt and now
ready to go into production
while we believe we have a great product
and then it has huge potential in saving
lives around the world we really need
your support to make it a reality with
your support the hero Russia will become
the hero that saves lives the toilet
brush is the grossest thing in the
bathroom are you brushing your teeth you
can always douse the brush in liquid
chemicals concentrated cleaning powders
or a myriad of cleaning sprays but now
there's a better way introducing lumi
the first-ever self sanitizing toilet
brush and base lumi uses UV light
technology to kill germs and fight
bacteria for you 3 UV lights are
situated on the inner circle that
provides surround lighting to reach
every bristle top-to-bottom the inside
of the base also has a specialized
coating that reflects the germ killing
wavelength of the UV light the smart
base recognizes when the brush has been
returned to storage and automatically
begins the cleaning cycle it's so easy
even a child can understand it UV light
is mutagenic they're very molecular
bonds in microorganism all DNA producing
thymine dimers at kilometres hospitals
use this UV light technology to clean
rooms surgical instruments and even the
air now we're bringing that same
technology to your home the holder keeps
the brush out of sight when you're not
using it and allows the UV lights to
totally surround the brush killing all
the little nasties the smart base also
has moisture evaporating vents that
provide drainage to a hidden evaporation
pan so the brush can dry quickly
allowing the UV lights to work even more
effectively the Lummi brush is also a
step above the rest with antimicrobial
bristles that are super strong and a
reinforced high-density polyethylene
candle you'll find cleaning quick easy
and comfortable it comes with a
replaceable head so you can use your
Lumi brush for years to come we need
your help
let's make your life easier and cleaner
take a look at the pledge rewards decide
what's right for you and back us now we
love the Kickstarter community and
appreciate your support
don't use that it's filthy use this it's
cleaner back to the Kickstarter today
and say goodbye to the grossest thing in
your bathroom
the second grossest thing in your
bathroom because back hair is probably
the grossest thing in the bathroom I
mean I don't not mine husbands he's
lovely
hairy no cavities
this is luma pod an ultra compact tripod
solution when we travel we always pack a
tripod well we got tired of lugging
around heavy bulky tripods to take
forever to set up that's why we've
created more power with a simple pull
and twist luma Paz patented tensioning
mechanism ensures a stable set up in
seconds
we created two separate models and
optimize them for different demands
whether you're spending a beautiful day
with your family spontaneously hiking
camping and mountains
we're exploring a new city spend less
time setting up your gear and more time
capturing those amazing life memories
twist pull set and you're ready to go
we integrated modular leg extensions so
you can easily adapt them apart to your
needs it's made to be brought everywhere
and designed to be ready instantly so
you can capture and share your
experiences in the moment use it with
your smartphone mirrorless or DSLR
camera
it easily fits in your pack so you can
always enjoy the benefits of a tripod
completely capture those long exposures
I furthest least Napa so
set it down to capture self-portrait
we are so close to finalizing this
project back us today helping little
pockets of the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
