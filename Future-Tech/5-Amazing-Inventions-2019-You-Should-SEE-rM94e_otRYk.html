hi I'm Steve and this is power policy
resistors device perfect for children it
provides nighttime comfort using
non-disruptive lighting patterns trojan
often needs some light in order to feel
a sense of safety and security in the
absence of their parents being
physically present Paul does this in a
way that supports children's mental
development and provides a comforting
racialized appearance one of the best
features about power is the light rhythm
that is given to the children a lot of
children they're very worried about
falling asleep in the dark and one of
the things that that power to support
them with is having a soothing light and
between themselves or their parents they
can actually control that's going to
give them enough lights to feel
comfortable but not too much that
they're unable to fall asleep in a
natural soothing way we know sometimes
kids have bad dreams I wake up in the
middle of the night the distress
detector in power monitors the sound in
the room recognizes changes in the other
levels can automatically reactivates
power to help soothe your child back to
sleep
power built-in motion sensor or more to
sleep activity and send data to your
smart device via a dedicated mobile app
perfect for keeping track of home asleep
you or your child is getting power has
many great features are the best feature
of power is that anyone can use it but
you're a kid whether you're a teenager
or whether you're an adult when we first
started talking to people about power I
was surprised to hear how many adults
actually wanted it for themselves
because everyone needs to sleep and a
device that works with feel on how you
sleep give you the right like pattern
the right combination of audio and the
ability to shut off on ice boned is
exactly what everyone needs to get a
good night's sleep connect power to your
smart device wirelessly using
and India tea you want to send to power
can be done from your mobile or tablet
device we think that is great for
parents and caregivers who want to
repair their own voice and have it play
about imagine your child can listen to
your own voice while they sleep if you
didn't want to work at all we built this
house out of straw
what I like most about power is that it
stands alone you don't need to have it
plugged into an outlet so if your
bedside table is nowhere near outlet
because to put power next to you it's
not gonna be a problem and it worked
three to five days on a full charge and
that's really important so that's power
you have a great product an amazing team
and now we were to take power in TV
production but we need your support to
make this a reality
