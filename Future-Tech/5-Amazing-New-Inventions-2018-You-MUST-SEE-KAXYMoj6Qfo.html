Oh
Oh
hi I'm Steve and this is power policy
restlessness device perfect for children
it provides nighttime comfort using
non-disruptive lighting patterns
children often needs some light in order
to feel a sense of safety and security
in the absence of their parents being
physically present Paul does this in a
way that supports children's mental
development and provides a comforting
reassurance to parents one of the best
features about power is the light rhythm
that is given to the children a lot of
children they're very worried about
falling asleep in the dark and one of
the things that that power support them
with is having a soothing light and
between themselves or their parents they
can actually control that's going to
give them enough lights to feel
comfortable but not too much that
they're unable to fall asleep in a
natural soothing way we know sometimes
kids have bad dreams I wake up in the
middle of the night the distress
detector in power monitors its own
Indian recognises changes in the other
levels can automatically reactivates
power to help soothe your child back to
sleep past built-in motion sensor or
more to sleep activity and send data to
your smart device apply a dedicated
mobile app perfect for keeping track of
home asleep you or your child is getting
power has many great features but the
best feature of power is that anyone can
use it but you're a kid whether you're a
teenager or whether you're an adult when
we first started talking to people about
power I was surprised to hear how many
adults actually wanted it for themselves
because everyone needs to sleep and a
device that works with you on how you
sleep give you the right like pattern
the right combination of audio and the
ability to shut off on its own
it's exactly what everyone needs to get
a good night's sleep connect power to
your smart device wirelessly using
and India tea you want to Center power
can be done from your mobile or tablet
device we think that is great for
parents and caregivers who want to
record their own voice and have it play
about how badly your child can listen to
your own voice while they sleep if you
didn't want to work at all we built this
house out of straw a second little pig
what I like most about power is that it
stands alone you don't need to have it
plugged into an outlet so if your
bedside table is nowhere near all that
because they'll pop out next to you it's
not gonna be a problem and it worked
three to five days on a full charge and
that's really important so that's power
you have a great product an amazing team
and now we were to take power eight
degree production but we need your
support to make this a reality
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
