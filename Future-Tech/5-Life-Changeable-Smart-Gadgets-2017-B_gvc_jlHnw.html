smart suitcase that follows its user
while avoiding any obstacles in its path
the code move system is the brains of
the RR one in charge of sensing the
environment planning reasonable paths
and avoiding obstacles all while
following its user the sensing ability
of the co move system is made possible
by multi sensor fusion technology which
is mainly based on a set of sonars
it.death sensor co AI and cliff detect
sensors that allow our one to avoid
stairs and other dangers drop offs a
customized bracelet will be provided
with each r1 the como system ensures
that our one rolls along within an arm's
length distance to the bracelet on the
user at all times a pair of active wheel
units when they retract will design
similar to aircraft landing gears
propels the suitcase forward when both
wheel units deployed the active wheel
units will retract as soon as you touch
the handle switching are one from
autonomous mode into manual mode
our one follows at a maximum speed of
4.5 miles per hour sufficient for most
daily needs the wheel units are powerful
enough to tackle any and all kinds of
terrain Co smart intelligent walk will
automatically lock itself to ensure your
valuables remain safe a simple double
tap on your bracelet will activate the
find immune function and r1 will
intelligently plan around to make its

co robot r1 make travel less of a drag
Oh
Oh
no one the corner I know wake me up
hello let me go go my name is Peter
Treadway and IM CTO and co-founder at
acton actin is a company that designs
and manufactures personal transportation
we are introducing a longboard the likes
of which the world has never seen carbon
fiber pressure cast aluminum extruded
aluminum cnc cut we are using for hug
motors all-wheel drive people all wheel
drive the one that will get you up most
of the steepest hills in America and
around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we got you we have two more models what
we call the blink s and the blink s2
it's a different construction than the
quattro is made of wood but it has
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
the aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the s2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor it goes a little faster and
just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the Quattro or the blink guess
or the blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you the
moji heat roller you'll never want to
use the traditional foam roller again mo
geez roller blends massage and heat
therapy giving you a more effective and
comfortable rolling experience we are
mochi an innovator in massage and
recovery were runners cyclists hikers
Yogi's like you we strive to keep active
and stay fit we've created a
groundbreaking dual therapy heated
roller it's effective and feels great
mochi has combined the benefits of
traditional form rolling with the
comfort and relaxation of heat therapy
rolling has never felt so good
our innovative two-piece design fits
easily in most microwaves then just heat
it up athletes have long used massage
and heat therapies for warm-up and
recovery foam rollers have become the
massage tool of choice for athletes and
active people here's the moji difference
rolling stretches and elongate the
muscles this helps ease muscle tightness
soreness and pain adding the power of
heat therapy reduces muscle stiffness
increases circulation and raises tissue
temperature you get improved range of
motion and healing plus it feels great
you'll want to use the moji heat roller
every day like many people I know the
benefits of foam rolling but I don't do
it as often as I should my vision for
moji was creating a roller I'd actually
want to use everyday I've got a medical
background and I know that heat helps to
relieve muscle soreness and tightness
our challenge was adding the benefits of
heat and creating a game-changing roller
that's convenient easy to use and feels
great we worked hard with our product
development partner for over a year to
create our patent-pending moji heat
roller a breakthrough product that
you'll want to use every day so we had
the challenge of finding a thermoplastic
that would heat safely and reliably in
the microwave oven we looked at a bunch
of different plastics and plastic
additives and experimented with
different concentrations until we found
a combination that had the right
properties to work really well for the
Mojo
we spent a year now on the moji heat
roller we love it and we are so excited
to get it to the hands of competitive
athletes weekend warriors and anyone
looking to enhance their warm up in
recovery thank you so much for your
support join us and help support moji as
we bring the hottest new roller product
to you moji it's how we roll
