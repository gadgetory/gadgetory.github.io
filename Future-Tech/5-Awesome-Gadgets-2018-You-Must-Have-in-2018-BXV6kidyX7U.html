you go please back or share our project
and show us how you use your noodle
if you need to carry two phones on the
go for whatever reason piece is a
simplest solution this is how it works
take the SIM card out from your work
phone put in beefs connect piece to your
private phone via bluetooth and now you
can get rid of your work phones when
your friends or family call your private
number
hey I'm gonna shoot right now can I call
you back in a minute
or your boss calls your working number
it all happens in one phone via the
piece app you can control all the
settings of both your numbers separately
manage your contacts send text messages
basically just work your phone like you
normally do peace is so small it fits
easily anywhere you barely even know
it's there
oh one last thing
when your phone and piece are over 15
meters apart piece will ring to prevent
you from losing your only phone you can
also use piece to look for your phone
just like you would your car in the
parking lot that way we make sure you
have one and only one phone on you at
all times
likewise if peace is in your wallet you
can use the piece app to look for it so
it's nothing big just this piece right
here and it will certainly make your
life a little easier thank you
historically we've made speakers and
headphones and made a very big business
out of making products that delight
customers we're gonna now help people
live more fulfilling lives with audio
products that are focused on wellness
rather than just entertainment so there
are three pillars of general health and
wellness some nutrition exercise and
sleep and most people go through life
thinking they can cheat sleep but they
can burn the candle at both ends there
are significant health implications for
not sleeping enough and not sleeping
well things like cardiovascular disease
type 2 diabetes obesity cancer
Alzheimer's are all medically
statistically linked to poor and
insufficient sleep this product is
designed to protect people sleep from
unwanted disruptive noises if the
honking of taxicabs people talking loud
neighbours a dog barking in a hotel
environment that you're just not
uncustomed to the snoring person right
next to your head I mean we've been
learning about years at Bose for a very
long time and we've been a little
leveraged a lot of that knowledge we
combine boses noise-isolating stay here
plus tips with soothing sounds that are
optimally tuned for masking noises so
sound masking works on this basic
principle that if you have this
disturbing sound that's going on let's
say like a low rumble of a snore and you
play another sound that's close to it in
frequency so let's say a low like
thunder storm that thunder storm is
actually going to help to
cover the original snoring sound what
makes it special is our ability to do
that in a form factor that is tiny
comfortable and stable so many people
sleep with the ear pressing into a
pillow so the stay here plus tips are
incredibly soft and you'll see when you
touch them and feel them how comfortable
they really are and how you like having
them in your ear
Bose has never made a product that's
this small before we sort of debated and
fought over every millimeter that we
could gain to make the products smaller
it's actually very easy to use so you
download the Bose sleep app insert the
sleep buds into your ears select which
noise masking sound you prefer schedule
a wake up alarm and you're good to go
the charging case is actually very cool
you get two nights of sleep on a single
charge to the sleep buds themselves and
then the charging case will provide one
additional full charge while you're on
the go we want to bring customers in
earlier than we have traditionally done
it bows to help us validate the product
vision I think one of the elements that
I'm most interested in hearing feedback
on is just the idea of the product
becoming part of your nightly routine
for me I want to know everything with
this solution to this really massive
problem that matters tremendously to
people we're going to change millions of
people's lives it's that simple
did you know your toothbrush misses
almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth so tilde floss
but who likes flossing anyone that's
what I thought and I don't blame you
it's awkward it's time-consuming and
here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way until now water flossers have been
one of the only players in the game
their tedious messy and more often than
not end up stuffed under a cabinet
somewhere
- shower is next level water flossing
and so much more it's a complete oral
hygiene experience in the comfort of
your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to all care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which hits the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush can't it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the
shower you'll never run out of water and
you won't have to sacrifice any precious
counterspace and let's not forget about
the revolutionary gut massager ear
gating and stimulating blood flow in
your gums this is a huge part of gum
disease prevention and in less than 10
seconds
you can flush out everything between all
your teeth while massaging your go
for the first time ever you'll actually
enjoy with each attachment you can
adjust the water pressure and
temperature to your comfort level and
use with your choice of water mouthwash
or tooth whitener when you're ready to
switch attachments just remove the swab
worried about getting water everywhere
well you're in the shower so it doesn't
matter and with multiple attachments the
whole family can use tooth show which
means better oral hygiene for everyone
that means a lot fewer expensive and
painful dental procedures and fewer
instances of gum disease you probably
won't be surprised to learn it was
created by a dental hygienist Lisa's
been deep in the tooth world for over 25
years and she realized there wasn't a
single easy convenient way for her
patients to effectively clean them to
you so she decided to design on herself
no power source no mess and because it's
in the shower to shower is easy to
integrate into your routine becoming as
second-nature as washing your hair face
Lisa and her team have been hard at work
perfecting tube showers design and
prototyping over 2
now they just need your help getting to
shower to the masses with the funds
raised here they'll be able to place a
bulk first order to get these made and
bring to shower to market for a whole
new approach to rural hygiene</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
