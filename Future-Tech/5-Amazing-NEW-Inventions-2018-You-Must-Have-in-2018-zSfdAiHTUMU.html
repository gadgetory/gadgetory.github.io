water it's a living breathing thing a
good gardener has to be mindful you have
to understand the interaction between
all of nature's elements and what those
mean for your plants eighteen months ago
I set out to create something that could
change how people interact with their
land their plants in their garden
something that could help them better
understand their environment because
understanding your environment is the
first step to conserving it I created a
company called Eden and this is our
first product the Eden garden sensor
Eden assess the soil nutrition in your
garden tracks how humid or dry it may be
the temperature the kind of sunlight
you're getting throughout the day then
Eden takes all that information about
your garden and cross-references it with
meteorological data from the area you
live in
Eden can tell you what type of
fertilizer is best for your soil and
what vegetables will thrive in it
when to plant them and how often to
water and that advice isn't just based
on generalities it's based on what's
happening in your garden right now the
end result is healthier more sustainable
plants and hopefully a deeper connection
to your garden it's really easy to
overwater or underwater your garden our
sprinkler systems just aren't that smart
we wanted to change that this is the
Eden water valve it's a smart controller
that manages your existing watering
system unlike other watering systems the
Eden valve doesn't use a preset schedule
Eden knows exactly what your garden
needs on any given day and the valve
automatically manages your sprinkler
system to make sure your plants get
precisely that that means no more waste
no more under watering no more over
watering your plants get just what they
need if you're a novice gardener we can
help you grow something beautiful if
you're a Master Gardener even can give
you insight into what's happening
beneath the surface of your soil my new
change is in acidity and moisture the
kind of plant stressors that you
wouldn't otherwise notice until it's too
late
together we can take steps to change our
food system for the better and make it
more sustainable for generations to come
we're really excited to share eaten with
you Reggie Oh lets you take control of
your water you can easily adjust your
sprinklers at any time Braccio water is

some tools never change a hammer is a
hammer a hairbrush is a hairbrush and
for nearly 150 years a nail clipper has
always been just a nail clipper current
nail clippers require odd uncomfortable
movements of your wrist and can easily
rotate or shift unexpectedly which is an
issue when you're holding a sharp object
it also requires you to be able to have
a strong squeeze between your thumb and
your pointer finger which may not seem
like a big deal but degeneration at the
base of the thumb is very common among
people over the age of 50 causing them
to struggle with this pinching move and
when you lose strengthen that motion
cutting nails is one of the first tasks
effectively as orthopedic surgeons
ourselves we've become used to precise
surgical instruments built for ease of
use and accuracy we thought why can't we
bring this type of quality ease and
precision we find in the operating room
to consumers in their own homes that's
why we invented clipper pro its unique
swivel function allows you to position
your hand wrist arm and shoulder in the
most comfortable position for you the
double action mechanism makes cutting
your nails much easy requiring very
little strength to operate and our
surgical grade stainless steel blades
cut cleanly precisely and effortless
we've spent the last 10 years working
diligently to take an outdated
frustrating hygiene tool and bring it
into the modern era by combining decades
of experience as orthopedic surgeons
with innovative engineering
state-of-the-art manufacturing and
cutting-edge design we have created a
revolutionary tool clipper Pro is so
precise it could be used in the
operating room and it is now available
for use in the comfort of your own home
we are passionate about clipper pro and
we are confident you will love it too
all of our tooling has been made tested
and personally inspected by us we are
ready to go into production back us
today and help bring clipper Pro to life
