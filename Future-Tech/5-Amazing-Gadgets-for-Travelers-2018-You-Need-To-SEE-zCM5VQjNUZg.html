I want a hoodie that enhances my life
something that's ready to go wherever I
go and do whatever I do so I created the
adventure hoodie which is ready for any
adventure that life throws at you
whether you're in the middle of the
forest or in the urban jungle and
everything this hoodie can do you'll
wonder how you live it without it
introducing the adventure hoodie which
is being praised for style innovations
and comfort Conde Nast Traveler says the
adventure hoodie is the only travel
clothing you need USA Today describes it
as smart looking casual wear Lonely
Planet declares it the perfect accessory
for busy travellers and men's gear calls
it stylish and exceedingly comfortable
with 9 secured pockets there are enough
places to put everything you need for
anything life throws at you whether
you're going across town or on a camping
trip or on a trip around the world
you'll always have places for the things
you want to bring with you each pocket
and the adventure hoodie has a zipper or
button to keep your items where they
belong and you want to rest the
adventure hoodie folds up conveniently
into a pillow with snaps to secure it in
place and then it folds just as easily
with your stuff in the zipper or button
pockets it makes getting through the
airport a snap you can tune out the
world with easy access to your music and
the oversized hood is lined with extra
soft fabric designed to pull over your
eyes with built in gloves that unfold
out of the cuffs you can stay warm and
cozy with a mini Pen pocket you'll
always have something to write with and
so will everyone around you
the lined hood converts to the softest
pillow on the planet there are underarm
vents but if things get too warm pull up
the ventilation zipper so you can cool
off without having to take off your
hoodie when you get to where you're
going
The Adventure hoody has built in
innovations that you'll wonder how you
lived without like our original neoprene
koozie pocket which holds your beverage
and keeps it cold and a bottle opener
zipper
when day turns to night or the weather
takes a turn there's a sunglass holder
and for safety there are reflective
elements in the front and on the back
and when things get cold and wet
there's the all-weather version of the
adventure hoodie and has all the
features of the adventure hoodie but is
made with durable water-resistant fabric
and it's insulated with extremely soft
Sherpa fabric in the body and quilted
fabric in the arms we've paid particular
attention to quality and sizing to make
sure this hoodie fits you the best it
can and it has premium fabrics and
stitching to make it last the price of
the hoodie on Kickstarter includes
shipping which is around 18 dollars in
the US but for Kickstarter backers it's
free life is an adventure
