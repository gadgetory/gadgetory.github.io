any surface to trigger notes or samples
we've been working on wave for the past
three years now in close collaboration
with musicians and were almost there we
found a great manufacturing partner and
we're putting the finishing touches on
this the final version of wave which
includes all the juicy hardware that
we've tested with hundreds of people and
that's been used live on stage but it
also features a sleek look and gives you
even more control so with your help and
support we can mass-produce wave and get
it into the hands of people making music
all over the world before the end of the
year so please help us make wave a
reality

from rockets that can explore the depths
of space to driverless smart cars while
some forms of transport have evolved

humble bicycle we've seen modern day

want the app displays five different
