wireless Bluetooth 4.0 MIDI interface
for musicians who make music with an
iPhone iPad or Mac yes bluetooth means
Wireless and thanks to Apple's Bluetooth
MIDI connectivity in iOS 8 and OS 10
Yosemite it's fast and stable and
enables multiple simultaneous
connections the puck plus supports both
the USB or five pin MIDI connections
enabling any MIDI controller to
wirelessly connect to apps on your
iPhone or iPad and da double use on your
Mac in an easy-to-use device chances are
you have more than one MIDI controller
so give each a puck plus and
simultaneously connect them all to your
iPhone or iPad or Mac if you haven't
already noticed iPads and iPhones aren't
exactly the easiest to connect cables to
and newer Macs have fewer physical ports
to hook up your gear the plug plus
connects to your controller and sends
MIDI to your app or workstation just
like you used to send MIDI over a five
pin cable or USB not only that but the
plug plus can also power most low
drawing USB controllers
to pity is a major technology leap for
musicians and the puck plus takes those
advantages and makes it easy for players
to use the Apple tech that they love
and once you experience how simple and
reliable the PUF plus is Wireless
performances you wonder why you had to
put up with wires for so long the puck
plus it's wireless MIDI made easy
what the flip is sugru hey this is sugru
feels like play-doh super easy to use
and overnight it turns into rubber
suger is 3-dimensional and fills weird
gaps so you can stick anything to
anything oh oh so it's easy to fix
broken plastics like toys and cracks in
the fridge Pat rusty metal in your
dishwasher I can replace missing parts
it's not just about fixing if it's not
broken you can improve it make handy
hooks with almost anything or rubber
feet to protect things or make things
more comfortable super is super durable
so it's perfect for use indoors and out
these ideas come from people all over
the world that are using suru to make
their stuff lasts longer and work better
for them join us on super calm dive in
and get exercises so he's not
responsible for your imagination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
