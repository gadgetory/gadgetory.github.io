hi I'm Daniel at scowl ski let me
introduce you a skunk lock we all know
that gut-wrenching feeling of coming
back and your bike's gone that won't
happen
with a skunk lock skunk lock is a
bicycle lock that was designed with a
built-in deterrent it can actually stop
a thief from stealing your bike lock
manufacturers won't tell you the fact
that any you lock can be compromised
with the right tools the truth is any
lock can be cut in a minute or less and
that's why 1.5 million bikes are stolen
each year let's not worry about
electronics which can fail or a crook
with an angle grinder let's pressurize a
unique chemical compound into the lock
but first if the lock is compromised
skunk lock is manufactured with the
highest quality materials we can find
with expensively tested our prototypes
for your safety and convenience it
doesn't look like any other you lock on
the market and unlike any other you lock
a thief will get a noxious surprise if
they tried to steal your bike when it
comes to the challenge of delivering a
skunk lock to your door we're ahead of
the crowdfunding curve we have
manufacturing in place and they're ready
to build upon receiving our first order
and skunk lock comes with easy key
replacement how would it feel if you
never have to worry about your bike
being stolen again join the revolution
and grab a stone clock it could be the
last lock you ever buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
