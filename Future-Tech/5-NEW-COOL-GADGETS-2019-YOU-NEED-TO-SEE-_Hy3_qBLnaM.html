your childhood memories what if you
could capture every detail of your
creations

you've ever read
introducing the Caesar are a scanner
we wanted to create a scanner that was
fast
a scanner that was able to create the
most optimal digitization intuitively
and a scanner that lets you scan
anything but most of all we wanted to
create a scanner that fits seamlessly
into your work and life
you
a scanner so smart and intuitive that it
enables you to retain your knowledge
memories and creations in precise and
beautiful detail
really cool like it really pulls your
body now oh that feels amazing
that's like the worst spot is on your
back initially it's up in the emergency
room three times even a dress this does
annoy see it's good I didn't even hear
yeah that does work yeah
that's really good that's like this spot
to a creative flow to have a positive
impact on other people's lives whether
you're dealing with multiple sclerosis
menopause or any activity that eats you
up outside I will blow up fooled you off
by combining airflow with aromatherapy
blow allows essential oil users to bring
the health benefits of their diffuser on
the go use it to cool off during a
variety of activities such as running
hiking biking working out and anything
else hi I'm Paul and these are the sound

Kevin here has an 8 or slept in two days

charge just one sound Flo it's kind of a
no-brainer
hi I'm Connor and this is solla sollew
is the first open-source fight o2
security key using solo you can log on
the web sites like Google Facebook
Twitter and others passwords and
temporary codes can be fished but not
solo
using solo is as easy as pressing a
button more on that later we'll be
offering two versions of solo one as USB
and the other has NFC so you can use it
by tapping it against your phone and of
course you can pick between getting a
USB A or a USB C plug and will provide
professionally molded silicone cases you
can pick your favorite color you
probably hear a lot about websites and
accounts getting hacked online how
security keys like Google so you type in
can you solve this solo is like any of
these keys and will protect your
accounts so a little is special to us
because it's open source we wanted to
make a key that's not only secure but
trustworthy anyone can verify it the
code running out solo is the same as the
code we post online and anyone can set
up solo on a website by going to your
account settings add a new security key
and pressing the button now whenever you
log into that site you'll have to use
your security key so if your password
gets compromised you'll still be safe
solo will work with major browsers
operating systems and devices for
hackers and makers will provide solo
unlocked so you can reprogram it and
customize it using no extra hardware
so we have solar prototype and we're
ready to put in production but we need
your help please back our Kickstarter
and we'll make secure trust of old
products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
