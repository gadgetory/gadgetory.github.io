what if you could measure anything just
by walking this is Moser one it can
measure as far as a 1,000 foot tape
measure measure through walls and
obstacles as if they weren't there
measure winding cable lines or tracks
measure angles and curves calculate the
area of a room volume for storage or a
shipping package get the right game
Klein for your decade or stairwell
photos find the right horizontal level
and distance for your poster frames
measure circular objects cylinders even
irregular shapes all with one hand just
need to move it from one point to the
other pin you're done other measuring
tools fail when there's too much light
the wrong surface or if the space
prevents them because it doesn't use
lasers or again
Moser one isn't restricted by light or
space use it anywhere anytime no matter
the circumstance Moser one is waterproof
dustproof and shockproof your recordings
are immediately saved in the app which
is already being sold in the App Store
the app also turns your phone into a
rudimentary Moser device and already has
70,000 downloads and a solid four star
rating from users so how does it work
Moser one uses an advanced technology
called motion
motion measuring is the same technology
used in rocket guidance systems to
accurately track the movement and
locations of rockets in 3d space using
gyros accelerometers and magnetometers
Moser one plot is three-dimensional
position in any space to measure
distance angle level and much more Moser
is the first motion measure device ever
made for consumer use it puts the same
technology found in rockets in the palm
of your hand
so what are you waiting for back our
campaign now step into the future of
measuring with Moser 1 introducing the
first action camera built for day and
night usage this is the Aurora
all right what is a photo
