what if you could measure anything just
by walking this is Moser one it can
measure as far as a 1,000 foot tape
measure measure through walls and
obstacles as if they weren't there
measure winding cable lines or tracks
measure angles and curves calculate the
area of a room volume for storage or a
shipping package get the right game
Klein for your decade or stairwell
photos find the right horizontal level
and distance for your poster frames
measure circular objects cylinders even
irregular shapes all with one hand just
need to move it from one point to the
other pin you're done other measuring
tools fail when there's too much light
the wrong surface or if the space
prevents them because it doesn't use
lasers or again
Moser one isn't restricted by light or
space use it anywhere anytime no matter
the circumstance Moser one is waterproof
dustproof and shockproof your recordings
are immediately saved in the app which
is already being sold in the App Store
the app also turns your phone into a
rudimentary Moser device and already has
70,000 downloads and a solid four star
rating from users so how does it work
Moser one uses an advanced technology
called motion
motion measuring is the same technology
used in rocket guidance systems to
accurately track the movement and
locations of rockets in 3d space using
gyros accelerometers and magnetometers
Moser one plot is three-dimensional
position in any space to measure
distance angle level and much more Moser
is the first motion measure device ever
made for consumer use it puts the same
technology found in rockets in the palm
of your hand
so what are you waiting for back our
campaign now step into the future of
measuring with Moser 1 introducing the
first action camera built for day and
night usage this is the Aurora
all right what is a photo
that cool have you ever desired
superhuman powers Aurora delivers with
this full-featured ip67 action camera
with an integrated HD o LED a personal
night-vision psyonix patented ultra low
light sensor technology she's twenty
times relative performance enabling you
to capture stunning video from noonday
Sun to starlit nights it's a day and
night difference capture your
experiences in every sense of the action
with Aurora's still high speed burst
slow-mo time-lapse are full HD video
settings with stereo audio the Aurora is
great for daytime usage but if you find
yourself in the dark we have you covered
with three available modes day Twilight
and night it will make the best use of
any available light not only is it
compact and lightweight it fits
perfectly in one hand for smooth
operation out of the box ready to hunt
ready to go this right here will do that
faster than anything else
the Aurora is able to withstand water up
to three feet deep for thirty minutes
even if your goal is getting lost it's
good to know where you are the Aurora's
built-in positioning tools offer an
optional overlay function to keep you on
the beaten path or help you make your
own with Wi-Fi capability and an app for
iOS or Android you're able to share your
adventures on social media so no one
misses out this is the Aurora
you
we are input club a group of enthusiasts
brought together by the internet with
the desire to create the best keyboards
in the world we've already brought you
the white fox a revolutionary
open-source keyboard that set the bar
for quality mechanical keyboards now
we're proud to introduce our latest
creation Kirra
a compact full-size keyboard built
without compromise
designed by Angelo Tobias not online as
thesis camper Kirra has the ideal layout
for designers and creatives Kira is our
first keyboard based on the 96 key
layout which includes a full number pad
function row and media keys in addition
to being our most dynamic keyboard care
we'll also be completely open sourced
and every key is a fully customizable
macro our keyboard configurator allows
you to program your device without
having to permanently run local software
kara has hot swappable mechanical
switches so if you want to change out
how your keyboard feels you can simply
pull them out without soldering the most
distinctive feature though is the fully
programmable RGB lighting both above and
below the keyboard
so if you're looking to design create
game or just really enjoy writing emails
Kira is the ultimate keyword optimal
performance beautiful aesthetics no
compromises
