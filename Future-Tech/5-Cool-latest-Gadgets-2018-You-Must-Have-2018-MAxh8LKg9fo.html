ice bucket challenge I feel much better
look at that guy seems popular right
this is Mike he's a painter
this is Jessica she's really into music
this is David he loves playing games
this is Cody rocky
they're friendly coding companion Cody
is a standalone remote controller with
more than 10 advanced electronic modules
each module can be accessed by writing
your own program Rocky's the car that
lets you take Cody anywhere you want
every child is a born creator given the
right tools they can explore their
capabilities and find their place in the
world as innovators engineers scientists
and many other things
Cody Rocky's easy to use graphical
programming language lets children
explore their creativity in code by
dragging and dropping blocks
he built a remote controller for his
games
he created a moisture sensing and plant
watering device she programmed her
remote-controlled car to avoid obstacles
all on its own
Cody rocky is all you need to make your
ideas real through code
control your TV with cody rocky make new
use of your old Lego blocks with cody
rocky and even create music with cody
rocky and your own code
Cody Rocky is a coding companion that
helps children realize their ideas and
by doing so learned valuable coding
skills this unassuming ordinary looking
microbe is a dinoflagellate or Dino for
short as a group dinos are incredibly
diverse and can be found in oceans and
lakes all over the world although their
existence may seem trivial from our
macroscopic world view these fascinating
tiny creatures offer us a beautiful
example of what makes life itself so
exceptional inspired by the ability of
these dinos to bioluminesce or generate
light from life itself we set out to
create a product that would enable
people not only to witness this
beautiful phenomenon but interact with
it from the comfort of their home or
classroom after countless hours of
sketching prototyping and testing we're
so excited to finally introduce bio
glove
letting it bubble creates a calming
effect to relax you into sleep or swirl
the bio glow for a sensation of glowing
vortex this Kickstarter will enable us
to purchase the tools and molds
necessary to bring bio glow to life
thank you so much for your support
