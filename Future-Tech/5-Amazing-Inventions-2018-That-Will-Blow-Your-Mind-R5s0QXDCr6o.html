there are two main things that make
fiddlestick different and in my opinion
better than all the other frigate toys
one and the most important being the
loop-the-loop opens up possibilities
that no other frigate toy has where you
can actually turn this into a
skill-based toy or just flick it around
like you would your keys
I love flicking my keys around when I
create in my office when I'm coming up
with ideas or I'm sitting down for a
creative jam session I found the number
one thing I would do is twist my keys
around my finger there was something
therapeutic almost hypnotic about it my
name is Adam Wilbur I'm an inventor and
a creator but I'm also a magician I use
my hands is my livelihood it's how I
feed my children so I really do have
something in my hands about 23 hours out
of every day and and that really pushed
me to realize I'm a fidgeter I think in
reality most people off
the fiddlestick is very much a fidget
toy it has all the fun buttons and dials
and tactile fixation tools that you
would want out of your fidget toy but it
does have a few added bonuses which
really takes it to another level right
up top the joystick in a perfect
organized position got a tactile surface
that just feels great on the thumb light
switch for clicky buttons pinball wheel
and two gears on the right side the
worry stone and last but not least is
your slider which is set to the perfect
tension the other differentiator of the
fiddlestick is that it is a bit
modulated and what I mean by that is
that you can take it as a very slim
minimalistic I'm going out and about and
I want to keep kind of a low-key fidget
or you can say look I'm gonna party I
want to be the center of attention and
you add on our led attachment when you
get a little bit of work into this you
go to a party it's light or it's dark
outside and you start fiddling you will
be the center of attention whether you
like it or not
with one successful Kickstarter already
under our belt we know we can make this
happen for the holidays the only thing
missing is you we would love to bring
the Kickstarter community into the final
stages of manufacturing let's have some
fun learn some moves give a gift or two
and join the fidgets revolution choose a
tier below and let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
