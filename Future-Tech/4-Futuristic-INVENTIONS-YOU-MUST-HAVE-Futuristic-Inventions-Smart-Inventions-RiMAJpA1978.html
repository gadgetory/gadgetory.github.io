GoPro videos are always shaky and
stabilizers out there are too complex
heavy and too big to be mounted anywhere
at new on matter we wanted to create a
solution that was so convenient that it
would become part of your camera
so we developed Park the world's
smallest waterproof stabilizer for your
GoPro that stabilizes your camera to
keep it leveled and create amazing
cinematic shots no matter what Clarke is
so small that you don't need to remove
your camera anymore it becomes an
extension of it allowing you to mount it
on the camera mounts you already have
just turn it on with your camera and you
are ready to go
