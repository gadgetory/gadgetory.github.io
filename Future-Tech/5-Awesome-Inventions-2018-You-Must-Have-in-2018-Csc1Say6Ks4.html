our first ray being heated down puffy
was great for keeping us warm in
everyday use well we kept hearing from
our customers that they wanted something
tougher more rugged so we went back to
the drawing board and created the
Arabian rugged jacket it's as rugged and
tough as you are maybe even a little
tougher introducing Arabian rugged
heated jacket we designed it with multi
zone on-demand heat when and where you
need it using our easy access multi zone
controller you can send the heat to your
core or thumb hole cuffs independently
or both at the same time with three heat
settings per zone you're in control with
the world's first patented heated thumb
hole cuffs we designed it to keep your
hands warm while keeping your digits

thin enough to work with most gloves to

batteries from Milwaukee to Walt Bosch
jookiba and most 12-volt power tool
batteries it's also water resistant to
survive the elements with an inner soft
breathable liner it's tough enough to
survive the jobsite but comfortable
enough to swaddle a newborn baby we
didn't skimp on the zippers either with
the industry standard beefy YKK zippers
there's also two waist cinches to keep
out the cold drafts when reaching for
that tool you need there are five
pockets a large stuffed pocket and
smaller security pocket on the inside
and large chest pocket and two hand
pockets on the outside we've also given
you two battery pocket locations that
allow you to connect to any 12-volt
power tool batteries or you can use
Arabian battery each battery depending
on capacity can power our jackets for up
to eight hours in a single charge or
with our Rabia battery you can charge
your mobile devices up to four times we
made our outer shell with thick stretchy
soft shell from the new vervain
