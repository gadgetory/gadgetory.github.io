healthier lifestyle today hi my name is
Fabio I have a project that I love and I
want to share it with you followed me in
2010
I found is for Ltd company that designed
and manufacturers and the water rob
cycle with my team we designed the kill
Club the first underwater drone for the
care of your health we started working
from similar products that were
available on the market on the water rod
for aquarium tanks after three years of
research and development we present kill
Club we don't sold the first vessel but
Ollie rented two professional client in
order to receive a qualitative feedback
sales start to two years ago with
and say one motors we manufacture or
assemble everything in the house only
after passion all the undersea rigorous
test the drone is ready to be shipped
thanks to 3d printing we give full shape
to our project what we think we can
design a mold by O'Fallon is the proof
of how lie of the CES unicellular and
multicellular organisms take root on
every underwater surface and grow
unfortunately on the house of boats
cause loss of speed and increase the
consumption just 5 millimeters of
vegetation can cause an increase of 20%
of hala consumption nowadays many
remedies are offered on the market most
uses toxic Spain in order to slow down
the proliferation process cleaning and
painting is a very expensive process
every years millions of boat owners
spend money and time to clean and paint
the house of their votes
king crab is revolutionary it solved the
problem by acting on the effect and not
on the coast you can use it where you
want when you want without moving the
boat kill crab is already reality is
another dream the greater the order the
louder will be the signal of change or
market thanks to crowdfunding we could
move from a manual production into and
industrialize the production the
increase in markup allows us to invest
many resources in research and
development in order to enhance our
products in terms of quality cleaning
capacity and automation the team is
really motivated we will never stop
until every boat will be clean like our
drone your crap the first underwater
drone with iPad and draw the control for
cleaning and inspection of your house
fast essential safe green and
user-friendly support has with your
pre-order and help us to make this
possible my inspiration has been to
combine the best of our Swiss heritage
in traditional watch making with the key
features of a smart watch to persuade
the majority of consumers adopting our
wearable technology we wanted to create
a world without compromises a one that
is desirable and will be accepted and
word by majority of consumers Z time
will provide a 30 days battery on a
single charge and a water resistant up
to 30 meters when we first started
working on the G time project we knew
from day one that the most critical
challenge for us would be to offer users
the opportunity to keep track of the
daily time without necessarily having to
turn on the display and therefore have
some battery life issues this has been
accomplished with the time the perfect
hybrid SmartWatch it combined the best
of both worlds stainless steel watch
case and mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full-color
touchscreen that instantly shows
incoming calls smart phone notification
real-time fitness activity accounting
calendar events daily reminders
much more right from your wrist the best
way to deliver make any cold hands
experience with a SmartWatch was
actually to use real ones but how and
how to make the background of a
traditional watch becoming smart while
drinking a hole into a TFT display was
the only solution we spent countless
hours with our engineering team an
industrial partner finding the right
solution to create a brand-new
touchscreen that could accept a pass
through mechanical health solution and
we finally did it over hundreds of
prototypes and design proposal by
combining a revolutionary TFT color
display together with the ultra precise
touch panel and a high-grade quality
glass we succeed to deliver the best of
both worlds an amazing SmartWatch that
can offer both doctrine experience
together with the traditional timepiece
but we didn't stop here with our how
noise we can tweak the lowest level
features to improve power consumption in
addition Josiah's comes with lot of
Princeton applications and a white
Surrey looked nice which faces while
using a traditional quartz movement when
we live into a brand new smart world we
were conjunct Lee with several partners
to create what we call the smart
movement built around two micro motors
this movement is capable of not only
providing accurate time but it can more
importantly be controlled by the watch
CPU to automatically adjust time
depending on times on where you are and
also move the ends where we need them to
be on a particular screen as a result
know if you're having hands covering the
text on your emails or messages we can
position them the way we want to deliver
the best reading experience and they
will go back to their original position
of the matte
having Orhan OS holdovers to customize
our UX and delivers a highest level of
compatibility for iOS and Android users
the time is also embedding some of the
most advanced technologies like a three
led heart rate monitoring solution
delivering precise and accurate measures
of your cardiac frequency throughout the
day or at a particular point in time
when you need it we also decided to
replace the traditional crown is a very
advanced smart crown helping user to
enhance their navigation experience
inside of Polish and nicely design user
interface so experience will be improved
and enhanced week after week with
regular of those year update offering
new watch faces new applications and
post on new features the time is with no
doubts an amazing timepiece that will
for sure reset the future of the
SmartWatch industry when I started in
early 2013 people throw that a West man
why would I start a SmartWatch company
in Switzerland in such a challenging
market it turns out that my vision and
passion have paid off as our company has
sold nearly two million smartwatches
since then we have established strong
foundations in Europe and now we are
willing to expand worldwide today we
want consumer to embrace our amazing
journey with the time and be the first
ones to get their hands on this
groundbreaking innovation as we are
heading soon to mass production
cooking meat is a lot like a water
balloon fine if you don't pay attention
be prepared to pay the consequences this
is Derrick he loves to cook but let's
face it he's never going to be the Next
Iron Chef
wave goodbye to those days because you
finally have the meter a sleek wireless
meat thermometer that keeps you up to
date on your meats cooking status by
sending you notifications on your
smartphone here's how it works
turn it on by taking it out of the
charger open the app on your smartphone
and choose the type of meat the cut and
your target cooking result stick the
meter into the meat push start on the
amp and begin the cooking process now
you can enjoy your time away from the
oven or grill because the meter is
monitoring everything for you it's too
often that we're reminded of something
cooking by that all-too-familiar
smell that prompts us to question is
something burning and you know by that
time it's already too late but with the
meter you get a notification on your
phone as soon as your meat has reached
the correct internal temperature for
your desired cook if you are busy the
meter can send notifications to your
friends it'll make sure there is always
someone that can tend to your meats
needs it even has a built-in ambient
temperature sensor so you know how hot
it is around your meat did your smoker
drop below 215 degrees Fahrenheit the
meter will notify you now you can add
more fuel to the flame the meter is your
meat bodyguard it watches your meat and
its surroundings to make sure it's safe
from under and over cooking using the
patent-pending dual sensor system the
meter can estimate when your food will
be ready allowing you to manage your
time and do the more important things
unlike other meat thermometers the meter
is the only connector thermometer that
has all of its electronics built inside
the probe eliminating the need for wired
external devices its innovative design
allows the meters electronics to survive
extreme heat and
completely wireless with a range of up
to 10 meters no more tangled messes are
having to constantly open up the oven or
grill to poke and prod your meat with a
quick read thermometer now that just
sounds painful with the meter once your
food is in the oven there is no need to
check it until it's ready the meters
probe has no buttons LEDs or openings
allowing it to be waterproof you can
easily and thoroughly clean it without
the fear breaking if you need the extra
range you can use the meter block it
will give you unlimited wireless range
capability in charge of the four meters
at once for nearly a year the technology
and prototype have been proven through
careful development extensive testing
