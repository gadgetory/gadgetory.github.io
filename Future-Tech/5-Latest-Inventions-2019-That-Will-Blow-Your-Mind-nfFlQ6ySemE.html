special toothpaste mousse around the
bristles pop into your mouth and bite
down slightly and it will automatically
start brushing your teeth or 30 seconds
Chiz uses sonic technology to clean your
teeth situated in the middle of the
toothbrush the sonic motor generates
25,000 slight strokes per minute that go
evenly to every bristle that covers your
teeth sonic vibration action creates the
foaming bubble to shake off plaque in
the cracks between each teeth and gum
line the soft bristles are directed in a
45 degree angle against your gingival
come as base method suggests chews helps
you brush your teeth automatically and
correctly so you don't have to worry
about inappropriate brushing angle and
strength and gum disease caused by them

job in just 30 seconds with their
contributions we can put a smile in
every face your teeth will thank you for
it spread the word about cheese you will
be the first to get one when it comes
out thanks for your support the modern
world is dealing with a very new and
universal problem our kids are hooked on
smartphones and tablets and when parents
try to manage screen time it can cause
major conflict in the home how can we
encourage our kids to disconnect from
their devices and connect more with
their family their friends and the real
world
the answer is Tecton we have created the
first ever product that combines an app
the parents use to manage screen time
with a physical home for our kids
devices that also serves as a secure
charging station it's a home to
healthier screen habits and we call it
the den within the app parents can set
up schedules for their kids screen time
when the time's up
the child puts their phone or tablet
back in the den where it is charged
stored and locked away by setting up
predictable schedules on the app kids
can anticipate when they next allowed on
their devices and for how long well
before they have to return the device to
the den the child will get regular
notifications on their device of how
much time they have left when the device
informs the kids that their time is up
that parent-child conflict is reduced
dramatically when a device is out of
sight is out of mind when a phone or
tablet is put away inside the den it can
no longer serve as a visual cue that can
trigger the desire to use it together
parents and children can set goals and
rewards for on-time returns it's another
way that the child feels a part of the
process and at the same time develops
habits for healthy device use only by
combining an app and a physical home for
devices can we as parents feel that we
have a complete solution the managing
devices in our home
we are so excited about the den and we
cannot wait for you to have one in your
own home back us today on Kickstarter as
we work on final refinements and user
testing over the next few weeks you can
