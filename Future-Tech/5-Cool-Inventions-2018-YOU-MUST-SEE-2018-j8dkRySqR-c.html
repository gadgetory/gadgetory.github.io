never miss another day
I've always been a gypsy I've always
loved the idea of traveling light when I
first experienced the teardrop Kayla I
didn't really know what to expect and I
didn't think that I'd fall in love by
all means I never expected to be so
comfortable I feel like I'm cheating
when I'm travelling in one of these
teardrop trailers because it's so
comfortable and warm there's electricity
is heating there's a sound system I have
a burst sound system an all-inclusive
kitchen with everything that I need and
it's really fascinating to watch
people's reaction to the Teatro Taylor
because I think everyone really wants
the idea of comfort like simple comfort
like this I think the appeal of such
simple adventure you don't have to think
about anything nothing's over
complicated the one word I would
probably use to describe myself is
freedom
I do everything around the idea of
freedom because I don't like being stuck
anywhere and I want to see what the
unknown has on offer but at the same
time I love luxury because I'm 28 and I
don't want to be setting up tents I
don't want to be cold but I hate hotels
because they're so restrictive you got
to carry your luggage back in for if
you're gonna check in they're expensive
if you want to change your mind last
minute about what you want to go you
can't two reasons why I don't like
spending too much fuel when I'm out
there exploring is I don't want to
really leave a big carbon footprint you
know I'm exploring the world because I'm
so fascinated by it I don't want to just
spend all this fuel and feel like I'm
killing but at the same time and also
money I don't want to spend all this
money when I'm going into venturing
because that suppose the experience mink
doesn't take that much fuel it almost
feels like there's nothing extra that
we're spending on the field who would I
recommend the mink to anyone that loves
adventuring but in a simple style the me
gives you the necessities food and
shelter and then you have to find the
rest outside
yourself so like the outdoors is the
extension of your living space which I
really love
just to have a home on the road no
limits as to where you want to go no
time restraints
large circular windows slippers pillows
Doudna times 2 music USB port summers
Northern Lights stargazing bunk bed for
a child or your luggage pal
shoe bucket blinds heating system
comfortable queen-size mattress mood
lighting on point
welcome to the kitchen gasps Bose sound
system salt and pepper yes Benna
chopping board turns into cooler with a
drain hole all right water container
cleaning good tea party good flips and
stuff
coffee maker whait aerodynamic shape
solar panels ventilation Wi-Fi GPS
tracking I think I'm done though sweet
perfect timing
my boy he just finished the dishes we
can finish up this video I hope you
enjoyed and yes I would recommend them
inc traveler to anyone that wants
adventure and fun and not be restrained
by hotels or camping and once a bit of
luxury in their lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
