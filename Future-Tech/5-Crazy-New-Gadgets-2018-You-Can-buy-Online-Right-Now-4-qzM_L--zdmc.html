wirelessly also called RFID is
everywhere nowadays
it offers contactless data transmission
with rfid enabled credit and debit cards
passport driving license store cards and
more providing amazing convenience and
time-saving for both consumers and
businesses alike but there is also a big
problem with RFID technology your data
can be stolen contactless too right from
your wallet so how is this possible
fraudsters and thieves can easily
acquire equipment that can access the
data stored on your cards from up to
several meters away so they can clone
your credit card take money from your
bank or use your identity for a host of
criminal activities and it's getting
worse in 2014 alone 31 million US
consumers had their credit cards hacked
over three times the number affected in
2013 so there has not been an RFID
security system that can truly keep your
card data safe until now hi my name is
Thomas and I would like to present you
the most advanced data protection for
your contactless credit cards and rfid
enabled documents both card combining
cutting-edge technology with massive R&amp;amp;D
and developed on the same principles as
military jamming systems vault card is
the most advanced rfid protection
solution ever designed it virtually
ensures absolute safety of your cards
other products have tried to protect
your cards by covering them in metal
foil unfortunately it doesn't work with
high-powered scanning devices and so how
does this work our more
adjust over one millimeter thick you
simply place a single world card in the
middle of your wall like so now all your
RFID enabled cards are protected within
one and a half inches on either side
your wallet can be up to three inches
thick
which as you can see is more than
adequate vault card switch is on
automatically when it senses the
electromagnetic signal emitted by
hackers RFID scanner the stronger the
signal from the thief scanner the
stronger jamming pod card will generate
so your RFID enabled cards will remain
protected even against the most powerful
scanning devices and RFID skimming
systems when you use your cards as usual
just make sure to hold them at least
eight inches away from vult card
what's more volt cart harnesses energy
extremely efficiently and doesn't
require a battery for its operation well
it doesn't mean that wall cart actually
lasts and protects forever that's right
right now we are ready to take volt cart
into mass production back our project on
Kickstarter join our community so
everyone can enjoy a future of unmatched
air of ID security with a full cart in
your wallet

keep your precious in your pocket at all
at slant we're right into the last em
kit that gets kids excited about
technology robotics is great for them
when we originally release the little
arm we immediately started getting
feedback about what we've done
people who were using it in the
classroom two things came in consistent
the first was durability our first arm
was not tough enough to take all of the
abuse that third graders would give to
it opening course Peter so we went back
to the drawing board and we made it
tough enough to take the uttermost the
other thing that came up was support
whenever it did you get some of these
some kind of stem kit they immediately
have to create a whole curriculum around
it from scratch we want to stop that
winter teachers get a hold of one of our
kids we want them to be able to go on
the website basically download
worksheets and information that lets
them teach the kids without having to
create a whole new class around this
thing that's where I were on Kickstarter
to fund the development of all that
content so please help us out check out
all the merch over on the side he builds
an awesome robots from it but if you're
not interested in an app at least share
this video it helps create a stem kit
that is really helpful and exciting for
kids to work
