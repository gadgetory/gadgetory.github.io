it all started with a very simple idea
of creating a range of eco-friendly
products which are both affordable and
extremely efficient I am very passionate
about protecting the environment so that
our future generations can enjoy nature
same way as I do with this very idea
sole inventions was born after nearly
two years of design and development we
are excited to launch a first product
the solar scroll the scroll is a
powerful and compact solar charger
featuring the most advanced flexible
solar panel it is both lightweight and
efficient the key objectives were to
design a portable solar charger which
look cool and work efficiently so that
you can bring it with you anywhere and
remain powered up on the pole that is
exactly what we've achieved with the
solar strobe
built from military-grade thin film
technology our solar panels are
extremely rugged waterproof and flexible
until now all solar charges within
similar range are relatively heavy bulky
expensive and nowhere nearly as
efficient and durable the scroll is
perfect for day to day use backed with
the 5200 mah battery and smart
electronics it is light enough to carry
with you anywhere yet powerful enough to
charge a variety of devices to use it
simply unroll the panel and let it soak
up the energy from the Sun the solar
scroll is designed for both urban users
and outdoor enthusiasts or anyone who
loves being off-grid but wishes to
remain powered up scroll is designed to
get the best charging efficiency at all
times in all weather conditions just
clip it on to your backpack and let it
charge while you're on the move the
scroll enables you to connect with
nature while your device's stay powered
