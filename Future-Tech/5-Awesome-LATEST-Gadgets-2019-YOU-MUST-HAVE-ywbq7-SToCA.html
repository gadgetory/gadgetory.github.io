my name is Jason Elam I'm a doctor I'm a
neuroscientist and I'm the finder of
Morris Morris as a healthcare technology
company that has been set up to try and
improve the lives of millions of people
across the world Laureus is a device
which gently stimulates a part of the
brain known to control fat storage and
metabolism and appetite and the idea
behind notice is that if you wear the
device for 60 minutes a day it actually
makes it easier for people to lose
weight so what we are trying to do is
really help people to improve their
lives and make that journey to losing
excess body fat easier I was attracted
to Matthias because it was something
completely different I have been using
motors for ten weeks I've lost seven
pints but the best thing for me is the
fact I've lost two inches from around my
waist and I've gone down a dress size
over the period of 11 weeks I've lost 23
points which which is brilliant it's
assumed that struggling with Weah is
actually because of her diet were not
enough exercise for people not trying
hard enough
we knew that this is actually an issue
in the ravine what attracted me to
moodiest
was the opportunity to try and lose a
little bit of width but I wanted that
width to be fat loss enough for me to
lose any muscle mass they find that it
really worked
managed to lose seven Pines in total
over a short period of time of only 25
days just kept my regular routine of
going to the gym eating as healthy as I
could but working in the media that's
very very difficult to do so I was
really pleased with the end result so
whenever you look at our initial results
in the lab we were actually able to see
a very significant reduction in body fat
as much as up to 16 percent the muddiest
life has been like making a lot of new
friends and the common part of one big
family its psychic community so we've
got yoga videos you've got fitness
videos you've got cooking videos and
it's all great because you're part of a

feeding back to us and we're starting to
see some really significant
handling results and that really fits
our vision which is to help people
