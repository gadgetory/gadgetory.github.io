that will revolutionize the way that
athletes coaches referees and parents
interact with a vital element of each
sport the ball and it will take the
guessing out of your game
introducing futur X the Tour X is
compact and simple to use open the cap
by twisting to reveal the protected
needle torx is design significantly
reduces the chance of damaging the
needle in manual mode the Torx measures
the ball pressure when the needle is
inserted simply increase or decrease the
balls pressure until you find your
perfect number
squeeze bounce or spike the ball to test
and determine that you are happy with
the pressure then you're ready to play
once you know your perfect pressure you
can switch to auto mode and achieve the
exact pressure every time with a push of
a button simply insert the Tour X and
hit the auto button once the Tour X
reaches the target pressure it will beep
three times and then you're off to play
the torx is powered by a robust lithium
ion battery that is rechargeable through
a simple micro USB connection at full
charge the battery is capable of topping
up 50 bulbs with torques is battery
capacity and auto mode coaches players
and referees can quickly and accurately
inflate or test multiple balls for
practising games
the Toric's is designed to be used in a
rough athletic environment and to live
in a backpack it is engineered for
performance and durability we spent a
lot of time developing the Tour X and
our team is excited to see it
manufactured and used around the world
you
introducing the only a bike small and
light enough to carry in a backpack the
SMAW circle s one small circle is more
than just an e-bike it's your new
everyday companion for better easier
transportation my name is Zhang Wei Wu
I'm the co-founder and chief marketing
officer as farcical technology so many
of us experience problems in our
commutes cabbages crowded public
transportation and distance Delta farm

possible solutions because of its carbon
fiber frame it weighs a mere 15 point 4
pounds as soon as you're ready to ride

brake will quickly and simply stop the
s-1 when your ride is done simply use
the small circle app to lock your s1

smash a go team has spent calculus days
on research and development we want to
design an e-bike not only can save
energy but also can save ty a space so
you can take with you wherever you can
whether you're commuting to work or
cruising through the park the S ones
adjustable seat and handlebars always
make for a comfortable ride the small
circle s1 the most portable and
lightweight e bike available to more
than 370 mm people can be saved from
drowning this year that's why it's our
mission at King G to provide water
safety hi I'm Tom I got be honest I came
up with the idea of Kinsey after I lost
a very good friend of mine three years
ago he drowned in the lake similar to
this one and it could have been
prevented when you drive a car you put
your seatbelt on when you ride a bike
you put on your helmet but how do you
protect yourself in water we set out to
make the smallest inflatable in the
world and we came up with a convenient
non-intrusive way to provide safety to
all of those in and around water this is
Kim G a portable flotation device that
comfortably secures onto your wrist it's
fast to deploy durable and contained
within a compact design kenji helps in
case of exhaustion or heavy currents or
when this for circulation or cramps
anytime you're on the water
even if you're just relaxing you'll want
a Kim G for you and a friend
we like Kenji because it's small does it
get your way when you're trying to
paddle out a lot of times when you're
surfing there's not a lifeguard anywhere
near so this gives you a little bit more
sense of security
Kinji can stay inflated for over 48
hours it includes a compass as well as a
whistle for signaling help in case of
emergency having knowledge and good
judgment first steps and water safety
but Kenji can be an important aid when
you're need it's easy and fast deploy
and its are even great out of recipes
Kinji is durable and the co2 cartridge
is replaceable so you can reuse Kenji as
many times as needed we need your help
to stop production and fight the dangers
of drowning with your support you become
an integral part of our team of
ambassadors and you'll be the first to
receive a Kingsman
do it for yourself do it for your
friends surf mates fishing bodies and
your family together we can
revolutionize water safety on a global
scale join the movement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
