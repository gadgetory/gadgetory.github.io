that's 50% of adults suffer with neck
pain each year I should know I see them
in my clinic every day hi my name is
West Marshall and I'm a physical
therapist and the developer and creator
of neck Savior I've seen incredible rise
in the number of people suffering with
neck pain and headaches over the last 20
years I've always done all I can to try
and help people and treat them the right
way also to empower them to help
themselves for centuries people have
loved the feeling of having their neck
stretched in clinic we do this by
pulling on the base of the skull and
it's a feeling that people love and I've
always wanted to be able to recommend a
product that does exactly that
however I wasn't happy with the products
that are on the market but claimed to
help they are either too difficult to
use uncomfortable or just plain
ridiculous so I decided to do something
about it I realized that foam could be
the solution brilliantly lightweight is
soft and comfortable and it can produce
considerable forces when it's bent out
of shape three years ago we launched
next savior original but only after four
years of painstaking developing trial in
the testing we created a super easy to
use effective product that stretches
your neck while you just lay down and
relax
next save original went on to win three
design excellence awards and is
recommended by therapists and planters
instructors all over the world
we always wanted to grow the next over
family

present next series little brother

headache relief without medication next
