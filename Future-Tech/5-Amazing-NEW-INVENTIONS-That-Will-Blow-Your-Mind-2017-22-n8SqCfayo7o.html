pap pap
do you fidget while you're thinking
waiting for something orb or how about
when you're nervous anxious or stressed
do you cap your foot to have your
fingers or just can't stop moving well
you aren't alone and you've likely heard
about the various widgets oice today
here's our solution
the orbiter by tech accessories is a new
kind of fidget device with two separate
pieces combined to form a unique bond
like a planet and its moon connected in
this case by a strong magnet with
high-grade materials exquisite finishing
and unmatched quality this toy is a
pleasure to fidget with be one of the
first to carry it around
we're here at maker space in Tucson
Arizona doing a first look of our
orbiter to people that haven't yet
played upon so here we go wow this is
cool hey I'm a fidgety person and this
is really kind of taking my mind off of
the fact that my hands are moving
constantly well I've been a really
fidgety person my whole life and with my
love of magnets and titanium I wanted to
combine that together to make a device
that you could carry with you and keep
you busy all the time and it wasn't just
a hand spinner it was something that you
could take apart and click and move
around and fiddle with in your hands it
was completely absorbing at the same
time and I think we've definitely teamed
up with orbiter so I was the first one
to actually put one together when we
have it we had all the materials and
parts and the first fitted itself right
there was great feeling
I myself have ADHD and
this has changed my life fidget toys
have been described by others to help
with ADHD symptoms stress and anxiety
therefore calming nerves and increasing
focus the orbiter new to our orbiter
line in general is the aluminium-bronze
addition here aluminium-bronze
is a corrosion resistant material a pale
gold finish that takes a beautiful
polish another new addition to our
orbiter line is the dlc coated titanium
orbiter this diamond-like carbon coating
is scratch resistant impact resistant
super low friction and guaranteed to
never scratch or scuff if you or someone
you know is a fidgeter we need your help
