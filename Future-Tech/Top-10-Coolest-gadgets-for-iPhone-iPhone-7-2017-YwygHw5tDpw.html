phones have evolved so much over the
past 15 years there's one problem you're
too big for our hands in fact in the US
alone a phone breaks every two seconds
costing us time money and sometimes even
our dignity that's why we created loopy
the first case with the loop to stop the
drop the first thing you'll notice about
being in the loop is how secure and in
control appeals loopy literally makes it
hard to drop your phone these phones are
so big and slippery they're impossible
to use one-handed they seem to put all
the most fuse buttons and the hardest
root spots but with loopy reason your
whole screen is a breeze even with the
iPhone 6 plus using your phone loopy is
truly a one-handed experience and who
isn't always carrying a million things
at once the multi grasp is a lifesaver
simply flip grab and go you don't
realize how nice having an extra hand is
until you're in the loop loopy is the
perfect running buddy all of your apps
and music conveniently in your hand
no more frustrating hard to reach arm
bands your phone has an awesome camera
and with loopy you can use it to its
full potential for steady pictures and
video even in crazy places you've never
imagined pulling out your phone before
in fact this entire Kickstarter video
was filmed using nothing but iPhones and
our loopies how cool is that we've gone
through countless prototypes to find the
perfect design and even secure the
patents after testing dozens of
materials we chose silicon loops for
their unique properties our loops are
strong they're durable they're super
secure ensuring that your phone goes
Noah and most importantly clip slave
flats fit into any pocket even the
tightest ones and they're perfect for
when you don't have pockets at all
they're super comfy so no more face
traps and loops even act as a kickstand
for sharing videos loops are easy to
install and adjustable to fit any finger
size plus they're interchangeable make a
loop be perfect for any a kid loopy is
the perfect balance of slim and
protective with wraparound bumpers to
ensure that your phone stays in mint
condition
and thanks to early customer reviews and
surveys no detail was overlooked
including oversized accessory ports easy
press buttons and durable materials are
designed to outlast your next phone
upgrade loopy won first prize at both
Purdue and Indiana University
entrepreneurship competitions and those
in the loop love their loopies even the
pros this is one of the highest rated
slim cases that we've reviewed out of
three dozen cases always really
refreshing to find a product that
actually makes the technology that we
have is supposed to make our lives
easier easier to use
you
that's the sound of your phone
connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there
frustrated at our cables for any number
of reasons
despite keep up steps becoming smaller
they haven't evolved to become any
easier to connect until now presenting
the future of USB cables ASAP Connect
featuring rare-earth neodymium magnets
with 18 carat gold plating ASAP Connect
will change the way you interact with
your USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charger
end
it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes on to the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark you no longer have
to worry about your devices getting
damaged
ASAP Connect even helps you retrieve
your phone from hard-to-reach places
we've designed two tips one for micro
USB devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional Apple
lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the Alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing a SAP Connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior materials to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA I believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototypes and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring ASAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today
you
hey Apple watch users have you ever
wanted a stylish charging case with a
built-in battery well we've created one
it's called Amber check it out
first insert entwine your Apple watch
charger around the spool then place it
back in amber next use the shell to
cover up the spool amber is ready to use
at night charge your Apple watch in
amber during the day put amber inside
your bag in case you need it
amber can be used any time in any place
to charge your Apple watch members

break in grabbing a coffee don't forget
to bring amber with you when you go

times using amber is safe amber won an
if' design award in 2016 and was
successfully funded on Kickstarter thank
you if you need to carry two phones on
the go for whatever reason peace is a
simplest solution this is how it works
take the SIM card out from your work
phone put in peace
connect peace to your private phone via
bluetooth and now you can get rid of
your work phones when your friends or
family call your private number
hey I'm in a shoe right now can I call
you back in a minute or your boss calls
you're working number it all happens in
one phone via the P stop so you can
control all the settings of both your
numbers separately manage your contacts
send text messages basically just work
your phone like you normally do
peace is so small it fits easily
anywhere you barely even know it's there
oh one last thing when your phone and
piece are over 15 meters apart peace
will ring to prevent you from losing
your only phone you can also use peace
to look for your phone just like you
wind your car in the parking lot that
way we make sure you have one and only
one phone on you at all times
likewise if peace is in your wallet you
can use the peace app to look for it so
it's nothing big just this piece right
here and it will certainly make your
life a little easy
