remote control for your air conditioner
well meet the touch AC all you need to
do is swipe this baby and the room is
automatically filled with cool
refreshing air let's look at this
imbecile doing the rain dance trying to
control the temperature bouncing like
that I'd probably sweat like a pig
anyway when I want to control the
temperature I use sensible it's based on
a simple idea really just make me feel
good hey Paul and Dan what's the
temperature in the room right now is it
hot or cold hot you see nobody cares
what the exact temperature is it's just
about being comfortable sensible is a
device that turns any remote controlled
AC into a connected super smart one so
smart fact if you choose full automatic
mode you'll never have to think about
your AC ever again sensible turns up the
heat before you wake up in the winter it
cools your house down before you come
home in the summer it's like your mom
and dad just out having to hear about
its back problems hi mom I'd like to
take a brief moment and explain how
sensible installed
oh look here's a team behind sensible
engineers designers visionaries they've
invested years of their lives in this
product not only to make your life more
comfortable but also because of a green
agenda not that the other green
yes sensible reduces the energy your AC
uses by an average of 40 percent making
it good for the planet and for your
electricity bill personally I don't care
about earth but if it doesn't bother me
I don't mind letting it exist its app is
so beautiful and intuitive you'll get
things done in less than two seconds and
spend the extra twenty seconds you just
saved on staring at it and admiration
and there's an app for pebble to live in
a rented apartment sensibo can be moved
from AC to AC here's half sensibo even
works with your 20 year old
remote-controlled AC because an old dog
can learn new tricks fish
I don't need your help but these guys do
if you back sensibo they can begin the
manufacturing process and improve your
quality of life significantly but more
importantly they'll be able to pay me
for being in this video thank you

hi I'm Raphael the founder of neo let's
talk about the things around us we have
so many different devices and each one
has their own remote or app you end up
with so many jumping from one remote to
another or when using an app finding
your phone unlocking it finding the
right app and waiting until the app is
ready it's cumbersome and inconvenient
it would be so much easier to control
everything from one place that's why we
have created neo neo is a smart system
that connects to all the devices in your
home and makes them available in one
easy-to-use app and for the ultimate
simplicity use the Neo remote it
recognizes you and lets you control
everything instantly so what are you
watching a movie setting mood lighting
relaxing with your favorite music or
lowering the window shades neo makes it
effortless and trust us setting all of
this up is insanely simple to make Neil
absolutely amazing we assembled a team
that expertise in home automation
software hardware and consumer product
design we truly inspired each other to
create something really special after
year of research and development we have
perfected the remote you'll be delighted
with the results new has just the
buttons which are absolutely needed so
you get that tactile feedback whether
cranking up the volume or flicking
through the channels new includes a
superb high density touchscreen display
surpassing even Apple's iPad vitina
standard we embedded a hand detection
technology engineer for which we have a
patent pending the technology knows you
and shows you your favorites instantly
the neo will even help you set and
manage parental controls near goes
months without needing to be charged and
if you can't find it use your phone to
activate the SOS so you know where it's
hiding the rise is like Apple TV nest
hue so knows Roku and over 10,000 other
major audio-visual devices are supported
right from the box our driver team and
some more devices every day so even if
you don't have the latest devices Neil
will just work we've been spending a lot
of time testing devices and electronic
stores and repair shops and that's why
it is insanely easy to set up now we are
currently producing the first news if
you order it now you will belong to the
first people to own one thank you
whatever happened to the days in Mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones sad crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew that before that was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and wear it
we needed to build a team of incredible
people with the wide range of skill sets
who are all unified to pursue our
mission and break the mold at the mobile
market the problem with the mobile
market right now is that the phones are
all the same and what little
differentiation they have is that some
are less user-friendly and some are less
durable things like this still happen so
we're here to change that with the
vibrant pallets clean typography and
easy to understand icon set the portal
UI is an experience it cannot be missed
why be stuck with the same old design
when you've got a new refreshing
interface to play with an interface that
hurts to interact that knows what you
want and works with you in the way that
you want it to work the portal not only
has all the features you would expect
such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC but also
has a waterproof kevlar infused
polyurethane body a six inch flexible
display wireless charging an unlocked
network and so much more
you
what is button we created the button
device for us humans to serve as a
physical touch point to the Internet it
is simple and intuitive everyone knows
how to use it just press it button tells
the end result of the press companies
distribute buttons to their clients or
point of sale to create a shortcut to
their services order a taxi food
maintenance services place reorders in
online stores or gather customer
feedback with buttons companies can turn
their products or services on demand by
offering super simple
one press orders or service calls some
said they wanted a smaller button
something that is more subtle it can
deliver the same magic so now we're
proud and happy to introduce a little
sister or brother to the button button
mini it's half the songs but it's packed
with the same magic button mini has
three different communications
alternatives to choose from mobile
theta6 box and Wi-Fi button mini has a
rechargeable battery lasting for a
thousand presses per charge the button
back end is the coolest thing of all it
lets you easily integrate buttons with
your existing infrastructure for example
have your service respond to the button
being pressed and then also deliver your
response back to the button for showing
green or red light to the end user
button actions are configured from the
cloud platform that comes in the same
package we're also introducing button
for commerce
api which is a secure easy and scalable
way to deploy buttons as part of any
purchase ordering or other commercial
backend what does that mean simple with
a press of a button you get your order
done paid and delivered it can't get any
easier than that press the button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
