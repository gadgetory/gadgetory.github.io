wait a minute maybe two teeth to how
each or single hair so we decide to make
something different we add an invisible
back button to iphone when you press the
button the action is transferred to the
top through our patented smart effect
technology so you just go there easily
which one is in go ahead and retail job
probability now you are free to message
on the way shop on life easier
even say you two days one year
try this also never anywhere with your
Erica
when appear back search go
enjoy your beer now
hello bakula is a new way to operate
iphone with your single hair now you can
use the SMAP button or switch to the
original operating any time it's all up
to you and this time we actually
opposites for you introducing the
world's first magnetic connector for
iphone 7 because apples combine the
audio jack and the power jack into one
connector on the iphone 7 we are now
able to give you a magnetic connector
that connects your data audio and fast
charging in a single click it's never
been working
magnetic connectors are vastly superior
to mechanical connections not only are
they way more convenient
they're all so far more resistant to
dust water and other contaminants all
this added reliability can greatly
improve your peace of mind our
engineering team has worked very hard to
make this connector as small as possible
we have also developed the two-in-one
connector that works with Android and
Apple device if you've already
successfully completed a pilot
manufacturing run of over 1,000 units we
have done extensive testing to ensure
their reliability over extending me if
you're interested please contact us now
through our early review
please support us and make this a
reality we cannot do it without you
the access port is a high-resolution
algo amplifier designed specifically for
and there are tons of technology back
Simon things and feeling musician for
the better part of life and I love the
access port every day music this the
access port provides 24 bit high
resolution audio imagine the old TVs
used to have yeah a big one now imagine
a TV in your house right now flat screen
the difference in the details and
clarity is what you will get from the
high resolution on and it's a brand new
experience we're developing the extra
sport without friends AAA Alex here is
Kevin hi cabinet haha aw measures of
this focus on your monitors I mean
working closely with the guys that punk
sounds for the last few years and we
started tell you about the excess
ah
hulia my company we use surprising
connection subscribe at it hard enough
and if it doesn't maintain all function
develop iOS app edit shuttlepod search
on quality we have specially developed
as a hand meet an entire department and
also keep the phone where how to date
any future appointments additionally
we've also added 12 an equalizer couple
of success for combat fire to me you
hear everything you're a timber young
music how do you ever found yourself in
a situation we're handling your
smartphone with one hand was an
impossible task that's why we invented
popsicles the first eco-friendly iphone
case that makes it easier for you pudsey
case has a foldaway handle that helps
you hold your smartphone in a natural
way using your hand instinctively
there are so many situations during the
day when we need to use the phone with
one hand while the other hand does other
things the boxee case handle allows you
to manage your smartphone with one hand
more confidently and safely without
using additional accessories but Popsy
case is not just a very comfortable
phone case we are very excited to
announce that it is made with one
hundred percent of cycled material that
comes from fishing nets from or
Mediterranean Sea so we are contributing
to decrease the amount of waste in our
seas and honor land hello my name is
Paolo hello my name is a deficit hello
my name is Anna will cofounders of
popsicles and we like to tell you how we
got here Pablo alanson came up with the
idea of popsicles when he was having a
hard time trying to take a picture with
one hand he thought that a handle would
solve this problem so he built the first
prototype when Pablo embedded this case
we knew that we had something very
simple but revolutionary on our hands
we're excited to announce our new line
of bendy charging cables
today I'd like to show you why we've
poured so much of our energy into this
cool little cable the Apple certified
bhindi charging cable comes in six
vibrant colors orange blue green pink
white and black the bhindi cable is 7
inches long from tip to tip we know how
frustrating it is to spend more money on
another USB charging cable because it
just keeps breaking or to have that
anxiety and annoyance that you won't
have access to your phone because
another one just came apart the durable
bendy cable is tailor-made to solve this
problem the bendy is durable because the
week problem areas on a typical USB
cable are coated in a strong thick
rubbery silicon coating that's still
super flexible and bendy this allows a
full range of motion for charging your
iPhone or iPad in most places that you
need the other issue is that longer
cables are overkill for most uses like
charging your phone with a power bank
charging your phone with a laptop on a
desk or connected to a USB outlet in
your car long cords just leave a tangled
and disheveled mess you can easily slip
the bendy cable into a pocket even with
the phone and a small power bank
connected the bendy cable easily fits
into a purse briefcase or even a small
side pocket of a backpack it's almost
guaranteed if you bought an uncertified
USB lightning cable that you'll
eventually get those dumb and annoying
accessory unsupported error messages on
your phone and if the cables will stop
charging and syncing eventually the
Apple mfi certification is pending and
should come through any day now the
bendy cable is a must-have for anyone
who uses an external power bank or
battery to charge their iPhone or iPad
the bendy cable is also perfect for
charging your iPhone with the USB outlet
in your car or truck I use the bhindi
cable to charge my iphone on my desk at
work with my laptop it keeps my desk
area super neat and clean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
