communication is not easy
Travel detects the voices in the
conversation with its front microphone
recognizing the language and translating
it through the ear but when you're
speaking trial records your language
through the front mic and plays the
translation into the other language
through the front speaker so only one
person has to wear the device luckily
we've been working on a live translator
that will solve all of these problems
draggled the global translator the first
hands-free live translator for automatic
two-way communication but how is it
different from the others Travel is not
intrusive Travel recognizes the voice of
the two people that are having a
conversation and discards other voices
around it even has a noise canceling
technology that deletes any
interferences from the environment you
don't need a data plan or Wi-Fi for most
languages Travel comes with everything
built-in you'll just need a mobile
device to set up the pair of languages
you want to use and you're good to go
when the other person talks their voice
gets recognized by my front microphone
that translates it through my earbud you
potential nothing for it you should see
how the whole thing
in suits you don't need to bother anyone
and this is the best part it's only you
in control three years of a design and
engineering process has led us to
develop a perfect fit for people all
over the world trying to get through
conversations in a foreign language it's
been a journey of many prototypes
designs and materials resulting in a
live translating hands-free device it
all gets logged through the travel app
where you can control any part of the
process if you need to hemos estado
dispositivo
we've been testing the technology
hardware and software and we're ready to
start the process of manufacturing but
we need you help to make it happen if
you are like me and like to travel learn
from other cultures and more specific
clothes the best deals this is what we
made this device for with your backing
you start the production of the devices
in Europe and we'll send them to you for
the best price we can never offer it's
time we forget about language and engage
in communication everybody's wardrobe
needs a good shirt but a lot can go
wrong with such a simple piece of
clothing not breathable easy to wrinkle
bum to stains
restrictive in uncomfortable that drives
us crazy introducing Lotus sure
a stain resistant breathable versatile
button-down shirt made with fiber
secrets shape-memory yarn loaded shirt
is unaffected by orange juice coffee soy
sauce grape juice if your shirt comes in
contact with dirt or liquid
just wipe it down or shake it off
to create the Lotus shirt we were
inspired by the micro structure of the
Lotus plant we designed the fabric to
mimic the hydrophobic structure of the
lotus leaf creating a shirt that is fade
resistant weather resistant and dries
almost instantly based on nature so we
named it Lotus shirt a shirt for
business meetings travel or dates Lotus
shirt won't leave you feeling restricted
in with Viper secrets special weaving
process it never wrinkles even if you
fold it or throw it in a travel bag
our shirt is also designed to breathe
with more than 1 million micro holes
Lotus shirt will keep you comfortable in
dry good news for those who struggle
with sweat in with our shirts blind fish
breathable mesh will always feel fresh
after washing simply hang up to quick
dry even with a closet full of shirts
every wardrobe should have at least one
loaded shirt after completing our
preliminary design and research we are
looking to you our backers for financial
supports and manufactures please help us
by backing loda shirt and making this
incredible idea of reality it's our
honor to introduce mix mix is an AR
device it's small like sunglasses it has
a 96 degree of field of view and it's
compatible with steamvr moste our
glasses promise to give you an

Suns but comes with a 96 degree fov the

entire field of view and it's mixed with
the environment naturally it's truly an
immersive AR experience let's test the

glass to show how you feel with mix well
connected to a PC mix can run on Steam
VR existing steamvr applications with a
dark background can be used directly on
mix it will give you a fresh a our
experience with existing VR content mix
supports positional tracking so that
virtual objects can be combined with the
real environment and there are optional
controllers eye tracking and hand
tracking if you have already developed
VR apps on steamvr just clear the
background and apply the black skybox
then your vr project will transfer to AR
we are collaborating with community
partners to create new AR games you can
also hacked with mix and different ways
we hope more and more developers can
join us and develop more AR apps
