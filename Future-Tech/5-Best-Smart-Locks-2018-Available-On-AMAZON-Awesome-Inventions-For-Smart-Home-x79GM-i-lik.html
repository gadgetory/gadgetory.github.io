Open Sesame
sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big their apps are
confusing they take too long to connect
when they're hassle to install I'm
pretty handy Sesame's different you can
install it in seconds literally no one
screwing no replacing sesame has a
patented design that fits any latch
anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this or like
this
it's SME senses when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special Nam
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries there with
no keys it's easy to let other people
into I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption no one's
hacking this thing Open Sesame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
