ported my name is Arturo I was born with
an eye problem one of the greatest fears
that I hear about during my support
groups with blind people is that they're
not gonna be able to do the normal
things like get on Facebook do texting
and get messages and make phone calls
there are 285 million visually impaired
people worldwide while we enjoying all
the technological advance that we have
right now for the communications blind
people get even more
for 20 years there was almost no
innovation existing Braille devices are
pokey and expensive two years ago we set
out to change this with dot the first
small watch for division of your people
dot is an active Braille device it is
connected to the smartphone via
bluetooth and can receive any text
information from any app or service
for input there's a crown in two buttons
it comes with full watch functionality
that is made from super light durable
aluminium and the battery lasts for
seven days but most importantly is
supportable at just $290 I have this
Braille SmartWatch which is a huge light
changing technology for me it behaves as
a navigation verification and a remote
system if you get a call it vibrates
then you can check who is calling to you
you can get on Google Maps and find the
nearest Starbucks boom there it is
literally at your fingertips young
children who are blind and visually
impaired can learn at an earlier age how
to read Braille dot is an open system

of apps are already in development

winter is coming hi we have come a very
long way since the iguana fresh shoes
was released five years ago we have sold
thousands of pairs all around the world
and today I'm proud to present you our
new amazing product the iguana jungle
most of us live in cities we spend most
of our time and enclosed concrete cubes
or in metal boxes our bodies are wrapped
under layers of clothes the part of our
body that stuff is the most are our feet
all day long they are literally locked
up in tight shoes there's nothing like
the feeling of finally taking your shoes
off and let your feet breathe at the end
of the day when summer comes and
temperatures get high we can't wait to
get our shoes off the dream is walking
barefoot on the beach and ideally
anywhere but on rough grounds our feet
need to be protected flip-flops and
other type of sandals have a design that
haven't evolved for centuries they are
inefficient and old-fashioned let's
change that introducing the eggwin a
jungle like the iguana fresh shoes the
jungle is inspired by the Amazonian
Indians they used to dip their feet
directly into natural latex to create a
second skin thereby protecting their
feet with our new concept the ultra
minimal piece of technical rubber will
only wrap around your big toe and you
heal by doing so it secures a thick and
soft ergonomic sole they assemble
together like a 3d puzzle and guess what
it holds the feeling is amazing it is
literally as if carpet was set in front
of your feet at all times the Iguana
jungle lets you walk as if you were
barefoot on any type of grounds put them
on and walk like never before
all the Iguana products are a hundred
percent made in Portugal there are two
types of sole available the first type
the luxury one is made of cork and
leather leather is ultra soft for your
feet and cork absorb sweat the second
type is made of EVA foam a flexible foam
that is ultra light and waterproof hey
guys it's Dylan from encased and I'm
here to tell you a little bit about our
latest product which I'm personally very
excited about since I really
you see I love the new iPhones that the
7/8 X but this week I was in the middle
of a big phone call when BAM fallen dead
I couldn't charge it because I was using
my headphones we don't really know why
Apple got rid of the audio jack but we
want it back so we created the audio
it's a high-grade iPhone case that also
has a standard audio jack so you can
plug in any pair of pin holes and you
can use your headphones while you charge
your phone the case is also a battery
pack so that gives your phone an extra
battery life to last you the entire day
by the way we didn't just build any
headphone jack our built-in DSP and DAC
chipsets amplify and digitize the signal
to give you premium audio quality which
is usually reserved for high-end
expensive headphones it's probably our
best product yet but it's not our first
here it incased we've manufactured and
sold thousands of quality iPhone
accessories in Amazon we even created a
Bluetooth adapter that makes your bose
QC 15 headphones wireless and that one
sold faster than a cheetah catching his
lunch our products earned thousands of
five-star reviews on Amazon not too
shabby
anyway the audio mod is already my
favorite product it has made my date
that much less stressful by the way if I
phone cases aren't your thing we are
also making external power banks that
bring back the jack so whether you're
watching netflix blasting your favorite
Spotify song or you're on a three-hour
conference call that demands the
headphones and power the audio mod has
you covered
but this case you will never run out of
battery again and you'll have the
freedom to use any headset you'd like
and charge your phone while you're at
but most importantly ladies and
gentlemen but jack is back now in order
to bring this product to market we need
to hit our crowdfunding goal to secure
enough demand to be the first one to get
the audio mod for your iPhone by backing
our campaign once we hit our goal we
will begin shipping as early as March
2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
