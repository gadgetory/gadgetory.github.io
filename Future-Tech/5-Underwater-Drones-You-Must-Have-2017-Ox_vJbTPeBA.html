built for filming observing and
exploring it is a portable and
user-friendly device that is able to
dive up to a depth of 100 meters all
while filming in Full HD
whether you are diving fishing island
hopping or exploring the Gladius is an
excellent tool for you it can fly like
an airplane while in water with a super
fast speed of up to four knots or 2
meters per second the unique Quatro
thrusters design makes it able to nimbly
move in all directions the Gladius comes
with two built-in batteries which can
last up to three to four hours on one
charge weighing only 6.6 pounds and
small size make it very portable as it
can easily fit into a backpack or
suitcase the built in full HD camera and
LED lighting have been optimized for use
and water which enables users to take
high-quality 16 megapixel photos and 4k
videos without any Distortion a remote
controller and the app interface is
quite simple and intuitive which is
compatible for Android or iOS devices
you can take pictures and videos and
quickly share on different social media
platforms the mobile Wi-Fi poi which
floats on the surface is equipped with a
500 meters range wireless communication
module which sends live image and data
to your device this gives cladius a
significant operating range we have
already produced multiple prototypes of
the Gladius in order to perfect its
design the internal sealed cabin of
glabius uses aluminium alloy materials
with oxidation treatment to ensure it is
waterproof and corrosion-resistant
within 100 metres depth now Salida
generators where does it down there
humans exploration to ocean never ends
but oceans are still full of mysteries
to explore the yet unknown underwater
world we created high quality ROV the CC
ROV it equipped with four horizontal and
two vertical thrusters allowing a
high-precision control it can rotate on
five axes or stay still to offer the
best underwater experience
grass production thomas supporters let's
sail away with the CCR LV to explore the
underwater world
you
what a filming took care of itself if
you were able to swim explore and dive
while your camera follow hi I'm Ben and
this is Kevin
well divers run to exploring marveling
at the beauty of the ocean and bringing
back memories of our underwater
adventures if you are like us you know
how cool it is to share your diving
experiences with people online you also
know how filming getting the way of
simply enjoying the moments which is why
we dive in the first place that's why a
year ago we had the dream with imagine
an autonomous underwater drone that's
follows you during your dials lets you
capture beautiful footage hands-free so
you can focus on the diving now above
always in pass of becoming a reality
this camera is completely autonomous
autonomous means that you don't have to
do anything at all
we've created and patented an underwater
localization technology it enables
ibubble
to know where you are and to keep you or
your surroundings in the frame now you
can record your diving adventures with
no camera handling whatsoever I bubble
comes loaded with a built-in library of
carefully designed camera movements all
you have to do is choose your shot from
the control bracelet and I bubble
execute the results are incredible
beautiful underwater footage from
completely new perspectives you might
wonder how I bubble performs when you
have let's say a specific close-up to
shoot good question you just call I
bubble back with your bracelet grab it
and film as you want when you're done
let ibubble go and it goes right back to
follow mode we've all dreamed of
following a turtle or month away while
it swim fast and far away
so we've enabled eye beable to do just
that all by itself press the target
locking button for a few seconds and
ibubble will recognize the shape it
needs to follow release it and watch as
it glides by turtles and sharks
capturing what's out of your reach we've
designed all the features in close
collaboration with the diving community
and professionals from the underwater
world when application puja bubbles
affected the vomit on Japanese GCE Dan
Lee
oh yeah liebherr Zuma a little
redundant community he doesn't the same
tone she a meanie huija in that
competence the veggies at all smashed
mine
can we are able to no keep that ammonia
will you this anymore
you know everything it's just expands
usually the type of things that I can
create so how does a future prison one
Porsche in the revolution policy on
Russia Davina I can't wait to have my
own eye today with the work we've done
and the team we've built we know we can
make above all a reality the last thing
we need is your help if we reach our
goal will access the whistles is needed
to deliver a bubble next year with more
fans will have even more features so by
i beable today thank you from the entire
eyeball team
hey I'm David and I'm Eric and three
years ago we came to you to Kickstarter
and told you about our dream to make a
low-cost underwater robot we wanted to
make underwater exploration accessible
to everybody
a lot has happened in that past three
years we've shipped thousands of these
robots to 50 countries every continent
and most importantly we've built this
community of people who are obsessed
with pushing the boundaries of what's
possible so for the last three years
we've been working on how to make
underwater exploration tools the right
way what we come up with is something
that we're extremely excited to announce
this is the Trident
I'd open ROV we believe that exploration
is not just about gathering data but
also about experiencing new worlds in a
new way we've designed Trident to be
extremely fun to fly most ROV easing up
and down slowly they go left and ride
forward reverse Trident is nothing like
that it flies like an airplane if it
speeds along you can Bank you can dive
it's fun to fly it goes fast when you
want it to but it can slow down and be
precise you have something you want to
respect getting video from underwater
has always been a challenge because
radio waves don't travel through water
so we've developed a very lightweight
neutrally buoyant tether which
communicates the video feed from the
barovia up to the surface that catches
to a wireless buoy which allows you to
control the ROV from any Wi-Fi connected
device like a tablet a laptop or even a
VR device like an oculus rift or a
Google cardboard we wanted an ROV that
could go to places that no ROV
had been before so we designed it to be
ultra portable whether you're hiking to
high alpine lakes or you're bringing
this is carry-on luggage it goes
wherever you go most are obese are
designed to look in specific places
where you already know where the target
is but we've realized that a lot of
people want to explore with an rfp we've
designed Trident to be extremely
hydrodynamic and excellent at going in
long straight lines this allows you to
do lawnmower patterns being able to
broadly explore place that you've never
seen before and find out what's there
we've seen community members take this
model and create 3d visualizations of
the sea floor using technologies like
photogrammetry and structure for motion
we hope that we can help create maps of
the underwater world that will allow us
to see it in a completely new light I
joined this project when it was the
initial Kickstarter and I did it because
it was going to be a chance to take this
Hardware these robots and I asked me at
Lee's my software skills actually
programmed them and have them do step
under water
I've been using that to build a platform
now that lets other software geeks like
myself contribute and help programmers
to find ways to control robots we've
made a plug-in architecture that allows
you to add your own
components add new sensors new
technology to an ROV after it's already
been developing out in the field the
opener of e software it's bigger than
any single ROV its opening the door to
services and technologies that were just
not scratching the surface on from
mapping to autonomous computer control
to imaging reefs and an underwater
shipwrecks in 3d we're going to be able
to send this data and utilize cloud
computing mesh networking and all kinds
of future technologies to make it
available to everybody so whether you're
a fisherman a researcher a recreational
boater or just someone who's curious
about what's below the surface this is
the tool for you so here we are you
spent the last 4 years developing
underwater robots and we've never been
more excited about the project we have
now to get to the next level to bring
Trident to light we need your help
so check out the Reward levels let us
know what you think and together let's
build the future of underwater
exploration thank you
we live on a planet that's 71% water yet
we've only explored 10% of it we're
about to change that the fathom one is
an easy-to-use underwater drone that you
control with your smartphone or tablet
we designed it to be the most affordable
most versatile underwater drone ever
made and after two full years of
prototyping and development were finally
ready to bring underwater exploration
and education to the masses
I'm John I'm Matt and I'm Danny we're a
team of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers they had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800's jump forward two hundred
years and now every cottage has
artifacts and pieces of history on their
walls that washed up on the beach but
there are still legends of horse-drawn
sleds that fell through the ice and got
stuck at the bottom just waiting to be
explored I thought if I could control an
aerial drone from a mobile app to
explore from above why couldn't I do the
same thing from underwater
that's when fathom was born underwater
remotely operated vehicles or ROV s have
been around for a while but they're
mainly large expensive industrial
devices tethered to big ships and early
consumer RVs inspired by their big
brothers cost well over $1,000 with no
mobile app for piloting and you need to
be a pretty good hacker to put them
together
we knew we wanted an underwater drone
that anyone could drop into any body of
water and pilot easily using an app on
their smart device and it had to be
small and light enough to carry around
meaning a completely new compact design
it had to come fully assembled out of
the box including an onboard 1080p HD
camera and built in high intensity LED
headlights for clear viewing and it had
to be as affordable as lower cost flying
drones with comparable equipment so that
every modern day Explorer could have one
we built the fathom one with all of
those features and thanks to custom
components in a streamlined design now
you can have it for under $600 that's
less than half the price of the closest
competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization fathom 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses
we built the prototypes validated our
designs and now ready to go on a
full-scale manufacturing all that's left
is for you the Kickstarter community to
show us that you want an underwater
drone that's affordable portable modular
and completely easy to use right out of
the box fathom is your chance to go deep
and see the world in an entirely new way
the possibilities are truly endless
what can you fathom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
