I'm the technical product manager at
Batavia Holland today I'm going to
introduce you to the mechs fire the safe
and easy way to light your barbecue
within minutes the max fire is a
cordless rechargeable eight volt
electronic barbecue lighter thanks to
the integrated heating element the
charcoal is heated quickly with no
annoying smoke the next fire lasts the
barbecue twice as fast as normal
lighting methods delicious prepared meat
and vegetables without the taste of
charcoal or chemicals I came up with the
idea when it's preparing my toast for
lunch
I forgot it for just a minute and the
toast is heating elements burnt bread
completely I've always been fascinated
with being underwater the freedom the
serenity
I've longed for a way to stay underwater
with these just like the beams that
inhabit it and now I can this is no
Nomad has a cleverly designed dive
system that is compact lightweight and
ultra poor your dive harness doubles as
a backpack for carrying Nomad to and
from the dive spot the flotation tube is
stored on the inside of the shell and
automatically inflates which push of a
button and the air hose is conveniently
wrapped around the outside of the shell
when you're done diving Nomad will
support one diver
to a depth of 35 feet with a runtime of
over an hour depending on the divers
breathing the prototype we have now is
quite amazing it has almost full
functionality so we're really only a few
steps away from completing the final
design with the money that we raised
from Kickstarter it will enable us to
complete our mold design and our
electronics design in order to bring to
market an amazing product
here's the expiration here's the
conservation here's nomads

way that's why we made go space go space
