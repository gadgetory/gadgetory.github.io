requires an additional app download and
account registration not so easy

download an app to receive access you
can securely receive a code via tax or
messenger as an owner you can easily
grant time-sensitive access directly

this wherever you are hi I'm Matthew as
Airbnb hosts ourselves we started igloo
home to make smart locks and lock boxes
that would provide our guests with easy
and secure ways to enter home rental
properties since then we've gone on to
win awards for our design and technology
which has been rolled out in over 80
countries and Counting we're now
launching a smart padlock focused on
shell access and everyday use the igloo
home smart padlock is jam packed with
features remote deployability is built
around the igloo home pin code algorithm
a similar system is used by banks and in
RSA tokens so it's very secure with our
unique remote pin codes users simply

time or an email from the lock owner no
additional app download is needed users
can request access by scanning the QR
code on the lock plus you don't need to
be nearby the lock to create these pin
codes the smart padlock recognizes the
dedicated code that's been generated by
the app codes can be one-time duration

morning
or if you have a shared storage with
others you can give each person a unique
code to access the space you can also
track who unlocked it and when it was
done the smart padlock also has
Bluetooth capabilities you can unlock
via your smart phone when you're within
