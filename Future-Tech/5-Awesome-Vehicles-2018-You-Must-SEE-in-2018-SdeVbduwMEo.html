workouts you can get for your
cardiovascular system and for keeping
fit while normal cycling is great for
your legs it doesn't do much for the
muscles of your upper body what if there
was a bike that could give your arms and
upper body the same kind of workout you
get by rowing or going to a gym hi my
name is Boyan and I came up with bicycle
which does exactly that
by adding a secondary paddling system
for your hands you can now achieve the
same kind of workout with your arms and
upper body as with your legs in addition
to your lower body you can work your
biceps triceps chest shoulders lats abs
as well as the entire core by using
varying riding techniques and all this
while enjoying beautiful outdoor scenery
and breathing in fresh air
twice the workout twice the fun bicycle
is particularly useful when going up
hills and your legs get tired as you can
just take over with your arms this here
is over 20 percent gradient use twice
circle as a normal bike a hand cycle or
combination of both twice go comes with
gears so you can increase or lower
resistance to perfectly tailor your
individual needs and is equally suitable
for both women and men chess pads
provide full upper body support and
prevents riders from making contact with
the chain ring there is also an optional
chain ring cover twice sigil is easy to
operate
steering handles can achieve tight
maneuvers and double as arm cranks we
believe that the most enjoyable workout
happens when it's combined with
adventure
if you were the kind of person who likes
working out outdoors then this is the
right product for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
