much Sun can be harmful UV rays damage
your skin and eyes and lead to skin
cancer this is preventable as experts in
analyzing weather data we found that
people care about the immediate
environment around them information the
current weather apps cannot provide what
if everyone could have a personalized
weather station that's why we decided to
create one so we set a goal develop the
idea assembled a great team conducted
breakthrough research talk to a lot of
experts and made several prototypes we
collaborated with the best engineers and
have begun manufacturing to provide a
one-of-a-kind device
this is q10 a remarkably precise weather
station built to fit on your keychain it
tells you the temperature and UV index
right where you are based on the
measured UV environmental situation and
your skin type q temp alerts when you
need some protection q temp tells how
much time you have before getting
sunburned based on your skin type it
helps create a comfortable space it
notifies you to be safer whenever you
want to go to the beach explore nature
or enjoy a day in the snow say hello to
the Sun again start your day off smart
learn about the weather wherever you are
and wherever you're headed get ready for
your productive day with real time
environmental updates either inside or
outside even track and share weather
info to personalize and customize the
experience enjoy your day safely when
you are together or explore alone know
the environment and protect yourself
we are growing but we need your support
our goal is simple provide a convenient
way for people to understand actual
weather data and enable people to more
easily avoid the harmful risks of skin
damage join us on our path to make skin
cancer a thing of the past
this is a hand now it can do more
whoa
and of course
and also
not now
sleep wake up okay time to go
hi Kickstarter my name is Alfredo this
is my hand and this is Aria with Aria
finger movements directs your SmartWatch
today's devices are awesome the way we
control them is not especially for
wearables buttons very vintage
touchscreen tiny FET user experience
voice control from these high-tech
devices on the market I would expect a
super engaging experience then I
discover that with a bunch of sensors I
could see this
everyone's dreamed about controlling
things with their minds and that's how
we started the next step was to
transform this into a product and that's
why we applied for pax and came to
Shenzhen China the manufacturing capital
of the world here we build and build and
build until area area is a tiny gesture
controller designed very specifically
for smartwatches you wear it you
calibrate it
and then you use it with your favorite
SmartWatch you scroll through the menu
and launch the application you want you
can play some music or check email or
char mama we worked closely with a
series of smartwatches
in order to guarantee the best user
experience possible aria is a Bluetooth
compatible device so it can be connected
to most of the electronics you always
use we're starting with a set of
essential apps to cover the main needs
and we're developing more we're also
releasing an SDK for all the developers
we want to create apps for Aria we
develop this technology and now we need
your support to start the production
please back us and help us to bring aya
to you
I think any dog owner can relate to it
you look into their eyes and share a
brief connection and see that they
really want to understand so when you
think about trying to talk to your pet
there's really only so much you can say
but what if somehow you could
communicate more what would you ask them
first this was the inspiration for
clever pet hoverpad is an interactive
device that reward your dog for solving
simple puzzles we know that when your
reward an animal for performing a
certain behavior it's more likely to
perform that behavior again in the
future
we use this every time we try to get our
dog to do something for a treat and to
the most important factors of making
this work a repetition and consistency
so clever pet uses your dogs morning
meal and the time it spends at home to
encourage interactions throughout the
day it starts out simple your dog will
get a treat whenever she presses any of
clever pets buttons once she's got this
down
clever pet makes her job a little bit
tougher now she only gets a treat when
she presses the button that's lit up
once she's learned that the game changes
again clever pet gradually teaches her
to interact in more interesting ways and
she stays active and happy all day long
the really great thing is that this is
all automatic clever pet engages your
dog even when you can't be home my
favorite part about working with dogs is
seeing progress on a daily basis I've
learned a lot about how dogs interact
with their surroundings and the most
important takeaway is that a dog with a
job is a happy dog what's really
interesting is that all my clients have
the same request they all want a happy
healthy and well behaved dog so when I
was first introduced to clever pet I
learned that there was something for
these problems keeping our dogs engaged
and busy while we're not at home I've
introduced dogs to just about every
interactive toy and device on the market
and nothing challenges your dog like
clever pet does we begin with simple pet
behaviors and have since advanced some
more complex interactions at clever pet
we're driven by compassion and curiosity
to find a way to care for pets when
they're alone and get a better sense for
who they are so whether you're looking
to keep your pet healthy and
happy or simply dealing with your dog's
anxiety when you leave the house
clever pet adapts to meet your dog's
needs clever paths engage idle paws
