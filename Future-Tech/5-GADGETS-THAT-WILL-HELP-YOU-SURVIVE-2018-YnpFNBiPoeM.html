hi my name is Stewart yo I'm from Salt
Lake City Utah and this is my backyard
I've grown up exploring these mountains
camping backpacking fishing and skiing
when you're in the wilderness a variety
of jobs can come up you need to be picky
about your gear when every ounce counts
I realized I needed to lightweight tool
that can do multiple tasks I'd like to
introduce the spar tool the spar tool is
a shovel and axe a machete a saw hammer
pick a pry bar and a bottle opener spar
tool weighs less than 3 pounds and is
constructed from spring tempered 1075
carbon steel and shatterproof Tzeitel
polymer it's solid build has no hinge or
other moving parts making it lighter and
more durable than the competition it's
sharpened and cuts deep with every swing
handle and cutting surfaces are aligned
to ensure a safe and effective stroke
the blade splits wood apart saw rips
through just about anything and of
course it digs like a champ the spar
tool is perfectly balanced making the
reverse end just as useful it hammers
it unhand
the spike excels a demolition
prybar is tough and versatile and it
opens up your favorite beverage after
all that work spar tool is a great
addition to your gear kit whether you're
on the road in the wild at home in the
garden or in case of emergency Sports
will design phases complete and tooling
for manufacturer all-metal components is
ready we need your help to fund
production injection molding equipment
and fill our first order so that we can
bring smart tool to market want to help
out but not ready to commit check out
our spark it survival tip it's packed
with useful goodies that could save your
life in an emergency or more likely help
you MacGyver a solution in your everyday
life
thanks for watching my video spargel is
proudly 100% American man and I hope
you'll support us bringing you the
ultimate outdoor survival tool
engineer for outdoor or emergency use
the etekcity water filter straw allows
you to instant access to clean drinkable
water from almost any unfiltered
freshwater source including rivers lakes
and tap water this is how it works
unfiltered water enters through the
endless heat and passes through an
advanced filtration system comprised of
a hollow fiber
uf membrane and anti bacterial carbon
filter trapping 99.9% of waterborne
pathogens so you can enjoy fresh safe
drinking water the water filter straw is
built for wonder less travellers
featuring a lightweight yet durable
design where you can easily store it in
your survival kit camping gear or hiking
backpack to increase your water capacity
the straws compatible with standard
threaded bottles in hydration reservoir
a foldable water pouch for filtered
drinking on the go is also heated
to drink directly from the water source
remove the outlet cap then submerge the
inlet piece in the water and sit from
the mouthpiece
if you can't directly reach the water
source use the extension tube to extend
your reach if you're trying to drink
from a more turbid water containing
contaminants simply attach the included
pre-filter to the endless piece firmly
before stepping to clean the straw so
the backwash device with clean water
then hold it against the mouthpiece
while pushing a plunger down to wash the
inner filtration system repeat as
necessary whether you're camping hiking
or and miss a natural disaster the water
filter straw provide secure drinking
water whenever and wherever things
aren't really bad in the world and you
could only have one night for the rest
of your life which knife would you
choose so founder of ultimate survival
tips I get asked that question all the
time over the years I've tested and
reviewed hundreds of knives but I never
found that one night I could do
everything I wanted so on early 2014 I
started sketching integrating elements
from blades I loved along with features
had never been seen before in one knife
like a micro survival kit in the handle
a two-in-one switchable nylon and Kydex
sheath that's packed with features and a
rugged knife built for tough jobs with
the finesse of a fine carving tool it's
called the MS k1 multi scenario knife to
build a knife like this I knew I needed
help so I teamed up with knife legend
Jeff Freeman the award-winning designer
many iconic gerber knives like the oh
six Auto the LMF - survival knife tossed
around some ideas and you know he sent
me some sketches for things that he
wanted you know and we just developed it
from there he said okay well let's let's
make a product together and so he was
able to tell me the things as a product
designer that this product should do and
I was able to come up with solutions
present them to him and he could test
them in a real-world scenario
every msk one is fashioned from a single
piece of quarter-inch full-tang steel
that runs from piercing tip to rock
crushing but making it one of the
thickest most durable blades you can buy
for the msk one we chose american-made
black oxide coated d2 semi's stainless
high carbon steel because it's
ridiculously tough extremely wear
resistant holds a razor-sharp edge the
center-aligned clip point is exceptional
for piercing detailed tip carving
precision drilling when I conceptualize
the msk one one of my major goals was to
create a knife combine the power of a
full sized chopper with the finesse and
fine cutting ability found mostly in
smaller blades we accomplished this by
raising the blade spine which
effectively shifts the center of gravity
forward just enough to make the msk one
an incredible chopper while the jump
thumb ramp increases knife control and
directs thumb pressure toward the edge
making every cut precise and efficient
for more intricate cutting and carving
tasks the oversized toy allows you to
safely grip the knife fraction of an
inch from the blade for incredible
control for handling comfort and grip
Jeff started with advanced economics
software to ensure that the MS k1 handle
was shaped to perfectly fit to human
hand
we chose canvas micarta handle slabs
because of their durability natural feel
shock absorption and comfort and cold
and wet environments front and rear
guards keep your hand in place while
cutting chopping pounding smashing or
breaking things using the MS k1 stout
butt end pummel mark was this fire
symbol our curved pummel and fire steel
striker gives you maximum leverage and
the ability to generate an aim more
sparks at your tender than a straight
edge for quicker more efficient fire
starting for primitive fire generation
we've developed the first ever Center
balanced stainless steel bow drill divot
it transforms your knife into a solid
low resistance hands
socket that's reversible for right and
left-handed users with the handle slabs
removed three strategically placed
lanyard holes make it easy to add your
favorite paracord wrap or lash the msk
one to a branch to make a spear I
remember when I was a kid and I got my
first survival knife with a hollow
handle in a survival kit inside I felt
like Rambo even though the knife was
terrible in the survival kit was mostly
a gimmick so my goal was to develop the
first truly useful handle survival kit
including hard to improvised items that
could actually help you stay alive in a
survival situation to do this I worked
with the team at was ooze survival gear
to develop a micro survival kit for the
msk one that includes items for fire
starting water collection and
purification fishing traps and snares
navigation repairing gear and first-aid
I've designed a lot of fixed blades and
in this case three or four rounds four
rounds of prototypes and I don't know
how many months of testing by
fifty-fifty we spent as much time on the
knife as we have on the sheath
we didn't say hey that's good enough or
that's fine in this case we just wanted
to get it right switchback ACS adaptable
carry system is the first she's package
that switches from a feature rich black
ballistic nylon sheath to a low-profile
black Kydex sheath by removing a single
bolt both sheaves have a generous array
of grommet holes that are designed to
fit optional add-on tools like the MS k1
fire steel holder and msk mini neck
knife MOLLE webbing on the front of the
nylon sheath is designed to accept msk
one kit pouches that are currently in
development strap the MS k1 to any MOLLE
compatible gear and carry the MS k1 and
either the standard or drop leg
positions be able to take the whole
thing all the way through from here's
just sketch in some idea and here's a
bunch of things I'd like it to do to
actually this is what we're going to
market with I mean that's that's pretty
cool and it's a lot of work but it also
gives you a big sense of ownership
you
as you can see ms k1 is much more than a
tough all-around survival knife it's a
complete survival system you can use for
your lifetime and then pass on to the
next generation now we need your help
your support will enable us to complete
our first production run hand build each
knife right here in America now I
realize at the end of the day this knife
is not going to fit every budget I
really wish it did but for those who
make the investment the MS k1 may be the
single best survival purchase you ever
make if you'd like to be the first to
get your hands on the MS k1 or other
items like the MS k1 mini neck knife
please back this project share it with
your friends and family thanks for your
support
you
