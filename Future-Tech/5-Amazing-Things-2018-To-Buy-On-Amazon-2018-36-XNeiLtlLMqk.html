how would you like your steak
medium-rare medium or medium well the
steak champ is the ultimate steak
thermometer for the perfect steak every
time just activate the steak champ and
stick it in the raw steak sideways the
steak champ now monitors the inner
temperature this unique thermometer is
made up of innovative and patented
features the double blinking signal
means you can take your steak off the
fire when it's green it's medium-rare
when yellow medium and when red it's
medium well thanks to an innovative
measuring technique you always get
perfect steaks and that on the grill
in the pan or in the oven
cooked to perfection always everywhere
steak champ I've never seen this thing
before but it kinda reminds me of a
space shuttle it's beautiful I think it
it feels even though I don't hold
instruments often it feels really
comfortable it's a nice beautiful oh I
can play like guitar I can play it like
like the keyboard that I used it's just
a good way to like get a good feel of
the instrument that's cool you can
almost barely barely touch it and kind
of you still get the sound but then
harder you do it it's got that attack
yeah um not knowing much about musical
equipment to be able to play it just
plugging it into my phone and using it
out
as a jazz musician I would fall in love
with this if I brought it to school oh
this feels a lot of very similar to my
ukulele as far as like the sensitivity
to yeah that's why it's not like a delay
or anything so it's great like when I'm
playing and playing Wow so you can play
two notes on the same string at the same
time which is virtually impossible with
any other stringed instrument ah I need
to spend a little time with this in
another room
that dog slept while I get the rock out
when I was 8 years old
I learned to play the violin and as a
teenager picked up the guitar I ended up
getting a PhD in sound studies
researching the ways that we listen to
and make sound in our everyday lives
what I realized is everyone plays with
music and music is a fundamental human
desire what's missing is an instrument
that can capture a full range of really
just basic human gestures whether it's
tapping along with the drums or
strumming a guitar or sliding along with
the orchestra and that's what we've been
building an instrument that can really
translate your musical intention your
music into sound our vision has been to
build a musical experience that's simple
and intuitive and to do that we had to
start from the ground up now we've
created an instrument that is smart
enough to take any of those basic
gestures and translate them into
whatever music you want to make this is
a revolutionary idea
traditionally an instrument is played in
one way we've created an instrument that
adapts to you and you can play however
you want any position any style any
sound for the past four years we've been
developing this technology and refining
our prototypes in Nashville Tennessee
and exploring this concept with
musicians from around the world the
result is a beautiful minimal and
ergonomic design that's so much fun to
play we're in a really exciting time for
musical expression and the possibilities
are limitless we believe everyone has a
part and we want to inspire you to play
your music
