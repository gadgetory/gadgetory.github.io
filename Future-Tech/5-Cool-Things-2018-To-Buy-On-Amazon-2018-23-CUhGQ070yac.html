when we began juicing using only organic
non-gmo veggies and fruits we delivered
our juice on a small set of wheels this
worked great for a while but our mission
has always been to get an organic cold
pressured juice into as many hands as
possible so even more people can
discover this simple delicious pleasure
of living vibrantly and to do that we
tried to come up with some alternative
methods to get our juice into even more
hands
Oh bull ride little
creative yes effective Neph so we
consulted our new friends of the
coca-cola company and they're making a
minority investment in Suja now we can
partner on new distribution to share the
Suja love and achieve our mission but
some things will never change Suja will
always be organic non-gmo and cold
pressure and of course made sunny in San
Diego</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
