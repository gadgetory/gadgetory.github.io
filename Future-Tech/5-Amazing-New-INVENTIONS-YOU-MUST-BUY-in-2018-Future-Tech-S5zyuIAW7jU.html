capture your own stunning moments
although tracking is critical clever how
to try out all the tracking stabilizers
in the market we found out there's a lot
of room for improvement it is too easy
to lose sight of a target when object is
shaded or simply moving fast
that's why taro campaign
Carroll is an auto tracking device who
can truly come home that are always keep
you in the frame
all you need to do is put on the
infrared tag and leave the rest to taro
our tracking camera will instantly
identify where the object is and our AI
algorithm will pinpointed exactly at a
blazing thirty calculations per second
that's 15 times faster than our
competitor now with targets living as
fast as 50 miles per hour with taro zero
lagging tracking feature your object
will be constantly locked in even during
very sharp turns
Taro's dynamic tracking works perfectly
even when you yourself are also moving
back because it sees and captures
fast-moving moments so smoothly you
won't even need to look at the screen
with three high torque brushless motors
and action camera shooting video jitters
are now a thing of the past and with our
app breathtaking action sequences
pictures and videos are just a single
click away as a group of AI software
engineers we've poured our heart and
soul into getting our prototypes just
right we are now so excited to be
releasing not just one but three devices
taro t1 for smartphones and GoPros taro
TX for DSLR cameras and taro m1 a
separate tracking module that's
compatible with all stabilizers whether
you're a vlogger sports freak animal
lover or whatever now at last you can
put yourself in the frame and
confidently capture every moment that
matter whether you already have a
stabilizer or perhaps looking to buy new
one the taro bring your shooting spirits
to a whole new level with us today
very oh sorry could work think about it
what is the most boring daily action we
performed since childhood experts
recommend washing teeth after each mill
and brushing for at least three minutes
but honestly who really doesn't and who
bothers always performing the right
movements both manual and electric
toothbrushes have been the same for
decades often in a hurry we brush our
teeth mistakenly which overtime forces
us to turn towards expensive and painful
visits to the dentist have you ever
thought you could brush your teeth
perfectly in just three seconds it's
time to change your habits for the
better with an eco
oh it's cold dope
that's a baby perfect temperature
perfect taste amber the world's first
temperature control mug from Edison's
times to our days the lamp socket didn't
change at all
138 years have passed but we still twist
what if we say that dream is a chain you
don't need to twist anymore just one
click
introducing the bagful a revolutionary
system which consists of two parts and
allows installing bulbs in one place and
it's all because of magnets of course
with bag bolts you don't longer need to
push and twist the bulb and awkward
lampshade it's no more extracting broken
bulbs using special tools no pain for
people with arthritis and all those
sufferings happen to you when you're
balancing high up stop it now
and start using mag balls
