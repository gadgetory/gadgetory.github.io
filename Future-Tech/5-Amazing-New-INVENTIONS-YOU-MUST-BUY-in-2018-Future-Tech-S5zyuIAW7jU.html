what is the most boring daily action we
performed since childhood experts
recommend washing teeth after each mill
and brushing for at least three minutes
but honestly who really doesn't and who
bothers always performing the right
movements both manual and electric
toothbrushes have been the same for
decades often in a hurry we brush our
teeth mistakenly which overtime forces
us to turn towards expensive and painful
visits to the dentist have you ever
thought you could brush your teeth
perfectly in just three seconds it's
time to change your habits for the
better with an eco
