accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you'd probably say I don't have
it with me so most of the time you end
up leaning your phone against some
random object instead of actually using
that expensive tripod that you left at
home so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iPhone and
holds your device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the school
best part is that it transforms into the
size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again people loved it we
raised more than our funding goal by
almost double and even Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak the was said why didn't
someone do this before what a great idea
that I wish I thought I put one of them
in my backpack which is always with but
then a few of our very clever backers
realized something that we missed told
us I've got a case on my phone I'm not
gonna take it off every time that's just
too much work and someone else said so
what you guys some kind of Apple fanboys
you know some people rock Angela right
that got us thinking can't make a pocket
tripod for every phone in case bottle
out there there's at least a million
different combinations who knows so as
soon as we ship all rewards to our two
and a half thousand backers we started
working on a universal pocket tripod
instead of limiting it to only bear
iPhones for months we studied case
design it's got feedback from our
backers and tested ideas once we had a
universal opening shape we made it in a
range of sizes so that it fits as many
case and phone combinations as possible
this is the new universal pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yep works fantastic in landscape and
halfway in portrait does it work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guide that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing what case and
device combination you have okay but
what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection do any two
pocket tripods nope because whenever you
swap your case or your phone you can
also get the adapters to match their new
size you're good to go
the pocket tripods been used in testan
for the past two years by thousands of
people who have wide they use it as
their primary tripod every day to take
amazing time lapses for making video
calls and even to create light paintings
we've made the pocket tripod with the
highest standards of engineering
materials and manufacturing they say the
best camera is the one that's with you
and the same is true when it comes to
tripods the pocket tripod is now a
proven product
we use it to capture our memories we use
it to get through our day we use it to
connect with our friends we use it when
we relax it's hard to imagine life

have you ever struggled to take your
keys out from your jeans the problem
that I'm trying to solve here is
something that I personally go through
every single day taking your keys in and
out of your pockets is something that
can be annoying for everyone especially
when you're wearing jeans
I mean form-fitting jeans this is just
my personal opinion but if you ever
struggle to take keys out from your
pockets then I think you know as well
that jeans and keys are not meant to be
together
as a new parent I learned that running
errands and shopping for groceries
become that much more challenging when
you have your precious minimi in tow
with both hands full of groceries
balancing a diaper bag and drink
shuffling through my pockets to dig out
keys becomes a serious struggle
that is why we created Magnus a portable
magnetic keyring holder for your
everyday activities securing your keys
has never looked so simple cool and
convenient with Magnus you can avoid
wasting time taking your keys in and out
from your pockets
Magnus allows easy and fast access to
your car and house keys within
milliseconds
Magnus allows for your keys to be right
in front of you and within reach at all
times
made from the strongest super magnet we
guarantee that your keys will not fall
until you decide to pull it off yourself
blocking and opening the trunk of your
car never been so easy when you hand so
cool with groceries Magma's make sure
your key just an inch away from your
hand
we have tested a lot of different
prototypes varying in strength and sizes
to finally find the best magnet to be
used for Magnus if Magnus can hang a
hammer I think it's safe to say it can
carry your keys without a problem please
help us to get Magma's into production
and choose any of the rewards that you
