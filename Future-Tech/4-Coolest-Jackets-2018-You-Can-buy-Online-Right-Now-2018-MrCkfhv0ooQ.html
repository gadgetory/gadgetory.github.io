welcome to epic tech under a hundred
first up we're taking a look at some
tech you can wear and this is rave Ian's
new heated hoodie and it's starting to
get a little chilly outside and this is
possibly the best way to stay warm this
hoodie has three heated modes which are
controlled by a small little LED lit
button on the inside of the hoodie and
there's a high medium and low setting
and depending on how cold it is outside
this hoodie can keep you warm up to
seven hours the entire system is powered
by an included five volt battery pack
which can also be used to charge up your
phone if you need power and there are a
ton of hidden pockets on this hoodie
it's pretty dope in my opinion and is
100% washable and if you're interested
in rave Ian's heated hoodie or some
other awesome heated jackets that
they're making I'll leave a link below
for you but you can pick up this guy for
as low as 89 bucks right now next up
we're taking a look at one of the most
portable solid-state drives you can get
this is SanDisk's new extreme 500 and it
is super tiny this thing fits in the
palm of your hand and spits out right
speeds over 350 megabytes per second and
read speeds around four hundred and
thirty megabytes per second thanks to
its USB 3.0 connection it has a pretty
rugged build with its rubber bumper
around the outside and even has a
built-in metal ring at the top so you
can clip it on to a backpack it comes
with a USB 3.0 cable is backwards
compatible and stupid slim and I picked
up the 240 gigabyte model which is a bit
over this video's price point at 122
bucks but you can also snag the 120
gigabyte version for only 80 bucks and
if you're interested I will leave a link
below for you if you're looking for a
good way to keep your Galaxy s6 powered
while on the go you should definitely
check out you news DX protective battery
case they make them for a variety of
smartphone models but this one for the
Galaxy S six packs a 3600 milliamp hour
battery and will easily double the life
of your s6 it's also a quick charge 2.0
already and there's an LED indicator and
a power button
on the back side and it comes along with
a micro USB cable for charging it's
available in a couple of different
colors and it's bumper style design
snaps around your galaxy s6 and stays
put the best part is it won't break the
bank coming in at just 60 bucks which
you can check out using the link below
speed
power accessories next up we're checking
out Samsung's fast charge qi wireless
charging pad and this will charge up a
compatible device such as the galaxy
note 5 or s6 edge+
up to one point four times faster than
standard wireless charging solutions and
reduced your 0 to 100 time by up to 50
minutes it's backwards compatible with
standard qi wireless charging equipped
devices but will only charge them at
normal speeds and even includes its own
micro USB cable and charging block to
get you going
either way it's a quick and easy way to
top off your note 5 or s6 edge+ and you
can grab it right now for under 60 bucks
finally we're looking at some high-end
earbuds to go along with those fast
charging smartphones these are our H
Asma 600 I knows isolating in-ear
headphones these are straight-up epic
with a machined aluminum construction
are a chaise custom 320 point one driver
for some dope sound quality and even
come along with a carrying case and
eight sets of dual density silicone ear
tips the MA 600 eyes also include an
inline microphone for changing tracks
volume and even answering phone calls on
the gov there's a 1.3 five meter braided
aluminum cable covered in a rubbery
material with plenty of space to reach
your pocket or bag and overall I can't
complain about the quality here they are
well worthy of being considered epic
tech and you can pick them up for 89
bucks and if you'd like to find out more
about these specifications frequency
response things like that I will leave a
link below for you and there's also a
version without the inline controls and
you can grab the michaelis Edition for
79 bucks so that about wraps it up for
epic tech under 100 and be sure to let
me know what you'd like to see featured

thanks again for watching everyone
this is DOM and I'll catch you in the

is it just me or there's some serious
problems with winter coats think about
it they're not equipped to save you from
cold when the weather suddenly turns on
you you realize you don't have your
gloves scarf hat even if you prepare for
everything before you go out you look
like this guy
we realize that winter coats needs some
serious upgrade actually we thought that
they need to be reinvented so we did
just that
here is our story first we want it to
have the gloves as part of the coat but
without the bulge we tried it so many
ways it either compromised look or
functionality and after testing and
testing and testing we did it
the trick was to create something super
light and super warm at the same time
while creating this coat we actually
invented a new glove it's 100% leather
warm water resistant and fits perfectly
with our parkas it can be used to
operate touch devices and it's so light
that there's no bulge we don't want you
worrying about a scarf either so we made
it part of the coat hip length parkas
look cool but in the winter sometimes
you need to cover more why buy two
jackets we've given you an extension for
those extra harsh days yes it's two
jackets in one we also give you an extra
removable layer for warmth so this parka
is good for winters and really harsh
winters which means you can use it for
that ski vacation in Austria as well as
for wintering in Florida this parka is
made for the urban lifestyle you'll look
awesome on your way to work with a place
to put your phone
tablet glasses and keys and stylish when
you go out with friends while keeping
your hands-free want to carry your hat
no problem
we have you coming we also threw in a
pocket for a tracker tag in case you
don't remember at which club you forgot
your coat last night the world's best
parka meets the world's best materials
both inside and out for six months we
explored every option to make it
waterproof but breathable warm but
lightweight we learned everything about
fabrics bills insulations zippers
leather fur and waterproofing and after
188 days of continuous product
development and usability testing we
made smart parka this is the best winter
coat in the world period the pockets are
made for carrying your stuff safely and
comfortably built-in scarf and gloves
means you'll never forget them it can be
extended and is adaptable for different
temperatures it's functional durable and
looks really really cool so for you the
awesome people of Kickstarter who helped
us take off we have decided to
completely cut out the retail margin and
for the first few supporters we'll bring
a price close to an actual manufacturing
cost all we ask in return is that you
support us now and share the hell out of
this video smart parka the last winter
coat you'll ever need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
