 it's how we were always told
smart homes would work your coffeemaker
would prepare your coffee right as you
enter the door the lights will be set
just right that never happened
all we do have is a bunch of appliances
operated from our phone just makes it a
fancy remote control the problem is that
there was never a sensor to sense who's
actually in the room is it me is it my
wife
well Rumi was about to change that
greenie senses smartphones to determine
who's in the room and personalize it
accordingly not just for me for everyone
in the house when I walk into a room
Rumi senses my phone using bluetooth
technologies and I've just everything to
my liking
and when I leave the room it turns
everything off if that's what I
programmed it to do as opposed to other
indoor positioning solutions Rumi senses
when I'm actually in the room and not in
the room adjacent room and since it's
not based on motion detection it's not
affected by other non phone carrying
things when there's more than one person
in the room
Rooney allows you to prioritize whose
settings to say
the attachment of Rumi is easy and fits
nicely in every room
no hubs are needed and there are no
security issues because Rumi connects to
your phone not the internet so yeah
thanks to Rumi that cool future is
finally here real automated IOT
personalized private 12 months 1 week 2
days and 4 hours ago we launched the
revolutionary device pyro we've
condensed it into a smaller more compact
version and along the way we've added
crazy features I'm happy to introduce
you to pyro me
you
one of the big advantages of pyromania
is actually the size right with this
half the size of the original pyro the
possibilities of this thing are
literally endless you can put it under a
spread of cards shoot fire from that
hide it inside a card box hide it behind
your iPhone behind objects in your house
it's so small you can take a credit card
out of your wallet and hide it
underneath your credit card so we've
been jamming out with this thing all
week with TV and the things we've been
coming up with are inspiring to say the
least

have to go to the store and buy triple

gig if you want when I charge this thing

lock in an unlock pyro from your wrist

fireballs you want to get rid of it for
the time being it's never been faster or
easier to remove pyro throw it in your

increase signal range we've added an
antenna that actually plugs into the
remote which gives you upwards of 30
feet of range you can be in your bedroom

shoot two fireballs the push of one
button at the very same time the perfect

illusionist built into a new phenomenal
device pyro mini
today more people are leading healthier
active lifestyles our kids are playing
more sports more families are hitting
the great outdoors and more of us are
running doing yoga hitting the gym and
engaging in extreme sports the result a
constant battle against odor at home in
the car and on the go what we do to
combat odor is anything but healthy in
fact there's an increasing body of
evidence that we are poisoning ourselves
many of the sprays gels plug and clip on
devices that only mask odor contain
dangerous chemical compounds fed up with
this the creators of remedies went to
work to create a safe effective and
non-toxic solution to everyday odors on
a mission to outsmart smell we needed to
eliminate odor at the source and at
every source we found moisture the
active ingredient in remedies is dual
action it helps to remove the moisture
that often harbors the bacteria and
fungus that produce odor and it captures
the organic compounds that we perceive
as odor watch as remedies and as little
as an hour and a half eliminates the
odor harboring moisture remedies active
ingredient is non-toxic activated carbon
and lasts up to a year it works great in
shoes boots skates and cleats ailments
gym bags boxing gloves hockey gear
luggage storage bins lockers cars boats
and RVs in your hamper any place around
the home you have odor just place the
remedies and let it go to work smart
safe and amazingly effective remedies
