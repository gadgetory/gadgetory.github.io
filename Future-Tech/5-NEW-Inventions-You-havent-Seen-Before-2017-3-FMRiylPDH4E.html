arrives right before our eyes moments
when our idea of what is considered
modern and stylish even our ideas of
what is possible in terms of performance
and technology are completely
transformed it is in these moments that
the world as we know it is forever
change
this could very well be one of those
times today we introduce you the future
of modern speakers kalium sound hero
our cutting-edge Bluetooth speaker takes
the form of a futuristic polygonal
humanoid for the last two years we've
been working from every conceivable
detail with the most qualified experts
in design and sound engineering it was
our mission to create a true
representative of the hype of modern
technology integrated into what is no
doubt a show-stopping speaker but the
striking design of this piece is just
the prologue of the story you'll be
blown away what's inside sound hero is
packed with next-generation features
such as
and wireless charging dock charging
adaptors for those who haven't yet made
the leap to wireless a Wi-Fi range
extender right a battery life in LS up
to eight hours when all the features are
being used forty-eight hours on standby
top-quality tweeters and subwoofers for
crystal-clear highs and a-growling low
range
ten color options in either math or
metallic to sizes
suitable for any kind of setup pair
multiple sound heroes's home cinema or
desktop speakers remote controlled
ambient light and an awesome smoke
dispenser kalium sound hero can
mesmerize the entire room as as angular
features reflect over 16 million colors
emitted by the RGB LED lights in its
dock
so back our project today and take a
trip into the future with kalium sound
heroes

for the last year we set out to create
an electric skateboard with an authentic
long boarding experience I'm pleased to
introduce the juice board from the shape
and flex of the deck to oversized 83
millimeter wheels the juice board offers
a buttery smooth ride while taking on
pebbles and cracks as if they weren't
even there we've designed the juice
board to be easy for beginners to learn
and powerful enough for the seasoned
rider with the remote in your hand you
can access four unique speed modes with
each mode the top speed acceleration and
braking power are adjusted allowing you
to start off easy and adapt your board
as you're riding progresses doing away
with the traditional belt drive system
we've sealed our motor right inside the
wheel making it highly dust and water
resistant this also means there are no
belts to replace and if you're on a
battery you can freewheel just like a
regular longboard the juice board is now
in production we'll be shipping early
summer stoked about this project by June
come along for the ride and bring you
juice boards to the street
