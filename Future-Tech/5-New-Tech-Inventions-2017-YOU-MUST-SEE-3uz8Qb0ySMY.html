Wi-Fi
Luna steps up in seconds and instantly
works with your existing Wi-Fi simply

DisplayPort install the Luna app and

no antennas no waiting and no hassles we
developed Luna because we knew there was
a better solution than relying on
software to turn an iPad into a second
display software apps literally hack
your graphics card delivering a glitchy
and unreliable picture they trick your
Mac into thinking and displays attached
when in fact they get no benefit of
graphics acceleration or metal GPU
support
so unlike software apps Luna harnesses
the raw power of your graphics card
giving you the full benefit of its
graphics acceleration delivering
stunning second monitor
that's 100% wire free in addition to
acting as a second display Luna also
acts as a complete extension to your Mac
allowing you to use it directly from
your iPad with full support using
external keyboards Apple pencil and
Apple touch interactions it literally
allows you to turn your MacBook or iMac
into a touchable device designed and
developed by the creators of astro pad

animation studios and product design
firms across the globe Luna carries the
same quality and performance that's been
delivered to their tens of thousands of
customers and for those of you who are
artists you can pair Luna and Astro pad
