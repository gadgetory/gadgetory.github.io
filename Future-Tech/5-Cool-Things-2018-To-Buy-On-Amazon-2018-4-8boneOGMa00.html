Sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big their apps are
confusing they take too long to connect
when they're hassle to install I'm
pretty handy Sesame's different you can
install it in seconds literally no one's
screwing no replacing Sesame has a
patented design that fits any latch
anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this or like
this Sesame senses when my phone is
nearby and gets ready for my special nun
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries it with no
keys it's easy to let other people in to
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption
no one's hacking this thing Open Sesame
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it easy a DJI we
created the flying camera as you know it
and there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small so you can dream big we created
your first personal drone but we're
still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoids obstacles and comes packed with a
4k stabilized camera 27 minute flight
time and a whole lot more this is the
DJI Navajo and this is the DJI Mavic
flow unfolding to make it this small we
have to rip out a ton of cool stuff
right now it's got 24 high-performance
computing cores dual satellite
connectivity and all new transmission
system with a 4.3 mile range for vision
sensors and more sound complicated it's
not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is capturing
when you take off the Mavic uses 2
vision sensors and connects with up to
20 satellites also it can remember your
location
this means the Mavic knows where home is
so it can return by itself precision
landing technology means it can land
almost exactly where you took off at the
touch of a button as you fly satellite
systems keep track of you working in
harmony with all four vision sensors
telling it what's below and what's in
front
whether you are flying beside a cliff in
a forest or even indoors just like you
maduk see and thinks that means it can
avoid the things in its path from trees
to walls any good flying camera needs
stabilization the maddox expertly
miniaturized gimbal teach the entire
camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization you use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and traits or
use tap fly to tap and flock
Terrain follow mode keeps the Mavic at a
height you defying as the ground Rises
so you can focus on your shot not your
height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad sized controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly using virtual
joysticks right from your phone over
Wi-Fi whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
track modes are ready to make you shoot
like a pro want to be on camera not
behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJI goggle
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode to get your pulse pumping while you
fly at an incredible 40 miles per hour
once you've got your shots edit
everything together in DJI go and share
or even stream your flight live to
Facebook or YouTube inspiration can
strike from the smallest thing a sketch
a feeling and experience the Mavic has
been designed for you to take it
anywhere ready at a moment's notice
whenever inspiration strikes you to
create something truly great
DJI Mavic wherever you go
you
in 2014 mass fidelity came to you with
an idea and we weren't sure how the
market would accept it the response was
overwhelming we had an incredible amount
of pre-orders to date we've delivered
thousands of units to every corner of
the earth and they've been met with
amazing reviews from the most
prestigious media outlets to mass
fidelity the IndieGoGo community has
been a paramount importance we would
have never been able to bring the core
to life without your support because of
that we want to reward you and thank you
by bringing you our next offering first
introducing the rad mass Fidelity's
latest addition to our high fidelity
speaker lineup at mass fidelity we
continue to look for new ways to develop
exciting technologies so you can
experience high fidelity sound wherever
you go acoustics are very tricky so we
developed the rad to stand up and
provide incredible acoustic performance
in even the most demanding environments
the radial sound field technology
developed for the rad presents an
engaging sound field in any environment
using an array of for wide range speaker
drivers and one subwoofer we've
engineered a solution that will bring
you incredibly loud clear and enveloping
stereo sound whether you're indoors or
outdoors the focus of the rad was not on
bells and whistles it was about creating
an amazing product that would stand up
in real-life situations it's rugged it's
weatherproof it's built to last the
feedback from our core campaign told us
that there was a demand for people that
wanted something even simpler they want
high quality sound they want rugged
construction and they want it to be
portable they want to be able to bring
this experience with them anywhere
that's what the rad delivers the rad
includes mass Fidelity's proprietary
networking technology this allows you to
stream uncompressed music to any room in
your house without the need for Wi-Fi
because it leverages the same network as
the core you can simply and easily
extend your collection to include the
road since portability was key with the
rad we wanted to optimize the experience
for mobile devices NFC allows for
wireless pairing Bluetooth allows you to
enjoy all of the music apps exactly how
you've always enjoyed them analog input
has been optimized for these devices and
USB can be used for charging we are so
excited to bring you the ride with your
ongoing support we'll be able to
continue to deliver award-winning high
performance audio products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
