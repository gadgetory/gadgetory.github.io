dollar computer connect over composite
VGA or HDMI chip does computer things
save your documents to chips on-board
storage surf the web over a Wi-Fi play
games with a Bluetooth controller but
wait there's more this is pocket chip it
makes chip portable tape chip put it in
the pocket chip and you can use chip
anywhere you might have noticed chip
looks a little different than every
other computer because we built chit to
fit into your projects and we're so
excited to see what you can do with a
nine dollar computer Kickstarter we need
your help to make chip for nine dollars
we need to buy components and extremely
large quantities help us make the nine
dollar computer a reality and back chip
on Kickstarter today thanks
hello Kickstarter we are onion as makers
we use development boards to build all
sorts of cool stuff but most development
boards on the market fell short of our
expectations they're bulky confusing the
set up and over complicated we usually
spend far more time reading the
documentation than actually using them
to build things today we're changing
that say hello to the omega to the
world's simplest development work the
omega 2 is tiny at less than a quarter
of the size of your credit card it can
easily fit into any project but don't be
fooled by its size the omega 2 is
powerful it is a full linux computer
that's right this tiny purple thing runs
the same operating system that power
some of the world's most mission
critical infrastructure the omega 2
works out of the box it comes with
built-in Wi-Fi and onboard storage so it
comes to life the moment you power it on
the omega 2 is familiar you control it
with apps just like your regular
computer we even have an app store so
you can discover apps created by the
community the omega 2 is easy to program
in fact you don't even have to write any
code it supports node-red a graphical
tool that you can use to create programs
by simple drag-and-drop
but if you are into writing code the
omega 2 supports many programming
languages pick one you're already
familiar with and start building the
omega 2 is cloud connected so we can
remote controller securely from anywhere
in the world the omega 2 is expandable
we have created many plug-and-play
expansions so adding new features to
your project will look something like
this the omega 2 is affordable starting
at only five dollars yep five it is
cheaper than this Frappuccino we want to
lower the barrier to entry so everyone
can join the maker me so you see
Kickstarter the problem is that the
tools for building amazing things are
just not accessible for everyone and
that is why we're working so hard to
make the omega 2 really easy to use but
we need your help to make it affordable
as well so please pack our campaign and
tell all your friends we can't wait to
see what amazing things you'll come up
with thank you
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical her meek
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
once try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olie said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shiz told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted 2 years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen meet shiz unbelievably magical
invention power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns you're embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane Pat's power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plate in the front there
is an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any micro USB cable
abshire and his career as a pilot planes
should be building or flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup three are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool power up threes smart shape
is programmed to optimize user happiness
you don't need a PhD in aeronautics to
be able to fly it the prototype is fully
functional and the super ultra magical
power up 3 is ready for production this
is where SH I need your magic beans if
you help shy get to 1400 backers you'll
help him bring the joy of flight to
everyone and obtain the privilege to
look down on regular paper planes for
the rest of your life so back power up 3
and help make the magical magical herb
let's
about something that every one of us
does but then most of us don't do as
well as we should sleep we spend a third
of our lives doing it each day is
dependent on it but we still neglect it
knowing how you slept is good but it's
not enough you need to begin to
understand why you slept a certain way
while you sleep at night you have no
idea what is happening nobody's even
thinking about the most important room
of our lives and how it impacts us the
bedroom hello we want to change that
sense is a simple system the tracks your
sleep monitors the environment of your
bedroom and reinvent clr sense watches
for noise light temperature particulates
in the air and more prove the sleep pill
your movements at night tells you how
soundly you're sleeping if you're
disturbed with through a.m. should be
able to see if it was your partner
snoring or a car alarm that went off we
all have a natural sleep cycle but a
normal alarm will wake you up regardless
of when's best for you with census smart
alarm it knows how to wake you up at the
right time so you don't start the day
feeling terrible if you want to be up by
nine thirty four you already half awake
in 9 15 then your alarm should know to
go off then not wait for you to fall
deeper into sleep here at hello we've
been heads down for quite a while now
building we're a team of designers
engineers and operations experts who
collectively have built products and
services that millions of people around
the world use in love
making world-class hardware and software
on their own as part doing these things
in concert together obviously becomes
even more complex that's why we've
assembled a team of the best people to
do just that with the rise of wearables
you've seen that people clearly care
about this sleep but to us it felt so
natural to be worrying about putting
something on charging it remembering to
press buttons we believe that technology
needs to disappear it didn't make sense
to us that we've been told to put
something on just as we get into bed
everything of sense is designed to fade
away you should simply be able to just
sleep when designing sense we didn't
want to create something that looked
like just another piece of technology
that's easy to do it's much harder to
design a device that feels at home
sitting beside your bed every day it
should look like an object that you'd be
happy to have their almost regardless of
its purpose for something so natural
asleep we wanted to design something
that felt organic the spherical form and
nest like structure helped to keep
things both simple and strong to get to
where we are today we've iterated
literally hundreds of times by being
able to 3d print and laser cut our way
out of almost anything we've settled on
a design that's beautiful and one that
also functions perfectly with all the
sensors we have inside fitting so much
insight such a small space is pretty
hard when you look at what goes inside
sense engineering everything to fit is a
challenge but it's fun it's like a
beautiful puzzle fitting together
perfectly to become strong sturdy and to
protect everything inside objects
shouldn't just be designed to look good
they should be designed to last that's
what building things for people is about
but sense in the sleep pill we wanted
things to stand the test of real life
and we've made sure we did just that
sleep is important to the chair rod so
we didn't want to make this product
hidden in silence and without your help
you want the Kickstarter community to
help us in shape up we're building as we
voted with your support we can together
help you better understand themselves
and the world around them we're so
excited to put sense and get it to you
your smartphone has your whole life on
it it's your point of connection to the
people in the world around you it's also
an incredibly powerful computer the
speed and power of our smartphones
rarely holds us back for the small
screens and limited interface often do
that's why we created the Superbook a
simple plug-and-play device that turns
your android smartphone into a beautiful
laptop computer just connect your phone
to the Superbook using a USB cable the
Superbook provides the keyboard
multi-touch trackpad and display in your
smartphone brings the computing power
along with your files and apps and of
course the Superbook can use your
smartphones data Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connectivity the Superbook has over
eight hours of battery life and it even
charges your smartphone it works with
all modern Android devices and its
future proof when you get a new
smartphone it'll still work with your
Super Bowl it's like getting a brand new
laptop every time you upgrade starting
at just $99 the Superbook is a fraction
of the cost of a traditional laptop and
is even more convenient hi I'm Andrew
co-founder of enduro miam makers of the
Superbook I was frustrated with having
such a powerful smartphone but with an
interface designed purely for mobile use
our goal the Superbook is to eliminate
the restrictions that hold smartphones
back the software side of the Superbook
is andro miam an app that makes android
function like a familiar desktop
operating system you get a mouse cursor
keyboard shortcuts desktop class
browsing and easy file management
everything is intuitive and optimized
for productivity there's no custom
firmware to install and no technical
knowledge needed simply download the app
from the Play Store and connect to your
Superbook you can use one of our native
apps or any of the millions of Android
apps in the Play Store we're also
introducing an open SDK to enable
developers to add and Romeo optimization
to the apps we've already released a
beta version of and Romeo into play
store where it's received hundreds of
thousands of downloads and extremely
positive reviews we've been developing
the Superbook and entro miam for over a
year and we're excited to finally
release them our prototypes are complete
and we're ready to move into full
production we're looking for your
support to help us make this new kind of
computing a reality the Superbook is
just the beginning and we're excited for
you to be a part of it thanks for your
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
