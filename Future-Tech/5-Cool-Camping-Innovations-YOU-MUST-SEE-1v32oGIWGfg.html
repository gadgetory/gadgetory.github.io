less that's one of the main reasons we
designed the chameleon backpack the most
versatile backpack in the world a more
evolved more advanced form we all want
more time in the great outdoors and
every minute you spend packing and
prepping for a day trip is less time to
enjoy the trail so we combined the
everyday use and function of a day pack
with the convenience and comfort of an
ultralight chair we thought what if the
same backpack that used to carry your
load could help you take a load off far
more than a backpack to chair
transformation it's everything else
about the chameleon that makes it so
versatile let's start with design one
thing nobody likes about typical packs
is having to dig through your gear to
get to what you need with the chameleon
you don't have to dig at a glance you'll
notice the unique zipper arrangement
this is our pentas zip technology and
allows for easy access to the top middle
and bottom of the pack so you can get to
exactly what you need another
game-changer is the chameleons -
included patent-pending switch bags
these feel the entire volume of the pack
interior for maximum storage and
organization these bags will hold all of
the gear when you switch from backpack
to chair but also accessible from the
top for easy loading when housed inside
the pack but feature two full-length
double zippers on either side allowing
accessibility from any angle even for
lounging in your chair the chameleon
works great as a rucksack if you decide
to leave the chair frame and the switch
bags at home or pre pack your switch
bags for certain adventures then simply
snap in the ones you need and you're
ready to go when you arrive at your site
just snap them off with your gear inside
and store them in your tent and keep the
chair by the fire but you can also
connect the switch bags together forming
a drawstring backpack for some light
exploring for family adventures it's
nice to have extra switch bags for the
kids to help fall some of the gear it's
also a good way to free up more space in
the chameleon for other essentials for
less primitive adventures it makes a
great travel pack it meets the FAA
standards and is the perfect size for
carry-on luggage we made sure to include
water bladder and laptop storage spaces
along with the
sidecut folder and we designed the pack
with Molly used in military and tactical
bags so you can attach your desired
items and increase your capacity to suit
your needs the lashing buckles work
great to carry larger items like fishing
poles tents compound bows and more
there's not a pack on the planet that
does what our pack does no backpack
gives you this much adaptability like
the chameleon does at trail form we
break away from the well-trodden path
and we forge new trails others will
follow by backing our project you'll
help form a more advanced backpack for a
more enhanced outdoor experience we're
just scratching the surface and we can't
wait to show you what's next
what is this band behind me I hear you
ask well it is the very special 5th
generation t van by track trailer but
what about this van is special well
first and foremost you've got a
redesigned rear hatch opens quick and
easy like the back of a car so that you
can get in and out of the band in a
matter of seconds and of course this
awning it'll set up in 30 seconds 60
seconds if you're taking your time this
is a complete new designed by track
trailer built specifically for this van
for all you tea van aficionados one of
the things you might notice is that the
rehab is a lot wider than previous
generations and this has been achieved
by substantially reducing that rear
bulkhead that had the stereo system in
it instead they've opted for a Bluetooth
system and poor old Lloyd Walgren the
marketing manager of track trailer I've
dragged him halfway around Victoria to
help me test this man you go tell us a
little bit more about it so the team at
Mach 5 now comes with the redesigned 10
we've spent a lot of time listening to
customer feedback and that feedback told
us that we needed adjustable straps and
quicker and easier and make anything to
attach them both inside the Hat and to
the deck so we responded by making all
of our points of attachment magnetized
and they're all adjustable as well so
you click it straight in and do up the
adjuster and suddenly no matter what the
terrain is you can make the tent if you
neatly to the base of the vent this van
is fitted with 1.8 ton suspension the
benefit of the 1.8 ton suspension as if
you are looking to carry all the gear
and then some for your friends and
family
the t van is now capable of doing that
there are over 250 individual sheetmetal
changes when you combine that with the
new fiberglass roof panel a new deck at
the rear and refined storage at the
front effectively the Tevan is
completely different
track trail has been building the team
and now for almost 20 years and you know
if you were to compare those very early
models to this one here you have to say
the changes are so much more than
skin-deep
over the years everything's changed new
decks new tent new power system in
kitchen big question though does this
fit generation unit live up to that
reputation of the bulletproof TV what do
you think
hi I'm Jackie the inventor of the real
wheel or as we like to affectionately
call it the wheel
our family loves outdoor fun we'd love
to take our kids to the beach and
camping and on other outdoor adventures
but hauling the cooler and the towels in
the beach toys can really be a hassle
I've looked for carts that could help
with this situation but none of them
could really move stuff on sand or rough
terrain I couldn't find what I was
looking for so I decided to build it
the wheel lets you carry more make fewer
trips and travel deeper and farther off
the road than ever before the wheel is a
truly rugged all-terrain cart that can
haul up to 200 pounds of anything
anywhere we've engineered the wheel to
have a super wide large diameter
non-slip tire that lets it ride on top
of sand and rocks without sinking in and
getting stuck we also designed the wheel
with a debris resistant rolling feature
to avoid any jamming from rocks or sand
the wheel also maximizes storage so you
can carry everything you need in one
trip heavier gear gets stored inside the
wheel where it stays stationary while
you're in motion simply pack your gear
in our custom bag which doubles as a
cooler and can fit up to 48 cans or your
beach toys or your camping gear once you
pack the bag simply slide it inside the
wheel and attach it to the quick turn
snaps to hold your gear in place not
only can you store gear inside the wheel
but we have additional storage for
lighter weight gear on the built in
tabletop which will carry almost
anything folding chairs are easily
slipped over the handles
other gears placed on a tabletop and
secured by attaching bungee cords to are
built in attachment points once you get
to where you're going it's time to relax
it wheel has a built-in table where you
can mix drinks prepare food and keep it
all out of the sand and dirt the wheel
even has built-in drink holders so you
can avoid drinks spilling on the ground
the built-in kickstand ZAR height
adjustable and quickly transform the
cart into a stable table when you're
ready for your journey simply fold the
handles with the release of a quick pen
and load the wheel into your trunk
pack the custom bag and store it inside
the wheel for transport the wheel makes
outdoor fun easier we've already built
numerous prototypes finalize our design
and lined up domestic and international
manufacturers but now that our design is
finalized we need to raise the capital
to pay for expensive tooling to
manufacture our parts and buy components
at volume prices with your help we can
get the wheel into production and you
can be one of the first people to have a
wheel that gets you farther from the
road for richer outdoor experience
if you've ever inflated a large object
like a camping pad you know what a huge
pain it is they take forever to inflate
you have to put your mouth on a vowel
that's been all over the ground and
they're even a pain to deflate so to
demonstrate what I mean
first I'm gonna blow into this bag with
a conventional valve so as you'll see
even after two breaths of air the bank
what the conventional valve was hardly
inflated now compared to that to the bag
with the wind catcher which is a single
breath of air I was able to inflate this
entire back thanks to a phenomenon known
as entrainment each time you blow into
the wind catcher a ton of the
surrounding air is also stuffed in
greatly amplifying your every breath as
a result an object is large this camping
pad can easily be inflated in seconds
without using any power or comp and this
is all done without the valve cover
touching your mouth designed to be super
convenient the wind catcher air pad too
can be deflated and packed up in seconds
and the valves ability to double as a
carrying case means you'll never
misplace or fumble with a clumsy stuff
sack again
but the possibility to inflate in
seconds and impact up in seconds plus
the own new ability to quickly transform
into a sieve thanks to its built-in
straps and snaps we think the air pad 2
plus will be just what you need for any
situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
