cables introducing the Zeus charging
cable the world's first Kevlar cable
with a lifetime guarantee
when assessed for durability the premium
charging brand Belkin bent upwards of
10,000 times while the Zeus cable bent
over 15,000 times without a problem as
tested by renowned German test lab hook
what makes you so strong its Kevlar the
stuff that NASA used to assist
curiosity's descent on Mars while
fighting against the onslaught of 65,000
pounds of force
so the Zeus cable won't break from being
crushed or tossed around we've also
designed the Zeus cables to have a
unique 90 degree plug so they're adept
at fitting in tight spaces we're so
confident in the strength of our Zeus
cable that we guarantee it for life get
the last cable you'll ever need the Zeus
Kevlar cable by Nanda

aah
hi I'm Katherine I love riding my bike
and I do it every day but I really hate
having to think about how to carry all
my stuff around I wouldn't accept the
next fine flexibility of my open bike
basket with the storage and security of
a car truck so I teamed up with the
designers and engineers of guts and
glory and tomorrow labs to create the
buco suit the first bike mounted storage
system to address the needs of the urban
biker that is as functional as it is
beautiful we design the blue kaput to be
able to carry large thing when its open
and smaller things when closed knowing
that we want us to be able to leave
things inside the boot when we left our
bike we designed a unique locking
mechanism that runs through the entire
boot securely locking both lives in
place it also attaches to any standard
bike rack from the inside so it can't be
removed without first unlocking and
opening the lid we wanted to keep our
things dry in the rain so we created a
sealed lid and we molded the bottom of
the boot out of a strong plastic to
withstand wear and tear instead of
worrying about the things you have to
carry with you what if you could focus
on what really matters like more
adventures more pics more late nights
and sunrises more beers with friends
more fun and more freedom with your
health we can free you from your stuff
and make it easier for you to ride your
bike every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
