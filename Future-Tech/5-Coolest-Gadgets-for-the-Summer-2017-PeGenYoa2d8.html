and we have launched several projects
with the help of Kickstarter backers one
web pack look like if you can pack your
stuff in a second we'll find you gears
just that easy out in spend countless
time for design and debris
finally we got the idea to redefine your
carry Styles welcome the frat pack just
pack and unpack in a second
Fred pack can be prompt to pack and
unpack with as separate pockets to
organize everything is clear to see no
more rush to find your staffs I can
become your bitch pad press pad and
pickney pad crown to go with simple day
you
gears are well-organized in the inner
pocket
with red this to prevent from coating
outside
we're back is freeway assess you can put
in and reach your gears immediately
everywhere and anytime
for sure what a resistance to protect
your gears another cool feature is pouch
there with pouch there you are no longer
to mix everything with your running
shoes sweaty clauses of Brussels
prep pad can also become a nice pyro
when camping on traveling
traffic provides backpack messenger
shoulder and handbag styles to mean your
lifestyle and different situation Rat
Pack is beautiful thoughtful and totally
wonderful for adventurous travelers and
everyone we will ensure the best quality
functionality and durability at releve
we love what we do and we are proud to
be independent company
the fret pack can also be your blessed
company no malfunction no main.c no ugly
styles
EcoPlus river is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy outputs of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you're good power to iPhones to
iPads to MacBooks
a mini-fridge a lantern a drone battery
a mobile Wi-Fi unit and stereo speakers
all at the same time without limiting
the output on any port with the storage
capacity of 416 watt hours rever gives
you more power than almost any battery
of its time you can jam on your electric
guitar for 20 hours straight or you can
watch a 10 hour marathon of your
favorite TV show by campfire
rivers battery can be recharged in three
different ways a standard outlet or a
car charger can replenish the battery to
full capacity in just eight hours with
eco flows portable solar panels River
can be recharged with absolutely zero
carbon emissions in just 12 hours the
real-time display allows you to monitor
the battery's current output power
remaining capacity and charge time being
a documentary filmmaker a lot of my
shoots happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights can never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River
