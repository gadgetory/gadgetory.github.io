building a better future we create tools
for global citizens of tomorrow we make
awesome stuff at the intersection of
fashion technology
hey I'm Adrian the Canadian in September
2015 I met an incredible girl just two
months later we were sitting in a cafe
in Barcelona and her bag was stolen
right from between our chairs inside of
her bag with her laptop passport iPhone
all of her valuables since it was my
idea to be in Barcelona in the first
place I felt really guilty so I set out
to impress her by making bag that would
never be stolen again a couple of months
later on a tiny budget with the help of
friends designers and models I launched
a life back on Kickstarter we raised six
hundred and thirteen thousand dollars
from three thousand seven hundred and
five backers I quickly had to assemble
an awesome team of people to help
fulfill all of these orders to date
we've shipped over 15,000 life facts to
people all over the world and from these
customers we had some great feedback on
what kind of products I'd like to see in
our new collection both bags include our
nukes deliver drop proof laptop storage
secret and secure pockets for your
passport credit cards or travel cards
and our patented locking system that
allows the bag to be locked to something
and lock shut instead of being worried
about someone taking your stuff this
gives you peace of mind and allows you
to focus on what support in the backpack
specifically there's really cool
features like this priority pocket for
your everyday essentials
there's magnetic closures they can get
super fast to close the bag and not
worry about it following me there's an
easy access USB port powered by the
solar band so you can charge your phone
on the super organized storage pockets
on the inside and test them hardware to
double through the bottle over on the
shoulder bag there's quick access
directly to the ports in the solar bank
there's a nice big pocket for your
cables so they don't get tangled up with
everybody special pocket for your
glasses or sunglasses soft plush handles
easy strap so you can mount it onto your
suitcase special hook for your keys and
of course a bottle opener
we have obsessed over every element of
these bags and we're so confident of the
quality that we're giving them a
five-year guarantee and a
no-questions-asked 30-day money-back
guarantees for all of our backers from
Kickstarter its 2017 life's got busy
working remotely is up over 500 percent
since the 90s and this year alone were
up from 39 percent to 43 percent of
people working remotely at least once a
week we're living in an age of
unprecedented freedom we can work
anywhere we are on top of this the
average person uses their phone between
75 and 150 times per day no matter what
you try to do your phone is always dying
both of these bags include our brand new
solar bank this is a two-in-one power
bank with a built-in solar panel these
are the most efficient compact solar
panels available in the entire world in
just four hours of Sun it'll generate
enough power for a full charge of a
smart phone and if you live in a place
that doesn't get that much Sun all year
round I'm from Vancouver Canada the
solar bank can even generate some power
on a cloudy day and you can even charge
the solar bank by plugging it into a
wall with micro USB or USB see these
bags in this technology are ready for
mass production and we're here on
Kickstarter to give you an exclusive
discount on the product before it hits
the market we're giving you a slice of
the future at a fraction of the price
please back this project today share
with your friends share it with your
family share with your coworkers we
really appreciate your support
meet the edge the world's best desk for
productivity we work from everywhere on
small mobile devices but our desks still
haven't evolved their big cluttered and
uncomfortable until now the edge desk
system is your solution to the way we
work today it's the world's first
integrated desk and chair set that
combines the comfort and focused posture
of a kneeling chair with the versatility
of an adjustable desk surface
it sets up anywhere in less than 10
seconds and folds down to less than 6
inches to allow for easy storage in an
office corner or studio apartment it's
designed to be a single piece right out
of the box and adjusts in five different
ways to fit all body shapes and sizes
sitting at the edge will put you right
into productivity mode improving your
posture and keeping you focused I worked
myself so a lot of the times I'll be
going to coffee shops your coloring
spaces
simply because my desk at home is a
little messy and cluttered I tend to sit
slouched over on a regular desk and with
this I feel like my posture is amazing
as an artist this is kind of a game
changer you know it's an easel it could
be a table and it's totally portable so
I could take it apart - mark came to us
with the coolest idea and a really tough
challenge we needed to create something
as comfortable as a kneeling chair that
would take up less space and a standard
desk and chair it's very important to
keep the desktop clear so we created
this edge all the way around the desk to
hold all the accessories I'm Mark
creator of the edge I see people working
everywhere I go
libraries coffee shops my daughter and
her friends work anywhere they can on
campus because their room is so small
people are uncomfortable and they can't
focus
we knew there had to be a better way
we've tested us with hundreds of people
to make a comfortable productive and
versatile it's amazing to see people's
response the first time they soon
now we want to bring the age to your
studio dorm room home or office over the
past 25 years our team has been lucky
enough to bring to market hundreds of
your favorite products you've changed
how you're working and now we're
changing how we work if you value
productivity comfort and mobility we
hope you'll join us on the edge

hi I'm Alex and I'm evil together we
created the clicks mount not just an
amount
stylish and smart mount we are drivers
and SWAT food users with a tired wasting
time using both mounts mount that were
constructed to make our life easier so
we design the combination of a magnetic
phone holder and a clever and adoptive
software we have spent years perfecting
clicks to save time and make your entire
experience more comfortable safer
supporters today don't let other car
mounts interrupt your flow this was me
every time I went out to the beach with
my family we can all relate having to
carry a mountain of items across the
sand that was one of the situations that
got me thinking of a multi-purpose
carrier to help make our lives a little
bit easier that is why I invented the
ear over the ear over is a lightweight
transformable adaptable carrier designed
to replace all those job specific
carriers that have saturated the market
today
I designed the ear over to consolidate
all your carriers into one package with
just a few simple and intuitive
adjustments the ear over simply and
quickly transforms from one form
into another and another
and another
with a sophisticated design to fit your
lifestyle and thoughtful engineering
that provides strength and durability
the e Rover is built to look good be
versatile and work hard stand it up in
any closet or slide it underneath your
bed light enough to pick up and pack in
the trunk of your car
I created the earth Rover so it can
assist you and I in everyday life
adventure
now you can load your cooler tackle box
and fishing rods all in the ear over
making the walk to the pier easier and
stress-free so you can focus on the
things that really matter for the
weekend warriors you'll likely find
yourselves buying supplies and materials
for your home projects getting those
bulky items from your truck into your
house condo or apartment is always a
burden at least it used to be
and since our family enjoys having
picnics and bike rides
now we can load and go with the ear over
so no time is wasted we make less trips
and have more fun we have been working
for more than two years developing ear
over and getting it ready for production
our engineers have worked tirelessly to
bring this unique and functional product
to life
help us take it over to the next level
by contributing to our campaign and we
will do our part in making sure you have
an ear over of your own thank you for
your support
