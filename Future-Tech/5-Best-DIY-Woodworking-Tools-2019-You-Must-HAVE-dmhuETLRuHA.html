if you've ever installed drawer slides
you know it can be a challenge you have

have rocklers new Universal drawer slide
jig designed to work with most of all

slides the jig holds the slide securely
and makes it easy for you to position it
perfectly for quick accurate
installations and it features an
indexing rod that makes repeated
installations a snap
like all great jigs it's easy to use
just separate the two parts of the slide
and put the cabinet track in the jig as
it will be installed in the cabinet an
integral stop guarantees the right set
back from the front of the cabinet and
the innovative locking wedge grips the
slide securely so you don't have to
worry about it shifting or tipping
beveled edges on the jigs wings line up
at the bottom of the slide for easy
positioning at the cabinet and there's a
scale in case you need to offset the
mounting height the jig positions the
slides square to the front of the
cabinet and level from front to back
flat areas on the body make it easy to
clamp it to the cabinet if you want to
free up both hands to drive the mounting
screws after installing a couple of
screws you can release the locking wedge
remove the jig and drive all the
remaining mounting screws as directed in
the slide instructions if you need to
install multiple slides at the same
height this jig will save you a lot of
time and the hassle of measuring at each
location
it features an indexing rod that lets
you register the slide off of a
reference surface on the cabinet the rod
can be installed from the top or bottom
of the jig depending on the location of
the reference surface when you've got
the slide located precisely slide the
indexing rod until the plastic foot
makes contact and lock it in with the
brass knob at the next installation site
just about the foot of the indexing rod
against the reference surface to
position the jig at the right height
you'll get perfect installations time
after time the indexing rod also works
great when you're mounting center mount
slides on a cross rail so if you want
easy and accurate drawer slide
installations every time you owe it to
yourself to get rocklers Universal

building something for your loved ones
is one of the most rewarding experiences
life has to offer and it's never been
more important to work safer and smarter
at your craft
microjig introduces gripper 3d
push-block
and it's the safest most precise
push-block giving you essential safety
precision and control when feeding work
through a table saw a must-have for any
table saw user it gives you the three
critical forces when cutting on the song
downward pressure to virtually eliminate
kickback and keep the workpiece down on
the tabletop inward pressure to keep the
work against the fence and prevent wood
burned and forward pressure to advance
the cut and control both sides of the
workpiece the gripper is engineered with
a powerful gripping surface that gives
you far greater control and traction and
the saw blade tunnel allows that table
saw blade to pass through keeping your
hands shielded the entire cut and the
adjustable Center leg slides easily to
accommodate a wide range of cutting
dimensions and keeps a solid hold at the
offcut material using the gripper is
simple and safe place the gripper on
your workpiece slide it against the
fence and guide the cut along the fence
and you'll get a safe cut the gripper is
a fully adjustable push block system
engineered to handle the demands of your
workshop and your full range of projects
and it's amazing when it comes to
handling small work pieces the built in
balance support drops down and
stabilizes for narrow work material
keeping your gripper square to the fence
the workpiece gets full contact with the
gripping surface to ensure a smooth
clean and safe cut the precise quarter
inch leg makes the gripper the most
precise pusher in the world
the proprietary green grip is lined
across the length of the leg to make
sure you have a firm grasp over the
smallest pieces of wood allowing you to
cut down to a quarter inch by quarter
inch all the while your hands are
protected with the gripper you have
your own moving blade guard the gripper
is an extremely versatile piece of
woodworking equipment we've also
introduced gripper advanced comes with
two additional precision accessories the
stabilizing plate gives you two hundred
and fifty percent more stabilizing area
and locks the workpiece against the
fence to enhance the versatility of the
gripper it intelligently maintains even
pressure without binding to create safer
and virtually burnfree cuts the
adjustable spacer adds one inch of
additional gripping surface to tackle
larger material and wider cuts they both
work remarkably well on the router table
the gripper holds the workpiece tight
against the router bit while the
stabilizing plate keeps you grounded and
moving smoothly across the table perfect
for freehand routing the adjustable
spacer is reversible and rises up to
give you extra clearance to pass over
the router bit when doing full profile
work like bullnose routing this takes
care of any uneven deep cuts on the back
end of the wood helping you make the
most of every piece no matter what
project you're taking on the gripper
will give you the control you need with
the precision to win over your biggest
fans with the gripper everything is
safer there are over thirty unique
applications substantially more than any
other push block you can use to grippers
for ripping stock longer over 16 inches
to virtually eliminate burning and
protect both hands when working on
bigger projects you can cut a wide range
of material types and sizes and then
recreate your stunning results with
consistency without having to readjust
your fence remembering how to smooth out
those joists when you needed to easily
fix a stubborn door or make two uneven
boards flush now you can do all this and
more with the win electric hand planer
the six amp motor provides up to 34,000
cuts per minute through even the hardest
of woods while most of our competitors
have a maximum depth of 5/64 of an inch
the wind planar exhibits 16 positive
stops in one 128 inch increments to fine
tune your cuts anywhere up to an eighth
of an inch deep the when electric hand
planer also comes with a handy dust
collection bag that can be attached to
either the right or left hand side of
the planer
an adjustment wrench with onboard
storage a kickstand to protect your
blade a rabbiting guide to help measure
the depth of your rabbits and a parallel
fence for making perfectly straight cuts
the base of the plate even has a
v-shaped groove to help make chamfering
the corners of your wood easier than
ever and if you have a dust extractor
you can plug it right in to either side
of your unit to maximize the collection
of sawdust and see your work area clean
remember when you had a reliable planer
that gave you years of quality service
