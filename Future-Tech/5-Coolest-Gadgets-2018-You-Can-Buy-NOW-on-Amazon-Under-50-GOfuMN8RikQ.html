frosting but what's better is sharing it
with someone else and with the same
concept we designed the magics power
donut for you to share the power with a
size so called back to the light that
you can slide in your pocket logics para
donar simultaneously powers of all 5 DC
sockets and 2 USB ports with a fast
charge and the best thing is they won't
conflict with each other
like they always do we solve this
problem with a revolutionary mini design
that allows the box to fit perfectly
next to each other
magic sleek cable stopper
makes it easy for you to adjust the
length of the integrated cork keeping
your charging space neat and organized
John Deacon grew and everyone who asked
her allergic charger for the UK EU or an
au plug type last time we hear you
that's why we designed the magics power
bagel similar to the magic Sparrow
dollar for this time with universal
sockets
when you have so many devices that need
charging it makes some sense to buy five
or six travel chapters when there's only
one wall socket what you want is
something that adapts all your devices
at the same time we have the perfect
solution MAGIX adapter integrated with
magics paralegal or donut and this is
the world's first universal power
extension adapter designed to fit in
your pocket
we complain that there's not enough
electric socket and USB charging station
at the airport in the hotel the reality
is we need power strips while traveling
but we don't bring them reason is simple
power strips on the market are way too
bulky and none of them can keep the long
messy court under control plus they're
enabled adapt to different socket types
my kicks are this winter since we
launched our first product the idea of
logics power donut and Baker which is
thin Universal socket version of donut
is to create something elegant and
powerful with a personal touch and
paying attention to all the small
details we read every one of your
messages so that we can incorporate what
you want in our designs after all logics
is a brand created by you guys as a
small design team we don't have the
luxury to hire PR companies or make
fancy venues our focus has always been
on
every cent we flush to us we use it to
buy components to make the bottles then
we ship to you in rain the shoe
you
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick click wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me like
now oh I'm so sorry I have to take this
but flight can be so much more than just
a shortcut to your phone it could be
integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie
and when I get home I want everything to
just take care of itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team all
right you guys ready yeah one two three
flick hi We're Swedish team that's been
working for almost two years to create
flick and we're really excited to
finally show it to you we've gone
through a hardware incubator in San
Francisco we traveled all across Europe
and China to finalize design and to find
the right partners we have developed a
flake gap to be super simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an ISA software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky we already have some amazing apps
that will work with flick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
flick to the market and into your hands
we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you
for watching hope you enjoyed the video
hello Kickstarter's what if I told you
that there was a delicious savory treat
that you've never had before or maybe
never even heard of what if I told you
that it was probably already in your
refrigerator it's the egg well okay
so I exaggerated a little we've all
enjoyed eggs at some point in our lives
but have you ever tasted or ever even
seen what's known as a golden egg a
golden egg is an egg that was scrambled
inside of its shell and its unique
preparation that has been relatively
unachievable until now introducing the
golden goose we've carefully designed
and engineered a new kitchen tool that
allows you to create golden eggs
yourself
it's the goose that lays golden eggs the
goose features economic handles abrasion
resistant nylon cordage a tough
scrambling chamber a securely locking
ring and a soft egg cradle designed to
fit a variety of egg sizes and shapes
inspired by the motion of Victorian era
children's toy the goose is a low-tech
kitchen appliance designed to take
advantage of what are known as the
typical forces it's been carefully
designed for performance and can
thoroughly mix an egg while protecting
it from breakage the way it works is to
hold eggs safely in its cradle
while the spinning motion evenly mixes
the egg white with the yolk over the
past year we've carefully designed and
developed a goose following a thoughtful
design process we started with loads of
ideas and sketches created different
geometric prototypes 3d prints and
rubber molds building and testing rough
CAD models and performance testing a
variety of materials we tested our
prototypes in a variety of situations as
well and took the best design to
finalise it with sophisticated computer
CAD models we've refined every important
aspect and we prepared the goose for
manufacturing our next step is to
purchase the actual production tooling
and materials we secured competitive
quotes from several manufacturers both
domestically and in Asia we've crossed
our eyes and dotted our T's we finalized
the design and engineering details and
we've had fun inventing new and tasty
dishes now we believe that we've created
an innovative and novel pitching tehsil
that's easy to use fun and a
effective oh and did we mention that
it's easy to assemble that it's food
safe
it's made with recyclable materials and
it's easily disassembled so it doesn't
end up in the landfill and this is where
you come in it just costs too much for
bootstrapping start up 2 foot film we
love the goose and we think you will too
but in order to make things happen we
need your help please help us share the
goose with all the creative cooks and
home chefs and Kickstarter's of the
world
hi I'm Garrett grumpy the creator of the
goose and I'm a product designer with
over 12 years of experience in the
industry I've just completed my first
year of opening up an independent design
and this is why line product designs
first solo project we've invested
everything we could into it and my
talented group of friends and associates
has helped to do skits where we are
today with your generous support we'll
be able to reach the finish line and in
return we want to share some of these
awesome rewards check out the rest of
our Kickstarter page tell your friends
and thanks for watching
oh geez plays senses vibrations in the

with your help mo G's play will be super
affordable and will also offer special
mo G's play plans for educational and
therapeutic organizations with your
support we want to help a new generation
