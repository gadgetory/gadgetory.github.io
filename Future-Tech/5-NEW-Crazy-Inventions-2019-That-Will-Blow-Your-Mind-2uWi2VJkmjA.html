as an audiophile I've tried lots of
headphones but I still couldn't find a
solution because when you wear a
headphone the sound pours directly into
your ears we feel the music echoing
inside our head which is the reason for
the dizziness and discomfort it took
three years to bring our patented
leading algorithm to solve this problem
by creatively implementing a customized
built-in gyroscope we provide a
revolutionary comfortable listening
experience by eliminating the in the
head localization effects
these headphones are gonna change the
way you experience sound entirely please
