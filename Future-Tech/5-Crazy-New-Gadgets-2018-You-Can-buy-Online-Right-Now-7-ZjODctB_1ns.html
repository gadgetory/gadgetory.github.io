technology for a long time now
I mean who hasn't I've tried just about
every smart glass there is and the smart
glass effort has been so unfocused
overpriced impractical and over
complicated I wanted to create something
that is simple useful and affordable
that works with the technology you
already have
I'm Goro Kusaka CEO and founder of view
flying and this this is beautiful with
you fine we want to do something
different we know smart glasses have
some fundamental issues from privacy to
basic functionality and really it seemed
to us that people already had the
functionality they're looking for with
their current technology people don't
need another smartphone on their face we
carry so much technology with us every
day and it's only getting more powerful
why not place that utility somewhere
where you really want it if you find is
a high-definition clip on display that
can connect to anything with HDMI output
your smartphone tablet laptop GoPro
drone and much more we've gone to great
lengths keep you fine as simple as
possible it has one button and two ports
it has no internal operating system
requiring proprietary applications it
can attach to a wide variety of user
glasses using an incredibly stable
magnetic docking station that I was of
you find to be both easily adjustable
and easy to put on and take off and
those are only consumer applications
view finds utility in the workplace is
equally diverse with potential across
countless fields and because view fine
is so streamlined the possibilities for
its use are virtually endless with view
find product value is user generated
because instead of dictating use it
facilitates it but the view fine users
can easily interface with crucial
information will stain handspring use it
as a viewfinder for your GoPro to make
sure you're capturing exactly what you
want to capture use it as convenient at
a glance GPS or a way to watch videos
privately on
crowded train using you fine as a
rearview camera for your motorcycle or
bicycle or simply to display fitness
goals best of all because of its
incredible simplicity view fine is
affordable and will retail for around
149 whether for consumer or business
applications if you find is a low-cost
low-risk opportunity to experience a
wearable display but to take it a step
further to help get it out of the office
into the real world we need your help
and relieved that the wearable
technology that is simple useful and
affordable is the future
and we need your help to get there
thanks for your support
name is Sean O'Meara and I am a business
traveler after 12 years of working in
the advertising industry I've had to fly
a lot from work and like millions of
people out there I can't sleep on planes
travel pillows could help if only they
fit into my small carry-on which they
don't and to be honest I've always
thought they kind of looked ridiculous
like wrapping a life-preserver around
your neck in the age of sleek stylish
accessories
I wondered why travel pillows have yet
to evolve and then one night it hit me I
was suffering through yet another
cross-country red-eye and I realized you
don't eat a doughnut wrap around your
neck to get a little comfort introducing
the bull rest the first travel pillow
designed to meet the needs of a modern
business traveler
it's eighty percent smaller than
traditional travel pillows or about the
size of a pair headphones or ski goggles
for a goal bar except it's much lighter
and less expensive of course basically
it's small enough to fit into any small
carry-on it works by using an ergonomic
design that cradles the back of the head
keeping it from shifting side to side
but without having to wrap around the
entire neck and with memory foam inserts
it doesn't sacrifice comfort over form
it works great with noise cancelling
headphones and is designed to fit both
men and women we created an opening in
the bag not just for structural and
design purposes but it also provides air
flow to the neck keeping it nice and
cool with three unique colors to choose
from there's a style for everyone
and we are proud to announce that the
full arrests will be made right here in
the USA our Seattle based manufacturing
partners will make sure the bull rest
lives up to our high standards we've
even established a distribution
infrastructure so that we can quickly
scale up to meet high demand after a
year of development my team and I are
finally ready to bring the full rest to
market but to make it happen we need
your help your contribution will finance
the first production run of the bull
risk to provide us with an initial sales
inventory we hope you add your support
and help millions of travelers finally
get the rest they deserve do you have
the same problem I do you arrange the
furniture in your home just the way you
like it but you can't move the light
switches so now you need to call an
electrician hey Kevin hey man what's up
I need that light switch changed oh that
one that one
I want a light switch right here so I
won't fall off the bed anymore
and I can turn on the light switch right
now whoa how did you do that I also have
a toddler and I would like to switch
lower so he can reach it and I can turn
on the switch like this you used to
think I need to tear out pieces of the
wall and run additional wires but now
this is no longer necessary you just
need to open the package no setting
replace the existing light switch with
this base switch then you can put the
gecko switch wherever you want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know with the gecko switch controls
here there are many icons to select from
the LED behind the icon lets you know
when the light is on or off makes a
bedroom light gradually brighten to wake
you up or make it to turn off with a
time delay 3 to 1 if you can't find the
gecko switch use the search function and
it will beep oh here it is
mmm do it now switch it up with a gecko
switch and make your home in life
exactly the way you like it
hey did you see my hammer no need for a
hammer Kevin you just need a gecko
switch meet the nomadic travel bag the
most functional travel bag ever don't
think so keep watching
our company was born and raised on
Kickstarter first with the basics wallet
then the basics notebook thanks to our
incredible backers and supporters now
over 100,000 people are enjoying our
products worldwide as our company has
evolved we have changed our name to
nomadic and we are excited to introduce
our most innovative product yet the
nomadic travel bag I want to share a
journey with you but with 20-plus
noteworthy features and more than a year
of development and relentless
prototyping I'm going to have to talk
fast here it goes
first we study the market current travel
bags were good but not great so we said
let's create the most functional travel
bag ever
we met with local industrial designers
and then traveled halfway around the
world to talk with material and bag
manufacturing experts after testing
hundreds of materials reviewing tons of
hardware and learning to drive a
three-wheeled car yep that's me the
first prototype was made and we said
it's not good enough yet many long days
late nights and 20-plus prototypes later
we have finally created the most
functional travel bag ever the nomadic
travel bag let's dive in and see what
makes this bag so functional the bag is
made of strong waterproof tarpaulin
material that will last forever and at
21 by 14 by 9 inches this bag meets
international carry-on standards easily
switch between backpack and duffel bag
and never have dangling straps again we
added a separate compartment to keep
your shoes separated and protected a
similar pocket can be found on the top
of the bag designed to easily store
socks underwear a light jacket and other
items
keep organized or accessible we design
the bag with a full perimeter zipper to
give you the widest opening possible for
optimal packing and easy access to the
interior of the bag once the top and
bottom pockets are packed there is still
plenty of room inside the bag for all
your clothing and toiletries by adding a
laptop and tablet pocket you can now
choose if you want to leave your
briefcase or laptop bag behind to fit
everything in one bag the right side of
the bag also has a full perimeter zipper
with multiple features inside first an
RFID safe pocket designed to be durable
and lined with RFID blocking material to
protect your credit cards passports and
other scannable information second there
is a combination of mesh fleece lined
and zipper pockets to keep your cords
powerbanks earphones and other
miscellaneous items untangled and right
where you want them back to the top of
the bag our easy access pocket on the
top of the bag is also lined with the
soft fleece to protect your everyday
valuables phone glasses etc we've also
added a water bottle pocket lined with
waterproof materials to keep your other
items safe in case it spills moving to
the left side of the bag we added two
top entry pockets perfect size for a
book and other small items in case you
need to pack extra the vacuum bag allows
you to save room and bring even more
last but not least to keep your dirty
clothes organized while traveling we
have included a laundry bag this bag
easily expands and hangs on a doorknob
so that you have somewhere to put your
dirty clothes and when your trip is over
and your laundry bag is full just zip it
up and put it back in your bag to wash
when you get home we have also developed
some travel accessories that fit
perfectly inside and match the bag for
the ideal travel kit however in order to
make the ordering process easier on
Kickstarter these products will become
available right after our campaign

sweat and tears put into this bag we
