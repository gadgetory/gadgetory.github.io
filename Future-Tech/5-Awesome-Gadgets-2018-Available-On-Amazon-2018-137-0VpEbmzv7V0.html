your hands what if you could print a
GoPro video or an Apple live photo what
if you could instantly send your friends
a magical photograph from your surfing
trip or photo from the concert of the
century or what life print you can so
there's basically three major things
that make life in really great the first
is our ability to give you easy access
to all of your special moments by
integrating your social media and video
into our app we seamlessly integrate
with GoPro with Apple live photos with
Instagram Facebook with behind with
Twitter and then we also integrate your
iOS camera role in Android camera right
basically the point is is that we're
giving you super easy access to any
photo or video you might want to print
next what we do is we can add an
augmented reality video experience
embedded into any photo you have this is
called hyper photo which is really cool
it's it's like magic or something and
then we can portably print and share
these hyper photos to anyone in the
world within our network and of course
you can print all of your regular still
photos to the augmented reality piece
just add something extra only if you
really want the third thing that makes
us special is our social network back in
this allows you to share your photos all
over the world now this is actually
something that we're really proud of
because when you take a photo you
probably want to share that moment with
someone not just keep it for yourself
think of us like a physical version of
Instagram I'll also say that when you
send someone a photo they have
permission to accept the print or not
they're not forced to keep printing
photos of your aunt's cats over and over
again and we design life print to be
incredibly high-quality we designed it
with long lasting materials in a
minimalist design language and we've
intentionally made it to be lightweight
and small enough to fit in your pocket
and portability is really key here
because it allows you to
share these moments in person so you can
bring your life print printer to parties
or on camping trips and then share these
moments with your friends and we even
have a sticky back film so you can slap
that on the bottom here skateboard or on
your fridge or whatever you want and for
our GoPro users we've designed a really
special ruggedized case that protects
the printer so you can feel safe when
you take it out with you in the field
and we require no ink toner to print we
have a partnership with zinc which means
you won't ever need to buy ink for this
product it's another great feature so
today we're offering you a better
Richard experience for your photos by
integrating augmented reality we're
giving you a chance to share real photos
with your friends and family and we're
giving you the opportunity to put all
your photos and videos into one place
within our app so you can easily free
them from the prison's of their digital
screens we do this to capture the magic
of holding something real in your hands
so if that sounds like the kind of thing
you're interested in we have all sorts
of amazing pledges for you and be sure
to share a project too because we're
giving away free film when you share
this and tag us on Facebook and Twitter
