experiences with the in case I seven
first thing I noticed was probably the
quality of the screen it's super light
the text is clear and every word is like
crystal sharp it tells the time the date
whether it's a phone case but the screen
functions better than full-blown
e-readers my task lists my reminders
kind of means I don't need to lug my
Kindle around anymore it's like a second
screen for my phone that has like six
days of battery life what's not to love
the in case just works wherever I go
it's anti-glare so I can read at the
beach and at night my eyes don't hurt
being able to save my articles in one
place has surprisingly made my life so
much easy I can even see the expected
time it takes to read each article I can
find on my jet and not I'm gonna take a
stack of folks with me when I go camping
it's not even an e-reader it's the best
probably you know what you call a
so how easy the case was to use
probably what attracted me most I
automatically sync all my ebooks into my
Inca case just by using the Bluetooth in
my phone I like to be prepared
in whatever I do so having my checklist
it's always on right there when I
actually need that it makes a huge
difference in my day I move around a lot
my things take a beating but the in case
is solid it seems to shock-absorber
better than any case I've ever years
there's no scratches there's no dents
there's no cracks and I've probably
dropped it like 100 times hello everyone
