experiences with the in case I seven
first thing I noticed was probably the
quality of the screen it's super light
the text is clear and every word is like
crystal sharp it tells the time the date
whether it's a phone case but the screen
functions better than full-blown
e-readers my task lists my reminders
kind of means I don't need to lug my
Kindle around anymore it's like a second
screen for my phone that has like six
days of battery life what's not to love
the in case just works wherever I go
it's anti-glare so I can read at the
beach and at night my eyes don't hurt
being able to save my articles in one
place has surprisingly made my life so
much easy I can even see the expected
time it takes to read each article I can
find on my jet and not I'm gonna take a
stack of folks with me when I go camping
it's not even an e-reader it's the best
probably you know what you call a
so how easy the case was to use
probably what attracted me most I
automatically sync all my ebooks into my
Inca case just by using the Bluetooth in
my phone I like to be prepared
in whatever I do so having my checklist
it's always on right there when I
actually need that it makes a huge
difference in my day I move around a lot
my things take a beating but the in case
is solid it seems to shock-absorber
better than any case I've ever years
there's no scratches there's no dents
there's no cracks and I've probably
dropped it like 100 times hello everyone
today we are excited to introduce to you
bloom cube light with so many everyday
uses for a small and portable light we
decided to shave off a few features as
well as a few dollars for those not
needing some of loom cubes more advanced
functionalities so with lungi of light

the optical sensor and instead made it

down the top right button if the loon
cube is facing away from you for 2
seconds 1 2
to turn off strobe simply click the top
right button once the rest of bloom cube

cuba with the same powerful 1500 lumen
LED it dials through 10 brightness
settings the highest measuring at 750
Lux at 1 meter
let's turn it off just click the right
button once or hold down the left button
for two seconds it has a built-in
lithium ion battery that's rechargeable
using the micro USB port in the back
which comes with a protective back cap
making a waterproof down to a hundred
feet for 33 meters and it has a quarter
twenty inch thread on the bottom making
it compatible with essentially any
standard mounting system mount them to
your drone to your bike to your tripod

flashlight head to wound cube comm slash

your specific needs you can adjust your
vantage point remotely by panning and
tilting within the app or set up to

points of view providing you with a
convenient set of automatic view
settings for instance point the camera
towards the front door then set it as
your viewpoint and maim it you can
