experimental equipment one for sight and
one for hearing we found that while we
experience the world as many overlapping
signals we can use technology to first
isolate and then amplify the one we want
our first device surplices approach to
the way we see motion achieving a
similar effect to long exposure
photography but for live experience by
detecting an overlaying movement it
allows us to see hidden traces and
patterns in real time it features a
camera and head mounted display and
works by sending captured video to a
computer where it is processed by custom
software and then displayed for the
viewer
our second device lets us hear speech
more selectively
distracting background noise is
neutralized while the speech you want to
focus on is sent directly to your inner
ear so can you hear me now yes good I
can hear you it uses directional
microphones to capture audio input that
passes through the software before being
outputted through speakers and
transducers unlike standard headphones
that have two channels left and right
our device has three the two earpieces
plus a central mouthpiece for speech in
sport post match analysis is often used
as a tool to enhance player's
performance by using idols vision we
could analyze motion life letting the
player or coach visualize performance as
it happens this could also enhance the
action for spectators with the evolution
of our software idols can be applied to
fashion or ballet bringing a whole new
feature to arts in live performance
not only a sight and hearing are most
important senses they are also our least
stable declining earlier in life and
touch taste or smell we see applications
of idols and strengthening signals
weakened by aging and disability being
able to hear more selectively which have
benefits for children and ADHD by
helping them to concentrate in busy or
distracting environments we are
surrounded by technology it's entering
our homes and helping us automate daily
tasks but I find myself thinking there
has to be a more natural and accessible
way to control the devices around us if
the goal of automation is to simplify
our lives why does it feel so
complicated our goal as a company is to
solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then to find all the
things you'd like Nike to do Nike can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
put one in your living room or the
kitchen
or even your bedroom I mean imagine
rolling over in the morning
and tapping a simple pattern anywhere on
your nightstand to snooze your alarm and
start the coffee maker without even
opening your eyes
you just bought 10 more minutes in bed
and you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
than bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but even
if you're new to the smart technology
world you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
which tech fix our patent-pending
technology uses non acoustic sensors
it's able to distinguish deliberate tap
or knock patterns from random vibrations
in the environment the beauty of our
product is that it makes any regular
environment into a user interface think
about the surfaces around you so many of
them serve one or two purposes add an AA
key to them and you instantly have a hub
for automation we carefully chose every
material and finish for naki we've gone
through a series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that no key
blends in in your environment and also
looks beautiful on your surfaces we're
doing our first production runs here in
the USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of naki
are you a light sleeper night owl or
frequent traveler are you just working
too darn hard to get enough rest sleep
masks are a great way to instantly
upgrade your sleep but most are
uncomfortable or don't fully block out
the light so as industrial designers
with over 10 years of experience we
created something better the Manta sleep
mask the key is in the adjustable
eyepieces simply lift adjust secure and
you have a personalized fit that's
comfortable with 100% blackout the
hollow eye contours prevent pressure on
your eyes which encourage REM sleep the
type of sleep that makes you feel well
rested we also did sweat the details
adding anti slip gel for better grip
integrating elastic stretch bands for
comfort and using micro velcro that
won't stick to your hair so whether
you're embarking on the most epic and
memorable adventure of this season and
need to catch a bit of sleep whenever
and wherever you can or you just need to
recharge yourself with a 30 minute power
nap in the middle of a busy day or maybe
you just want to sleep in on a lazy
Sunday morning and have breakfast in bed
with the one you love Manta sleep mask
will be there for you
