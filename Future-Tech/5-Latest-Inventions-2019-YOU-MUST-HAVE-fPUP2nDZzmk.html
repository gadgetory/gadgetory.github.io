never miss another of
introducing smart world's first modular
translator that speaks 37 languages in
real time in share mode split the device
and share it to your friend the main
unit and the pot will get paired
automatically to you smart is simple
press the button and talk then release
it when you finish
click the pod back and get charging from
the main unit smart supports 37
languages you can use smart with Wi-Fi
or plug in the SIM card to get global
roaming to over 100 countries or share
the hotspot to any of your smart devices
so you'll never lose the Internet smart
also supports talking in groups with
multiple languages yeah I 100% agree
with you jebadiah joven yes
[Laughter]
this is smart Bacchus on Kickstarter to
help building a world without language
barriers you're looking into the eyes of
a robot and he's looking back at you
he's curious about who you are and what
you're up to
this is vector this is a video about
vector Heasley new creation from Hongki
he is a character a robot that is meant
to live in your home he's always on he's
alive the idea is really that vector
becomes part of the family or that home
both on the emotional character side but
then also on the utility side vector is
really the first robot that uses
advanced deep neural networks to do a
lot of perception and understanding of
the world around him what he does feels
intentional he can react to inputs in
his environment in his life we generally
want to find one defining feature and
then build from that
for vector curiosity was a big one what
they're saying is you officially live in
a time when robot sidekicks are a real
thing it's a step closer to that sci-fi
robot you know that everyone wants to be
friends with that step closer means
you've got a robot in your house waiting
for you to get home
autonomous like a Mars rover aware
enough to avoid Falls like a tightrope
walker and always excited to welcome you
home like a loyal companion vectors no
slouch roommate either he's happiest
when he's helping out ask him the
weather and then he'll show you he can
set a timer and cause a commotion when
it's finished
activate robot alarm
and he can connect his robot brain to
the internet to answer your questions
he's a little robot who brings a lot to
your house he's also a little robot with
nearly 700 parts that one right there
that's his sole part okay I made that
one up but the little guy's got soul
let's get someone in here to tell him
what all this stuff actually does how
does he hear vector has a microphone
array which allows it to hear voices and
noises and understand where it came from
what's he used to see vectored uses a
wide-angle camera
why doesn't he fall off the table for
crop sensors how come he doesn't bump
into stuff has this laser disc sensor
right here in the front whoa
robot lasers how do we know he won't use
that for evil we have a very strict
quality control process to make sure
that no evil robotic overlords emerge
from from vector this thing is just
awesome there's got to be a huge amount
of code inside the robot there is a huge
amount of code inside the robots a few
million lines of code at this point that
software really encompasses everything
from the character to the low-level
operating system to the cloud
functionality he has a camera in his
face and that's actually one of his
primary sensors not just capturing the
light in all the pixels but it's making
sense of those pixels he knows what it
is and where the stuff is that code
creates his intelligence and his
personality we think both about the IQ
and the intelligence as well as the EQ
and the emotion you feel something for
him you bond with him relate with him
care about him and you feel that he can
relate to you and give you something
back he is your friend he was built to
help and delight and entertain you that
is delightful and entertaining so
instead of sitting back and waiting for
the robot apocalypse on key is making
super-smart robots built to bring joy
and companionship to humans did I
mention he likes to be pet
vector is a really big milestone for
robotics because for the first time ever
there will be hundreds of thousands of
people living with a robot in their
homes and that has never happened before
vector is ready to live in your house or
at least he will be after the snap sweet
robot dreams buddy
