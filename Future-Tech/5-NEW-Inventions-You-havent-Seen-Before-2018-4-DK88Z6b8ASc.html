really hard to share photos and videos
with everyone involved someone has an
iPhone someone doesn't someone is on
Facebook someone isn't so it was really
hard to find a common place where all
our families could share photos and
videos with the ally or you're just one
tap away from seeing them on the biggest
screen of your home which is your TV
Halle means home or house in Hawaiian so
it's a connected device for the home to
help family members share their lives
together you can see memories
immediately as they come or it can
easily scroll through thousands of
photos whether they're from yesterday
last week last month or last year we've
been working on the Hallie or for over a
year
iterating on both the hardware and
software the user interface is built
from the ground up specifically for the
orc it is designed to handle hundreds or
even thousands of images easily
we've been meticulously tuning not only
the way the orb looks but the way it
feels in your hand well the initial
design started as just kind of an orb
split in half but I thought that it was
still lacking some bit of personality
and so one of my favorite parts about
the design that we eventually arrived at
was having this tilt to it where instead
of being just sort of ambiguously
relating to the environment all around
it really kind of presented itself to
you and invited interaction with it as a
designer my goal with any project would
be to change the experience of the
actual users we wanted to help family
members connect with each other and
that's why we created the halyard
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
ovo one key for all do you feel tied up
with a bunch of big keys all day your
car opens four doors so why do you need
all of these to open everything else ovo
is a revolutionary breakthrough you can
change the combination to give it
maximum reusability it has all the
applications of a typical one-to-one
lock but with greater flexibility
the ovo pair lock has six main features
easy-to-manage it has all the
applications you're used to with the
standard key
new tenant same lock
for anyone renting or sharing their
space the hassle of changing locks is
gone
multi-layer management one incredible
feature is that any communal space you
can imagine can now be accessed by
multiple people by having some digits of
their past codes in common
this leaves room for individuality in
each key for areas that aren't shared
lost key be your own locksmith if a key
is lost there's no longer a need to call
a locksmith or replace existing locks
you can easily find a new ovo key
secur plus if you want security beyond
the standard four-digit combination each
order will include a custom cylinder
that's unique to your parallel this
digit wheel upgrade will make any pass
code exponentially harder to guess
remotely unlocking the parallel perhaps
the most convenient feature is the
ability to share your key with friends
allowing access is simply a text or
phone call away pass codes can easily be
reset if sharing temporarily
now we need your help the cylinders and
various lock applications are fully
developed for production and marketing
we need you to be part of our team

hassle-free at acid I call clean job hi
everyone I'm Avril over the past year me
and my partner John have been working
hard to bring you ding a beautiful
simple smart doorbell for your home the
idea is a simple one when you press the
doorbell button you hear a chime in your
home like a normal doorbell but you also
receive a call to your smartphone
allowing you to talk with the person at
the front door from wherever you are in
the world
whether you rent your flat out on Airbnb
you're out of earshot in the garden or
even on holiday you carry your doorbell
wherever you go is right there in your
pocket you'll never miss your door again
currently doorbells are unloved and
forgotten objects they don't work with
how we lead our busy lives that we
control through our smartphones we want
to fix this for you you've controlled
into our smartphone app this allows you
to set the kind of time you have look at
caller history and even set some quiet
time when you don't want to wake up the
household
we've worked for over a decade in the
design and technology industries and
design is really important to us we
don't want to make just another plastic
box it sits in the corner of your room
we want to make ding something really
special that complements your home
rather than distracting from it I did
spend a lot of time trying to find the
right finish in color for ding whether
it was for the chime which had to feel
really belong inside the home so we made
it really friendly and warm using the
fabric for example doorbells haven't
really changed in 50 years it's about
moving a kind of doorbell from something
that you're only able to interact with
when you're in the home to actually
something that you can use from anywhere
we've had some great support in
developing Deen from both the UK Design
Council and from John Lewis a leading
department store in the UK from a John
Lewis perspective it's the perfect
product you know we are really excited
about new innovation coming our way and
given the kind of the big boom that
we're seeing around smart home we think
this place perfect it's that trend
we believe ding will change the way
people think about smiles making it more
about the home and less about the tech
inside with our manufacturing partners
were almost ready for production so if
you want to be one of the first to own
ding
check out our page below there's several
rewards for you to choose from including
ordering your very own ding we hope
you're all as excited about ding as we
are and we're looking forward to bring
it to you very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
