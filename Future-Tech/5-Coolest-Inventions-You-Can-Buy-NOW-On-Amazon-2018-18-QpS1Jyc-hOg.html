founders of pehla pehla at some point
we've all felt uncomfortable due to the
hot weather
even if room is equipped with air
conditioner the cooling engine often
can't cope and of course each of us
wants to set the temperature comfortable
for himself we discussed this and came
up with the idea of creating a
personalized solution we created evil
polar the world's first portable air
conditioner designed for personal use it
can be used to enjoy a cool and moist
air exactly where you need it you're
poor which here is cooling effect same
where air is coordination by water
deprivation

your body

clean principal allies one used in
conventional air conditioners that can
easily give you a cold as the major
element in making ever polymer we use
the specially developed high tech
evaporative material it consists of
minor on nano fibers although it has a
simple look the inner structure is
complex
this material allowed us to take a fresh
look on a conventional air conditioner
and exclude anything that makes him
bulky it was also very important for us
to develop a material that is not only
safe to use but absolutely eco-friendly
the polar was made to naturally fees
interior design business office at home
or any other place you needed think of
your personal comfort here finally you
can get to read or things that are
cluttering up your space and control
climate around you by yourself
ever polar is very easy to use all you
need to do is to fill the removable
water tank select the desired power and
relax as if they'll cool within a short
time it is noiseless a doesn't vibrate

really important in today's world

and invisible things over the last year

idea to the finished product and now we
need your help to succeed in the next

Oh
hi I'm Jack Nam Davis we're two brothers
from Austin Texas who are passionate
about hydration
as athletes we've often needed to track
our water consumption but solving that
problem led us to a more important
question how much water should we be
drinking drinking too much or too little
can be dangerous and the reality is that
everyone's optimal level of hydration
depends on a bunch of different factors
that are unique to you your workout
schedule age gender location your sweat
rate and even the weather are all key to
the equation in the past only elite
athletes had access to the tools needed
to dial an optimal hydration that is
until now
introducing Trago the world's first
connected smart water bottle
the Tago cap fits on any standard
widemouth water bottle and connects to
an app on your smartphone using
Bluetooth Low Energy
it runs on a commonly found replaceable
battery because the last thing you need
is another device to charge it uses
patent-pending
ultrasonic technology to measure how
much you drink with the Trago cap you
know exactly how much you should be
drinking each day more than that the app
automatically builds an adjust your
profile by seamlessly connecting to
other wearable devices so there's no
extra work for you imagine recording a
long workout on another app or device
and then immediately understanding how
to hydrate for proper recovery or using
the app to note just how much water to
drink leading up to a marathon or
football games the Tri go cap also
allows you to monitor teams groups and
multiple bottles coaches and trainers
can keep an eye on all their players
because proper hydration happens long
before the game starts with our
experienced team we've already solved
most of the challenges and bringing the
Tri go cap to reality we're ready to
take our product into manufacturing but
we need your help please spread the word
and help us support our mission and
changing the way people think about
hydration

breathe well I do and now I can't
imagine not knowing truth is your indoor

outdoors impacting allergies asthma
eczema sleep and much more fortunately I

toxins in your air and you'd be
personalized recommendations to help you
