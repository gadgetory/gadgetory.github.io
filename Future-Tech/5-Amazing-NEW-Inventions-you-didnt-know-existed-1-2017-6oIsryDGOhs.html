you straight I never leave my home
without capital off all of my gadgets so
I knew the bag to fit them all in and
keep them safe and organized not just
regular backpack for girl I bet I could
find one so I started this adventure to
create one that will fit all my needs
and be cool say gizmo an advanced more
functional and aesthetically pleasing
way of carrying things under a man's arm
the gizmos slim and versatile design
smartly merges tech where and
contemporary urban fashion promoting a
new trend in wearing tech devices among
men
we have to organize the spacing button
irrationally so we ended up with a
highly optimized back in which the
direction and the size of the
compartments depend on the size its
corresponding device and these are
catalyst to smartphones keys wallet
power stick pencil and a pad of paper
fergie book it's the meat and easily
accessible at all times lots of effort
to try to solve tangled cables and
charging so we place hidden passages
between the compartments which allows
you to charge your tablet where's the
power 6 or connect your phone with
headphones and still look cool so
caccamo wireless go trouble us another
important challenge was to create the
bag thats a slim even read sport also
because the bag is care
one shoulder we optimize the proportions
and the ways of the object so that the
back doesn't move around uncontrolled
erections Peggy's mo is the new solution
to wearing a bag for all your gizmos
under your arm no matter what you wear
over a shirt under or over a jacket or
perhaps a business suit you won't even
need to take it off wear it while you're
driving a car riding a bike or a quick
meeting over a coffee big is mo truly a
bag of tricks
please share and support our story to
anyone you think might appreciate it it
was mean world cause with your support
this bag is pretty much in the bag I'm
Mike and I'm Brandon and we're the
co-founders of pedestal Footwear we're
in a mission to get athletes out of the
crutch of traditional footwear and into
their pedestals their shoes for
everything basketball tennis and even
bowling but what about the training
space ask any strength coach physical
therapist or trainer and they'll tell
you you should be spending more time out
of your shoes this is especially true in
an environment where it's not going to
rain or snow I'm sure you want an
expert's opinion though so here's Tony
gentle core one of the top strand
coaches in the world to explain more
I've been using pedestal Footwear
recommending it with all my clients and
athletes for over a year now we don't
wear gloves on our hands every day so
why would we want to wear shoes when we
train there's an understandable concern
when it comes to postal Footwear and
that is what happens if you drop a
dumbbell or plate under your foot
outside of that very small risk of that
even happening I don't really feel like
wearing a shoe is going to cause that
much more protection there's a really
good marriage between what the research
says and what we see on the performance
side of things so whether you're looking
for improved performance in the weight
room how we feel with with overall back
health and joint health postal footwear
I'll help you get there all athletes are
looking for a competitive advantage and
we know we can provide that rewind to
2014 when Mike and I started to consult
with some of the top strength coaches in
the world some of the best people out
there for human performance and some
athletes as well we created the one
point 0 with all their ideas or feedback
everything in mind 2016 was a big year
for us we're featured in bodybuilding
com stacked calm and we won 2016 men's
health gear award we understand the feet
of the most neglected part of the
training regimen yet the most crucial to
performance and mitigating injury the
new 2 point 0 design includes our
proprietary blend of abrasion resistant
with
that we call ped tax feature it in both
the 4 foot and the heel these are the
areas that typically wear the fastest
soft to the skin but tough on the
outside ped tex gives you the protection
to train on various surfaces using a
combination of pressure mapping data and
we're testing we developed ideal
geometrical pattern on the bottom patent
pending the triangular grip is the most
effective at creating traction and
delivering explosiveness across all
three movement planes since there's more
concentrated sweat glands on the feet
than any other part of the body we use
the breathable knit completely lined
with silver naturally antibacterial your
Footwear will dry quickly and Bo during
bacteria free forever pedestals are no
brainer when you consider their third of
the price of the irregular gym sneaker
