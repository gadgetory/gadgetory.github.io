seven years old
birthday first jungle venture meditation
exploration alone
get out of your ordinary life be who you
are for a change
easy or hard you only live once to feel
the real vibe of the universe your best
self will be discovered in a new vision
unleashes capture it and remember it
while at Rome is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size the small size of it but it flew
longer than just about any other topper
you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution and we'll deliver
one right to your pocket
imagine a day in a local park and
getting a whole new perspective from the
palm of your hand that you're suing to
incredible heights of the waves and
float out of a hot-air balloon
sharing the breathtaking riddles
this is my cruiser when we began on
micro drone our aim was to create a
small size personal drone that was
affordable durable easy to fly that
works straight out of the box a drone
for everyone whether you fly micro drone
in extreme conditions like on a windy
beach or in delicate ones like inside
your home with its precision control
flexibility and durability you can fly
it anywhere no matter your age or flying
experience there's no other drone like
it
we're doing really innovative stuff we
don't cut corners rearing it for the
long run we launched the first edition
micro drone in 2011 and the feedback was
incredible we redesigned the second
edition around the modular architecture
and support a unique range of plug and
play modules it received rave reviews in
the technical journals online blogs and
even TV shows these little drones that
are like hey they're awesome man have
you seen the micro drone two point yeah
that's probably my favorite one it's
incredibly nimble perfect if you're
filming extreme sports
it is very rugged and if anything did
break it's modular design means it's
easy to replace any parts now after two
years we're ready to make micro drone
3.0 micro drone 3.0 is designed with
drone enthusiasts and excellent
engineers from around the world
components are easily expandable
upgradable and replaceable it's also the
smallest drone to currently carry on a
Canon
the HD camera streams live footage to
your smart phone the battery slide in
and out for quick hot swapping and the
plug and play smart modules simply snap
on with magnets since everything either
snaps or slides in the structure is
sleek aerodynamic and beautiful so now
it's possible using a 3d printer
technology like the old tea maker 2 you
can print out your own custom frame
similar to the dragon or the wasp I was
super excited when the when the micro
drone team reached out and wanted to
make a first person view drone
technology using the DODOcase VR viewers
very few people could use first-person
view
drone technology even a year ago I mean
the fact that the micro drones team is
making this technology available is
really a revolutionary idea we want to
make the quintessential drone the drone
market is evolving and together we can
drive the technology forward we need
your support so no matter who you are
we're making sure that whoever opens a
box
finds a simple reliable affordable
durable and plundering
thank you and we look forward to making
with you the next the one and only micro
Joan

experience and capture the moment at the
same time when you need to unleash your
camera and let it fly

flying camera that doubles as a nine
millimeter thin phone case it is with
you at all times ready to capture and
share the perfect shot you can only
dream up cell flight takes off and
hovers autonomously operated in
real-time through your phone to catch

slim design thanks to the unique motor
folding mechanism so we can easily fit
comfortably in your pocket so why is
your point of view from a new exciting
angle
hey are you so ready yeah alright let's
do this
Wow
I've always believed it's best to show
your child where to look
but never tell them what to see
because children are natural-born
explorers mother nature is their
favorite teacher puddles are seen as
opportunities not obstacles
challenges are to be readily accepted
and not fear
their greatest adventure is always what
lies ahead see that awesome and now she
can see more than ever before
with a hangs ghost drone 2.0 it's super
easy to take anywhere the controls mimic
the movement of our smartphone
and she thinks that's pretty cool
and the VR goggles give us both a whole
new perspective to share in the
experience
elevate your view of the world but the
hangs ghost drone 2.0 the first vr drone
fully controlled by your phone welcome
to the next level
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
