every journey has a story worth telling
when we bring our cameras with us we
have a vision for how we can capture
moments that we never want to forget
that's why we built in our box a rugged
compact device that's designed to make
the creative process easier for anyone
with the camera no matter where you are
you can edit 4k videos and raw photos
without having to bring a laptop using
our box is simple all you have to do is
plug in your memory card connect to the
NAR box Wi-Fi network and open our app
within seconds you can trim your clips
stitch them together into a highlight
reel perfectly synced music all in full
resolution and it also packs a powerful
quad-core processor GPU and ram so your
phone can tackle videos just like your
laptop does at the end of the day all of
your shots are backed up organized and
ready to sync to the cloud your desktop
or your favorite editing programs no
matter what your adventure is how you
choose to capture it or what story you
want to tell NAR box is here to support
the way you create
Nabby lets you look forward while
staying connected with your maps your
calls your messages and your music all
projected directly in front of you so
that you'll never miss a turn again or
the information that matters most to you
there was a lot of opportunity to make
the driving experience better to really
blend to the phone into the driving
experience in a way that feels natural
and is easier and is more productive and
and is also safer at the same time what
makes navigate so special the people who
work here is that everybody is unique
individual we have DJs we have computer
science people we have people who do
parades on the weekend we have all walks
of life and that's really important to
develop naffy because everyone uses Navi
and so we couldn't just have one person
here developing a product that's made
for everyone there are a lot of things I
love about Navi but one of my favorite
things is doing wacky Wednesday's like
today we're going to the beach just
really important to step away from our
work and get to know each other on a
personal level that way we can all
succeed together I think the thing that
makes navdy unique is that it's really
the first product that takes your
dashboard and your nav system and your
stereo and your phone and it puts it all
in one place like right in front of you
while you're driving so for me as a
designer it's a great opportunity
because you get to sort of solve all
these problems and combine all of this
stuff into like a simple easy-to-use
thing that everyone can use in their car
yeah I think in the end when the
consumer pulls a Navi out of the box I
think we created a pretty elegant
solution
you know we fit in 95% of cars a short
person tall person tall - short - in the
end it's pretty simple based on how how
complicated a design situation we were
faced with
when we created the mounting system for
navigated it to feel like it was a
natural part of the vehicle so once
you've put it in the car you didn't feel
like it was x-rated is something that
had been built in so now we've decided
to really replace all of the things that
you see in the car with what's on the
display but at the same time we
constantly try and adapt to show you
only the information you need at that
point in time so the UI isn't cluttered
and hard to interpret especially when
you need to look down quickly and make a
fast decision we have a multimodal input
system right you can use gestures you
can use a steering wheel dial you can
use your voice depending what you're
doing so we figured out that we wanted
to reserve them for the really important
interactions these things that were sort
of really temporal like in the incoming
call for example so it feels natural it
makes it easy and you can do it whenever
people that I work with are some of the
most passionate innovative thoughtful
people that I've ever met making a
product that is radically changing the
way people drive and interact with their
phones in the car
certainly navi makes sense for a person
like me who has a life where i have to
balance a whole bunch of things i have
to drive around have to take my kids
around and then i also have to keep my
mind on work and make sure that i'm
staying on top of what's going on at the
office we all love navdy we use it all
the time so i think the most important
part of it is that we're all working on
something we love every trip I take I
use it I notice when it's not there it's
weird if it's not in a car that I'm
driving
and I think that really is a testament
to you work harder on something you
really care about and you care more on
something you use all the time it has
been a very long journey at nab D and
I'm incredibly proud of what we've
accomplished together as a team and the
products that we've been able to bring
to market but in many ways we're really
just getting started
