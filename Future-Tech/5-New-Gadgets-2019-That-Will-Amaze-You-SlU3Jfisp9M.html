best use of my time Smart Watch helps me
to keep tracking but no one on the
market suits both my style and need I
found the answer after visiting celerity
unique inspired by the beauty of the
lake we came up with an idea of the
perfect SmartWatch we call it the
transparent levitated display all
information is displayed at the glass
and disappears completely when not in
use
that's why Memex is the most beautiful
integration of traditional and smart
watches notifications will be shown on
the glass turning the whole watch face
into a display
mimicks is powered by an integrated
widget of step motor that's why we can
streamline the watch by removing the
entire watch crown mimicks also has all
the features you would expect from a
modern SmartWatch for example a heart
rate monitor that helps you to keep
track of your fitness the dual time zone
function where another time is shown
with the display and automatically syncs
with your phone
mimicks case is forged to surgical grade
stainless steel cut with diamond blades
for maximum precision
we also offer a wide selection of straps
from hand pick natural leather to
durable TPU materials they can be
switched to suit any occasion
now you get more in me
you
introducing pack your luggage companion
pack lets you use any luggage you want
pack as much or as little as you need
and never have to worry about anything
ever again pack works by filling all the
remaining space in the bag
creating a tight fit and providing
cushioning to everything inside it the
tight fit that pack creates holds your
stuff together and protects them against
any bumps or swings so when you open
your bag again in the hotel room it will
be exactly the way you packed it no
dirty clothes no spills and no broken
lenses pack can be folded to as small as
a rolled t-shirt and fits nicely in your
bag when not needed because everybody
knows that return trip packing is much
more difficult right pack can be used on
any type of bag you own from large
luggage to duffle bag and Bank tank we
even use pack in our motorcycle case
trust me
tank has got you covered but wait
there's more pack will notify you once
your check-in luggage arrives so the
next time you check in your luggage
there's no need to crowd around the
conveyor belt waiting anymore now that
is convenient be a part of pack and
enjoy worryfree packing help us bring
back to life a share alike a mention is
truly appreciated pack the revolution in
travel packing
