run out of it
either because we choose to enjoy nature
away from the grid or in disaster
scenarios the grid chooses to get away
from us
that's why we've designed this the
callee pack a portable solar energy kit
that meets dozens of off-grid energy
needs nature trails photography trips
all-day picnics disaster scenarios and
electricity shutdowns daily use in areas
with unstable electricity supply the
callee pack is completely autonomous and
can fully charge from either the Sun a
car or a wall charger it's 38 a.h
battery is powerful enough to charge
your iphone up to 120 times and powerful
enough to provide energy for our entire
set for a whole day including a fridge
until we ran out of beer you can even
add a rain cover to keep the power going
in case of rain in a Bluetooth app for
easy management when designing the
callee pack our team focused on
developing a seamless off-grid user
experience with an all-inclusive kit an
optional daisy chain solar panel for
double charging power a cool app and
storage for your devices and accessories
the callee pack is a must for every
off-grid scenario fully portable it
provides you with natural free energy
wherever and whenever
so may the power be with you when you
need it hi I'm andreas peernock and I'm
here at our labs at the National Design
Centre in Singapore to tell you about
Korea pop a really cool 3d pen that we
are working on we came up with the idea
of using light-sensitive ink that is
solidified by shining ultraviolet light
on it in the industry this is called
photo polymers with Korea pop you get a
3d pen without any hot parts without any
melting plastic and without any bad
smell with Korea pop cooling pops up
magically people just love to create
things we see this all the time with
artists and with designers we also see
it with kids who love coloring books
Lego and play-doh Korea pop is the
perfect tool for anyone who wants to
create their own designs in different
shapes and different colors I could have
just imagined my daughter for hours
messing with this I think it's cool and
that's gonna bring drawing to a whole
new level well you can make a drawing in
3d you can make customized float clothes
for your doll you can make jewelry
they're the possibilities are endless we
have been following the space of
personal fabrication for quite some time
and the evolution has really been
amazing
just think about what has happened with
3d printers and 3d pants however there
are a couple of problems specifically
when you look at 3d pants all of the
pens out there melt plastic to
dangerously hot temperatures just think
about what would happen if someone gets
melting plastic onto their skin or into
their eyes it would be really bad in
addition you get a quite unpleasant
smell when you use pants that melt
plastic it's simply not nice in a home
environment
that's how we started thinking wouldn't
it be possible to do things in a
different way
couldn't we make a 3d pen without hot
plastic and without a bad smell with
Korea pop you can use some really cool
ink we have inked in many different
colors so you can create multi color
designs we have ink that is elastic so
you can make a dress for a Barbie doll
there is magnetic ink that you can use
for making fridge or whiteboard magnets
we have aimed that glows in the dark if
you want to make objects that radiate
light in a dark room you can use our
aromatic ink to make items that smell
good for your car or fill your bathroom
we have got ink that changes color with
temperature so you can for example paint
a teacup and see how it changes color
when you pour in hot water and since
Korea pop is using cooling we have
gotten body paint ink to make tattoos
and henna designs
I think it's freaking cool my little
daughter would just love it I think
great pops extremely novel idea it's
something I haven't seen before
we started working on Korea pop last
year and this is what a first prototype
looked like and this is what Korea pop
looks like today as you can see we've
gotten rid of the cord and we made
improvements to the design over the next
few months we'll make further
improvements to the design and to the
functionality until Korea pop is ready
to be shipped we have come quite far
already and now we need your help to
make Korea pop reality if you think
Korea pop is cool please pledge on
IndieGoGo so that we can do this
together thank you hi there this is
janae Ringelmann I am one of the
founders of IndieGoGo and I'm really
excited to be here with cRIO pop they're
launching their IndieGoGo campaign soon
to bring their really cool innovative 3d
pen to the market and what they're doing
is they're using IndieGoGo to reach out
to the world to the people who want to
see this come to life and get them
involved in bringing this innovation out
and so it's really exciting to be here
to meet the team and see this innovation
come to life
