about
so what's special about it yeah
everything look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music going so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
wine in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place it on the back of a
window and you'll hear sound through
both sides bigger the surface you're
placing it on as well the bigger the
sound you're going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
gonna take home and put on the side and
think it sounds great you've got to show
people so the other feature we've got
that's inside there as well that I
think's really quite neat so if you're
in a space like this you could place two
speakers either side you've got the
stereo sound coming out of it makes it
amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly
