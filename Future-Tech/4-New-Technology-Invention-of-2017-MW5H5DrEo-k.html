exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place it on the back of a
window and you'll hear sound through
both sides bigger the surface you're
placing it on as well the bigger the
sound you're going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
gonna take home and put on the side and
think it sounds great you've got to show

that's inside there as well that I

speakers either side you've got the
stereo sound coming out of it makes it
amazing
