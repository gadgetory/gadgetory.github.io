best outdoor oven four years ago you
helped only revolutionize outdoor
cooking by supporting the launch of the
world's first portable food fight over
since then we've given tens of thousands
of people the opportunity to cook and

incredible versatility but still be the
most affordable event of this size I
wanted to invent something that looked
amazing that was transportable so you
can enjoy outdoor cooking anywhere and
avoid the time and effort of a storm 80
the way only pro works is very simple
it's good fire like our other models it
takes the direct heat of the flames and
the heat stored in the stone baking pork
this way you get a well-cooked top as
well as a beautiful aggressive base the
precise and multi-fuel capabilities make
it very special just like our previous
models it burns wood pellets but with
the pro you can also use regular wood
charcoal and it can even run on gas by
adding a specially designed burner which
means you're ready to go at a flick of a
switch Pro can reach temperatures of
nine hundred and thirty-two degrees
fahrenheit in just 15 minutes only pro
has twice the cooking surface of our
previous models so you can cook until
lishus 16-inch neapolitan-style pizza in
just 90 seconds you can cook just about
anything meat fish vegetables deserts
and take the perfect bread it's tasty

outdoor oven
I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
of hickory mesquite alder and cherry mmm
the juiciness you get from a slow cook
now I just use my Z grills wood pellet
grill I can smoke grill fake brains
roast and BBQ all in one I have to say
it's my new secret weapon z grills
automatically moves wood pellets into
the electric burner at a consistent rate
for even heating the fire never touches
the food keeping it from unwanted
charring after plugging Z grills in just
tells e grills whether you like to smoke
or cook providing that great wood flavor
with the ease and convenience of a gas
grill using a gas grill you just don't
get that natural wood flavor and aroma
charcoal grills are just too messy it's
difficult to control when you start or
stop cooking after my prep it straight
into the Z grills you smoke and cook all
in one place besides the convenience of
smoking and grilling at the turn of a
dial I can also make this delicious
wood-fired pizza Z girls digital
temperature control makes it easy for me
to step away for the more important well
more fun things now that you know all of
my grilling secrets get one for yourself
at an amazing price get yourself easy
grills a lead night
so the number one problem people have
with cooking is knowing what temperature
their cookware is that when you turn
your stove up to 8 you have no idea
whether that means 300 degrees or 500
degrees and I can tell you that means
the difference between under cooking a
pork chop and burning it on contact
where others see challenge you see
possibility or others see a meal you see
