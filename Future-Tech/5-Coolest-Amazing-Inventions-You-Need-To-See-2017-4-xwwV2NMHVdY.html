I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
of Hickory mesquite alder and cherry mmm
the juiciness you get from a slow cooker
now I just use my Z grills wood pellet
grill I can smoke grill bake brains
roast and barbecue all in one I have to
say it's my new secret weapon Z grills
automatically moves wood pellets into
the electric burner at a consistent rate
for even heating the fire never touches
the food keeping it from unwanted
charring after plugging Z grills in just
tell Z grills whether you like to smoke
or cook providing that great wood flavor
with the ease and convenience of a gas
grill using a gas grill you just don't
get that natural wood flavor and aroma
and charcoal grills are just too messy
it's difficult to control when you start
or stop cooking after my prep it
straight into the Z grills you smoke and
cook all in one place
besides the convenience of smoking and
grilling at the turn of a dial I can
also make this delicious wood fired
pizza z grouse digital temperature
control makes it easy for me to step
away for the more important well more
fun things now that you know all of my
grilling secrets get one for yourself at
an amazing price
get yourself a big grills elite night
so the number one problem people have
with cooking is knowing what temperature
their cookware is that when you turn
your stove up to eight you have no idea
whether that means 300 degrees or 500
degrees and I can tell you that means
the difference between under cooking a
pork chop and burning it on contact

possibility where others see a meal you
see a personal masterpiece cooking is
