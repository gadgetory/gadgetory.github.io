smart-home devices have made our lives
more comfortable but comfort comes at a
price in fact last year alone there was
a 45 percent rise in cyber attacks on
smart homes and in April 2016 a cyber
attack was carried out that brought the
Internet to its knees how do they do it
through smart home devices
this is Akita the smartest watchdog for
your smartphone why do you need it
because of this yep
you're a very new excellent home
security camera that you purchased after
a lot of research it's a great camera
unfortunately it's connected to the
Internet which means it can be hacked
and once the camera is hacked you're not
going to be the only one looking through
it and it's not just your camera every
IOT device in your smart home can be
hacked your thermostat can tell the
hackers if someone is in the house and
your friendly smart home hub might be
listening even when you're not asking it
to once those devices are hacked well
your computers a hackers playground and
once they're inside your computer they
can see everything you want to keep
private
that's where Akita comes in Akita
provides the most advanced home
protection and it requires you to do
just one thing nothing
Akita constantly scans and monitors your
home network checking that only devices
with IPS you've allowed to use your home
network are the ones actually using it
and once Akita finds out that one of
your lovely devices has been hacked it
immediately blocks the hack by
extracting at that specific device from
your network it also notifies you
through a notification on the Akita app
then if you want further assistance on
how to handle the hack you'll need to do
just one more thing
press this button it will contact the
Akita team immediately and they'll
answer any question you might have
they're there for you 24/7 Akita is
super smart and it gets even smarter the
more you use it it leverages home
networks and lets them learn from each
other to be even more security with your
home getting smarter so she drew who
protected it support Akita now and get
the smartest home protection possible
that's the way it should be
Apple's mission has always been to
create easy to use products people love
their iPhone however with every new
innovation of the iPhone Apple has
gotten further away from that idea
resulting in one major complaint
navigating is difficult as our phones
have gotten larger we've had to
compromise single-handed use we
shouldn't have to and you the people of
smoke
everyone wants a more convenient way to
navigate their iPhone and just like Katy
we also wish the iPhone had a backlight
introducing the Intel of us by not a
smart screen protector for the iPhone
the Intel plus is the most convenient
way to navigate your if-- helping you
answer messages tweet surf Instagram and
so much more with its built-in smart
button
changing the way you use your iPhone or
any teleplays features to smart buttons
on either side of the hold on signals
from the smart buttons are carried at
the top of your phone yet integrated
circuits so now you'll never have to
struggle to reach those icons at the top
more than just a back button the
intellicus is the ultimate iPhone
accessory
