hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach so as a freelance product designer
I'm traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes
I could bring water with me and when the
bottle was empty it it collapses and
goes away and takes no extra space in my
pack yeah it fits an active lifestyle
weather in the winter when you're skiing
and you can fill up the hideaway in the
lodge or in the summer when you're
backpacking or hiking it collapses in
your backpack and takes no extra space
no one loves buying disposable water
bottles it's it's merely out of
convenience and the Hideaway makes a
reusable bottle more convenient in fact
in some places disposable water bottles
are being banned so we're all gonna move
towards the reusable water bottle model
and that's why I feel like this is kind
of the next generation in hydration this
gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away the hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids in both our
water type I'm really excited to share
the Hideaway bottle with with the world
and Kickstarter is an amazing
opportunity to do that to be able to
show you the backers what this is all
about so please check out the rewards we
need to raise a significant amount of
money to get this into production to get
it on the shelves this year
and just as important please share it
with everyone you know tell them about
this great water bottle The Hideaway
