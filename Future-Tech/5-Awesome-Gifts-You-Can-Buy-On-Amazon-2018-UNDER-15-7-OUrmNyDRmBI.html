they're called hickeys a new lacing
system a new idea fasten ones never tie
again make all your shoes look better
and feel better
core Hague is for everyone they work on
any shoe one mix hick is so special once
in style you can sleep on and off your
shoes you will never have those laces
again the adductor muscles movement
making sneakers on confident they are
easy to use and you can adjust the
tightness no messy walls mega shoes look
fit and perform better piggies lacing
system are the evolution of shoe laces
what started like a cool accessory to
sleep on and off your shoes has evolved
into a hickies 2.0 a smart adaptive
shoes this is hickeys 2.0 same idea but
now more durable more comfortable a more
streamlined design more secure and we
offer two different models adults and
kids
hickies 2.0 allows your shoes small to
every carbon are we wanted everyone to
fill their feet muscles moving in
synchronicity with their shoes how does
it work the fact that he is 2.0 connects
only two eyelets at a time makes it
possible to deliver a targeted to
customized fit the key is to thread
hickeys using our different lacing
techniques if you have a high arch you
can loosen your key keys or tighten them
up if your feet are too narrow or flat
this is the only license systems smart
enough to be truly elaborative
simulating the levels of tension that
you can put on different areas of your
shoe you actually give your muscles a
lot more freedom we destructive the way
that you lace up your shoe completely we
don't just turn your shoes sleep on we
give you the perfect fit
always you may remember our error model
of hickeys that was funded by over 3,000
backers right here on Kickstarter in
2012 since then more than 2 million
people have turned their kicks in to
sleep on zwicky's want to roar
Kickstarter family too and inspire more
people to live a life without laces put
your help
we can change the footwear industry and
make all sneakers look fit and perform
better we can't wait for you to try so
pre-order now and get them in time for
the holidays case
simple it's about overcoming complexity
simple for us means being smarter about
everything we do we wanted to apply that
idea to make us healthier a main
component of being healthy is are you
moving enough so we wanted to ask that
very simple question and answer it with
a simple product so we came up with the
shine the shine is an activity tracker
that's smart
elegant and really strong it's carved
out of a block of solid metal if you
want to be technical about it it's
carved out of aircraft-grade aluminum by
micro laser drills so we built into
lasse
because it's made of solid metal
transmitting wirelessly is almost
impossible but to keep things simple we
developed a new type of wireless sync
technology all you have to do is place
the shine on your smartphone the shine
synchronizes with your phone
communicating with the app which is now
available on the iOS App Store your sync
is complete no wires cables or pairing
simple and I think really cool
after studying how people use their
activity trackers we notice the main use
making sure you reach your daily
activity goal with the shine you check
your progress by tapping the surface the
LED lights display how close you are to
achieving your goal answering the
question are you moving enough it
registers your bike pedals swim strokes
and distance travel by sensing your
movements and it's the size of a quarter
so it's easy to wear even when wearing
almost nothing it's waterproof practical
and elegant
in keeping with our philosophy of
thoughtful simplicity we're trying to
simplify the process of making stuff
that means we run a tight ship with a
small team and that's why we're starting
here at IndieGoGo it's what we call the
lean hardware movement making it better
from the beginning prove that there's
demand and then create we're also going
to open the shines API so anyone can
make something new and we're inviting
people to create their own apps it's
about making things smarter through
simplicity we put a tremendous amount of
time and energy into making the shine
we're looking to you to prove you love
it just as much as we hope you will by
funding our project you're saying that
you want it and it allows us to overcome
the complexities of manufacturing and
lets us focus on simply making operate
