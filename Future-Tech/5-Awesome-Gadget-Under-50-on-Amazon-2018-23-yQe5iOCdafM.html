you
according to a recent estimate 85
million people in the United States
alone are involved in jobs that
primarily involves sitting this couldn't
be good for your health
could it have always been a health freak
the sitting disease first hit me when I
started working at a large corporation
where I sat most of my day I spoke to a
number of people and realized it wasn't
just me this is why it's not surprising
that Wired magazine calls sitting the
new smoking and they're probably doing
it right now
and that's why we built Cuba Cuba is the
world's first under the best elliptical
device designed specifically for your
workplace it's sleek modern and sexy
making it a true delight to use and sing
over the last 12 months we need multiple
iterations to ensure the perfect look
feel and posture this ensures that your
QB lets you get some basic exercise
without any distractions from regular
work the right alignment ensures that
you'll need to not hit the desk there
are many fitness trackers out there but
we wanted to make something a little
different we wanted to create an actual
source of exercise Cuba comes with
Bluetooth which wirelessly connects with
our mobile app and this lets you keep
track of your progress and share it with
friends and family on social networks
and if you're already using a fitness
tracker the app connects with those as
well so all you need is one there were
concerns about sweating and getting
distracted while using cuba so we did a
beta test and got very positive results
I used to get restless at work sitting
for long periods of time at my desk just
working on my computer but actually the
Kyuubi smooth motion actually gave me
something to do and concentrate on which
allowed me to concentrate on my work and
improve my productivity to spend less
time sitting people are now switching to
solution
the treadmill desks and standing desks
well they tend to be very expensive
costing anywhere between a thousand to
sometimes even four thousand dollars and
secondly they require complete change in
your office furniture and you might not
have the space to do that I love how the
QB is so compact it fits right under my
desk
and the best part is that it's
affordable I could purchase it myself
without needing any approval from my
manager or HR QB also comes with an
adjustable resistance allowing you to
easily pick an exercise intensity of
your choice based on my prior experience
and my degree in kinesiology I find that
a product like the QB would be an
excellent solution for a very large
population of people a product like the
QB would be ideal for individuals
working in an office setting you want to
be able to burn a few extra calories as
well stimulate their entire metabolism
while at work as well as complan elite
esthe we do not realize but advances in
technology actually promote an inactive
lifestyle we really have to get off our
seats for anything anymore human beings
did not evolve to sit for prolonged
periods of time with QB we hope to make
sitting healthier even if you go to the
gym every day for an hour it's not
enough if you're sitting for more than
six to eight hours
you need to stay active in order to stay
healthy cubed sleek design makes Fitness
fashionable it not only makes your
workstation feel more alive and
energetic but also more modern and
state-of-the-art you really cannot help
but fall in love with it we've been
working on QB for the past twelve months
and we are proud to say that we finally
have a prototype ready now all we need
is your help to redefine sitting you may
not always have time to exercise but you
will always have time to sit and be fit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
