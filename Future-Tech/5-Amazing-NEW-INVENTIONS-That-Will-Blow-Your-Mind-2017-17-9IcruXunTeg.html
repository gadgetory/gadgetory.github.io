never run out of power again in today's
world we are surrounded by the multiple

everyday life we charge the batteries at
home and at work even when we sleep the
regular charger violently continues to
push the power into the battery even
when it is already full
keeping chargers plugged in when they're
not being used
consumes unnecessary energy and shortens
battery life and increases the risk of
fire through overeating luckily there's
a solution bright charger is a brand new
invention from Finland it's a
beautifully designed charger which saves
energy and at the same time it's most
gentle for your device's bright charger
automatically stops drawing power from
the outlet when the battery is charged
after this it functions as a soft LED
light

devices worldwide will top 10 billion in
2017 what if we could just stop wasting
all this energy while we still can
besides freaking nature this is wrecking
your own wallet as well batteries can
only be charged for a limited amount of
time before they become totally useless
why is this consider normal why spend
hundreds of dollars on your phone just
to buy a new one within a couple of
years we all know how unpredictable worn
out batteries can be especially at low
temperatures when you're just chilling
out in the wilderness right charger

charged the way they were designed to no
more worrying about forgetting to above
your charger for the night bright
