imagine if vertical bike parking would
suddenly become simple a bike parking
solution that would lift your bike for
you wouldn't require physical strength
and would save floor space it's all
possible and it is here it's parkus how
it works drive in the front wheel when
the wheel is fixed hold the saddle to
lead the way and let parkus do its job
to remove the bike just grab the saddle
and pull firmly towards yourself many
bike enthusiasts face a problem a lack
of storage space all the available by
parking devices that solve this issue
require great physical effort so parkus
was invented as a solution the idea was
born in 2014 and developed for over a
year by the end of 2016 a fully
functional product was created parkus is
a solution that can be used by everyone
from teenagers to the elderly it also
saves at least 40% floor space and it
looks stylish
parkus it's easy fun and simple
so a lot of people ask us how hard it is
to put on the hydric River and frankly
it's pretty easy so today I'll show you
all you do we tell people to grab it
like so slip it over the back your head
it's easy to do make sure the straps are
nice and straight cinch it down nice and
snug don't be afraid to pull on it it's
built tough it's not gonna fall apart
then you take the excess webbing put it
in here under the little braided elastic
on the end of the shoulders now you have
some little loops you can hang your
hands on or side and get that one in
there quite right you hang your hands on
this so you can let the sodium run out
when you're out for a long trail run and
keeps them from flopping around and
driving you crazy some people like to
roll them up and tuck them into here so
they're completely out of the way the
shoulder pockets up here on the sleeves
they're easy to access there's a lot of
storage in these we're putting in your
phone your keys your chapstick
electrolytes etc and then as far as
reaching the bottle I tell people if you
can scratch the back your head you can
reach the bottle it's right on the same
place is there sloshing some people ask
about that sure there's a little bit of
sloshing but there's gonna be something
whether it's a pack moving or something
on your hips I guess that's a minor
consideration you have to take into
effect but in my opinion it's kind of
something that disappears and you just
really don't hear it after you've been
out there very long but as far as
reaching back it's easy to grab it's
easy to drink the bottle has a big
tapered opening the better a tapered
bottom the the water bottle holder
hydration pack has a big tapered open as
well it's easy to put the bottle back in
take off and go for a run thanks much
