spent on average eight times more time
in our beds and in our cars but for some
reason our cars have climate control and
can now park and dry themselves while
their beds have to stay the same for
hundreds of years that smart duvet we
believe it's time for our beds to catch
up to the 21st century introducing the
smart new bed breeds the world's first
dual zone climate control self making
bedroom well possibly the single biggest
innovation in our bedrooms in the last
100 years
in addition to making the bed for you
the breeze lets you select your
preferred temperature for each side of
the bed independently using the
smartphone app avoiding all future
arguments about room temperature we were
able to achieve both climate control and
self making bed features through our
patent-pending inflatable sheet placed
seamlessly between your duvet and duvet
cover no more sweaty night spend
regulating your body temperature by
leaving a leg out of the duvet it's time
we give sleep the attention it deserves
we all know that a good night's sleep
will be much happier healthier and more
productive
in 2016 smart duet amazed the world by
introducing the first app controlled
self making man this year we wanted to
make smart duvet even better by doing
more than making the bed fourth we
wanted to improve your nights as well
that's how the smart duvet breeze was
born you and your partner can benefit
from a better night's sleep by
individually adjusting the temperature
with your smart phone you can even
refresh or preheat your bed a few
minutes before sleep to enjoy the
perfect temperature when you get in then
the breeze is also a great way to reduce
your energy consumption by heating and
cooling your body directly instead of
the entire house it will also eliminate
arguments over room temperature or who
will have to make the bed
