I mean this is like climbing today

around you you obviously can see better
but other people can see you they
they're awesome you can see everything
you don't you can go off anywhere you
want
they light up the ground in front of you
without bothering the horse it gives you
more detail to remove it you can see
texture with this light hi I'm Rob
co-founder of Zenda tea over the past 30
years I've brought hundreds of tech
products to market I live in one of the
coolest places on the planet and spent a
lot of time outdoors and I don't always
like to go in just because the Sun Goes
Down there are thousands of flashlights
and headlamps out there but none of them
did what I wanted I decided to create an
entirely new category of outdoor light
so we designed the world's first strap
light the Zinta Neera
you
we identified three things the light
needed first it had to be super bright
these lights you just see it all they're
awesome they're really bright you're lit
up so you're less likely to get a tap
you can get red anywhere tonight
second it had to light at the area
around you and matches a spot you know
it was great to have these lights so I
could really assess the entire area that
I was looking at and not just small
spots
I like how I can move my head and the
light still stays with these they branch
out they cover so much area that you can
see everything around you she went
through the park on her own and night
people won't be able miss her and third
it needed to be hands-free it's easy to
mount ride to a backpack with simple
hook and loop ties you can use the
d-ring strap to fasten Ron in a wide
variety of applications didn't bother at
all
we built in ten rare earth magnets to
allow quick attachment to any ferrous
object the matching magnetic backer
makes it easy to securely fasten rod to
your clothing
you
we've completed the prototypes we filed
the Pens
and now we need your help please support
us and back us on Kickstarter because we
are bringing some really cool products
to market ok cool security isn't about a
siren everyone ignores security is about
people it's about knowing who should and
shouldn't be there so we feel safe and
worry less me cocoon
smart little security device that
protects your whole home it learns
what's normal for you and your home
alerting if something unusual happens so
you can come and go as you please
without having to set anything oh and
cocoon is pet friendly so no false
alarms feeling safe shouldn't compromise
your privacy so we've designed cocoon to
fit in with your life without being
complicated or overbearing cocoon is
packed with high quality sensors these
work together to measure changes in your
home may indicate something isn't quite
right
our unique sub sound technology means
cocoon can sense activity in your whole
home not just the area it can see cocoon
provides protection how and when you
need it so you can take action and feel
safe
whether you're traveling that's work or
just heading to bed at night cocoon is
looking after what you care about most
I thought it was coming from the two
speakers and when you revealed what was
actually happening it was very surprised
its chords it's like kind of nothing
I've really heard before I was aghast
and I haven't been that in a lot of
years really expert on rock
the core is the most advanced wireless
speaker system ever developed five
digital signal processors allow us to
render the audio in a way that is
totally revolutionary you're getting
stereo sound from this one tiny little
box the convention right now is that for
true high-end listening you have to have
two speakers the core changes that you
can have one and it truly sounds like
tune for a little box like this or
create although imaging is very
impressive leveraging a combination of
wave field synthesis and beam forming
allows us to create an acoustic bubble
in the room so that the image stays
stable no matter where you're sitting
you can almost see each person in the
band in the room with you I can move my
head around and the location of the
sound source remains intact as if it was
a you know a hologram
there's no speaker that can do anything
like this
everything is smart but sound systems
aren't and this is the thing that we're
doing at mass fidelity is creating truly
smart sound systems if you have an NFC
enabled phone just touch the top of the
core and you're automatically connected
a high density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the cores
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the cores USB connector
will recharge it for you the cores
control input makes it home automation
compat
in fact the core has all the inputs
you'll ever need any smart device will
work instantly via bluetooth hook up
your Apple TV to add pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once for the past 18
months we've been developing the core
with engineers and factories to make
sure that we can deliver to you a
perfect audio product we're a small
company used to doing small production
runs the demand for the call has been
overwhelming we need your help to
accelerate the tooling that will allow
us to bring it to my ability so join us
and you'll get a beautifully designed
wireless speaker that gives you true
stereo sound for any room in your house
the core will be the only wireless
speaker you'll ever need and the most
exciting audio product you've ever owned
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when asked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product that would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you the
platform is strong the posts are spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor so you
can increase the workout the body boss
is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
you can choose your color green pink you
can choose your package and choose how
you want to follow workouts live
reflect program all on your own
normally costing thousands of dollars to
buy or recreate all of the support but
by backing this Kickstarter today you
can get it for a fraction of that price
our hearts and souls have developed the
body boss 2.0 and we're making our first
prototypes to be able to produce the
product and make it available we'll need
your support together we can make this
happen make this a part of your
lifestyle share this video with a friend
