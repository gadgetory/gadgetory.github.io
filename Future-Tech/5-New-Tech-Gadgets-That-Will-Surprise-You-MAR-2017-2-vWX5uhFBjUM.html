saying goodbye to the hostess and reach
to grab a toothpick before walking out
the door there it is the dreaded turn
the knob toothpick dispenser that
someone else turned after scratching an
itch on their scalp or worse enough
already
introducing the world's first smart
toothpick dispenser a simple wave above
the surf clean sensor electronically
delivers one clean unwrapped toothpick
to your fingertips a beam of UV light is
directed into the storage compartment
during each delivery enjoy a clean sharp
unwrapped toothpick without the worry of
germs wrappers or accidentally grabbing
multiple toothpicks the surf clean
sensor toothpick dispenser uses for
double-a batteries or AC adapter and
power cord also included is a starter
pack of white birch double pointed
toothpicks and a convenient Tong to
easily load bulk toothpicks into the

toothpick
finally a high-tech germ free delivery
product for the simple toothpick whether
at a checkout counter kitchen table
aside your easy chair at a Costco
sausage taste demonstration or sitting
next to a platter of cheeses at your
upcoming social the serf clean toothpick
dispenser is a must-have for your
friends family customers or the gift you
send someone who has everything hi I'm
Troy Bell co-designer of the new smart
toothpick dispenser after devoting
almost two years refining the concept
creating working prototypes and testing
every aspect of this invention we have
achieved a timeless design bringing the
toothpick dispenser into the 21st
century
each internal component down to the UV
lights used to bombard the toothpick
storage compartment have been sourced
for the finest quality and durability
every detail like the unique toothpick
tong provided to load clean toothpicks
into the dispenser without touching them
with your hands has been thoughtfully
addressed the resin components were
handcrafted or 3d printed so we could
view improve photograph tests and allow
focus groups to activate working models
until every detail was perfected we
applied for the patent over a year ago
tool drawings are completed and we are
ready to order production molds thank
you for your interest to bring this
unique idea to market
this is the world's first lamp where you
can move the light in any direction to
place it where you really need it it is
much more than just a pendant lamp with
300 powerful LEDs it can illuminate any
part of your room in any brightness you
want and it's colored up light can
create the perfect mood for any
situation with smart lamps from Luke
Roberts you get unlimited lighting
possibilities by simply painting your
light just take out your phone and start
painting the light in the desired
direction the more light you paint the
brighter it gets and you don't have to
worry about the position of your phone
as the app rotates with your movements
the right painted on your phone is
always aligned with your lamp
simply paint and enjoy you can save your
personalized light scenes and switch
between them with a simple swipe the
lamp uses different colored LEDs so you
can choose between warm and cool whites
warm light to relax cool light for tasks
such as reading because it helps you
concentrate when you leave the room it
turns itself off to save your money and
the environment
when you enter the room the lamp uses
presence detection and smart algorithms
to predict which light scene is best
suited creating a new light scene is
easy just pick a color and start
painting your light
once you are satisfied save the setting
as a new light scene with the colored
indirect light you can create the
perfect mood for any situation where you
want a touch of color but the lamp gives
you much more than just beautiful mood
lighting it can easily illuminate even
larger rooms for example if you are in a
hurry and looking for your keys get the
perfect light for any situation with
smart lighting from Luke Roberts this is
well not much different from your belt
this is how it's different from your
belt buckle up smart well
it's basically a very compact PC to play
games on it's a really nice concept it's
very different that's it's a good idea
I don't like that there's huge amount of
games and you can play games like from
back from nineteen nineties up to the
newest triple-a game laptop you still
it's still pretty heavy you need a
separate bag and this you can just put
in your rucksack as heavy as you think
you can plug in a mouse and keyboard to
it with a USB - so it's pretty nice yeah
I liked it really much and looked very
promising it seems rather powerful it's
really a promising solution for mobile
gaming with the real PC experience using
steam you can just take your safe games
with you and play along
hi I'm Nick I'm the founder of those
awesome guys and a developer our move or
die is basically a portable steam box
which is an amazing
yes SV it looks like a really
interesting product and should that let
me have a looking into it I think it's
nice for game developers to have this
because you can try to build that image
for PC you're playing it out them you
have all the power in the PC in your
hand pretty cool
I mean it's like a no-brainer taking all
your Steam games with yours pretty
awesome and it's pretty unbelievable to
be able to hold a Windows machine in
your hands that actually works so I'm
super excited to see this as a finished
project
I really love the device I held in my
hand and it felt really great
you know the control touch steps and it
was really exceeding my expectations so
yeah I'm really really looking forward
to getting it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
