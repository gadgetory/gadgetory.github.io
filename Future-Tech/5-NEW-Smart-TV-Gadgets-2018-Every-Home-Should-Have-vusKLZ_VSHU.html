your sinha made 15 system was made to
make what you watch even better
and it won't take you long to start
enjoying it first we'll add the rubber
feet to the acoustic module
prevent scratches and keep the module
from moving on a smooth floor peel the
backing off each rubber foot and attach
it like this
when you're done turn the module upright
and place it where you want it for the
best performance put it near a wall or
corner
next we'll connect the soundbar speaker
it comes with the cables already
attached you just need to attach the
other ends to the acoustic module slide
them on and tighten the hand screws on
both sides
next we'll connect the speaker system to
your TV
first take a look at what outputs you
have on your TV you'll get the best
performance using the optical output a
secondary choice is to use coax digital
or analog connections
if your TV doesn't have any of these
outputs you can use the outputs of
another device such as a cable box but
the cinemate system will only play audio
from that device you only need one type
connection choose the one that works
best for you
we'll use optical for this video this is
the optical cable that came with your
cinemate system make sure to remove the
protective covers plug it into the back
of the soundbar speaker
notches on the side to line it up the
right way insert it until you feel a
click then plug it into the back of the
TV
if you're using other types of cables
the steps are the same first to the
soundbar
then to the TV the Jackson connectors
are usually color matched next plug this
end of the power cord to the back of the
module
and the other end into a power outlet
you should hear a tone letting you know
there's power
the batteries are in your Bose remote
and turn on the cinemate system the LED
should light up then use your TV's
remote and turn on the TV you can
control the volume with the remote
and this knob on the back of the module
lets you adjust the base up or down
you may need to turn down or turn off
your TV speakers your TV owners guide
can help with this now it's show time
