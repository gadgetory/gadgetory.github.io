I am biscuit I am a good boy but my dear
human gave biscuit a bad bed
why would you give a good boy a bad bet
we all make mistakes maybe you you
listen most pet beds are gross extinct
they're hard they're lumpy and they look
like this the pet bed world needed an
intervention so with the comfort
scientists at purple I am veneered the
all-new purple pet pen the first and
only pet bed to feature Purple's crazy
comfy super Sayan see purple technology
oh wow please give is excite whoops this
cat peed a little it happens and poo we
all do but on the purple pet bed that's
okay you see first we looked at other
pet beds most come in a variety of
covers ranging from cotton and nylon to
microfiber and polyester problem is most
of these fabrics are easily penetrated
by moisture creates bacteria and
bacteria smells gross this means even
when you bathe conditioned and deodorize
your little buddy as soon as they lay
down on their bed that old dog smell
returns like a bad sequel I'm looking at
you Michael Bay so just toss the cover
in the wash right wrong because the real
problem is the bed itself foam slab
cotton batting fluff chunks these
materials are breeding ground for
bacteria mold and fungi no Kies the bad
fungi that means your pet bed not only
smells gross but might be making you
more allergic to Fido or cat Fido that's
where the purple pet bed comes in when
we developed the purple pet bed we
addressed all these issues starting from
the inside out the core of our bed is
made of our ultra comfy hyper elastic
polymer the comfort core is then wrapped
in an antimicrobial water pre odor proof
protector that means no bacteria no
smell better than my human son
and are easy to remove ultra-durable
cover is also antimicrobial as well as
stain and moisture resistant not to
mention a beautiful statement piece for
any living room bedroom or pet room you
know if you're one of those people
guilty now here's why your furry friends
are gonna go barking mad over the purple
pet bed it's just so dang comfy don't be
jealous
ever notice that even though you bought
the $200 plush microfiber therapeutic
deluxe edition pet bed at a big-box
store your fur children still prefer
your bed over theirs boy do I love
shedding is probably what cats think as
they diabolically spread their fur all
over your bedspread
but hey you're just so cute also you
might notice your more fur heavy friends
prefer to sleep on the cool tile floor
over there soft dog bed kind of like how
I prefer Chloe to Kim that's why we
engineered the purple pet bed to be
temperature neutral your little buddies
can rest comfy pant freeze meaning no
panting I think that's pretty cool
that's cool is your fanny pack nerd as
your pet ever utterly destroyed his or
her bed first off maybe they're trying
to tell you something but also it's love
to scratch and chew but nothing
scratches and chews with more precision
plug in the club
our way to test for durability the
purple pet bed would stood over
60-thousand claws from this monster the
purple pet that is the absolute greatest
pet bed of all time so if you love your
pets like she loves sloths then treat
your furry friends to the best rest of
their unfortunately short lives and hey
