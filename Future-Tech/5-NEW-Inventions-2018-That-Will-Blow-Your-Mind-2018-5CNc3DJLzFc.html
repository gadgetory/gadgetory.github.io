container in the world the innovative
design led to double the storage
capacity from 16 ounces to 32 ounces or
vice versa when you press the lid our
patented one-way check valve removes
excess air and keeps food fresh longer
the crystal-clear transparent body
provides 360 degree clarity the
changeable height maximizes the space
that was not being wisely used before
and the vertically stackable design
keeps your pantry well organized
look how the 1/2 smart storage system
transforms your space the 1/2 smart
storage system is proudly designed and
engineered here in America we tested all
different materials shapes sizes and
storage capacities it took two years of
research and development and finally we
found the best solution to begin with
manufacturing costs are fully priced the
tooling is ready and we could start the
production any time it's named a
finalist for the housewares design
awards 2018
first there was a light it witnesses
evolution yet witnesses workmanship we
have tried to control and harness its
power but this was never easy
until today
well I hope you enjoyed that journey
because I certainly did now let's make
this one to remember
but as always slim down and stay secure
meet the Gullu G mm the lightest most
powerful car jump starter that can start
any 12-volt car up to 40 times it can
also jump start this and this and did we
mention these while its slim and
lightweight enough to come along for the
ride don't let its size fool you this is
not your regular car jump starter
it's your all-weather companion a
helping hand when you need it most an
affordable battery that can charge all
your devices at once and up to four
times the speed it'll even work if your
car battery is totally flat don't worry
about getting out of your car to get it
going it can charge from the cigarette
lighter output instead so it's always
convenient wherever you are
it's unique smart cable makes it easier
to use than the competition to
self-diagnosing the battery status and
walking you through the process
step-by-step to get your car up and
running quickly you know that save the
day kind of stuff there's even a torch
for emergencies every kind of emergency
once you're home plug the G mm in and
it's good to go again in four hours one
charge will last up to three months so
it's ready to help out whenever you need
it such attention to detail comes down
to who lose experience in the industry
we sold one of our jumpstarters every
second unlike
you can check out our Amazon reviews to
see why we listen to what our users
wanted a flex your product and after
thousands of hours of research the G
2000 is the result don't wait until you
need the G 2000 buy it now and secure
your peace of mind
today
