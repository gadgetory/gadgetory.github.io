on electricity it powers the technology
all around you making your home safer
more comfortable and responsive to your
needs but electricity is confusing
that's why we built Kirk the whole home
energy intelligence system isn't it time
to power smarter to take control of the
very thing that connects you to your
world
say goodbye to energy bills that come a
month later and don't tell you where
your money went curb shows you exactly
how much power is being used at any time
I really love curb for two reasons I
love it from a budget perspective and I
also love it from an environmental
perspective this part of the app here
shows me exactly where my money is going
so that I can have all the data I need
to make changes for next month so I can
lower my utility cost and also lower my
impact on the environment curb is
installed in your homes breaker box
where it monitors everything that uses
electricity it lets you know when things
are accidentally left on and forecast
your electric bill so that there are no
surprises curb sensors work like a brain
processing electrical data and
identifying home energy trends so you
can rest easy knowing that curb is
always on the lookout if Curt notices
something odd you'll find out right away
and if your appliances start acting up
curb will give you time to plan curb
will even remind you of the little
things so that you can focus on the more
important things in life
over time curb will learn about your
energy behavior and give you
personalized tips saving you money and
making your home more efficient what was
really the benefit was this deeper
understanding how are we using energy
where are we using it it all has a cost
associated with it but it was that
learning experience for the you know the
engineering folks amongst us that I
thought was particularly valuable and it
it does end up changing your actions it
changes the way you interface with
energy and that's a good thing overall
curb gives you the power of information
and shows you the impact that changes
have right away you can even set up
alerts when you get close to your budget
to help you adjust and stay on track and
to make your life easier
curb also works with other smart home
devices allowing you to power things on
and off directly from the curb app no
matter where you are power your life
smarter with sleep of course is the
primary method of boosting our mood
memory cognition and energy to enhance
your overall sleep quality and to allow
for a new level of productivity at work
we've designed the circadian tracker
this began with engineering a new
contactless sensor the first of its kind
to measure heart rate breathing and body
movement using a single device the
system scans your heart chest and body
allowing circadian to capture biometric
signals 100 million times every second
attached to your bedroom wall it works
from up to 8 feet away it's testing
through your duvets and blankets
environmental sensors integrated in the
circadian tracker work with these rukia
app to detect ambient temperature
humidity light and sound allowing you to
learn how your environment affects your
quality of sleep by synchronizing with
other smart home products it
automatically creates the most conducive
sleep environment the smart wake up
alarms analyzes your sleep in real-time
and uses sound and the integrated light
to help you wake up at the optimal point
in your sleep cycle ensuring you always
begin your day of fresh the built-in
speaker allows you to play and wake up
to your favorite tune
straight from your preferred music app
with biometric data you get an analysis
of your sleep with 98% lab tested
accuracy sleeping patterns are used to
calculate a model of your bodies in
clock signaling when your body will be
at peak alertness when you will start
feeling tired and when your body is
ready to sleep it also predicts how much
your internal clock is out of sync and
the impact on your alertness and sleep
quality later in the day
working with the circadian a p-- it
provides personalized feedback during
the day to improve your sleep for those
of us that spend the majority of our
time indoors under artificial light and
for the jet-setters we've also designed
a compact add-on therapy lamp which uses
the natural properties of light to help
you resync your body clock keeping you
alert sir KDF Ines and sinks to your
perfect rhythm the key to a good night's
sleep on average should we breathe
around 26,000 times every time we
breathe we don't only absorb oxygen but
also pollutants we tend to believe that
indoor air is clean and safe but the
truth is far from that indoor pollution
can be two to five times higher than
outdoor these levels of contamination
are alarming since we spent nearly 90%
of our time inside rooms whether we're
at work or at home you know furniture
home appliances cigarettes and
especially textiles complete or indoor
air and the fact is we think we're safe
once in doors but pollutants are
everywhere ever bought an air purifier
that left you feeling dissatisfied
because you just don't feel the
difference after lots of research and
testing we finally designed the zunium a
modern hybrid air purifier it will
release over two million dual plasma
annuals onions
normally found in nature helped clear
harmful airborne particles jr. purifies
the surrounding air just like plants and
trees would on top of that it removes
ultrafine dust using HEPA and a natural
anti allergy filter it works as a
sterilizing medium and anti allergen
that finds bacteria might pollen
odors
and other pollutants so let's say
goodbye to these stubborn particles and
hello to zuni zillion has three modes
turbo normal and sleep if you want to
amplify the purifying effect click the
fan button twice to start the turbo mode
8 seconds after turning out the lights
in a room zoomin changes automatically
to sleep mode and activates a neon
movies union also has a smart USB you
can connect and charge any USB power
device either wirelessly there are 2
kinds of zooms available wired and
wireless you still remember how many
times a day we breathe well if you
forgot I recommend you to restart the
video just kidding now with the xenian
modern hybrid air purifier we can both
enjoy purified safe indoor air in our
fast-paced world we overlook the most
important component of our day sleep
studies show that waking abruptly are in
the wrong phase of sleep can be as
harmful as no sleep at all we all have
to wake up on time but how we've been
doing it is unnatural and needs to
change most of us aren't even aware that
waking delight the way nature intended
can be the difference between another
groggy morning or revolutionising your
day here at mode modern we want to
change them the sunrise pillow is the
world's first smart pillow that tracks
your sleep wakes you naturally with
light and reinvents the alarm our
specially designed LED lights speakers
and sensors are embedded beneath layers
of premium memory foam simply set your
alarm
choose your wakeup music and go to sleep
in the morning your pillow will glow
from a soft morning red to orange until
your room is filled with light then your
music plays to ensure you're away by
mimicking the Rising Sun your body will
be stimulated and wake up naturally
fully refreshed and ready for the day
the sunrise pillows smart alarm you
knows when to wake you in your lightest
phase of sleep so you wake up focused
and energized the moment you open your
eyes our sensors monitor your sleep and
give you a sleep score if your sleeps
interrupted at 2:00 a.m. you should be
able to hear what it was so you can
adjust your surroundings to perfect your
sleep fall asleep to nature sounds your
favorite audio book or mask out unwanted
noise with the built-in sound
conditioner you can even fall asleep the
old-fashioned way with the adjustable
reading lights that turn off
automatically once you've fallen asleep
here at mode modern we've been hard at
work we're a team of designers and
engineers with over 10 years of
experience making a pillow for you to
rest your head on may seem simple but
making it intelligent and easy to use
takes even more finesse that's why we're
working closely with materials experts
and software engineers to source the
most comfortable materials and design
the simplest system that works
seamlessly to improve your life the
popularity and wearables is proof that
we all care about improving our bodies
state of mind but we shouldn't have to
wear something to become better at the
sunrise pillow is designed to give you
insight into one of the most important
processes of your life your sleep when
designing the sunrise pillow we went
through many iterations to make sure it
was not only the most intuitive smart
alarm but also the most comfortable we
use soft breathable fabrics and
integrated coin technology to keep you
cool and comfortable the entire night
sleep plays a critical role in all our
lives so we didn't want to make this
pillow without your help we want the
Kickstarter community to help us for a
better sleep to everyone with your
support we can together help people get
more out of their days
proving the quality of their guns we're
so excited to build the sunrise pillow
and get it to you
how's it going my name is Chris Aang and
I'm the creator of the bed shelf II know
not bed selfies guys to the right a
little very dark the bed sheltie you
know my entire life I've noticed that if
there's one thing that we could all use
a little bit more of its space big
clunky furniture can make your home feel
more like a cage sometimes finding
something as simple as finding a place
to put your nightstand can become quite
the challenge
so I set out to create a solution that
would work for everyone and every living
situation from the college dorm room to
the studio apartment to the best of all
and my favorite the bunk bed this
bedside shelf is easy to install it
attaches firmly to the edge of your bed
frame without tools using a simple and
time-tested clamp and knob mechanism of
course it had to be extremely sturdy to
safely hold all of your bedside needs
design wise it features rounded edges
and a neat wire slot for charging your
phone we chose to handcraft the bed
shelf e out of bamboo you love bamboo
it's four times harder than oak and
matures in just three to five years it's
eco-friendly and has a ton of great
character over numerous designs and
sketches later we've arrived to a clean
minimal form offering a wide range of
versatility
the bed Shelby team is really excited
about this product
we were extremely grateful for your
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
