the love we share for cafe racer bikes
goes way back to 1977
when we bought our first bike back then
we were just three brothers that loved
tuning and riding bikes
fast forward 37 years something and we
are still the same brothers that share
the love for cafe racer bikes we decided
that we wanted to create a new type of
cafe racer that has never been seen
before we wanted to create the world's
first electric cafe racer scooter our
idea and vision was to mix the past with
the future and rumble was the perfect
name of the scooter we wanted to share
with the world fast forward three more
years and we have created the perfect
scooter for everyday use for people
around the world
rumble is an electric scooter that you
can ride to work meeting up friends
would just take it out for a nice ride
we have source parts from countries in
Europe USA and Asia to create the best
high performance electric bike we want
our customers to build quality
background in engineering and passion
for bikes has been the key to create the
perfect electric cafe racer scooter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
