we think there's something wrong with
them it's a concept that is not evolved
for more than 30 years we have so many
different devices and each one has their
own remote or app you end up with so
many jumping from one remote to another
or when using an app finding your phone
unlocking it finding the right app and
waiting until the app is ready it's
cumbersome and inconvenient it would be
so much easier to control everything
from one place that's why we have
created knio knio is a smart system that
connects to all the devices in your home
and makes them available in one
easy-to-use app and for the ultimate
simplicity used in your remote it
recognizes you and lets you control
everything instantly so whether you're
watching a movie setting mood lighting
relaxing with your favorite music or
lowering the window shades neo makes it
effortless and trust us setting all of
this up is insanely simple to make new
absolutely amazing we assembled a team
with expertise in home automation
software hardware and consumer product
design we truly inspired each other to
create something really special after
year of research and development we have
perfected the remote you will be
delighted with the results here's just
the buttons which
needed to get that tactile feedback
whether cranking up the volume or
flicking through the channels new
includes a superb high density
touchscreen display surpassing even
impose a permit in a standard we
embedded a hand detection technology
into new for which we have a patent
pending the technology knows you and
shows you your favorites instantly and
neo will even help you set and manage
parental controls near goes months
without needing to be charged and if you
can't find it use your phone to activate
the SOS so you know where its hiding
prizes like Apple TV nest hue cirno's
Roku and over 10,000 other major
audio-visual devices are supported right
from the box our driver team adds more
devices every day so even if you don't
have the latest devices Neil will just
work we've been spending a lot of time
testing devices and electronic stores
and repair shops and that's why it is
insanely easy to set up Neil after a
year of hard work developing software
and machining prototypes we are now
ready for production by backing our
project will enable us to start the
first production run of the neo system
thank you for your support
we've been controlling our homes from
walls for decades there's something
beautifully approachable about a switch
give it a flick and you know exactly
what's going to happen now why should
this change in the world of smartphone
unless you have to pull out your phone
and look at your email every time you
want to turn the light on and that's why
we invented wink relay it gives you
complete control of your smartphone
exactly where you've come to expect it
right on your wall when designing wink
relay we really wanted to design
something that didn't feel like a cell
phone stuck on your wall we want to
design something that felt like an
architectural fixture within your home
something that was easy to use and felt
like it wanted to be touched every
single product in your wink ecosystem
will show up there right on your screen

humidity sound everything you need to
know to have complete control and
awareness of what's going on in your
environment there's two light switches
that are built into it and the two light
switches can directly control your light
loads or you can actually override the
buttons to be able to program smart home
scenes into it
