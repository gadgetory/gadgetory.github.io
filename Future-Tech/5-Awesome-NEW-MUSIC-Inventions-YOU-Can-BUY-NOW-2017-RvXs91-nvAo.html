from Berlin I always had a passion for
music I was teaching for a couple of
years with vinyl and then with digital
tools as well so I wanted to go out of
the computer I wanted to go away from
screen like I want to enable people to
make music yeah and this hands-on
fashion the automat is a controller to
control motors like to bang on stuff or
to control acoustic instruments with
MIDI signals you can simply plug in your
iPhone or iPad or MIDI sequencer or
keyboard or laptop and then you can hook
up to 12 motors and play on objects or
like acoustic instruments and make crazy
sound the tool kit comes with everything
you need so the motors are included the
mounting stuff is included so you have
everything to get started to create
music machines you can basically use
everything to create sound together with
the pupae you can use your club multi
bottle your vehicle you can use what you
find in your basement and then there's
adapters like for microphone stands to
play your drum kits so you have ready to
go to a kid for training percussive
sounds my competing demands on theater
kind meant the etc of the London firm
from the Amish bein a began notice comes
Alison elementor's when a techno track
20 artists took diversity team passes
for eight years
we are using data machines because it
brings in a very new sound aesthetics
it's a nice combination of robots
playing acoustic instruments in a very
special and unique way
we are production ready we found the
right partners to manufacture here in
Germany it's ready to be out there so if
you want to create awesome sound in an
analogue fashion please help and back to
project now
making music with hardware is expensive
it takes up space but it is a lot of fun
to tweak knobs press buttons plug in
different machines and just jam away
that's why we have created a product
that gives you everything you need to
make electronic music a product that
doesn't depend on a mobile phone or a
computer one that fits in your pocket
and only costs you pocket money
we call it the mini Jam studio back in
2013 we had a successful Kickstarter
campaign with patch blogs now we've
developed that technology further and
turned it into something new our studio
comprises of four music machines as well
as this little speaker this is a drum
machine with eight synthesized drum
tracks as well as eight patterns of 16
steps each parameter is fully automated
or you can change patterns and store
everything in flash if you like this is
a unique little wavetable synthesizer
the 16 automatable parameters and/or
wavetable banks
features are built an appreciator as
well as the sequencer with four patterns
this machine mixes the audio signal it
keeps everything in sync you can change
the temple of all connected devices and
record the mix onto a microSD card and
this is an analogue filter which you can
use as an external effect unit it
features a band pass and low pass made
with the support of our Becker's from
the first Kickstarter campaign we've
used the chance to form a great team
establishing Network reliable suppliers
and build up distribution and retail
channels all over the club our products
are selling quality check here in
Germany we already have two units in
pre-production second I need you to
realize this project
hey I'm Marta from coma electronic and
this is our latest product the chroma
electronic field kit a little box made
for experimentation with electro
acoustic elements the field kit is
inspired by experimental electro
acoustic performance techniques as
discovered by our heroes like John Cage
Steve Reich and David two-door by using
contact microphones and electromagnetic
pickups sensors and switches you can
generate sounds from ordinary objects
and process it inside the fields with
the field kit is build up out of seven
different building blocks in the middle
of all of it is the four channel mixer
each channel has a tone control a volume
control and a gain control on top of
that there is a little selector button
over here with which you can send the
signal to an auxilary bus that comes out
over here of course there is a master
volume and a master output and a speaker
volume
speaker outputs where you can switch
between different channels to send to
the speaker outputs next to the mixer
you find the envelope follower you send
in a signal and the envelope follower
sends out a envelope or a gate you can
set the control sensitivity here and
play around with it and for instance
control the DC interface down on the
Left we find the CV radio which is an
am/fm and shortwave radio that you can
set both by hand with this little button
here or you can search via CV over all
bells next to the radio you find the LFO
it's a very basic and simple design that
goes into audio rate so you can also use
it as a rudimentary normal oscillator
here you can choose it here you can set
the range and here you can set the
waveform over there you have the output
here in the bottom will find the signal
interface where you can use any type of
sensor plug it in on the bottom right
here set the level set an offset and get
a CV signal out over here the field kit
is ideal for people who want to
experiment with sound with people that
want to make their own sounds
it's ideal for sound designers for
people that just want to play in their
living room or since it's so small take
it on the road we have worked on the
field kit for the last year and we are
very happy that it's finally finished
this is the final prototype we're ready
for production and all we need is your
pledge to make it happen thanks a lot
for watching this video and thanks a lot
for your support together we can make
the field kits come to life if you have
any questions let us know and please
check out the awesome rewards under this
video
this was Berlin my life hello we
identify we would like to introduce our
first product for the auto top a certain
synthesizer a meeting invention kit that
allows you to make her in his shoes we
designed it so anyone is able to use it
you can unpack the kit and get making
straightaway each your total has 12
touch inputs arranged like a keyboard an
on-board speaker and headphone output it
either powered by batteries or USB
it has four sensor inputs for modifying
yourselves
it's easy to use all you do is plug in
the object like rocker clips and touches
activate the sound
using different combinations of object
sensors and sounds the only limit is
your imagination
throughout the development of Toto to be
testing the prototype time workshops and
we've been amazed by the results
musical bikes the singing fruit really
hurt me
hi I'm Sebastian hunts and I'm the
developer of patch blocks which are
these programmable sound modules which
are standalone battery-powered
sound synthesizers that can be chained
together you can program them with a Mac
or PC editor with what is called visual
programming and this combines the
flexibility of patching software
environments and the tangibility and
physicality and fun of physical Hardware
actual synthesizers so in essence it
allows you to program and create your
own synthesizer and take it with you
wherever you want how it works is easy
all you have to do is you use our Apache
editor and connect low level sound
synthesis elements in there assign which
parameters of that you wish to assign to
the controls of the patch blocks and
then if you want to listen to it you can
use the emulator of the software listen
to it until you are happy with it and
then press compile it then compiles that
code and uploads it via USB to one of
the patch blogs and you just unplug it
and you're ready to go what you can do
with it it's for example use one and
program it as a drum computer or combine
to transfer the audio signal losses in
between them and have a bigger drum
computer or you can use one as a
sequencer and sequence that or you can
program one as a city sizer
automated with a control signal from
another book lay them all together this
is just another demonstration of what
you can do with a single block in terms
of silent and processing power you can
also use a single patch block as a sound
processor by routing an external audio
source into it a mobile phone iPod or
another piece of musical equipment
briefly demonstrate how this sounds like
this for example is a filter or you can
use a delay effect
hardest wash
we have already a few of these units
made as a short prototyping run you can
pledge for those 440 pounds and you get
a unit as soon as the Kickstarter
funding round is finished you can also
support us for 30 pounds and get one of
the first units of our main production
run we're aiming to produce 1000 units
that's where we're trying to raise the
money for so we're very depending on
your support please help us to get this
product out there thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
