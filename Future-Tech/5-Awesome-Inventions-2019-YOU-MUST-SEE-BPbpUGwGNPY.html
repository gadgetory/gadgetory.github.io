never miss another of their flying on a
paper airplane must be so magical with
your help magical is about to become
un-freakin'-believable
this is shy a pilot an industrial
designer and an inventor he is a world
known expert in cool stuff that flies
two years ago shy was challenged by his
friend to create a smartphone controlled
paper airplane thanks to 21,000 backers
on Kickstarter he made it happen people
all over the world are now controlling
paper planes from their smartphones with
powerup 3 I proudly came back to his
brand and his friend said wow that is
magical but you can't put a live
streaming camera on a paper airplane shy
thought for a minute and said challenge
accepted now after two years of testing
and prototyping meat sized new on
freaking believable invention power up
fpv the first-ever paper airplane drone
with a live streaming camera using
state-of-the-art technology power up fpv
lets you see what your plane sees to put
it in different words you feel as if you
are flying through the air riding a
paper airplane yes
power up fpv makes your regular paper
plane look like a kitty next to a lion
riding a t-rex just take a piece of
paper fold it into a plane and attach
the module put your phone in the
cardboard viewer and your idiom fly the
camera screams live video through an app
on your very own smartphone sitting in
the head mounted goggles to control your
plane just tilt your headlights and
there's also a gamepad mode for when you
feel like handheld control powerup FTB's
camera can swivel around that's how you
also get winged view and back view so
you can see this defining moment in your
look it's you flying a power-up fpv so I
wanted to create the most immersive
real-time experience that's why he
partnered with the good folks of parrot
world experts in wireless streaming and
creators of the AR Drone with their help
power up SBB streams live video over
Wi-Fi from over 300 feet to make the
experience really smooth power up FTP
has a ton of sensors and an on-board
computer with real-world autopilot mode
making it nearly uncrashable nearly
power up fpv is ready for production so
if you'll have flying and want to ride a
paper airplane back power up fpv and
help make what was once magical on
freaking believable

scooters in 27 countries and our
scooters have caught more than 1 billion
kilometres worldwide making new the
largest smart scooter company in the
world and we're just getting started

enjoy the fun of riding with two people
if you're not comfortable on a larger
scooter the slender and stylish M plus
is the perfect choice the battery is
lightweight and easy to carry the cruise

hand off the throttle on open roads for
that extra bit of riding comfort and
it's four color options mean you can
