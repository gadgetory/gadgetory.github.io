so we don't map so we made this
the micro wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
as we grew frustrated with traditional
leather wallets only lasting several
months instead of several years as
designers we knew we could do better we
set ourselves a pretty challenging brief
to design a minimalist wallet that was
not only aesthetically beautiful but
functionally superior to anything else
on the market our years of industry
experience enabled us to quickly
evaluate our designs taking them from
initial concept through to sourcing
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating would rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strengths so we decided to test it ready
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes
holding audio cards securely you no
longer have to remove them to make a
payment one of our proudest achievements
is its full functionality of a regular
wallet without the bulk believe it or
not we've even managed to find space for
your change
hi I'm Adam he's kind of a big day for
me and that's why I have Wally while
he's connected to my club and sends me
instant notification whenever I leave or
forget about hi which happens a lot
that's not even the best part
I never even have to charge Wally to
swap out the battery whatever it's time
for a new one if I ever lose my phone I
just tap my wallet twice my phone will
start ringing yep goes both ways
you
you
you
you
oh you have my card inside
oh yeah
wall-e lets me know if I leave my card
behind so I'm always covered
you
hello kickstart out Phillip I'm Alec I'm
Gabby and this is ping wallet the
world's thinnest smartest wallet thing
is a smart wallet that connects to your
smartphone using bluetooth we design
ping wallet to look better than a
traditional wallet it's sleek it's
modern and you can customize it to the
color of your choice pink wallet can
outlast the traditional wallet because
it's made with the durable single piece
of aluminum and a commercial-grade
elastic band not only is it durable and
modern it's smart as well and thing
while it is the only wallet that
protects itself and youth from ID theft
getting stolen or being misplaced
what makes Bank so smart it has multiple
Hall effect sensors that can detect the
Sun someone or you remove a card from
game we remind you to come back to the
wallet
if you out at a bar or restaurant you
can use the pin out to open a tab to a
manager at a later time because we use
Hall effect sensors instead of Artemia
sensors in a custom battery the battery
lasts up to two liters after three years
you can replace the battery for another
two years
once you couldn't pin to your iPhone or
Android they instantly protect each
other
if someone takes your wallet your
whether when we were flying through from
like this or if someone takes you for
penguin or a fire do sound
our world is constantly moving faster
and it's getting harder to remember all
the important things
it's easy to lose track
probably loves things
that's why we created one
it's the slimmest smart wallet that
you'll never lose
will it protects your valuable cards
documents and money
you
please handcrafted with love designed to
give you peace of mind
hi my name is Marek and I'm launcher of
products and services I do it for
companies I do it for myself and I'm
very busy and because of that I lack of
product service that can give me better
control over things
well it's something more than just a
leather wallet it's something that I can
describe as a sense of security so right
now we're giving you bullet super smart
wallet that you will never lose bullet
is the first wallet you can lose will it
protects you from anyone who wants to
steal your pash arts or identity
hi and I'd like to tell you about our
new product smart one we've been using
wallets for hundreds of years and we
think it's crazy that we've been using
the same wallet
essentially the same wallet that our
great-great-grandparents use
that's why we want to make the wallet
smart
the first function and I pin it's a
two-way notification system get your
wallet
to forget your phone your wallet will
remind also you get up let me take care
of something
and your wallet starts to beat them to
remind me that you've left your phone
behind
if you have misplaced your wallet boy
from the spot wallet can also serve as
attractive you can use the smart wallet
