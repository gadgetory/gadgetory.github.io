green is a completely new generation of
UA Tomita measures continuously the body
temperature and gives you the whole
fever curve and not only a one spot
measurement my name is Reza I'm Johannes
clear founders of coziness and parents
are free very cute children as parents
we know how difficult it is to know what
the right thing is to do when children
have the temperature for example shall I
try to keep my child warm or try to cool
it down in this very moment and how
effective was my treatment as skilled
engineers and as parents we put our
passion for perfection to the test and
created this revolutionary innovative
device which brings demo meters to the
highest degree it's quite small I think
it's not very heavy it's it's light and
very flexible I think it doesn't disturb
the babies or the children I would
recommend the decree for parents because
it's a very minimally invasive
possibility to check the temperature so
you don't have to wake up the baby for
temperature control for especially
during the night the advantage of degree
is that you can have a curve of the
temperature so that you can see if the
temperature is fallen or if the
temperature is increasing degrees
measuring continuously
body temperature and sense this curve to
a receiving device like a smartphone so
that's for example in the night you
don't have to wake up every hour and
also wake up the child to take the
temperature because degree is simply
doing it continuously you can define
thresholds at which you want to get a
warning you also get a warning if the
temperature is too high or rising too
fast the app also shows you physicians
and pharmacy near to you and how to
contact them yeah we did a lot of
research of the size of the ear with
small children with all the children so
we found a solution where we have a
adaption of the device in size and also
a very flexible design so it can be
adapted to nearly every year it's very
comfortable and convenient so the
children don't feel the device degree is
the biggest invention in the history of
coziness we developed this device
because our daughter and I had a febrile
seizure these seizures are due to very
fast rise in temperature so you just
can't see it coming when you take the
body temperature once in a while you
need a continuous temperature curve to
see such a seizure coming so we decided
or we start thinking about developing
decrease ever continuously fever
centimeter and now here's degree the
next generation Tama meter continues
convenient
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
