have its drawbacks like finding out
where you're going and sticking together
that's why we created goat le
goat le is a GPS tracker using
long-range radio technology goat le
creates its own network goat le allows
you and whoever you're with to locate
communicate and stick together no matter
where you are go telly can run on its
own for up to two days on a single
charge and can be used on its own
without the need of any other device to
record and track your location down to
one meter accuracy when paired with a
smartphone you can use the app to view
and track the group up to 30 units go
telly is able to allow users to
communicate via text to others in
even send an SOS signal when in trouble
you give me you that peace of mind of
being able to be there when needed go
Telly's network is also able to be made
in your own home monitoring loved ones
and making sure they are safe within the
app you can also make an electronic
fence once a goat le device crosses this
invisible fence you will be alerted on
your smart device this can be helpful
when you need to be able to find and
track those who sometimes like to
venture off by themselves sometimes we
just need to know if someone is ok and
go tele makes it easy to venture out
with the security of always being able
to find your way back home get a goat le

what if your voice could be synthesized
into a video game character what if your
voice could replace the voice of Surrey
or sing to the world in any language
imagine a truly global community where
you can speak to anybody and be
understood by everybody welcome to
Babylon your voice is like a fingerprint
it's your personal signature and it
can't be replaced
Babylon is a new hardware software
technology that recognizes your unique
voice it captures a multi-dimensional
voice profile it's not just the sound of
your voice it's the internal throat data
the lip movements the cheek flutter and
all the other elements that make up your
speech Babylon takes this
multi-dimensional profile and
synthesizes your voice into new
languages so essentially it's you
speaking French speaking Mandarin
speaking Russian speaking Spanish very
soon with Babylon your voice will be
able to be synthesized in many different
languages allowing you to speak to
anybody and be understood by everybody
good morning folks don't forget to
breathe physical Sandow shows Dupree
alaya watch the valve nut cozy invective
wok emulsify continually the chance of
showers we've all seen the competition's
attempt at speech synthesis how many
people does it take just between a light
bulb and language dubbing leaves a lot
to be desired
you know slowly we cut our only way out
from a 38 potato soup Oh God so why
Babylon and why now it's time to connect
humanity and break down the last barrier
of globalization Babylon does this while
preserving your authentic voice tell me
all about it I want to know when tomato
to get us a bad communication has never
been just about words in fact only 7% of
the meaning and communication comes from
the words do you know what I mean do you
know what I mean do you know what I mean
is everything else that matters the
inflection the emotion the tone the
accent Babylon is the first technology
that can quantify all those elements
into a multi-dimensional and digital
profile and we don't use microphones to
do it
the demand duplications are massive in
entertainment education trade
telecommunications international
governments within five years in the
retail consumer environment every piece
of electronic hardware could be
outfitted with babylons unique and
patented voice synthesis technology but
how can this be done it sounds like
rocket science right our tech guys are
the top experts in the field with many
major technical innovations to their
name our strategic advisors include
NASA's Ames Research Center and Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory the
technology is fully researched design
patented and ready to go
our tech development thus far has
delivered amazing results but we need
your help to reach the next level so we
can bring this to the world
