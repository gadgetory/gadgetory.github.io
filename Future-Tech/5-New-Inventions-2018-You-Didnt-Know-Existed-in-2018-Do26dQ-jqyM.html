hello Kickstarter we are onion as makers
we use development boards to build all
sorts of cool stuff but most development
boards on the market fell short of our
expectations they're bulky confusing to
set up and over complicated we usually
spend far more time reading the
documentation than actually using them
to build things today we're changing
that
say hello to the Omega to the world's
simplest development work the Omega 2 is
tiny at less than a quarter of the size
of your credit card it can easily fit
into any project but don't be fooled by
its size the Omega 2 is powerful it is a
full Linux computer that's right
this tiny purple thing runs the same
operating system that powers some of the
world's most mission critical
infrastructure the Omega 2 works out of
the box it comes with built-in Wi-Fi and
on-board storage so it comes to life the
moment you power it on the Omega 2 is
familiar you control it with apps just
like your regular computer we even have
an app store so you can discover apps
created by the community the Omega 2 is
easy to program in fact you don't even
have to read any code it supports
node-red
a graphical tool that you can use to
create programs by simple drag-and-drop
but if you are into writing code the
omega2 supports many programming
languages pick one you're already
familiar with and start building the
Omega 2 is called connected so you can
be looking for securely from anywhere in
the world the Omega 2 is expandable we
have created many plug-and-play
expansions so adding new features to
your project will look something like
this the Omega 2 is affordable starting
at only $5 yep
5 it is cheaper than this Frappuccino we
want to lower the barrier to entry so
everyone can join the maker movement so
you see Kickstarter the problem is that
the tools for building amazing things
are just not accessible for everyone and
that is why we're working so hard for
making Omega 2 really easy to use but we
need your help can make it affordable as
well so please pack our campaign and
tell all your friends we can't wait to
see what amazing things you'll come up
with thank you
