a whole new perspective from the palm of
your hand
pictures soaring to incredible heights
of the waves and float out of a hot-air
balloon
sharing breathtaking enemies
this is micro drone when we began on
micro drone our aim was to create a
small size personal drone that was
affordable durable easy to fly that
works straight out of the box
a drone for everyone whether you fly
micro drone in extreme conditions like
on a windy beach or in delicate ones
like inside your home with its precision
control flexibility and durability you
can fly it anywhere no matter your age
or flying experience there's no other
drone like we're doing really innovative
stuff we don't cut corners we're in it
for the long run we launched the first
edition micro drove in 2011 and the
feedback was incredible we redesigned
the second edition around a modular
architecture to support a unique range
of plug and play modules it received
rave reviews in the technical journals
online blogs and even TV shows these
little drones that are like hey they're
awesome man have you seen the micro
drones your point yeah that's probably
my favorite one it's incredibly nimble
perfect if you're filming extreme sports
it is very rugged and if anything did
break its modular design means it's easy
to replace any parts now after two years
we're ready to make micro drone 3.0
micro drone 3.0 is designed with drone
enthusiasts and excellent engineers from
around
components are easily expandable
upgradable and replaceable it's also the
smallest drone to currently carry a
mechanical gimbal the HD camera streams
live footage to your smart phone the
battery slide in and out for quick hot
swapping and the plug and play smart
module simply snap on with magnets since
everything either snaps or slides in the
structure is sleek aerodynamic and
beautiful so now it's possible using a
3d printer technology like the old tea
maker 2 you can print out your own
custom frame similar to the dragon or
the wasp I was super excited when the
when the micro drone team reached out
and wanted to make a first person view
drone technology using the DODOcase VR
viewers very few people could use
first-person view
drone technology even a year ago I mean
the fact that the micro ground team is
making this technology available is
really a revolutionary idea we want to
make the quintessential drone the drone
market is evolving and together
we can drive the technology forward we
need your support so no matter who you
are we're making sure that whoever opens
the box
finds a simple
reliable affordable durable and fun
drone thank you and we look forward to
making with you the next one and only
micro drone
you
my first impression of the tick wise
tool is it fits great and it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explored the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrists twice
answer the call flip another two times
and hang it up it tracks my workouts and
it fits with my lifestyle I'm not really
what you call tech savvy but the tick
watch tubes and really easy to use
okay Tico we want sushi I can ask it to
find a nearby restaurant and it shows
the rating and the review and how far
away it is whenever I want to go for a
run I can always track all of my fitness
goals on it it's really important for me
to be able to track how I want to do my
workout if I want to use it by calories
or with distance or based on my heart
rate I was really impressed with how
convenient it was the scheduled tasks in
meetings responded my voice commands
very easily
okay Tico schedule a meeting with Bob
Williams for 7:00 a.m. tomorrow I
thought was pretty awesome that you call
an uber by just saying : Eber into your
watch and it would request one for you
it's great to be able to focus on the
tasks I have at hand instead of having
to check my phone all the time I receive
the texts I simply glance at my watch I
can dismiss it until I'm ready to reply
later you know I don't see how I've
really been able to function without it
it's really helped me be more efficient
it's made my life a lot easier when it
comes to my workouts or even just my
daily life okay Tico how's the weather
when I'm selecting a watch it actually
matters to me how it looks it's cute I
like it overall I was really impressed
with the tick walks - it's fast it's
intuitive it recognizes my voice faster
than the other SmartWatch I've ever seen
so I get to keep this right
sitting we do it for over nine hours
every single day and because of the way
we're doing it
90% of us will get back pain in our
lives seriously when we hunch and slump
it affects our mood our happiness even
how optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapy
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back
oh so that's how the palabra go Bonnie
feels awesome it's so easy to just sit
up straight this could sound weird back
and like feel my my body you know I can
feel my my organs not being squished I
can feel that it's right here but it's
not like oh I have all this on me it's
just like I am just like relieved
pain-free I'm sitting straight up right
there's like it forces your torso to
stay upright where can I get one of
these can I have this one simple it's
easy I put it on and I feel immediate
relief so that's how it feels and this
is how it's actually helping betterback
gives you better posture it allows you
to not fatigue the muscles that you use
when you're sitting down so when you do
stand up your posture is literally
changed good posture can change who you
are it affects your attitude it affects
your decision-making good posture
changes who you are literally sitting
correctly over time does more than stop
slumping stress on your spine it also
retrains your body's natural default
posture so whether you're standing or
sitting without better back your posture
is greatly improved let me show you how
it works
Fedder bag zips itself into a portable
case throw it in your bag and unpack it
when you're ready to sit wrap the back
pad around your back and the knee straps
around your knees all there's left to do
is to pull on the adjustable leg straps
to stack your spine into perfect posture
so if you're going to spend nine hours
of your day sitting you might as well be
doing it right when you're pain free and
your body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life
wherever life takes you carry the
perfect backup plan
the portable versatile talon by tactical
modern life presents challenges work
sports adventures small things can
easily blow out and become big talon

with an advanced composite technology
and world-first patent-pending design

composite materials 40% lighter than
titanium and the strength of diecast
metal plus the material tech allows you

the talon can go anywhere you do and it
complies with current tsa requirements
for air travel the australian designed
engineered and manufactured talon
multi-tool by tactical compact enough to
carry everyday lightweight enough not to
weigh you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand enough said
two years ago we bought you tactic as
first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you
Talyn pushes the limits with materials
technology and functionality its
patent-pending design is made possible
by using an advanced composite material
this makes it super strong and enables
the unique unibody design that increases
strength and hardness we've also created
a dual purpose storage compartment into
the design to function as a socket
something that hasn't been possible in a
multi-tool until now we make the Talon
in Melbourne Australia and over the past
few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations make sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery
delays will be right there in front of
the machine as they come off the line it
doesn't get any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right we've made
the decision to launch straight into the
production process because we reckon
you're going to want one or two in time
for Christmas we're tooling the molds
now and we'll be ready for full-scale
production well before Christmas thanks
for the support and look forward to
getting a talent in your hand soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
