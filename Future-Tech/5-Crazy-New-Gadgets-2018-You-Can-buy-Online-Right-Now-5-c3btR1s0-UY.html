it's one of the most important things to
our lives a lot of wearables track sleep
but tracking sleep doesn't necessarily
mean improved sleep but what if we could
change that what if we could create a
wearable which not only tracked your
sleep but improve your sleep at the same
time at them we're doing just that and
we want to work with you the Kickstarter
community to bring this project to life
we sleep for one third of our lives but
it affects us around the clock the
benefit of falling asleep faster is that
you can get more out of every day I
think the most exciting thing is that we
can change people's lives them helps you
to fall asleep quicker and this will
ultimately come or sleep across the
night the development of themm is really
based on a lot of excellent university
research that has shown a better way of
improving sleep but for the first time
now them allows this to be translated
into the home environment we start by
placing them on any of your fingers
before you go to bed Finn will then
accurately determine when you fall
asleep to the nearest minute the
algorithm then implements a retraining
program to allow people to fall asleep
more quickly that has been used by
researchers for the last 10 years this
is a simple behavioral approach to
improve your sleep but for the first
time then allows this to be carried out
in your own home this is a way to teach
people to sleep better and from our own
research we know that it works them is
about more than helping you to get to
sleep quicker tim can also help you take
the perfect power nap research from nasa
found that their astronauts performed
34% better having taken power naps
the secret to a perfect power nap is
sleeping for exactly ten minutes five
minutes won't do much for you and
sleeping for 20 minutes will leave you
feeling groggy once you wake up the
incredible accuracy of thim of knowing
when you fall asleep to the minute
allows you to take the perfect power nap
for the first time them also collects
your sleep data and provide you a sleep
score so that over time you can see how
your sleep is improving here at them
we've been heads down building for some
time we're a team of researchers
designers and engineers we collectively
have built products that people around
the world use and love and most recent
invention was the retime ER which
received worldwide acclaim at them we've
reinvented the wearable for sleep
our research is based on a peer review
evidence base this is more than a step
forward this is a quantum leap for how
we use sleep technologies we want to now
design to represent the ability to
disconnect and dream we wanted to
engineer something that you forgot
you're wearing we've done just that
fitting the components into such a small
and light package has been a challenge
we've gone through hundreds of
iterations we've given our 3d printer a
serious workout with every iteration
we've learned something new and it's
definitely improved our design the
journey so far has been thoroughly
rewarding I'm really looking forward to
seeing what's to come we would love to
work with the Kickstarter community as
we go through final design
considerations for this wearable this is
your chance to be part of something
where we change the face of wearable
technologies forever we'd love you to be
part of it and you can do that by
clicking the green button thank you
this is yo Swift it is the simplest
solution for creating a smart home by
upgrading your switch I've tried other
smart home switches most of them require
neutral wire to work and they are not
compatible with my home to install these
products I have to spend a lot of time
and money to redecorate my home yo Swit
is different it can replace your old
switch directly yo Swit doesn't require
neutral wire to work and it provides
different sockets with a wide range
voltage just remove your old switch and
connect with yo Swint your smart home is
now ready no neutral wire no pairing no
hub needed all you need is your
smartphone so what can use wit do remote
control home Lighting's adjust ceiling
fans open the curtains with just a touch
you can even set the timer and schedule
and your home will automate itself at a
specific time is that all about Yoast
whit of course not I found out that
water heaters air conditioners stoves
and even machines can be smart to
connect those devices with Yoast whit
cooker switch they perform more
efficiently conveniently and save energy
with Yoast whit even small apartments
can build a home heater blinds shades
and projection screens are able to work
with yo sweat curtain switch and my
entertainment system can also be
controlled by Yoast whit up until now
I've installed dozens of Yoast wit
products but it's such a hassle
controlling things one by one so yo Swit
brought me the group and scene mode with
a simple touch
everything is set and I can sit back and
enjoy a movie with comfort since I
connected my home with Yost wit I no
longer worry about whether I forgotten
to turn off the electricity or not
yo squid detects my presence and
automates my home keeping it safe and
lowering my bills by the way yo Swit
supports mesh and remote control I can
still check out and control everything
through the mob mob function even when I
am away from home
try it now your smart home yo Swift
developed yo suite for over two years
and now we come up with the second
generation yo suite
it's a post compatible wiring without
neutral wire remote control away from
home and mesh network we need your
support to bring the idea to real life
and tell us with the mass production
based in Hong Kong Science Park we are
an incubator specializes in Bluetooth
smart home products with years of
experience and product design and
development we are so excited to bring
Yas wit to you so support us today and
start your smart home experience away
from home
you
