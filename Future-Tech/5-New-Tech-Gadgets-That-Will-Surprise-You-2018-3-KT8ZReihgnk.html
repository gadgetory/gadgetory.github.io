really the story of all of our robots at
iRobot our goal is to make practical
robots that replace those dull or
undesirable jobs you may have in your
home but as we started talking to our
customers we realized cleaning needs
vary every home is a little different
many people today in their busy lives
like to maintain a nice clean floor in
between those major cleans and they use
things that are cloth based for example
a Swiffer and we thought we could help
in this arena as well and that robot is
Bravo
because the purpose of Brava is to give
your floor as a surface clean we knew
that unlike Roomba and Scooby's I adapt
methodology which tells the robot to
make multiple passes over the floor we
needed to develop a systematic way to
cover the floors in a single pass that's
bravas Northstar navigation system it
works like an indoor GPS to help the
robot keep track of where it has been
and where it needs to go the Northstar
navigation Cube projects a signal onto
the ceiling that Brawley uses to
determine its location as Bravo cleans
it builds a map of the area including
walls obstacles and drop-offs as it
encounters them and the thing about
Brava is that it's just so easy to use
the attach a cloth you put it down on
your floor you hit a button for dry or
damp and away the robot goes and listen
to this it's whisper quiet to
we design brava to cover your floors
quickly but also wanted to ensure that
it cleans the floors effectively that's
why we developed two cleaning modes for
Brava one for dry mopping and one for
damp mopping when dry mopping raba moves
in straight lines using dry cleaning
cloths to pick up dirt dust and hair
when damp mopping rather uses a special
back-and-forth mopping action and damp
cleaning cloths to lift surface dirt and
grime raba can also be used with the pro
clean reservoir pad after filling the
pad with water it helps dispense liquid
evenly onto a damp cleaning cloth while
cleaning your floor Bravo will pick up
dirt dust and hair from virtually any
hard surface whether it's hardwood
laminates tile even stone and keep those
floors looking shiny all week long there
is a lot of intelligence built into
Brava because of its compact size
Brava can clean under sofas tables and
get into tight areas wall following
technology allows Brava to clean dust
and dirt right along the walls
baseboards and edges of your forth
BRABUS smart built-in sensors help it
avoid stairs area rugs and raised
transitions to carpets we're really
excited to add Brava to our portfolio of
home cleaning robots we know you're
going to enjoy adding brava to your
robot fleet or bringing it home as your
first robot

IndieGoGo to make web scout a reality
what if you could control your dreams
fly over the Grand Canyon visit a
beautiful island or perhaps go back in
time to the age of dinosaurs now you can
meet I band plus the EEG brain sensing
headband for inducing lucid dreams and
improving sleep what is a lucid dream a
lucid dream is any dream in which you
become aware that you're dreaming
without you actually waking up dreams
occur almost always when you are in the
rapid eye movement phase also known as
the REM phase of your sleep
in rem phase your brain activity is
different than in the other phases of
your sleep cycle IPAM plus accurately
senses this dream phase by monitoring
variations in your brainwaves
once I've m+ census the string face it
plays audio visual cues
the subtle external stimuli of light
patterns via the LEDs on IBM Plus and
sound appear as anomalies in your dream
making your wear that you are dreaming
without them waking you up once you are
lucid in a dream you can take control of
your dream actions and consciously
reshape the dream to fulfill any fantasy
your wildest desires unrestrained by the
laws of physics or Society
lucid dreams are vivid and highly
immersive once in lucid dream you enter
a virtual world where everything you see
hear touch taste and smell is as
authentic as reality lucid dreaming has
been researched scientifically many
psychologists and researchers have
recognized that lucid dreams can help
with artistic creativity problem-solving
improving sports and language skills and
can even help people prone to nightmares
to get their fears under control sleep
is also very important to restore energy
reserves and strengthen the immune
system even minimal sleep loss affects
mood productivity ability to handle
stress and even body weight Iban plus
tracks your sleep indicate sleep quality
and gives feedback on improvement I pant
plus also has the most advanced smart
alarm feature that wakes you up with
simulated natural sunlight and sounds at
the most optimum period of sleep cycle
so that you wake up fresh every time
I pad plus headband communicates with I
band plus app on your smartphone via
bluetooth so you can conveniently check
your sleep statistics and improvement
suggestions you can even customize your
IBM plus from this app to set LED light
patterns and the brightness as well as
the audio cues developers can use our
open platform to create amazing new
experiences with future software updates
I band plus could be connected to
numerous smart devices in your home to
simplify your daily life
those were the days that quote something
like challenges the mother of invention
or hardship is Mother invention I think
necessity that's the accessory is the
term
when we were kids nothing compared to
that clock it was so rad
but as adults we get a lot of hurdles
with only eight LEDs we couldn't share
our selfies or cat photos for our memes
and then one day John said hey Nick
there's a way we can do this so in 2011
we set out to make it happen get images
to appear out of thin air
anywhere in the world anyway a hard
thing and at first it was pretty rough
thankfully come on had some good ideas
Steve brilliant rather than good that
okay we can continue fall in the
hospital recovering I've had some I
think pretty good ideas to make the
future direction of the product but then
I dug a bit deeper in some technical
areas it was heartbreaking it all down
and we struggled for a while intent but
after months of development and
temporary losing sight in one night tada
dunno
we be cool we would we would love it if
you liked it just a fraction as much as
we do
you
you
hi Kickstarter we are seven hugs we are
passionate about connected home and
expert in hardware software and print
design like you we love tech and it's
now all connected and smart but every
single device comes with its own mobile
app or remote control whatever was a
simple way to control everything
meet Smart Remote the most advanced
control system for your home Smart
Remote gives you the ability to control
any device
now Wi-Fi Bluetooth our infrared simply
point at the device you want to control
and Smart Remote screen adapts instantly
black magic
we have also integrated your favorite
services you can point at your door to
order an uber or at your window to check
the weather the possibilities are
endless
Smart Remote comes with a charging base
and free room sensors which are used for
indoor positioning setup is super easy
just place the sensors in the room where
you would like to use Smart Remote and
that's it our patent-pending technology
combines an indoor positioning system
with motion tracking sensors allowing
Smart Remote to be incredibly accurate
and highly responsive after years of
research and development we are now
ready to start prediction for the design
jealous panting word savelic snow
reported is also possible - Irina dotty
teapot is a cellular reasonably smart
phone with a tilaka moment initially
moving on for you it is an extremis up
with a solid piece of a q-tip with
possible areas to build a perfectly
designed product we tested dozens of
prototypes we worked with a leading
global manufacturer to build a fantastic
high-definition screen for the Smart
Remote
but you have seen is just the beginning
we want a smart remote to be the only
reemerge will ever need be the first to
receive it and help us build an amazing
product that you will love using every
day join us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
