never miss another update
why choose one decor when you can turn
your wall into an interactive canvas
meets gribbit the world's first right in
the race robot that creates a different
image whenever you want to nails and a
plug is all you need to install Scriven
and thanks to the app it's always
connected create an image or source it
from the web then upload it to the app
and scribble will reproduce it on your
wall within minutes and if you get tired
of the design no worries
scribble will just erase it and you can
start over again you can connect script
to your favorite apps and show you the
latest news and weather forecast or even
your Twitter updates any surfaces game
whiteboard glass or standard plaster
and with four color options the
possibilities are endless the only limit
is your imagination
leafless box what's the weather like
tomorrow what's the terrible day wake me
up at the seven o'clock baby I set the
alarm at 7:00
hi Kickstarter's i'm Mattia I designed a
realized reflex box it's the only Wi-Fi
charger that works with many additional
functions now forget the best and focus
on reflex box
what's the worth in life now
remember to take your umbrella
nice day is the way to begin your day
with a smile when we switch off the
alarm we could wake up watching your
favorite pictures or video reflex box
the clever box
I love my laptop I rely on it every day
and I take it everywhere but
economically laptops are not ideal
the longer we spend on them the more we
hunch leading to tension or pain in our
neck to shoulders and back which is why
we've designed the timing tower are
portable and height adjustable laptops
they're the tiny tower allows you to set
up and get to work in no time whether
it's at the office at home in a cafe or
wherever it has an elegant design which
integrates beautifully with your laptop
helping you work comfortably and protect
your posture I suffered a serious disc
herniation in my neck
after hunching over my laptop for too
long I realized that a lot of existing
products don't really solve the problem
and they're not something I want on my
desk so as an industrial designer I
decided to create a product that laptop
users would be proud to own the tiny
Tower has a clever push-button mechanism
that adjusts your laptop screen to a
height that suits you there are 10
different height levels about
when you're done it takes seconds to
fall down flat into a compact and
lightweight unit that you can take
anywhere it's compatible with both Mac
and Windows laptops from 11 to 15 inches
in size your laptop sits firmly and
securely on a non-slip grip all for
added security
the tiny Tower has fingers you can
extend we've also created a high quality
zipped nylon pouch to carry your Tiny
Tower keyboard and mouse we've been
working on this project for over 18
months during development
we tested seven different prototypes to
get every detail just right we wanted to
find the perfect balance of
functionality and simplicity and to
create something you'd be proud to own
and use we decided on aluminium as the
main material because it's strong
lightweight and durable the aluminium is
precision cartoon bead blasted and
anodized to give that lustrous semi
matte finish
hi I'm Matt and I'm anti together we've
created the tiny
the money we raise will pay for the
tools molds and materials we need to get
the planning tower into production if
you want a stylish clever solution
that's as portable as your laptop and
you care about your posture and
well-being while you work and we'd love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
