what if you could connect to any device
with a single cable are you ready for
ten times more speed and a two times
more powerful cable introducing neck
neato
crafted with the highest quality
materials including rare earth neodymium
magnets 18 karat gold plated connectors
shielded with aerospace aluminum
combining the latest advanced circuitry
technology for smarter and safer
charging on both ends the world's first
groundbreaking patent-pending reversible
cross device USB 3.0 magnetic cable
featuring 10 times faster data transfer
speed and a 2 times more powerful cable
compared to a traditional USB 2.0 cable
by harnessing the force of nature
you can effortlessly insert the magnetic
tip to both ends of the device and the
magneto cable immediately magnetizes and
snaps to the devices the breakthrough
concept of the both end magnetic
connector cable successfully opens the
door to multi device connectivity for
SuperSpeed charging and data sick
meaning you can cross connect almost any
device between USB Lightning Android
type C mini USB and beyond Magneto was
born out of the creators frustration
with our daily lives caused by all the
different types of devices we first
created a prototype by putting some
existing product components together and
we spend months with countless hours to
complete the design we knew this was
going to be a great product that we got
to share with the world
to reinvent a new standard of USB cables
we have accomplished the most
sophisticated test
combined with the highest quality
materials to design a state-of-the-art
USB cable our team has chosen the
largest manufacturer that's made over a
hundred million electronic devices for
many of the top brands to build this
awesome design and we're ready to go we
need your support for our campaign to
help us bring this super charging cable
to the market be part of us as
contributors you are welcome to write us
with a new suggestion or new ideas for
further improvement of magneto within
the period of the campaign magneto is
the world's most powerful magnetic USB
cable for everything
breathing is the most natural and
important thing we do and every day
almost 3000 gallons of air fill our
lungs air is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sleep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only outside but it's the complete
opposite many studies have proved that
indoor air is up to five times more
polluted than outdoor air this is why we
created theory Clery is the most amazing
natural air purifier powered by real
fans that helps people in reducing
indoor air pollution and it will be the
best design object you will ever have on
the market right now there are only
traditional electronic air purifiers
made in plastic very ugly big and bulky
and in early where thanks to filters
this is why we thought about something
revolutionary and we created the perfect
synergy between nature technology and
design so how does Clery work we
designed a smart flower pot that
amplifies the natural properties of fans
our idea started from a research of NASA
they found out that some plants have got
the ability to eliminate toxic age the
problem is that a single plant isn't
that effective so we created a
technology unit that allows more air
flow through the soil and the roots this
is where the filtration happens we use
plants as biofilters roots and soil
generate colonies of microorganism that
trap and filter the toxic agents in year
in a natural way
clearing fact-filled is 93% of toxic
agents immediately
it's very silent and has a very low
energy consumption less than 50% other
LED bulb you can manage it with your
smartphone and the best thing is that
there are no filters so you don't have
to change them and waste money what
happens inside is not magic but a
scientific fact and we proved it we did
many researchers and prove the
effectiveness of Clery at limber one of
the most important research labs on
plants in europe and peanut a spin-off
of the University of Florence based in
Italy Cleary is also proudly an Italian
design product we work hard for a year
to design it in every
we developed with multiple sketches and
prototypes to make the design perfect we
presented it at CES 2016 and had great
success we have a super team with two
brilliant industrial designers and a
great advisory team that helps us Italy
has a long tradition of craftsmen
especially in the ceramic field this
Italian culture is an inspiration for us
we use a ceramic first for the suitable
quality but mostly because it's
eco-friendly and it doesn't release any
toxic agents in the year obviously we
also work really hard on the technology
part of our product we came to the
Silicon Valley to make something really
powerful we've developed our technology
working close with engineers and
manufacturers in the Silicon Valley to
improve the functionalities of Clery
thanks to our technology unit in our
smartphone app with health and air
quality sensors clear is able to track
the toxic agent in year and give you
real-time pollution and lt analytics of
it and also temperature and humidity
monitoring Clery lives with you telling
what's wrong maybe allergies sleep
problem productivity asthma it learns
about you and cares about you it works
with Wi-Fi so wherever you are clear it
can give you healthy tips on how to feel
better and tell you something is going
wrong please bake our product
ears ringing the morning after that's
the sound of damage found that me and my
friends had the same problem so I wanted
to find a solution
I wondered a protects that protected my
ears but still member I could enjoy
going to gigs with loud music without
feeling like I was listening to music
underwater conventional earplugs are
fiddly and cool and not fun to wear
especially at concerts in gates because
they make the music sound muffled
through developing our earphones which
was successfully funded on Kickstarter
last year I discovered a revolutionary
way of protecting our ears I'd like to
introduce isolate ear protectors
traditional ear protection products try
to absorb sound from entering your ears
they ruin your music experience and fail
to isolate you properly from bass
frequencies and you miss out on the
details of the higher frequencies making
what you do here sound very unbalanced
by using our own patent-pending
technology
I discovered a way I could create ear
protectors that don't absorb sound they
block it giving you sensation that you
are simply lowered the volume using
flower isolator a concert is really
something else you can hear every
instrument every detail a safe low level
like never before everyone who loves
gonna gigs and festivals is going to
love isolate they take out Peaks and
excessive bass which means you can hear
details at constants that's normally
masked and no dangerous ear pain from
sudden whistles or screams from behind
you in the crowd our bodies and bone
structure act like dynamic dampeners to
your ears as the sound gets louder your
body feels everything but your is stay
safe and an amazing comfort with
isolates you simply pinch roll and
insert they can be used in any
environment you wish to isolate your
ears from we use the highest quality
materials in the design of isolate solid
titanium and aluminium our entry-level
isolate products are solid aerospace
aluminum and are isolate Pro uses solid
titanium for the ultimate airport
experience
titanium is a denser of the two metals
and so attenuates sound to a higher
level as you can see the isolate design
is finalized a minute ago now you too
can be one of the very first people in
the world to join the ear protection
revolution isolate by Flair longer days
