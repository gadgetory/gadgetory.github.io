and of course we want to do everything
on the go
so we fearlessly use public Wi-Fi
networks in restaurants airports
shopping malls coffee shops you name it
but are these networks safe while we
enjoy the convenience of these public

can cost us on a bad day by creating
fake hotspots or hijacking public
hotspots hackers can view all of your
private communications what's more they
can access your valuable data including
your bank account your passwords even
the photos you have stored on your
device hello my name is Aslam Ottawa I
spent the last 30 years in cyber
security I was searching a way to
protect myself in others when we connect
to private or public Wi-Fi networks I'm
proud to announce that they finally
created a device that will keep us all
safe it's small and fit into your pocket

constantly monitored the network traffic
to and from our devices so it can stop
the attack before they happen

device that's always on the lookout for
Wi-Fi hack Wi-Fi wall constantly
monitors all traffic on whatever network
you connect you and if it detects any
malicious or suspicious activity it
automatically alerts you to the problem
and most importantly immediately
disconnects your device using Wi-Fi wall

leave your house and you can surf the
web with confidence wherever you go the

hackers the truth is that while using
these devices on the go may be
convenient

of intensive testing we've developed a
working prototype of our product the
next step is to get into production and
into the hands of users all over the
world
