and of course we want to do everything
on the go
so we fearlessly use public Wi-Fi
networks in restaurants airports
shopping malls coffee shops you name it
but are these networks safe while we
enjoy the convenience of these public
Wi-Fi networks we forget how much they
can cost us on a bad day by creating
fake hotspots or hijacking public
hotspots hackers can view all of your
private communications what's more they
can access your valuable data including
your bank account your passwords even
the photos you have stored on your
device hello my name is Aslam Ottawa I
spent the last 30 years in cyber
security I was searching a way to
protect myself in others when we connect
to private or public Wi-Fi networks I'm
proud to announce that they finally
created a device that will keep us all
safe it's small and fit into your pocket
it doesn't require any software and it
constantly monitored the network traffic
to and from our devices so it can stop
the attack before they happen
Wi-Fi wall is a standalone software free
device that's always on the lookout for
Wi-Fi hack Wi-Fi wall constantly
monitors all traffic on whatever network
you connect you and if it detects any
malicious or suspicious activity it
automatically alerts you to the problem
and most importantly immediately
disconnects your device using Wi-Fi wall
is easy just turn Wi-Fi wall on when you
leave your house and you can surf the
web with confidence wherever you go the
device fits on your keychain or in your
pocket doesn't require any new software
cables or cords and has a rechargeable
battery that lasts all day every year
millions of Wi-Fi users lose data to
hackers the truth is that while using
these devices on the go may be
convenient
it isn't always safe but with Wi-Fi wall
we can change that after a long period
of intensive testing we've developed a
working prototype of our product the
next step is to get into production and
into the hands of users all over the
world
but to do that we need your help support
our campaign today so we can manufacture
Wi-Fi wall on a large scale and bring
this product to market at a price
everyone can afford backers of our
campaign will get Wi-Fi wall first and
at a reduced price but most of all they
get the assurance right away that
they're surfing the web safely
oh hello I was wondering what do you get
when you combine a MacBook Pro a
powerful GPU and an Arduino into a
single maker PC well tell you the boat

another single board computer this is on
a on a whole new level it's revolution
it's powered by AMD Rison embedded Li
1000 processor and it allows to make
impossible things possible you don't
believe me well let's have a look
imagine for instance to create an AI
powered robots or a computer vision
project with the power of usable both of
them are adhesive tape with its
lightning-fast TPU you can play three
play games like lol or fortnight in Full
HD plus beautiful T's VR erm looks
reality ready
it's also the ultimate a demon portable
workstation this amazing ball runs evens
the earliest ideas and design software
and is perfect for 3d rendering and
there's no better HDC you do both can
handle up to four screens at once so you
can relax um watch a movie with your
friends in art right stick also you to
bolt is perfect for digital creativity
software like unity Max or
openFrameworks it means that you can
finally a physical beautiful and
augmented work away the boat is not just
powerful it's also flexible yes it's a
super mini PC now prevent the maker
world we need your help
