the idea of Ultraman started two years
ago and our team of engineers and
designers have been working tirelessly
on creating a perfect mix of design and
technology and here it is in its final
shape packed with super abilities
five minutes they're both here man again
not this thing that was a home meet your
personal Superman so what do you think
did they understand they need to back
this project in order to get
vultureman's of their pockets folks we
are so close to finalizing this project
but we need your help to start
manufacturing voltar man
so back this project today and let's
make this a reality
the vibe is a magical product that
allows us to experience infinite new
world from the comfort of our own homes
however as game-changing as it is
discomfort can be a real issue heat
buildup the vigorous gameplay can
quickly spoil the experience we're
passionate about VR and wanted to solve
the problem so we created the vive in
chill
well it's not quite that powerful but
the feeling of relief is the same the
vibe until was designed to be easy to
use effective and maintain a compact
form factor allowing it to disappear
into the headset and let you focus on
gaming first as we set out to find a new
solution we explored many different
pathways we experimented with countless
fan types and built iteration after
iteration of prototypes to focus on
parking air into the headset it didn't
take long to realize that most users
experienced problems with dry eyes high
noise levels and low airflow in the end
we discovered that dissipating the heat
generated across the forehead provided a
much more substantial benefit than
forcing air into the headset ISM our
goal is to create a product that you
couldn't go back to VR without and had
no annoying side effects it had to have
a minimal noise footprint work reliably
be convenient to use and it's stolen
under a minute with no modification to
the headset it also had to be
lightweight and nearly invisible in the
end we've succeeded with the vive intial
the rigorous scientific play testing
we've engineered the best possible
solution to meet these objectives I'm
not even kidding is so much
those really professional and pleasure
to fall off easily not to mention I miss
my head tool so let's go huge this is
clutch man this crucial need to have
this up huh currently we're in the
pre-production release phase of the
project in order to make the violin
chill affordable for everyone we need

this project a reality
