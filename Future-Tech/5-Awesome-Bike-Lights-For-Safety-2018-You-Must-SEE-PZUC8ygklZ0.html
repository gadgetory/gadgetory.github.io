the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycle
introducing luma a 360 degrees light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bike front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles grips three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway though it makes you visible
luma itself is almost invisible it has a
compact elegant design that does not
interfere with the looks of your bike
the body is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum the same alloy used for
helicopters and airplanes it's tough
almost indestructible we've paid special
attention to the surface finish anodized
ultrasonic cleaned and hand brushed for
a premium look finally each set comes
with built-in lithium batteries that are
easily charged through a standard
microUSB port
we love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good but one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety cup us
spread the word and save the world
get a luma for someone you care for it's
not just the light it's all you need to
see and be seen as with the original
this new version of Revo lights will
provide unprecedented 360-degree
visibility with a functional headlight
that allows you to see where you're
going and a smart taillight that can
sense your speed and will flash when
slowing down
we're on IndieGoGo to add the next level
of function into our newest version of
the lights we want to add in the ability
to connect our already smart lights to
your phone to provide a number of
awesome features for starters real time
battery life so you can make sure your
lights are always ready for your next
ride with Eclipse the battery now snaps
directly into the ring making it much
more accessible while removing any need
for cables or parts near the hub and
making installation a snap we want our
lights to work with any riding style so
this new version will include a feature
that recognizes the time of day and
turns the lights on for you if it senses
you're about to ride to achieve the
lighting effect Revo lights calculate
your speed and for the first time we'll
be able to give you this data so you can
accurately track your speed and distance
and work towards writing goals when
developing Revo lights we focused on
creating innovative essential tools for
commuters like handlebar activated turn
signals to make it easier to grab a
drivers attention when turning we also
plan to add features for any commuter
like weather alerts letting you know
ahead of time what to expect and
ensuring you never get caught without
your jacket but with all these added
functions we wanted to make sure your
lights are secure so just like with the
previous version of our lights they are
designed to be locked up along with your
wheels so if you do have to leave your
bike on the street you don't have to
worry about removing them or having them
stolen to celebrate the launch of
Eclipse we partnered with Pier fix to
bring you special edition bicycles with
Revo lights already installed
exclusively for IndieGoGo whether you're
an everyday commuter or a more casual
rider we have you covered with the Revo
lights Coolidge and Revo lights and roil
bicycles
we cyclists are the most vulnerable
users of the road to wheels to balance
no chasis to protectors and we still
need to use our hands to communicate
with cars blinkers is the one thing that
was missing for cyclists to be safer and
to be a natural powerful Road it starts
with the regular bike lights that you
know the blinkers actually backs
everything you need to be seen on the
stood and respected by everyone else in
the road with blinkers cars will always
know when you are turning and when you
are breaking a laser projection makes
you even more visible and allows cars to
understand better what is your space and
what is their space blinkers were
designed to fit in your life it has no
buttons and turns on as soon as you plug
it in
blinkers also has a powerful battery and
is very easy to recharge blinkers is the
ultimate safety solution for sight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
