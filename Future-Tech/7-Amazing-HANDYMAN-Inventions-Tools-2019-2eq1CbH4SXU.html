and never miss another update just
because a job doesn't require a hardhat
doesn't mean head injury risks don't
exist
mechanics airline workers and in-home
service employees are often working in
tight quarters with nothing but a ball
cap or a few hair follicles between
their heads and potential bumps bruises
and seriously nasty cuts the new
scholars 89 45 universal bump cap insert
adds lightweight breathable head
protection to just about any cap or hat
just turn your cap over and place the
insert inside next fold back your cap
sweatband and tuck the insert behind it
until it's entirely behind the sweatband
then fold the sweatband back over the
insert and smooth out as needed you can
now put your trusty ball cap to work
protecting against on-the-job injuries
insert not fitting properly no problem
simply remove the insert from the cap
and starting at the rear slowly cut
along the recess line with a sharp
scissors then reinsert the shell and get
to work

sheet materials for cuts and works as a
temporary work bench or table base

strut is a replaceable polymer PTO
that helps to avoid contact damage
between the blade and steel struts while

between them with the slide action it's
all powered by a lithium ion battery
that stays charged for up to 18 months
need an extra hand you've got it the
WORX SD driver with automatic screw
holder get yours today hi I'm Mel with
Little Giant ladders here to show you
one of our newest ladders called the
velocity starts off just a little over
four foot seven inches tall but if you
need a 5 foot 6 foot or a 7 foot high
stepladder it's as simple as rotating it
straight open like this now if you want
to work on ground that's not level
whether that's ramps sloping ground or
staircases you literally can take this
ladder right up the stairs with you as
you go now the one I use the most around
my home when you want to get close to a
window or wall normal ladders the higher
you go up the further from the wall or
window you get but watch this we're
going to drop this down to a 90 degree
angle get right next to that tight
corner it's much easier to work in those
tight spots now when you need to get up
a little bit higher just rotate this
straight open and now you have what's
equivalent to a 17 foot lean-to
extension ladder now that's 15 feet tip
to tip but you can reach 17 when your
work
it has the wide flares at the top and at
the bottom bring it back down
you're gonna store this again just a
little over 4 feet 7 inches tall but one
of the great things about the velocity
you'll notice at the bottom it has
wheels so you'll never have to carry a
ladder again just wheel it from place to
place that right there is the easiest
you'll ever carry a 17 foot ladder
inside of a house without knocking paint
off the walls we do make the velocity in
a 13 foot which is three foot seven the
model 17 which is a four foot seven and
one foot taller the model 22 velocity
great ladder great addition to your home
and all the tools you use around it this
here the brick II mean template
key features four stainless steel spring
clogs porpoise beam when you lay it on
the course they keep the tool simpler
than place we learn the closed end up
here at the end of a wall to begin get a
mortar into the collar wear section
press a tome into a scrape it across
just like so no coolant here because the
perfect square pair to begin who will
know swing the tool around and as you
see the back and hero to open its bridge
so as we reposition it on the wall slide
the tool along as we go
pressing our mortar dome into the
cutaway section and scraping it across
we come to the corner now look at this
then log underneath hits a corner brick
we finish perfect we come round again to
look at the back here ensures we join on
to perfection and away we go again all
design for speed and ease so when we
come to putting on a brick we just
gently press the dome into that with the
perfect template now again to settle at
the end of a brick pointed in remove the
excess remove the guide the perfect
vertical joint knows well to put on our
next brick again just gently pressing
that home to give you that choice secure
10 millimeter joint note all around your
brick know we need to come to the far
end of our wall set off the end as well
to pull our string Line so we get
perfect straight lines I bring you to me
it's my second invention again pure
simplicity here I set a metric brackets
the keeping the lip here on the top
which ensures when you settle on the
corner of your brick you're lying cannot
slip we can no place on the bricks
within the course we just bring the top
edge of a brick no to meet our spring
line here you have it we've uniform
clean joints with perfect squared lines
we just need to point over joints so my
final invention the pro pointer what's
unique about this it's multi-dimensional
you were 12 in each and six millimeter
pointing surface one of them will always
get in and strike up your joint and give
you that perfectly pointed finish just
get out there and fill something
beautiful because remember
