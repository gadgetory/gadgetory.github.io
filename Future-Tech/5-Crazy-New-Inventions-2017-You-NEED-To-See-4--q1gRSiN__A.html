consumer product that will be in the
highest of demand but we need your help
to make drop printer a reality please
support us and drop printer right now hi
my name is Justin and my name is Adam we
have worked on this project for one year
would you lot of works such as the
industry design programming and debug
and now what we need is finalized our
product and the master production so we
need your support in making a project
come true and reaching our goal thank
you
you
more and more the world is moving to
using machines first we had typewriters
and calculators huge improvements over
pencil and paper after the so-called
universal machine the computer comes in
for the majority of people they're going
to a screen and they stay at the screen
for seeing people show up in the
workforce with injuries in their 20s you
know stress repetitive injuries that we
didn't use to see until their 40s so
little problems develop over a long
period of time we went through this
phase we're sitting is the new smoking
etc and so people said oh well it's the
opposite of sitting at standing so we
should just stand and now the research
is really going towards this idea of
prolonged physical inactivity being
problematic and relatively small changes
in motion can have a big effect on that
if you take people working in cubicles
and what we found was the people
pretended to have obesity was seated to
the quarter hours of war than people who
will leave don't worry nothing will fall
on you we wanted to make a system that
was really easy to move throughout the
day by lowering those barriers to
movement and making it very easy for the
person to move but without interrupting
their workflow what we believe is
different tasks are best done in
different positions if I'm on the phone
I want to be standing I want to even
maybe be pacing but if I'm doing
something where I really need to go into
deep thinking then I really want my body
to be comfortable so what we're trying
to do is how do you get the computer to
move to where the body wants it to be
and to be able to do that at the press
of a button so there's no barrier to
move
and your work just keeps flowing so what
the workplace the future looks like in
10 years on one hand not predictable
because less than 10 years ago we didn't
have iPhones right think about that now
on the other hand it probably looks a
lot like it did 10 years ago which on
the surface is very similar but in the
details and the way we interact with
stuff very different we think that more
and more people will be saying I want to
the computer to move with me i need
movement throughout the day and we're
looking to support that kind of vision
this is the gosun stove a mighty little
solar oven that takes just 20 minutes to
prepare a meal can roast up to 3 pounds
at a time reaching temperatures over 700
degrees and all without the use of field
it's fast easy to use in a safe to touch
even while bleeding hi hello I'm Patrick
of applied sunshine and I've been
working with the solar energy industry
and trying to get it to power our lives
for the past 12 years I pulled a solar
collector off a rooftop at up at a home
here and I brought the the solar
collector down to my backyard I started
tinkering with it you know I'm kind of a
do-it-yourselfer and before long I'd
gone up to the refrigerator pulled out
some hot dogs fired them inside the tube
and next thing you know I've got lunch
immediately you know I'm thinking wow
this is some unbelievable potential this
this technology has got real capability
here to cook food and serve Annie
in one simple durable and portable
package the ghost son is ready for
action for our fast-paced
the gosun stove can fry bake and boil
wherever and whenever the sun is shining
summer or winter
the integrated stand allows it to be set
horizontally when roasting foods and
with a simple adjustment positioned
vertically to sterilize water or brew
coffee
smoke inhalation is one of the world's
leading causes of death due to the more
than three billion people still cooking
with wood and charcoal beyond the human
toll it puts tremendous pressures on the
environment in the finances and health
of family women in rural India spend on
average 50 hours a week gathering
firewood and haitian families often
spend as much as fifty percent of their
income under
this has to stop we aim to use the gosun
stove to help break the cycle of poverty
while reducing pressures on critical
resources
giving is at the core of our business
model that applied sunshine with every
five purchases we will equip and train a
family to use a go sun for their daily
needs or partnering with nonprofits
around the globe to make this technology
transfer a success as we grow our plan
is to expand the program empowering
thousands more for two years we've been
crafting every working prototype by hand
and now it's time for larger scale
production we will need startup capital
to make this great product to reality
for families around the world with this
seed money we have a viable business and
can go into production by funding our
campaign you'll make the gosun stove
affordable and allow us to supply this
underserved market potentially saving
thousands of lives and acres of forest
we've only scratched the surface of what
this evacuated tube technology has to
offer we're looking for creative users
to come up with more recipes accessories
and uses for the gosun I hope you decide
to join the clean cookstove movement and
sponsor our campaign ordering a ghost
son stove will not only make for fun in
the Sun but will help us share the power
of solar cooking in the developing world
this is the gosun stove a mighty little
solar oven that takes just 20 minutes to
prepare a meal thank you

hi i'm jason and i'd like to introduce
the go hamid this tiny stuff sack
contains an oversized 11 foot long
hammock designed to be the most
comfortable one you've ever tried i call
it to go hammock because it's designed
to go anywhere with you and it can be
set up in a snap the level of comfort it
provides makes it perfect for sleeping
napping or relaxing it's lightweight and
portable and is great for camping hiking
picnics or just lounging in the backyard
if you back this project you'll be among
the first to experience the amazing
comfort of this hammock and at a great
price over the years I purchased many
hammers but I couldn't find one that was
really comfortable as a matter of fact I
can only to them for a few minutes
before feeling discomfort so I set out
to design the most comfortable hammock
possible after extensive research in the
building of many prototypes I came up
with the go Hammett and it's so well
built it may be the last hammock river
by made from extra strong deputy D nylon
you can count on the go hammock for
years to come the go hammock eliminates
uncomfortable pressure points by
distributing the users body weight more
evenly than traditional hammocks it's
generous size allows freedom to move
around and makes it easy to find lots of
comfortable positions even for side
sleepers to reduce the curved body
position that's associated with hammocks
experts recommend lying at a diagonal
angle to enable the user to lie even
flatter we made the go hammock extra
long and wide at 11 feet it's much
longer than most hammocks this extra
length helps flatten out the body
position dramatically at 70 inches wide
one can lie in an even greater angle
flattening the body position even more
large hammocks can sometimes have
annoying loose fabric on the sides to
eliminate this problem I designed
removable fabric tensioners that pull
the loose fabric out of the way the
tensioners make folds in the fabric
giving the hammock its unique shape
every go hammock ships with a carabiner
and a rope loop to use with a suspension
system of your choice our optional tree
straps with cinch bubbles make set up a
breeze and they're easy to adjust simply
tilt the buckle pull the strap and
you're good to go these heavy-duty
polyester straps won't stretch like
nylon straps that are commonly used with
hammocks to take the guesswork out of
setting up your hammock I recommend
using our optional Ridgeline you see an
order for a hammock to be as comfortable
as possible it must be set up with a
certain amount of sag our ridge line
sets the sag for maximum comfort every
time it also makes a great place to hang
items while enjoying your hammock I've
been designing and manufacturing outdoor
equipment since 2007 and I know what it
takes to bring a product from design to
production this prototype was made the
same factory that we making your go
hammock everything's in place for us to
begin production and we should have our
backers order ship this summer but we
need your help to make this project a
reality so please check out the rewards
below and reserve your go having today
because you deserve to be comfortable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
