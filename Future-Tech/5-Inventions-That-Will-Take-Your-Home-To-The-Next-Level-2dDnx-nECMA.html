never miss another update this is a
cybereye coffee table the sober is a
feature of furniture designed for your
connected lifestyle with a refrigerator
drawer
bluetooth speakers and charging ports
the sober it keeps you powered up and in
the moment technology has changed over
the past 20 years these days were
looking for quick solutions to solve our
problems and ways to simplify our lives
this got us thinking while everything
around us is advanced why hasn't
furniture this is why we designed the
sober Oh coffee table
furniture reinvented for your modern
lifestyle so bro uses a bluetooth
pairing with its built-in speakers to
provide excellent sound quality
that's cord free you can also set the
mood with the ambient LED lighting
design with a large refrigerator draw
the coffee table keeps beverages and
food chill and always within reach
charge your phone and laptop with the
outlets on the side of the table when
you're done
roll up your cord and stash them in the
drawers
we're excited to bring so bro to
IndieGoGo we've created a prototype and
have our manufacturing partners in place
all we need is your help to start
production and begin shipping the sober
a coffee table to your living room we
believe that so bro is a future of
furniture because it makes living a
connected life more convenient please
back us today can help make this sober a
coffee table a reality
this is a smart safe mother we're going
out of town for a few days before we're
just having guests over we like to keep
our valuables hidden unsecure smart
safes our line of products designed to
look like everyday household objects but
are actually hidden compartments we
tried other safes and they were either
way too big and bulky or they just took
way too long to get into which can be a
problem when storing objects you need
daily access to like jewelry or
prescription medication the vent fits
between two studs which makes it easy
for anyone to install
smart safes use your phone to open up
and they give you a variety of ways to
access your safe different open options
allow me to customize my level of
security oh and if you don't have a
smartphone or you just don't want to use
one you can always use your RFID card to
open up the app keeps track every time
your smart States used now you know who
opens your safe and when the shelves
come in a variety of colors and styles
which makes it easy to find the one that
matches your home now your valuables are
locked and secured well conveniently
accessible hidden in plain sight office
chairs are usually somewhat standard
some have more bells and whistles than
others but for the most part nothing
really stands out that is until a
scooter chair hit the market
retired nostalgic Vespa scooters are
getting brought back to livelihood
original frames from the two-wheeled
vehicles received some padding then they
are upholstered in leather chrome legs
and wheels add a touch of elegant beauty
and the end result is a vintage looking
swivel chair simply called the Vespa
chair the barcelona-based designers from
Bell and valve are the masterminds
behind that anything but boring
creations the undoubtedly nifty seat is
said to be very comfortable completing
the retro funky appearance our fully
functioning flashing lights the designer
stated the traditional character of the
piece combined with modern lines makes
it a unique product and a sample of the
most avant-garde art design the piece
also means an extra emotional charge for
all Vespa lovers how do you like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
