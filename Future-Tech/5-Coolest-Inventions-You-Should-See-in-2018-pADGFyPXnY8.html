breaths we take but by the moments that
take our breath away our team is
dedicated to creating the perfect gear
for your biggest adventure
mean alley light
360-degrees source of light and safety
we're taking it on a journey with you
its primary objective is to bring vision
emitting high luminescence made for the
most difficult journeys and crafty with
precision
unleash the power by the touch of a
button
the light placed economically in a
revolving manner around your waist makes
you visible and safe from every
direction no matter where you focus all
obstacles on the go are well illuminated
alley light is uninterested to
environment water-resistant and smart
in case of emergency beacon message
anyone you select
when you explore the magic of the world
alley light gives you freedom to get the
most out of it and brings you back home
safely
introducing the Simtek smart sensor
reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secure and things like
closets jewelry boxes gun safes and
storage units but who's watching your
stuff when you're not around and how do
you truly know it's safe every year up
to 600 thousand guns are stolen and many
are used in suicide accidents and crimes
despite the growing popularity of gun
safes here are the problems colonel arms
are designed for houses and not saves
gun owners don't want smart technology
that could restrict the use of their
firearms I decided to change that and
that's why I developed Simtek a simple
and effective way to monitor any
enclosed space like your gun safe the
moment your safe is opened Simtek sends
you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands my gun earning friends tell
me that there's no easy way to reliably
monitor their saves but nobody wants a
product that could potentially restrict
the use of their guns and that's why I
developed sim tech a smart sensor that
can be used anywhere in anything to help
keep you and your things safe gun owners
around the country have been testing sim
tech and we've received great feedback
Engineering and design are complete and
we're ready for mass production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
most people want to see what's going on
around the property but they honestly
don't want to do the wiring and all the
hassle and everything it takes to
actually put up cameras
like hem requires no drilling no wires
no hassle you just plug it in turn it on
and it works
we designed like Kim to be the most
versatile and affordable camera for your
house your camera is HD its impaired so
it can see in the dark so first of all
if you have a taller structure if you
have a shorter one you can actually
telescope it up and down when you pick
your viewing angle it'll actually rotate
side to side depending on where you'll
actually want to see your actual lens
comes out so you can aim your camera
down if you have a vertical sconce you
can actually go ahead and switch that so
you can get the viewing angle you want
this telescoping lens actually can
connect up with the glass of your
enclosure what that means is you're not
gonna have glare or any of the blinding
kind of like hey the infrareds bouncing
off the glass or the light is bouncing
off the glass I can't see anything at
night it's got motion activation so if
you have visitors you're gonna know
about it
it has 2-way voice on it you're gonna be
able to adjust the colors light cam is
designed with high-end Cobb LEDs so your
light should last you know 15 to 20
years
I mean we've spent basically two years
perfecting every piece we could to make
sure that it work in as many different
situations as possible light cam is an
amazing product and it's gonna benefit a
ton of people we really appreciate you
guys watching this and we hope that
you'll help us by backing the campaign
and by sharing it with your friends and
family so that we can bring this great
product to everybody we live in a world
of invisible beauty electronics are
everywhere
a mysterious life is hiding inside these
black boxes party machine sheds light on
it more than a book
poppy machine is a series of six
experiences where electricity paper
plane and graphics meet to unveil the
invisible aesthetics of electronics it
all starts with paper you will get it
fold it assemble it draw on it build
with it and above all you will play with
it printed with silver ink its
possibilities are extended while
beautiful this special ink also conducts
electricity with bubbly machine you will
bring paper to life you will play music
many girl challenge gravity you will
create a whole family of toys with a
simple button cell a sound component a
mobile role and your pencil Hey
we are puppy machine from Paris this is
me onions on your right and these are
her fail and mayo both designers running
their own studio we've been working on
patty machine for almost three years now
intrigued by those black boxes around us
we started exploring our day to day
devices and we discovered an invisible
world made of materials graphics and
even smell circuits hide a surprising
narrative potential that we wanted to
make visible we studied a list of all
the existing components and try to
rebuild them ourselves MacGyver style
that's when we realize the potential of
combining paper with electronics we
learn about conductive ink we managed to
get some and made experiments to master
it it meant testing testing testing and
testing we know circuits in a functional
way in puppy machine we considered them
as any kind of print so we designed them
playing with colors and shapes our first
prototype of Paquime machine received
the red dot design award later on thanks
to the Audi talent world we had the
opportunity to exhibit that The Wizard
is a decorative in Paris
thus testing puppy machines effect for
the first time
with all your feedbacks we went back to
work to make this project become a real
product we made choices to reach high
quality expectations paper binding
colors reliable partners everything had
to be perfect and in this really
feasible and here we are ready to
produce on a large scale the first
volume of poppy machine a series of six
interactive experiences to show
electronics in a singular and accessible
way and because we believe in learning
to play pop your machine is designed to
stimulate your curiosity and most of all
for you to have fun we hope you've been
seduced and want to be part of the story
we hope you're looking forward to
playing with Poppy machine thank you for
bugging us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
