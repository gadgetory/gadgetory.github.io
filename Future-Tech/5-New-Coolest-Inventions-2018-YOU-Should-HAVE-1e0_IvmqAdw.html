a reality
we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your

solution includes carrying around our
power bank plugs cables and everything
else we need to ensure we don't run out
of juice imagine if there was a smarter
way to save your precious phone battery
from running out all the time something
lightweight and easy to use
say hello to cue it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not cube simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go how really does the cube work well
it's a simple concept just plug your
cube into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smartphone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down
hi my name is questioned as every busy
person I was often on the road and
almost every day my phone was running
out of the battery in black tea instead
of messy wires and power bank I wanted
to have only one small device that can
replace the number of
I have to carry everything when we
started to think about the cube group at
the existing technology on the mat and
we quickly notice that most of the
available devices were not complete and
not user-friendly
together with fear our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design community the designer this
elegant compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small in
cool design with a significant battery
capacity it was something that had never
been done but we made it and we're so
proud and excited to bring it to you
cube is the world's first compact and
lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink in quick charging
cable you also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
you
wherever life takes you carry the
perfect backup plan
the portable versatile talon by tactical
modern life presents challenges work
sports adventures small things can
easily blow out and become big talon
helps keep the small things small made
with an advanced composite technology
and world first patient pending design
the talon packs 17 tools and features to
match in a pocket-sized carry it comes
with metric and imperial wrenches and
rulers box cutter bottle opener and
standard quarter-inch phillips &amp;amp;
flathead hex traps the talon adapts to
your life simply swap out the hex drives
for your next adventure whether you need
an Allen head 30 stalks the Talon holds
to within its body a flexible elastomer
keeps the tools locked in place and
ready when you need them the original
socket design allows your hand to be
positioned as you would with a regular
screwdriver a feature that many pocket
tools don't allow the talon is made of
one of the world's most advanced
composite materials 40% lighter than
titanium and the strength of diecast
metal plus the material Tec allows you
to carry your talent without fear of
scratching your latest phone or tablet
the talon can go anywhere you do and it
complies with current tsa requirements
for air travel the australian designed
engineered and manufactured talon
multi-tool by tactical compact enough to
carry everyday lightweight enough not to
weigh you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand enough said
two years ago we bought you tactic as
first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you
talon pushes the limits with materials
technology and functionality its
patent-pending design is made possible
by using an advanced composite material
this makes it super strong and enables
the unique unibody design that increases
strength and hardness
we've also created a dual-purpose
storage compartment into the design to
function as a socket something that
hasn't been possible in a multi-tool
until now we make the Talon in Melbourne
Australia and over the past few months
our team has worked closely to perfect
the design for manufacture it's great to
be involved again with the same factory
that produces our popular one bottle
opener this kind of collaborations make
sure that everyone involved has a deep
understanding of the project and the
high standards we expect having a local
manufacturer also reduces the risks
usually associated with overseas
manufacture now waiting on shipments
faulty products or delivery delays will
be right there in front of the machine
as they come off the line it doesn't get
any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right
we've made the decision to launch
straight into the production process
because we reckon you're going to want
one or two in time for Christmas we're
tooling the molds now and we'll be ready
for full-scale production well before
Christmas thanks for the support and
look forward to getting a talent in your
hand soon

powerful there a weapon of choice was
