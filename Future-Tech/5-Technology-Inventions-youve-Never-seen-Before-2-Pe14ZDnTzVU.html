a collection market for many years
why do we give this product or model Z
we found that our customers are still
using out-of-date barcode terminal like
Wincy system with small display and a
very old single core cpu was poorly
experience display is very small on a
3.5 inch with 320 and 240 resolution the
screen is hard touch you can have may
use your finger but only use the stylus
to input the data due to that update
platform it doesn't support any popular
4G Wireless and Wi-Fi communication the
body size is very large seek and heavy
not easy to carry but a most important
thing the wind theory platform was
abandoned by Microsoft and will not be
supported with any updates now time is a
chinjung model zs five point two
millimeter outer st. body design and a
5.5 inch 2k corning gorilla glass
display Snapdragon 820 processor was one
point AG core core CPU and the latest
Andrew seven platform the most important
thing is what we're all as providing
revolutionary technology moto Mars with
mobile Mars just forming the model z2
any scene that he wants will not be a
dream like Hasselblad zoom camera JBL
speaker projector and so forth
now we built new barcodes let moss for
model z it integrates professionally
hardware decode balco's skin ng to
provide greater scan performance for
retail warehouse healthcare logistic
application is transforms Motorola MOTO
disease microphone into enterprise ready
Barco sled that provides sales associate
with instant access to product

will charge for a particle sled and a
model Z at the same time
we will lunch back on slap mores a model

few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations made sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery

the machine as they come off the line it
