measuring marking and bad cuts you make
with your circular saw well put down
that tape measure and pay attention to
this because now you can make those
perfect repeatable cuts in plywood MDF
and other large sheet goods without
measuring or marking cut lines thanks to
the Craig rip cut saw guide with a Craig
rip cut you can easily make accurate
straight cuts with your circular saw
every single time the Craig rip cut lets
you get the most from your circular saw
because it's so easy to set up the whole
process can take less than a minute and
you only have to do it once and the
Craig rip cut easily attaches to most
every brand of circular saw and has a
reversible guide for both right and left
handers that adjusts quickly and easily
to your selected cutting width once the
RIP cut is set you can make repeated
cuts of the same width with no measuring
or marking you'll save time and waste
less material and the guide could be
quickly adjusted to another width and
you're back in business here's a Craig
tip support the sheet goods with rigid
foam insulation for cleaner smoother
safer cuts on work benches or even the
ground quality projects all start with
perfect cuts so the RIP cut guide should
be on every workbench it's the first
tool to buy before building bookshelves
closet organizers tables or anything
else that requires the use of sheets
goods trade the difficulties of cutting
large pieces on a table saw for laser
straight perfect cuts made easy with a
rip cut saw guide the Craig inline clamp
makes it easy to hold work pieces of all
shapes and sizes without the clamp
getting in the way the in line clamp
does this with a low-profile design that
applies pressure from the side rather
than from overhead so the clamp stays
out of the way as you work the inline
clamps stays in place with a peg that
fits into any three quarter inch
diameter hole that makes the clamp a
perfect companion to the Craig mobile
project Center and allows you to get
more from any workbench that's equipped
with three quarter inch bench dog holes
or you can drill through quarter inch
holes in any work surface to add the
convenience of Craig inline clamping
using the inline clamp is
easy simply turn the contoured
easy-to-grip dial to move the push rod
and press the clamp shoe against your
workpiece that makes it easy to dial on
the clamping pressure you need up to 250
pounds of clamping force the low-profile
clamp shoe is just 1/2 inch thick so it
stays out of the way while you work the
clients shoe design holds tight against
work pieces of all shapes and sizes
including corners and round edges and
because you can rotate the inline clamp
it's easy to direct that clamping
pressure in whatever direction you need
with the Kreg inline clamp you get the
helping hand you need when you need it
with the versatility you want for a wide
variety of tasks visit us online at
craig tool comm to learn more about the
craig inline clamp as well as our other
craig clamping solutions that help you
create every project with confidence
when you're building cabinets cases and
boxes holding the pieces in position
during assembly can be one of the
biggest challenges the Craig 90-degree
corner clamp simplifies the assembly
process by aligning and holding corners
and partitions at perfect 90-degree
angles so you have both hands-free to
end fasteners unlike some corner clamps
that can be cumbersome to use the
90-degree corner clamp is simple plus it
works with ninety degree but joints and
T joints used to attach shelves and
partitions all you have to do is squeeze
the padded handles and the clamps cast
aluminum wedge and V shapes draw tight
against the inside and outside phases of
the joint this holds the two pieces at
exactly 90 degrees a reversible corner
style makes it easy to align the mating
pieces in the clamp while edge stops
cast into the under V help ensure that
the edges will be flush and aligned too
with the clamp holding the joint
securely together you can add the
fasteners the 90 degree corner clamp
works great for building with Craig
pocket all joinery it even has access
points and the honor V that allow you to
drive a Craig screw with the clamps
still in position openings in the outer
V also make it easy to attach the joint
with the brad nailer or even to drill
and drive conventional wood screws the
90 degree corner clamp is great for
building drawers cases boxes and more
because it works with thin materials and
lumber up to one inch thick and thanks
to Craig
auto Manx Auto adjusting technology you
never have to readjust the client when
you move from one material thickness to
another just squeeze the clamp handles
and automax technology does the rest
applying the perfect amount of easy to
regulate clamping pressure to the joint
every time and with every material
thickness when you're looking for a fast
foolproof way to create square corners
and perfectly positioned shelves or
partitions on your woodworking and
do-it-yourself projects the Craig
90-degree corner clamp is the perfect
solution
when you're cutting plywood one of the
biggest problems you're going to run
into is tear out or splintering right
along the cut edge that's because when
you're cutting with a circular saw the
blade is rotating this way cutting on
the upstroke and that means that as the
tooth exits the wood it wants to pull on
that fragile veneer layer and rip and
tear it that's one of the best things
about the Craig Accu cut the guide
strips that help hold the Accu cut in
place also do a much more important job
they help create a nice clean cut
because the guide strip is right on your
cut line and the blade rides right
against the strip as the saw blade comes
up the guide strip is pushing that
fragile veneer layer down and that means
that it can't lift and tear so thanks to
the guide strips on the Craig Accu cut
you get clean splinter free cuts every
time
the current custom pocket hole plug
cutter makes it possible to take Craig
joinery projects to the next level by
giving you complete freedom to create
your own custom plugs from any wood
species that means you can cut plugs
from your own project stock to create
plugs with color that matches your
project better than has ever been
possible before plus the custom pocket
hole plug cutter allows you to create
face green plugs that blend in amazingly
well the plug cutter simply slips into a
Kreg jig in place of the normal drill
guide block and works with the Craig
Jake k5 k4 or even an older k3 model
that allows you to clamp your plug
material in place and drill in the same
way that is used for creating pocket
holes to create the plugs just chuck the
plug cutting bit into any drill this
high-performance bit features a
specially designed cutting tip that
sheers cleanly for a smooth consistent
plug the bit also has an open design
that presents wood from jamming inside
the bit and fluting that reduces heat
and friction for better plugs and longer
bit life a stop collar ensures perfect
depth every time to produce accurately
sized plugs the custom pocket hole plug
cutter comes with one bit that creates
plugs for standard size Craig pocket
holes for even greater versatility two
optional bits are also available one
makes smaller diameter plugs that fit
Craig micro pocket pocket holes
the other bit creates large plugs to
work with the Kreg jig HD a plug size
that's only possible using the custom
pocket hole plug cutter
after cutting the custom-made plugs free
they simply slip into the pocket holes
the plugs are sized to protrude only
slightly above the surrounding surface
that means it's easy to sand or trim the
plugs flush producing a plug that
virtually disappears when you want the
best matching pocket hole plugs possible
and when you want the freedom to create
plugs from any type of wood the Craig
custom pocket hole plug cutter is the
solution you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
