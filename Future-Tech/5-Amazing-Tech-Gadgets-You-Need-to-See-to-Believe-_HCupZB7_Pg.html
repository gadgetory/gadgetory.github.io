your phone in any environment where
would you take it hi I'm Andrew and on
that we're the founders of Pro Shop the
iphone 6 once again set a new standard
for portable video recording devices
this has become a one-stop device for
our lives but it's fragile can break and
shatter most importantly it's not
waterproof so we created proshot we want
to give people the confidence to take
their phone every list with the pro-shah
case you can capture the most exciting
moments of your life whether you're in
the top of the mountain scuba diving in
the crazy
we spent the last year engineering the
most waterproof iPhone case available
our highest priority was to make it a
hundred percent waterproof and durable
without sacrificing style the show is
made from a polycarbonate and abs blend
and sealed with three aluminum clips
around an airtight silicon gasket we've
developed an app that allows you to
control your camera's functionality
using the volume buttons on your phone
the minus button cycles through mode
between videos slow motion and
photographic mode and the top button
allows you to take photographs and
videos pro-shot can be easily mounted on
a wide range of accessories on almost
every surface
we design a case is perfect for everyone
well to the outside there's no need to
justify spending forty dollars on a new
camera use that money to book a flight
bring a pro shot and never miss that
shot again
the best camera is always the camera
which you have with you bonus in your
pocket all the time thank that makes
photo opportunities top off all day long
it is incredible how much we rely on
weather forecasts and so-called local
temperatures the truth is that those
values available online or through apps
come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away nothing
beats measuring the values by yourself
right where you are but that's just not
possible and silly so we have created
the world's smallest a weather station
that can easily fit in your palm simply
plug weather point into your device and
start the app simple as that it consists
of four sensors for temperature humidity
atmospheric pressure and ultraviolet
radiation with this information you can
have the most accurate weather forecast
anywhere you are also by measuring
atmospheric pressure you can know your
altitude more precisely than GPS devices
you can also measure UV radiation and
limit your exposure to these harmful UV
rays the housing is made from aluminium
and titanium and ensures longer lifetime
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
weather point doesn't use a battery well
who likes them anyway it doesn't even
require internet connection the building
hardware is costly we invested a lot of
resources into making weather point
possible and now we need your support to
make it available and affordable for
everyone thank you this is a macbook
charger from Apple and this is power up
by homie fast lightweight and compact
