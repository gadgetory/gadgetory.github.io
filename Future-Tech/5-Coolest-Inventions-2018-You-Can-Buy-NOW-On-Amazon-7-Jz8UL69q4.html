zooom it's magnetic lacing solution
makes your own shoes incredibly easy to
put on and take off since our first
campaign tens of thousands of people
have loved their Zubaz because they no
longer have to fuss with tying laces
squeezing into shoes double knots ugly
floppy bows or laces coming undone with
xue bits your shoe is wide open so you
can easily slip in without squeezing as
if you had no laces at all then just
pull the magnets together and that's it
now go for a run or play sports
Zoop it's magnets are incredibly strong
we've taken the strongest neodymium
magnets and made them even stronger with
our patent-pending magnetic array
technology
to prove how strong they are we gave
some Zubat s--
to our parkour friends at bay area
movement and they really put them to the
test
in two days of running and jumping off
buildings trees and playgrounds the
magnets only separated once
so yuzu bits on your daily run
triathlons dance class your gym class if
you triple unders at CrossFit go
mountain biking quickly put on golf
shoes play basketball your hiking shoes
can double as slippers around the
campsite clean up casual shoes use the
magnetic force show off your Zubaz hang
shoes on your locker or conveniently
organize the whole family's shoes
we've received so much positive feedback
about zubats closures and some truly
touching stories about how Lubitz have
improved the lives of people with autism
arthritis or other special needs and so
now we have new improvements to make xub
it's even easier to install and adjust
as well as adding new colors so with
your support we can pay for
manufacturing these new improvements
with zoo bits closures you can
magnetically pair up your shoes and
organize them in new places
this really encourages kids to put shoes
away and helps define them and zoo vets
are not just for athletic shoes but
perfect for casual shoes and they even
make boots a lot easier to put on
because you don't have to reverse the
laces to squeeze in so in winter time
you can even put boots on with mittens
there are other elastic shoelace
solutions but they stretch out in weeks
zoo bits can be used over and over again
on new pairs of shoes
with this 2.0 version we are offering
six new colors to match your shoes or
make them stand out or even mix two
pairs to support your favorite sports
team our new clips allow you to make
micro fit adjustments any time and also
make installation much easier to install
Zubaz closures onto your own shoes
unlace the top three rows then relays
through the Zubaz next attach our
securing clips and lock your laces for a
secure hold then you can cut off the
excess lace because you don't need it
anymore and with su bits 2.0 if you ever
want to adjust the fit tighter or looser
just quickly slide the clip as needed
you can also wrap your lace around the
clip for the most secure hole
so get
you
