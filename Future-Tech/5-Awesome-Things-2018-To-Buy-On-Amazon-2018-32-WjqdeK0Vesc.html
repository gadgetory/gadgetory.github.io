hello again empty fastest route found to
earlybird cafe
you and me we're busy people and being
busy means checking your phone even when
you're not supposed to even when you're
on the road but now there's navigate
hold on I gotta get this Casey
talk to me hey Adam quick reminder first
thing today is that coffee with Connie
and Greg at the earlybird already on my
way
she was brilliant about navdy is the
faster route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes perfect
never been this way before I'm going to
switch to Navi - see what's so brilliant
about Navitus its display is focused in
the distance so your eyes are never off
the road it's also forty times brighter
than your smartphone it dims
automatically so it's easy to see day or
night
in fact it worked sorry gotta take this
one - Greg and I actually want to do
bars Cafe add-on 60 - smiley face Oh
awesome
luckily Royce is one of my favorites
Navi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps so you'll never get lost
like out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
one gas rerouting - nearest gas station
text Connie be there in 15
you have arrived thanks Navi see you
soon
you
hi my name is Brian min and for those of
us who truly enjoy the tactile act of
typing I want to show you a project that
is guaranteed to bring back a bit of fun
and excitement back to your desktop
computing experience you know as a game
developer I spent a lot of time on my
computer typing a lot so I thought I
want more out of this device that I use
everyday
to connect with everyone that's
important in my life now I've been
fascinated with vintage typewriters for
some time and I gotta say they are just
beautiful on the other hand I've been
completely obsessed with modern
mechanical keyboards mechanical
keyboards feature individual switches
and will give you the kind of tactile
feedback that will make you smile so I
thought if I could somehow merge the two
now that will be fun and beautiful it
all started with an old discarded
keyboard in my garage all the way to
modding a very popular off-the-shelf
gaming keyboard eventually I built an
entirely conceptual keyboard combining
elements from a real typewriter for the
modern mechanical keyboard
finally that prototype resulted in a
brand new hybrid mechanical keyboard
that is both fun to type on and
beautiful to look at so now I present to
you the quirky writer
the quirky rider is an 84 key USB
typewriter inspired mechanical keyboard
it's fun to type on and beautiful to
look at
it's even got a place to stand your
favorite tablet the return bar is
cosmetic but I plan on enabling
additional functionalities depending
upon the success of our crowdfunding
including Bluetooth and wireless
capabilities so this is where I'm in the
project I need to raise enough funds for
a final iteration and engineering pass
on the production prototype tooling
costs four key caps in the frame and the
final assembly this is where you the
backers come in we can partner together
to see this project come to life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
