immediately starts thinking about how I
could put these things together these
these materials are these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get in
being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it
I came up with the idea for a translator
when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and I met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak English very well
and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible but if
you're never speaking and our phones are
in a face like this forget it this is a
wall we're out of this real world
interaction but this in your ear just
right back in it
ludie I put this in your ear push me so
mmm oh hey I put in here comes up yeah
okay can you hear me French vive me
little doleful thing visible buddies all
say yes I can hear you talk French of
course is fist but this is awesome but
how you do it
yeah it's translating it's translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our Tunes
been work on it over two years Andrew is
our original co-founder and overseas
prior development I'm an electrical
engineer and expert in manufacturing we
also have mechanical engineer software
engineer PhD in machine translation as
well as an industrial designer our wide
breadth of experts has allowed us to
develop a product from the ground up we
wanted to create something that hugs the
curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless dreamy music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly labs it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
this IndieGoGo campaign helps us finish
what we started we can get the ear
pieces along with this portable charger
manufactured and delivered within a year
the app works on its own if you just
want to use the app for basic
translation and will have the app out by
late summer first for our backers here
on IndieGoGo but for the full experience
you really want the ear pieces to it's
the dream you know a life untethered
free of language barriers it's just that
it's no longer dream anymore it's real
this is amazing
I'm on my sofa I bet 2,000 calories
watching a movie
hi I'm Louie Crowe medical doctor
researcher and an inventor I have done
the caloric equivalent of a marathon on
my couch watching TV
I've even trained for a marathon with no
running no pounding of the joints just
this panic chair an app and a wrap that
goes around your tights electronic
impulses stimulates the muscles to
exercise the users of low levels
equivalent of walking you can burn
calories at work maybe to slim down you
can train clean video game
it's worker pouches one-eight-five it's
pretty good - heart rates data during a
session our trek 54 warm up and then
peak levels my heart is beating as fast
as it can maintain this for an hour and
stop
I'm going to taste and calories this was
a tough
it's well researched and proven with
luck Thanks
we've even tried us with European Space
Agency in zero-gravity it works up there
too that was fun
hi I'm Barry Broderick electronic
engineer responsible for bionic Jim's
physical device we have a working
prototype but before we go to market I
mean to shrink the size of electronic
components to make it ready for mass
manufacture we need to further develop
the user interface of our app to make a
consumer ready we can only achieve this
with your support so please join us it's
spread to add importantly pledge today
so we can get the ionic jam into
production thank you what kind of snorer
are you
introducing the silent partner the
world's first smart mask to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the silent partner creates a
silent zone around the person wearing it
giving you and those around you a better
night's sleep how does it work
silent partner uses patented active
noise cancellation that detects the
unwanted snoring sound and generates a
counter sound which suppresses it the
result well it's as simple as a plus and
minus they cancel each other out many of
us have probably been there being around
or creating a symphony of snoring noises
that create frustrating nights for us
and our partners most snoring products
today don't fully solve the snoring
problem they are often intrusive and
disrupt the quality of sleep so instead
of tackling the snoring we decided to
simply find a solution for the noise
using vast experience with a and C
technology and sleeping experts the
silent partner was designed and
developed to be effective from as close
as 20 centimeters away simply wear the
smart mask the way you would wear a
traditional sleep mask and enjoy a quiet
night's sleep
be one of the first to experience silent
partner and finally give you and those
around you
a real silent night Sport is our energy
it is essential for us to remain healthy
stay in shape and live longer we develop
the first smart spots where that makes
every workout more effective our system
is based on electro muscle stimulation
technology that originated in the
medical and rehabilitation practice the
20-minute workout with antelope equals
up to three hours of conventional
workout we have the technology that will
change your life change the way you work
out and achieve your goals no matter if
you are an ambitious athlete or just
someone who wants to keep in shape
introducing the revolutionary antelope
series exercise smart you have the full
control over what your workout is about
antelope utilizes state-of-the-art
electron will stimulate in technology
which forces muscle contraction using
electrical impulses this safe and well
proven method exactly mimics natural
muscle contraction but as the stimulus
occurs directly on the muscle it
activates a much higher percentage of
the muscle fibers than through normal
exercising that's the secret of why our
antelope is so effective triflin is a
very time consuming sport you have to
plan your schedule exactly to integrate
into your day to day life as every
minute counts antelope helps me to
achieve my goals in the most effective
way
integrate it into any sporting activity
and make your workout more effective
enhance strength endurance coordination
and speed get on the bike and
supercharge your battle leg muscles go
outside jogging and simultaneously will
train your upper body combined endurance
training and power training whether
you're training outside at the gym in
the hotel on your business trip or at
home with our products everything is
possible no limits the Antelope suit has
integrated electrodes placed on all
major muscle groups that can be
activated all at the same time
consisting of lightweight special
compression fabrics with integrated
textile electrodes and wiring the
Antelope feels just like your usual
sports clothing simply attach the
electronic control unit onto the side
and control the system comfortably
through our fully synchronized antelope
app that's how easy it is prototypes are
fantastic antelope 1 the Easter brand
new award at the largest and most
prominent sports Fair worldwide now we
are ready for production please back us
on IndieGoGo
when you see a problem my brain just
immediately starts thinking about how I
could put these things together these
these materials or these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get in
being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it my name is Stephan
marsh I'm the inventor of the ear ring
technology and the president of the
company
my name's Tom Cotton's I'm live in
Southborough Massachusetts with my wife
I'm a farmer that's what I like to do I
found I had sleep apnea through a test
sleep apnea is an inability to maintain
normal ventilation during sleep
oftentimes there's very dramatic snoring
gasping and choking in the night why
it's important to treat sleep apnea is
the longer-term consequences and that's
where the associations with heart
disease metabolic disease higher risk of
stroke coronary disease heart attack
when you stop breathing and there's no
oxygen going to your brain that's going
to do some damage over time the most
common treatment is delivery of airway
pressure through a mask it was working
for me it was extremely cumbersome I
didn't want to take the mask off I
wanted to rip the mask off it's a
minority of patients we were able to
tolerate the treatment at home so I've
got to find some way to deal with this
and keep a smile on my face man starts
out usually doing things in a way that's
brute force but sometimes you can figure
out a way to do it that's a little bit
more elegant a little bit easier simpler
but that usually requires an invention
this is amazing I think that if this
works this will be the answer for 99%
they'll never go back to using that Star
Wars piece on their head again when I
see this I say how can that possibly get
the air in me when I first talked to
people about this and I say well you
know we have these little micro pumps
and and turns out that they're very
powerful they can they can pump the
right amount of air at the right amount
of pressure their first response is no
way get out of here you know I got well
yes I think we can because our micro
pumps our micro blowers are very very
small it's based on two membranes that
are electrostatically attracted or
repelled from each other opposite
charges attract and that's the bellows
closing and blowing the air out and like
charges repel
that's the bellows opening and sucking
air in and if hundreds and hundreds of
these little bellows are plus and minus
plus and minus going together you get a
large amount of air to flow through
zinc-air batteries is a battery
technology that has a lot of stored
energy in it it's very dense which means
it could be very small and have the
right amount of energy the nose buds
they're easy to insert really it's one
hand grab it stick it in you knows
you've done the molded silicon rubber is
extremely pliable everybody that we
tested it with has found it very
comfortable really for the first time in
this disease we have a treatment that
patients will be willing to use
long-term consequences of sleep at
reduced it's comfortable it's well
tolerated patients can sleep in a
variety of positions just perfect
treatment it's almost like you can't
wait to try I I don't know it's
important to get this technology to get
this device to get the air ring into
people's hands as quickly as possible
the fastest way that I know how to do
that is to raise sufficient amount of
money so we can and you factor it
produce it and get it out there so we're
here to ask you to give us a hand
if you can take this simple technology
and treat this sleeping disorder this
condition it just that's what technology
is for you've got to go do something
that's important and I can't think of
anything more important for these
blowers to do then to save somebody's
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
