I'm a hiker and with the little space I
have to carry stuff I want to be able to
remember moments like these forever
that's why the my site 360 is the
perfect solution the my site 360 can
capture everything in beautiful 4k
without needing a big rig or heavy
equipment to get stable shots and if the
trail gets bumpy or the camera isn't in
the right position the my site 360 keeps
videos level with its built in
calibration the horizon optimization
ensures level viewing and to make sure
your viewing quality isn't sacrificed by
unexpected camera positioning or tilting
the stable calibration minimizes motion
gimbal Lake quality without the excess
weight and equipment and it's water
resistant so the mine site 360 can
capture the entire experience rain or
shine
plus if you need to change the position
it only takes a second
when I get to a place with a great view
I know that the my site 360 is getting
the best quality photos and videos if I
missed anything on my way here the my
site 360 has a long battery life so I
won't miss it on my way back on my way
back I can start posting right away the
my site 360 app uses artificial
intelligence to create a feature called
life log which looks at all the videos
from my hike and stitches the best parts
of them together into one clip that way
I don't have to go through hours of
footage my site 360 is not a fully
360-degree camera if what you want is to
make to 360 degree video you may want to
look somewhere else but what we are
hopefully is the wearable camera
designed for hikers to capture and we
create a hiking spirits we have no
intentions of making the best 360-degree
camera out there but I can confidently
say that if you are hikers who want to
create your hiking experience my
seismicity is a product for you thank
you
I spent seven years working as a
mechanic so I saw firsthand the kind of
handheld lights and area lights that
were being used they were cheap with dim
underpowered bulbs and flimsy
construction I'd constantly be buying
new ones because they always fell apart
even with newer LED lights the
electronics often broke creating an
unreliable light
I remember thinking then that car shops
deserved a better life and so did
truckers electricians first responders
anyone else who works with their hands
when I started working at Big Ass
solutions I knew this was a project that
I wanted to pursue I came up with a
rough concept a handheld area light that
was bright cordless portable durable a
light that was over engineered to stand
up to years of abuse and harsh
conditions I pitched the idea to our CEO
Carrie Smith and he actually encouraged
me to pursue this project and see where
it led and now after two years and
countless hours of work we have the
big-ass light bar we wanted a light that
was bright as hell with five thousand
lumen at maximum output it's everything
you need up to 48 hours of continuous
light on battery power the light bar
itself is made of a chemically resistant
Scytale glass filled nylon that means
that you can spray it off with common
chemicals the shape of the light itself
was actually designed to prevent it from
rolling away if you dropped it or set it
on the hood of a car
with its ip66 rating you can take it
outside and not worry if it gets rained
up we know that you were going to toss
around the light bar so we overmolded it
in key areas with the technology called
versa flex to be shock absorbent
now we're closer than ever to making the
big-ass light bar the reality we need
your help for the final stage though
production if your assistance will be
able to begin manufacturing and start
shipping the light bar to all
contractors first responders soldiers
police officers and anyone else who
demands a product that they can take to
hell and back in return you'll be the
first customers to receive the
revolutionary big-ass light bar this has
been a passionate project for me it's
something that I've worked on for years
and I'm very proud of what we've come up
with it is absolutely the best handheld
area light in the world bar none</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
