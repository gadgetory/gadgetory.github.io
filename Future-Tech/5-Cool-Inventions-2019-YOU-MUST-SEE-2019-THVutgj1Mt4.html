never miss another update are you still
measuring in risky situations do you
still need someone to help you measure
lengthy distances how do you measure
objects that cannot be measured by the
ordinary tape measure here is a new way
of measuring introducing accion para
para is a to laser measure with
smartphone application and bluetooth
connection for better easier and safer
user experience the angle encoder
coupled with the two laser measures
enables Pythagorean calculations Paris
bluetooth technology enables users to
keep track of their measurements you can
quickly and easily measure long
distances with just a press of a button
without anyone's help you can
conveniently view measured data on the
display screen para can measure up to
180 degrees all distances can be simply
measured from one stationary position
para is perfectly designed to be easily
and quickly found in any field of work
para eliminates risky and dangerous
measurement situations it can be used by
anyone in any situation regardless of
age gender or experience it can also be
used with one hand saving you your
precious time and energy by using
Pythagorean functions even the height of
tall buildings can be easily measured
planning on making changes to your space
use para to find out the dimensions para
is a complete system that can always
provide precise and reliable
measurements para can be attached to a
tripod to fully utilize our smartphone
application when you take a picture with
our app it instantly triggers the
measure button and keeps track of both
the picture and the data on your
smartphone simultaneously you can then
draw on the picture to remember exactly
what you have measured by knowing all
the precise measurements you won't have
any trouble redesigning your space para
is versatile it can be used in various
fields it can even be used to measure
you para can be used by experts as well
as people who are unfamiliar with
measuring para is specifically designed
to be dust proof making it reliable in
any work environment you can measure
curves by simply rolling Park you can
also measure all kinds of irregular
shaped objects with just one hand
para has a built in rechargeable battery
that can run for over 14 hours para has
a targeting feature that alerts when it
reaches the distance you've set set the
distance and then extend para and the
beep sound will tell you that you've
reached the set distance this can be
useful for tasks that require constant
spacing like setting up picture frame
difficult measurements or now ease with
para
take para with you anywhere you go food
waste causes serious environmental
pollution and although many of us are
doing our best in our daily lives to
reduce and categorize food waste
properly the problem persists therefore
we want to take a more positive approach
in dealing with the food waste that's
been created to take all the food waste
that would have originally reached
landfills and incinerators and instead
bring it to the repurposing plant the
food waste then goes through a simple
processes of mixing drying and pressing
to finally be molded into shape to
create alpha pod made from food waste
the 100% biodegradable pot for your
plants it's self watering through a wick
system it's modular design
and more importantly it can be directly
transplanted alphabat becomes nutrients
helping your plant to grow as it breaks
down naturally in the soil this is the
kind of positive cycle we want to
achieve
to give food waste a new and more
beautiful life
to create a sustainable and greener
future alpha pod grow easily in nature
