never miss another update hi I'm
professional mountain bike rider jeff
lenosky I'm going to show you how to
install as Victoria airliner the first
step is sizing the air liner to the tire
wrap it around the rim mark the
intersection next using a sharp blade
cut the insert perpendicular at the mark
the next step is to join both ends using
the zip tie carefully trim off any sharp
ends from the end of the zip tie now
it's time to set one side of the tire
onto the rim once I have one side of the
bead on the tire it's time to put in the
air liner in order to make this air
liner go on the tire a little bit easier
I'm gonna wet it with some water and
that will act as lubrication the next
step is gonna be to place this thing
inside the tire just like I would seat a
regular tire I'm going to start at the
valve stem and work my way around in
order to get this last bit of the tire
on you're gonna want to use a tire lever
and be careful not to damage the rim
strip now the tire seated I want to
remove the valve cork and inflate it
just like I would any other tubeless
tire make sure you hear all of your
beads snapping into place and then I'm
gonna let all the air out so I could add
my tire sealant you're going to want to
put your tire sealant in through the
valve stem once the sealing is inside
the tire I'm gonna put the valve stem
back on and then play it back to full
pressure once the sealant is inside the
tire and you're all inflated give the
wheel a spin and a couple of bounces to
swish around that sealant that is the
entire vit√≥ria air liner installation
process this was my first time ever
trying and it went super smoothly
hopefully you find this video useful and
now if you'll excuse me it's time to go
shred some trail
[Laughter]
flector zero is an ultra performance
reflector of the new generation it
combines zero weight design with
high-grade reflection and fits every
spoke like a glove
it literally starts to glow and hit by
headlights collector zero is almost
weightless a small sexy flag that's it
due to the high resilience of its
composition collector zero is nearly
indestructible flector zeros aerodynamic
efficiency is unmatched in comparison to
any other reflector on the market
for me biking is about a lot more than
just getting where I'm going it's about
enjoying the ride so when my bike group
started to wear out I began to look for
replacements that could enhance my
biking experience with improved comfort
a better aesthetic and higher durability
in my research I found that some groups
had a palm support for more comfort some
were available in multiple colors to
match my bike and others were even
custom fit to give me an exceptionally
secure grasp on my handlebars but no
grips had all these features and none
were any more durable than the old ones
I already had I knew there had to be a
better way that's when I set out to
design grips that would look great feel
great and stand the test of time even in
the most demanding conditions for me
grips contour and conform to your hands
to distribute pressure more evenly
allowing you to ride more comfortably
for longer with just two of your hand
measurements we can custom manufacture a
set of grips to fit you perfectly they
have a palm support which maintains a
comfortable wrist angle and supports
your upper body weight they're available
in your choice of over 40 color ways to
perfectly match your bike
they're made of a more durable material
than conventional grips and they come
with a one-year warranty through 3d
printing with a flexible lattice inside
to absorb vibrations from rough terrain
and they're compatible with all bikes
that have bike grips all of these
features work together to create a
better cycling experience for you for
many seasons to come to create forming
grips I first invented a device that
when paired with a 3d scanner would
allow me to efficiently and accurately
capture many hand impressions I then
used that device to digitally capture
impressions with hand sizes ranging from
the first percentile adult female to the
99th percentile adult male this enabled
me to use the 3d scans to design
perfectly contoured grips for every
adult hand size I assemble the team to
research and experiment with
manufacturing for me grips using
different methods of 3d printing once we
determine the best way to make forming
grips we won funding through multiple
startup competition
at Virginia Tech and University of
Virginia this funding has allowed me to
prototype refine and test forming grips
over the past year and a half now we
need your help to start production your
contribution to this campaign will allow
for me to scale manufacturing and start
selling grips I've put together some
great rewards so go pick out the one
that's right for you and please share
this campaign to ensure it gets funded
thank you for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
