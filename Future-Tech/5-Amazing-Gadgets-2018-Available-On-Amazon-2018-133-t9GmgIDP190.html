thinks broken we fix it those days when
imperfection is profession those days
when every picture holds the story to
mistake in one the blurry one the funny
one the loved one the hated one the
badly times one the perfectly timed one
and the old one the
the light and the dark they'll all say
the new honk at the gym
it has to finish a new condition
everything in the past they all lives on
the difference is now all the strawberry
captures will be safe inside SD card
with the new Hogan vigilant he can tell
your story a little bolder
a little earlier
a little more freedom
a little more adventurous
a little more sharing with the
thoughtless free to be half there is
always a little more you could do to
bring the vintage charm back to today
please help us to resolve retro and let
the classic lives on thank you
I'm late
when I'm in a hurry I tend to forget
things lucky for me they gave me a new
app for this video
and it just notified me that I left my
garage door open
it's called garage 't garage it works
with your existing garage door opener to
monitor your garage door and proactively
notify you when you've left it open
allowing you to open and close the door
from your smartphone anywhere you have
internet access unlike other systems
there are no other cost or monthly
subscription fees to pay it's super
simple to setup just attach a couple
wires to your existing garage door use
the included sticky pad to apply the
unit to the bottom of your opener and
plug it in finally stick the reflector
on the garage door and you're all set
it's that simple and just like that I've
closed my garage door now Boldin garage
it can help me find my copy this is
Dennis Griesa he's the creator of
gravity hello
personally I've been in the situations
we need to check if my garage with left
open already has been operated remote I
researched what's available in the
market and found that existing products
offer limited features are difficult
install expensive and sometimes require
replacement of the garage door opener it
became clear that we need a better
product
after months of development design and
testing we are ready to share a garage
it with the world
the powerful onboard processor and
over-the-air firmware updates allow
garages to learn new tricks remain
secure and avoid obsolescence
standards take shape another great use
for garage it's when you get dropped off
but you forgot your keys hey why don't
you use your phone
Thanks grabs a guy easy to remember and
close the garage door yeah of course I
do
it's hard to find time to cook good food
we're all busy usually it's the last
thing on our minds so we made cooking
simple meat mellow the effortless way to
make delicious meals it's kind of like a
slow cooker it uses a technique called
sous-vide cooking which is commonly
found in top restaurants sous-vide is
slow cooking your food to the perfect
temperature to the perfect texture and
to the perfect taste with mellow now you
can cook a five-star restaurant meal
effortlessly without even being there to
cook it so you can make a chicken breast
dinner while you jog the spare rib
entree while you work even a poached egg
breakfast while you sleep you begin by
placing ingredients in our specially
designed food safe bags our bags are
self sealing and water won't get in drop
it in mellow and then just specify what
you're cooking when you want it done and
how you'd like you made that's it that's
all you have to do
mellow chills the water so your
ingredients won't spoil while you're
away then at the right time it
automatically starts cooking the key to
mellow is cooking food by surrounding it
with water it's not boiling your food
rather creating bubbles for water
circulation and controlled heat for the
perfect temperature to cook this makes
sure that your food is never raw or dry
never undercooked or overcooked
mellow always finishes when you tell it
to so when you get home your food is
already done
you can plate your meal right away or
have fun giving it a quick sear for the
perfect finish and that's it you're
ready to dig in have incredible food on
the table no matter what else is on your
plate let Melo help make the memorable
meals you'll share with old friends new
friends or best friends what if you
could infuse your home with a fragrance
that isn't just limited to here or there
but that's perfectly even throughout a
whole space a liveable breathable
atmosphere that's so light in the air
it's like it's everywhere and nowhere
all at once an experience that doesn't
change or fade from day one to day 60
and what if you could truly control the
intensity of the fragrance whether you
want the slightest hint or a transport
of experience and what if all of this
was controllable right from the palm of
your hand so you could see your whole
home through a new lens the perfect
atmosphere for every space and every
occasion turn one room on and another up
and even set a schedule so it's always
there at just the right time
