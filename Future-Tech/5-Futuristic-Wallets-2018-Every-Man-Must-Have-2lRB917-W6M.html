a single billet of aircraft-grade
aluminum unibody along with a hard coat
anodized surface highlights that
seamless design a highly resilient
elastic band is used so that the future
wallet can expand to hold all your
essentials but wait you didn't stop

materials enabled us to create the
world's first completely rfid-blocking
wooden wallet
the future while a cash-strapped
features a hidden pocket for coins and
keys
your wallet goes wherever you go take
pride in what you carry every day we've
tested our prototypes and sourced our
manufacturers all we need now is your

appreciation for beautiful design and
functionality we saw what was out there
and we knew we can do better we just
have a month testing our prototypes

their manufacturers now all we need is
your support
