way and create rock-solid joints that
are built to last
well forget males split wood brackets
and messy glue and build like the pros
for over 25 years pro woodworkers every
lied on Craig jigs to build and repair
furniture now you too can create Pro
joints with just a drill and a Kreg jig
to easily build tables cabinets and more
thanks to the Craig joinery system you
can master the same techniques used by
professional cabinet makers to join wood
and create rock-solid joints it's time
to say goodbye to split wood and broken
joints forget nails brackets and the
mess of glue Craig jigs will allow you
to build all types of furniture and wood
projects better and stronger with pocket
holes and Craig's unique self tapping
screws you'll learn how to build a tight
square box with solid joints and then
you can build many projects from custom
picture frames to complete storage
systems so why buy weak flimsy
ready-to-assemble furniture when you
could build quality furniture yourself
and all you need is your drill and a
Kreg jig and you can create rock-solid
joints that are built to last on your
own wood projects the old way of doing
things require clamps and glue alignment
was difficult and clamping always seemed
to squeeze out the glue but now just put
the Craig fit with its depth pilot tip
into any drill and your Kreg jig makes
building as simple as 1-2-3 first clamp
down the jig with any clamp then drill a
quick series of pocket holes at the
perfect angle and finally dr Craig self
tapping screws to pull the two parts
together it's just that simple with the
Kreg jig you drive hidden pocket holes
that provide perfect alignment every
time you'll get ultra strong joints with
no exposed fasteners and no messy glue
and they're great for repairing failed
joints in store-bought furniture to a
Kreg jig can pay for itself on the first
wood project you build yourself and
sure to use Craig's unique self-tapping
screws made for every application to
give you those rock-solid joints that
are built to last several Craig pocket
hole jig czar available right here on
our website and at many fine
home-improvement retailers and they all
come with a 90-day money-back guarantee

hi I'm barb and I'm Hannah
in 2014 I ran a successful Kickstarter
campaign for the make smith cnc today
I'm super excited introduce you to our
new project Maslow Maslow was a 4x8 foot
CNC cutting machine designed to change
the way we build everything from art
projects to houses and it's cheap you
can get one now for under $500 Masel
lets you print the things you can find
around you that are made from wood this
could be anything from furniture to the
world's coolest treehouse to rebuilding
after a natural disaster we wanted to
create a game-changing tool which allows
people from around the world to
digitally collaborate to make amazing
things we wanted to create a tool which
was cheap easy to use inclusive and
powerful basically we want to help you
build cool stuff to make that possible
we knew we had to make a machine which
work with materials and their native
flora by deform without taking up your
entire garage or workshop it needed to
be affordable both to purchase and to
ship it had to be easy to assemble with
no soldering no programming and no fancy
tools it needed to be just as accurate
as a person using power tools even when
cutting complex shapes our solution masa
masa uses gear reduced DC motors with
encoders and a closed-loop feedback
system to achieve high accuracy and high
torque more details for nerds can be
found below Maslow stands only 19 inches
out from your garage or shop wall
leaving plenty of space to park the car
Maslow comes as an easy-to-assemble kit
which includes every piece of hardware
you need except for two bricks two
sheets of plywood and three two by fours
we couldn't get those to fit in the box
also if you don't already own one you'll
need to purchase a fixed base router
maslow can be put together in a weekend
using only a phillips screwdriver a pair
of pliers and a handsaw maslow connects
to your Mac Windows or Linux computer
using a standard USB port excited for
your first project pledge now to reserve
your maslow cnc can't believe it read
and learn tons more about the project
below building things digitally is the
future and we believe it should be for
everyone
this is an important technology and
we're making the choice not to patent it
all of our designs PCB layouts firmware
and software are available for free
right now on our website to anyone in
the world when you design something to
print whether it's a kayak a tiny house
or light aircraft we encourage you to do
the same and share your digital files so
anyone can benefit check out our videos
and content below to learn how easy it
is to assemble your kit and to find out
how to turn your digital files into
real-world objects and most importantly
build something amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
