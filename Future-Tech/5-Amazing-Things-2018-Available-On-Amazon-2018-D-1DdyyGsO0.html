the Southwire simple fish tape provides
a faster easier way to push and pull
fish tapes to EMT and PVC conduit the
low friction spiral extruded polymer
allows the tape to easily glide through
conduit without binding it turns joints
or couplings the simple fish tapes are
kink and break resistant combining the
strength of a steel fish tape with
greater flexibility than fiberglass fish
tapes the non conductive material is
also rust resistant and will not deform
when bent like other fish tape materials
these fish tapes are lightweight and
greatly reduce user fatigue and downtime
on the job due to fish tape breakage the
simple fish tape features two different
leaders on various models the flexible
metal leaders with a swiveling tip
allows the fish tape to roll off turns
and continue moving without binding in
tight radius turns the fish tapes also
feature a non conductive
glow-in-the-dark leader making the fish
tape non conductive from end to end
allowing for easy installation over
existing wires simple fish tapes are a
must-have for any professional
electrical contractor pushing or pulling
wire or cable through conduit Southwire
built for durability built for
reliability built for work
