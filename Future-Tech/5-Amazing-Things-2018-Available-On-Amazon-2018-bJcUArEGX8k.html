Cline tools for the professional
tradesperson since 1857 klein tools is
proud to introduce the NC bt to dual
range non-contact voltage tester the NC
b t2 is designed to detect and indicate
both standard voltage between 48 and
1,000 volts ac and low voltage between
12 and 48 volts ac unlike competitive
non-contact voltage testers the NC b t2
can detect between the two ranges
automatically when the blue LED light is
illuminated the NC b t2 is in dual range
mode and can automatically detect both
standard and low voltages the NC BT 2
indicates low voltage with the low
pitched beeping tone and blinking red
LED light a steady red LED light and low
pitched beeping tone indicates the
tester is detecting standard voltage the
NC b t2 can be switched into NC b t1
mode which detects standard voltage only
after powering the unit on press and
hold the power button until
blue LED light turns to green again the
ncb t2 will produce a low-pitched
beeping tone and steady red LED light
when standard voltage is detected in
addition the power on blue or green LED
visually confirms battery sufficiency
system integrity and active NC bt mode
and the high intensity light is great
for illuminating workspaces the NC b t2
is also equipped with a silent mode
function which is useful in noise
sensitive environments like hospitals to
activate silent mode
make sure the tester is powered off then
press and hold the power button until
the LED light illuminates no audible
indication should be heard the NC b t2
uses standard 1.5 volt triple-a
batteries and is equipped with an auto
power off feature to conserve battery
