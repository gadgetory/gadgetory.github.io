introducing the moon by one ring the
world's first smart camera to defy
gravity the unique stabilized levitation
technology coupled with advanced
wireless resonant charging capability
allows the moon by one ring to not only
endlessly levitate above its stand but
noise ously rotate in any direction with
a simple swipe of your finger
leaving no spot unnoticed we have
equipped the camera with the latest
generation Full HD Simo sensor with a
pixel area much larger than that of any
ordinary home security solutions
combined with a bright wide angle lens
the moon by one ring captures
considerably more light than an average
home monitor camera resulting in
incredibly crisp and clear images even
in dimly lit conditions - built in
precision microphones on each side of
the lens automatically detect the
direction of incoming sound and adjust
the cameras field of view accordingly
making sure it captures every moment we
have also integrated a high quality
loudspeaker and an additional third
microphone for HD noise cancellation so
you'll not only see and hear what
happens around the camera but can also
communicate making the moon by one ring
a natural choice for video calls both at
your home and in your office for over
two years our team has been dedicated to
designing the moon with a single goal in
mind to create the most advanced and
versatile smart home solution in the
world to achieve this we have opted to
combine the major home automation
standards of z-wave zigbee and Bluetooth
smart with a beautiful easy to use and
feature-rich camera giving you an
unparalleled flexibility in building or
expanding your very own smart home or
office the moon by one ring has
temperature humidity co2 and light
sensor integrations so it will not only
notify you whenever it's a good time to
let in some fresh air or turn on the
air-conditioner but it can share this
information with other smart home
devices
additionally thanks to its integrated IR
blah
the moon by one ring can also control
your legacy appliances like the
air-conditioner stereo system or
television integrating them into your
personal internet of things all of the
crucial electronic components are
integrated directly into the camera so
you can also use it independently from
the base unit the built-in battery
enables up to five hours of autonomous
operation while the USB type-c port
makes charging on-the-go fast and
convenient we've engineered the moon by
one ring as the most sophisticated smart
camera for your home and office support
our project and make the dream of a
truly flexible and easy to use smart
home come one step closer
did you know that billions of batteries
that we throw away have only used
roughly 20% of their battery life what
if you could instantly tap into the
other 80% that is still trapped inside
now you can with battery boost vanna
robust is a patented reusable stainless
sleeve with electronics that slips over
your new or used batteries and extends
the battery life by tapping into the 80%
that is usually thrown away having been
selected by CNN Money as number 9 of the
36 coolest gadgets of 2015 battery boost
can save you money by buying fewer
batteries
not to mention convenience of fewer
trips to the store
if we line up the reported 15 billion
batteries that end up in landfills it
would wrap around the earth more than
eighteen times every year batter row get
more waste less
say hello to the powerstroke modular
what's unique to the powerstrip modular
is that we've created extension modules
that allow you to solve your day-to-day
necessities without the use of thousands
of different adapters say you need a
Wi-Fi extender well there is a module
for that or if you need to charge up
your phone there is a module for that
too we're even working on a power bank
module that you can just snap in charge
up and snap back out to take with you on
the go there are many other modules that
we're working on such as the light
module a USB type-c module a sensor
module so basically there's a ton of
modules that we can create and our
team's goal is to make the power strip
future-proof for example every day we
struggle with power for us a simple sip
of coffee can do the trick but for our
devices the problems usually start with
inefficient power strips whether it's in
the office or at home we can all relate
to this annoying problem of not finding
the right plug adapter or charging port
and this leads us to throwing away power
strips or replacing them with temporary
solutions and that's where we want to
make and change power strip modular will
allow you to attach what every module
you need whenever you need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
