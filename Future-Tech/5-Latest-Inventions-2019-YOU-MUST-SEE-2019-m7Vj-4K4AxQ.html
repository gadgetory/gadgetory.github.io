never miss another lovely this is a box
this is min Dobis who put his dream into
that box
this is mindo gasps dream a perfect
chair made from sixty loose elements
that you can put together any way you
want but the beginning of Mandela's
dream didn't start here you cannot make
anything beautiful without making your
hands dirty as always say for every
architect it's a dream to create the
church in the same way but every
designer in the world it's a dream to
create a perfect chair spin D consists
of 1260 pieces of wood put together by
hand each element is treated with
natural aural which makes it strong
enough to stand both inside and outside
the spindle is simple but the process is
super complicated actually it's the
human spine built into the perfect chair
very flexible and very very strong I
spent many nights building the
prototypes improving the technology
finding the perfect locking system and
this is the hardest part of the process
making it smooth pitch all handmade and
needs a lot of patience the first time I
saw spin D it was during the exhibition
I touched it
as I couldn't believe it it felt like
silk
from that moment I just knew is going to
be a big training we went to
international exhibitions we won
international awards we were showing it
not as a simple chair but as the unique
piece of furniture would endless
possibilities spin D comes with a manual
of 25 detailed instructions showing that
you can build any chair it's just long
an armchair or well even your sports
equipment
one thing endless possible
jeez
the world is full of things to explore
and we gain an understanding about our
world through sight taste touch but
sometimes our senses don't give us all
the information we want now there's a
solution that can help identify things
around you with the click of a button
introducing links Square SDK a portable
spectrometer and development can blink
square uses visible light to determine
the exact colors of objects and it uses
near-infrared light to detect their
molecular makeup included in your link
Square SDK is a link square spectrometer
a user's guide a set of sample color
chips USB charging cable and spectral
data collection software connect link
Square to a Windows PC using Wi-Fi next
place the link square in contact with
the object of interest then press the
button on the side of the spectrometer
link Square will gather data on how the
object responds to light and transforms
the data into a spectrum graph as a
developer you'll be able to use the
graphs you collect to careen
applications for personal use you can
cream absolutist English between
medications validate the authenticity of
gemstones and much more link square can
be deployed in a wide range of fields
such as research pharmacy education food
and environmental studies
strata OS engineers have tested the
software prototype the hardware and
selected manufacturing partners all
that's missing is you
small spectrometer big possibilities
links where SDK strontium
what if you could play all the music in
the world with just your voice play my
morning playlist
stop play the toxic avenger
volume up
is where the heart is music is my home
