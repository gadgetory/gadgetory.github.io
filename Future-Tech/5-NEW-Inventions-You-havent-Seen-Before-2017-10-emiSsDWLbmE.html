device is travel with you then you know
plug in your devices in different
countries can be a challenge whether you
travel often or once in a while you
probably use one of these at least once
in your lifetime simpler travel adapters
only plug into one type of socket
Universal adapters aren't the most
travel friendly because they're big
bulky and can be quite heavy
well after countless prototypes
extensive testing and customer feedback
we created a better solution to help
travelers plug their devices anywhere in
the world introducing micro the world's
smallest universal travel adapter with
surge protection compacting all the
benefits of a bulky universal adapter
into a cool gadget this smalls a single
socket adapter bringing over a hundred
and fifty countries from all seven
continents into the palm of your hand
squeezing all plugs from around the
world into a compact space for maximum
versatility micro is super small weighs
only 40 grams is durable then very
travel friendly plugging in the micro is
easy micro accepts all major plug types
from around the world the adjustable
integrated casing makes it easy to cover
any third pin safely the release
mechanism is spring-loaded and easy to
use top slide to plug into the Americas
and over 54 countries simply twist to
use in Australia and over 29 other
countries
and when you're done push to store and
block bottom slide to plug into Europe
and over a hundred and twenty five
countries simply connect the integrated
modular third pin extension for access
to the UK and over 47 other countries
when you're done you know the drill
push store and lock the built-in fuse
protects your devices wherever you
travel because a blown fuse is always
better than a fried laptop phone or
tablet simply replace the fuse and
you're ready to go wherever your travels
may take you the world's smallest
lightest universal travel adapter keeps
your gadgets safe and makes plugging
your devices easier than ever before
let's improve the way we plug our
devices when we travel back our campaign
and help us bring micro to life
light our exposure to it during the day
is the key to our health
it's the cue to our internal clock our
circadian rhythm but too much or too
little light at the wrong time disrupts

patterns the system can model your
natural internal clock with unparalleled
accuracy state-of-the-art learning
algorithms then calculate how much your
rhythms are out of sync predicting the
impacts on your daily schedule based on
neuroscience this data is then used to
automatically create a personalized
lighting program using light science it
helps you map your internal clock with
the world clock boosting your mood
cognitive performance alertness and
helping you sleep faster the circadian
tracker works from up to 8 feet away
sensing through your sheets and blankets
highly responsive sensors built into the
sleep tracker detect the movement of
your body and monitors your breathing
patterns with optimal accuracy
temperature humidity light and sound
data from your bedroom enables the
system to learn about your sleep

light therapy program runs automatically
with just 20 minutes of exposure in the
morning the circadian lamp can begin to
retune your body
clock inspired by NASA is the world's
first portable light therapy solution to
tune your body clock using the most
advanced solid-state lighting technology
and a proprietary algorithm the
circadian lamp emits different
wavelengths of light and varying
intensities when you're feeling tired
during the day the lamp Auto adjusts to
give you that much-needed alertness
boost it's just as potent as caffeine
but without keeping you up at night the

Oxford and Harvard Medical School we're
a small design team working to bring to
market - beautifully crafted objects to
help you sink your body clock so you can
feel more alive in September 2016 we
moved to change in China the world's
capital of electronics for four months
to refine our concepts very good
manufacturing experts testing hundreds
of prototype iterations with our design
finalized and rigorously tested beyond
are ready for the help of you
Kickstarter to help bring circadian
through reality with your support we can
invest into tooling and scale production
the journey to better you doesn't just
start with a smartphone sleep tracker or
