display spud is a high-resolution 24
inch display that collapses down to the
size of a book and weighs less than 2
pounds this revolutionary product is the
first truly collapsible display and the
only device that gives you both
portability and a large screen for
entertainment and productivity
throughout the spud design process we
focus on image quality and ease of use
we use the latest projection technology
combined with our own custom optics to
project a large high-quality image over
very short distance
this enables spa to produce a bright
sharp image that's about four times
larger than a laptop screen and 23 times
larger than a smartphone screen to mix
but as easy to use as possible what
design to work just like a rugged ice
umbrella you can pop up the screen in a
very intuitive way and you have this bus
setup and run in less than 10 seconds
and since but it's also lightweight
battery-powered and uses a hassle-free
HDMI connection we can get straight to
the big screen you want without wasting
any time on setup one of the most
exciting things about spud is the many
different ways that you can use them on
the entertainment side spud is basically
a portable TV or movie screen whether
you're traveling camping hanging out
with friends at a coffee shop or just
lounging around your house it's the big
screen that you can use anywhere for
work having a dual screen setup is great
for productivity but you can also use it
for presentations and as a collaboration
it's great for trade shows sales visits
or any kind of field work
spud gives you the flexibility you need
no matter the situation and it's great
because it's a complete solution in a
very small package that you can take
anywhere we have the team the product
