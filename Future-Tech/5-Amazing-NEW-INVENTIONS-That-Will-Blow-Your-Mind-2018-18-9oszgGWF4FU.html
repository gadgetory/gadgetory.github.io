have you experienced frustration in
certain areas of the world
mosquitoes are well-known for bringing
infectious diseases like malaria or
dengue fever which can be fatal to
people and children at an eco as
adventure and people lovers we have
decided to stop it once and for all this
is why we want to present to you the new
mosquitoes Ackroyd lantern it is a
compact and portable lantern but don't
let its small size trick you it is very
powerful the lantern is easy to use
controlled by only two buttons featuring
two main functions sceeto killer and
lighting mode as I told you don't let
its eyes confuse you the anti mosquito
lantern comes with two thousand
milliamps per hour which translates up
to twenty hours of non-stop uses wall
charts so how does it attract the
mosquitoes it's very simple the lantern
uses ultraviolet light to attract them
and then electronically adapt them with
the wires in the upper section and if
you want to use the lantern in the
outdoors you can easily hang it on trees
or inside tent by using the hidden hook
on top as you can see you just unfold it
and it is ready to be hung or the second
feature the lantern itself has three
modes up to 200 lumens to regulate the
amount of light you will need in
different scenarios and just in case
you're wondering yes you can use both at
the same time The Killing mode and the
lighting mode whenever the lanterns
becomes dirty and you need to remove the
dead insects you can just use a small
brush and simply brush them off or you
can use water the zapper man here is
highly water resistant
ig6 reading therefore you can think it
without damaging the lanterns once you
take it out of the water you can
immediately turn it on and as you can
see it works impeccable to ensure that
the lantern works perfectly we have
tested it in many different scenarios
until we have come up with the final
perfected version as the one you can see
in this video the lantern uses a USB
port to charge allowing you to charge it
and use it at the same time for extra
convenience we want to get rid of
mosquitoes and for that we are asking
for your help and your support to fill
our warehouse with the mosquitoes at
romain turn and to finally only get
lighting and edify</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
