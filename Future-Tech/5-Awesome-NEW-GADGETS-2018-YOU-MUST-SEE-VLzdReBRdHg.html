over the last few years we've done
extensive research on bags and after
asking thousands of people we found the
number one use of Nags to carry so
we created on Vonda a great bag
it has two features carries and it
looks great and bond that
doesn't have solar panels smart sensors
or an app it just carries our
pocket system follows a unique
philosophy there's no special pocket for
your battery pack or your wood necklace
just put your in whichever pocket
you want it's your bag and vonda
can hold over 10 billion different items
here are a few examples yes it can hold
the sweater mom pocket we don't jump it
Vonda comes with straps because we
realize you need straps to carry a bag
to carry your since we didn't want
to decide on the way you carry your
inside Vonda you can move the straps
around and carry in a few different ways
like this like this or like this
great options to help moving the straps
around we use the unique method of hooks
and to close the bag we're using
something known as zippers our hooks are
made of zinc iron and the zippers are
top-of-the-line YKK zippers it's a
simple bag but high quality our bags are
lined with the best quality leather we
could find AKA full grain italian
leather but if you don't like leather
there's a leather free option made from
the best not leather material our back
fabric has silver in it to keep bacteria
and bad smells out so you can even put
smelly in your bag without worrying
it will harm the rest of your
it we do have a third
and Vonda comes in many colors and all
of them look great
some might say they look really
great will allow it whatever color you
choose you can rest assured you'll be
able to carry your you can use some
Vonda at school at the office or at the
bus stop really anywhere you can carry a
bag too it can be used by both guys and
girls now that's freaking versatile
Vonda was made by people who wanted to
make a bag that can carry and look
great while doing it so they thought
about it designed it probably ate
something in the process and now it's
here you need a great bag this
is a great bag it's also pretty
affordable so it's a no-brainer
great bag carries reasonably priced
and looks great what more do you
need to put in bag now the key I'm
Vonda a great bag as the world's
population continues to grow we are in
need of more and more food with over 30%
of today's food being thrown out and
wasted we're not only exhausting our
planet but households also throw away
thousands of dollars every year the
benefits of eating healthier and fresher
foods are clear we all want to enjoy
better quality food without wasting our
time money or the environment that is
why we have created Cuba like most
people I found myself throwing away
significant amounts of food because it
had gone bad to prevent this I tried out
several food sealing systems that
lookout air and moist two major factors
for food decay
I found these systems were not practical
and bulky so I started rethinking the
way we store food and we began designing
a system an affordable system that is so
easy to use that it would make sense for
every household to own one vacuum food
saving systems have been around for ages
the benefits are clear removing air and
moisture can have a very significant
impact and the time that you keep your
food fresh however current food saving
systems from all the major brands have a
number of disadvantages
they take up a lot of space in your
kitchen they are inconvenient to use and
most require separate adaptors and
accessories in order to use them with
reusable containers because they are
designed to heat seal banks these banks
can only be used once which is very
wasteful kuva is the only vacuum food
saving system that delivers top
performance and is fully integrated in
your kitchen counter it is always ready
when you need it and blends in perfectly
with your kitchen design cuba works with
special high quality triton containers
and reusable zipper bags the containers
are super durable and freezer microwave
and dishwasher proof there are three
modes on your cuba general mode for
delicate foods full mode for maximum
performance quick marinade mode that
runs a number of vacuum cycles in order
to marinate food in minutes instead of
hours removing air and moisture from dry
goods such as nuts cookies chips and
crackers using our containers will keep
them crisp and fresh as the moment you
open the packaging the multi-layer
bpa-free zipper bags are great for
longer-term storage in the freezer they
are reusable and block out air to help
prevent freezer burn using this system
can keep your food fresh for up to five
times longer special wine stops help you
to keep your wine delicious for several
additional days after opening for the
big sous-vide fans you will find there
is no easier way to prepare your food
for a perfect precision cooking
treatment all the rich flavors and
juices of your food are kept inside
using the specially designed cuba vacuum
bags we started our journey with cuba
almost two years ago and we have already
achieved a lot with a magnificent team a
manufacturing partner is getting ready
for production we just need a last
financial push to kick things off in
order to bring Cuba to food lovers all
over the world we need your support with
your help we can produce the first
batches of a product and ship it to
consumers we have a great selection of
rewards lined up for you so join the

foreign if it took them three times
longer to finish a simple homework

Kansas our family and our friends we
have made a great deal of progress our
prototype is complete our manufacturer
is ready to go now we need your help to
make the reading style pen area
our goal is $40,000 which will cover the
