that will get you to where you need to
be let me introduce you to cycle this is
the coolest electric bike ever created
we've spent countless hours creating a
unique design that is super functional
but looks great wherever you're riding
this is the bike that will get you there
after studying many other a bikes and
receiving a ton of feedback the number
one complaint was the size and bulkiness
of their batteries so we developed a
lightweight alternative that is
faa-approved we had to put some serious
engineering into designing a battery
that is not only compact but will remain
extremely powerful but we didn't stop
there one of the best features of the
cycle is its ability to fold up with
only six hand movements it's extremely
compact and could be folded quickly your
cycle can go from riding ready to being
stored in the closet in less than a
minute our bike weighs only 42 pounds
with its lightweight aluminum aircraft
frame most ebike stop over 45 pounds
without a battery which adds another 7
to 12 pounds the cycle is fully electric
and has pedal assist you can get up to
50 miles on one battery charge with an
average speed around 15 miles an hour
this way you never need to slow down
even when you get to that incline and
when you need to stop our dual disc
brake system will keep you safe in any
situation but what happens when you run
out of juice our batteries are swappable
so you could always carry a spare and
never get stuck without power plus we've
integrated a USB port on the battery so
you can charge any of your electronics
when you're on the go the cycle is truly
a one-of-a-kind bike that will get you
to where you need to be in a breeze
this is mobile it's super comfortable
safe electric bicycle card for travel
within the city and beyond
Mobile is an ecological mode of
transport which will partially replace
the card you can move easy and safely
without facing any limits in
communication with the firewall travel
the passenger can write the mobile
exists commonplace
you can put in the luggage compartment
all what you need and also take
comfortable shoulder pads for a walk
we installed 350 watts area will
electric drive in order to develop the
top speed of 25 kilometers per hour
the total the pond'rous makes it easy to
handle difficult odds independent front
and rear suspension with absorbers
provide a comfortable travel even on a
dirt road as well as his fault
headlight and parking lights at night
Mobile has been modified five times in a
year our goal is to design the
department convenient and multiple
reliable way of comfortable travel it's
available in service from short life
items our standard bike type
we've been working about to design the
first prototype and now we need your
support to launch a serial production of
green transport join us
you
