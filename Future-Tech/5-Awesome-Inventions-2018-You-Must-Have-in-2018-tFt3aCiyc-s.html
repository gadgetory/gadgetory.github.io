breath ometer we're demos and we've made
the best shovel ever other shovels crack
bend and break demos beats them all
literally last year we launched our
kicker tool the stealth shovel on
Kickstarter people loved it but they all
agreed on one thing they wanted
something bigger badder and made for
everyone so we listened and gathered our
team to make the bestest toughest dam
this shovel ever and we did introducing
the alpha shovel mother nature meet
daddy you wanted big oh it's big over 20
inches long and 12 inches deep of
glorious aircraft grade aluminum means
you can shovel away the Ice Age for your
driveway
it's got serrated teeth to cut ice and
shovel gliders to protect your deck
beneath so when we say it's cutting edge
but we mean it
the alpha shovel is durable and tough
rain or shine dirt or snow we built it
to weather through a lifetime of storms
in a storm through any weather our
collapsible shaft makes it easy to pack
and the built-in strap holders makes it
easy to carry and we added a saw for
good luck use it to cut anything that
might get in the way
choose between a D handle for better
grip or a T handle for better
compatibility best of all everything in
the Alpha shovel is interchangeable with
the rest of the demos family allowing
you to build a collection of
multi-purpose tools for life every job
every day for everyone
valpha shovel conditions be damned
Deimos is a collective of lifelong
innovators and adventures we like to go
out and wreck faced with nature and come
back and make the best products ever
we're born and raised in Jackson Hole
but our family goes far beyond town and
state borders this is a collaborative
effort not just between the team but
with pro athletes action enthusiasts and
most importantly our community back our
campaign today and join the demos
collective we thank you for all of your
support
truly demos define not by us but by you
our backers
let's keep crushing it
hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we've come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travelers wanting an easy way
to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
in water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic soak is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution
sonic soap is ready to be shipped just
after our campaign ends we just need you
to help make it happen which means you
can have a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us
bring sonic soap to mass production and
experience clean like never before
now you can enjoy a cleaner lifestyle
where this is game show it's a game
console that's modular portable and open
source so you can do all kinds of cool
stuff take Jackie for example hi she
used it to play indie games like the
classic platformer cave story and with
game shells expandable memory slot she
can download thousands of more titles
online when Jackie's feeling nostalgic
she can also run emulators on her game
show unlike a slippery touchscreen the
classic controller layout is perfect for
retro gaming or you could be like Tom he
likes to mod his games like adding a
cheat codes or new character models he's
even working on developing his own game
for game show it's a prequel to Tetris
you can use Python C Lisp or any other
language
and for makers like William game shell
is an all-in-one def kit that runs
through gnu/linux each kit comes with an
air embassy for an Arduino compatible
programmable keypad a 2.7 inch screen a
1050 milliamp battery and a stereo
speaker you can choose from six
different case colors and with our STL
file you can even 3d print your own with
game shells plug and play modules will
doesn't waste any time searching for
compatible parts everything just works
right out of the box then he just writes
his code on PC or Mac and he can upload
it wirelessly through a Wi-Fi connection
game shell can become a Wi-Fi speaker a
controller for your robot a smart home
remote and even an 8-bit synthesizer the
possibilities are endless from the
beginnings of gaming to the future of
hardware game shell is with you wherever
you want to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
