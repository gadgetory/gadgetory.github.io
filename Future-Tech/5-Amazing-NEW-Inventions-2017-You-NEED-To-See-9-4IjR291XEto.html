when I go out to shoot pictures I used
to have to bring my GPS unit remote
shutter control and a bunch of other
devices with me until I got this neat
little gadget called pin out pin out has
all the functions I need so I don't need
anything else
I bring pinout everywhere I go
it works beautifully with my smartphone
records the locations information and
embeds it into the photos I take
automatically the other day I went to
shoot a short time lapse video I simply
open the pinout app for my smartphone
set all the necessary parameters
and enjoyed every moment of my
transformation into a samurai
pinout can also remote
control up to ten cameras simultaneously
here I set up nine cameras to
automatically detect my every move from
different angles with pinout I'll never
miss another shutter chance pinup is a
must to shoot night scenes
you
with pinouts remote shutter function I
can avoid small vibrations that lead to
blurry pictures
I also use pin out in the name
on the move on my way back I set pinout
to shoot the street scene every fifty
meters from my car
I had an incredible day I can't wait to
see the pictures
