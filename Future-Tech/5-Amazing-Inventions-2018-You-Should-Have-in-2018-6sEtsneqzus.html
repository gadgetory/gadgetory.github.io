has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us however smart phones are
entirely dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
this sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
instant messages voice recordings image
data and GPS locations even when there
is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the sonnet and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonnet users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data through
other SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
four thousand milliamp hour battery that
allows you to use it continuously for up
to 24 hours as a built-in USB port so
that you can even charge your phone with
it on the software side is the sonnet
app an intuitive instant messenger that
draws upon the familiar user experience
in addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call in your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
we've been developing the sonnet for
over a year now and we are super excited
but as possibilities our prototypes are
now complete and we're ready to move in
a full production that's where you come
in we're looking for your support to
bring this form of decentralized
communication into the mainstream
the sana is just the beginning and we're
so grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature
you can input coordinates in the fastest
and most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower in
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse to be able to
create so much value to bottom one has
been built with extraordinary
performance the perfect calibration of
the high performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes
in your pocket is one of the most
revolutionary cameras ever made but how
do you turn amateur footage into a
cinematic masterpiece
the answer is movement introducing
emotion it's a fully automatic slider
that lets you do hollywood-style camera
moves at the push of a button it has
custom modes for any situation and it
works with all smartphones GoPros and
mirrorless cameras it comes with 15 inch
rails that can be extended to double the
sun's yet it easily breaks down to fit
in your bag using an integrated panning
mechanism it automatically creates a
parallax movement as it slides it's
great for products us interviews or
anytime you want a cinematic look
reverse the camera and the parallax
becomes a panning slide giving you a 36
degree wider viewing angle than regular
sliders for vloggers and motion lets you
forget about the camera and focus on
your content using our motion tracking
algorithms
face following intelligently keeps you
in frame as you move around and with the
live streaming inside the app building a
following is easier than ever before for
photographers in motion lets you create
motion time lapses right on your phone
just customize your settings in the app
and hit start
the motion unit can also be removed for
flawless panoramic shots or panning
time-lapses for night shots time lapses
capture more light and maximize your
video quality after the shoot select one
of the many presentence then be a cloud
computing your files will be color
graded automatically for action sports
there's motion trigger using two
Bluetooth sensors you can set up a
trigger for subjects that are up to 30
feet away when activated and motion can
start recording immediately or give you
some lead time for a smoother transition
in motion was filled five film makers
for film makers you can build a full rig
thanks to its three-quarter inch
mounting points and it even has a
built-in USB fast charging port in the
app you have full control of the camera
and slider to create the exact look you
want from a slow track that reveals a
key plot detail to slow cushions for
dramatic effect in motion gives you a
cinematic shot every time hiking
standard I am so Alec and my team and I
need your support to bring in motion to
the market we're a diverse team with
backgrounds in software engineering
mechanical design and manufacturing but
what unites all is a huge passion for
photography with in motion everyone will
be able to create paly old-style shots
just with their smartphone so please
back our campaign today and help us
bring this dream to reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
