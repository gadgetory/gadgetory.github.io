Nima was created to reimagine the way
people manage food allergies both in and
out of the home my daughter Kate suffers
from food allergies and sensitivities we
tried to limit her risks we read labels
research brands even ask endless
questions to restaurant staff but even
when following every precaution there
were still lingering uncertainties
especially when Kate went to birthday
parties when we traveled or in any
situation that I couldn't control most
existing tests are lab kits which means
they have multiple parts and take
precious time to receive a result there
was nothing on the consumer market that
could bring real-time peace of mind
until NEMA developed by MIT graduates
NEMA can detect allergens at parts per
million level parts per million or ppm
is a term used to describe an extremely
small amount of something
imagine this ink is an allergen place a
few drops into the water and it
dissipates the I can't see it but NEMA
can simply fill a disposable capsule
with a small sample of food then screw
the lid shut NEMA grinds the food and
mixes it with the chemistry inside then
the proprietary antibodies seek out and
attach to a target protein like that in
gluten or peanut Nima's test trip
develops and in only a few minutes your
answer is clearly displayed on the front
screen it's an added piece of
information when and where you need it
most the result is also communicated to
the NEMA app using Bluetooth technology
so you can track your test history and
share with the community Nima's team has
dedicated their lives to making the food
world transparent and safe so if you
want to be sure that pasta salad is
actually allergen free just as you
ordered
let NEMA take the first bite
could installing a security system to
your home office or business really be
as easy as screwing in a light bulb the
innovators at top Net decided it should
be with years of development and design
they've created the table net light bulb
security camera which can be installed
in any light outlet to immediately begin
recording your premises the light bulb
security camera has a hundred and twenty
viewing angle that can be adjusted 360
degrees and his motion activated day or
night the camera is equipped with a
backup data storage system in an SD card
and the data can also be downloaded via
Wi-Fi to smart phones or computers a
dedicated app allows you to check your
cameras throughout the day not only does
the camera record video but there's a
two-way audio element that can both
record noise and project it into the
area remotely the light bulb security
camera can even send you an email alert
when motion has been detected
by using a compression video technology
you don't have to worry about running
out of space for your security
recordings so how does it work the unit
is all-in-one and requires no extra
installations beyond placing the tub
that light bulb security camera and a
compatible light socket once installed
it's simple to get it working with your
smartphone app or custom remote control
to have the security of your home office
or business at your fingertips

cooling down with a refreshing drink is
always nice but those trays don't hold
very much ice getting more trays would
overstuff your freezer well here's a way
that's much easier introducing the ice
genie the revolutionary space-saving Ice
Cube maker that could replace as many as
seven traditional ice cube trays ice
genie is easy just fill and chill the
secret is the unique double chamber
design the outer chambers freeze the ice
cubes while the inner cylinder holds
them until you're ready to use them
just lift off the inner cylinder and
empty the tubes into the bucket then
just refill and freeze again Ice GT can
hold up to three batches of ice cubes
that's 120 ice cubes at a time Wow no
more overcrowding save a ton of space in
your freezer
take off the lid and now you're ready to
serve the whole party I selected over
tres starts to smell but I squeezed
tight lid keeps your cubes fresh and
odor free even fancy refrigerator ice
makers run out of ice or get clogged up
and to get ice out of trays you have to
turn and twist but just precise genies
flexible chamber and those cold cubes
pop in your comand put on the spill
proof lid for easy storage when you're
finished just rinse or toss of the
dishwasher then fill a chill again and
look slide your favorite drinks into ice
GT to keep that chill for hours and even
holds an entire pint of ice cream enough
for the whole family make all your cold
drink dreams come true with the ice
