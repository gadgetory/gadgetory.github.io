consuming content from sharing updates

I'm Brent lead engineer designer and
inventor of superstring we all love
watching and enjoying content on our
smartphones but even large phones offer
us subpar viewing experience we rarely
use our tablets because our phones are
so much more personalized and functional
I knew there had to be a way to make a
low-cost high-quality touchscreen device
they could harness the power of the
smartphones you are do that's why we
created super screen the most affordable
large screen device that doesn't need a
paid

70% of Americans have trouble falling
asleep at least one night a week it's
never been harder to turn off our minds
completely unplug and reach a deep
relaxation and restless that we actually
need introducing gravity a weighted
blanket engineered to be 10 percent of
your body weight to naturally reduce
stress and increase relaxation through
deep pressure stimulation over the last
year we've studied the incredible
science and medical research about the
positive effects that weighted blankets
can have on serious conditions like PTSD
insomnia OCD and serious forms of
anxiety this is critical because 40
million people in the country suffer
from prolonged anxiety that is 18
percent of the country and so we wanted
to take this science and design a
product that could help everyone each
gravity blanket is tailored to represent
about 10% of your body weight it evenly
distributes pressure across your body
while you rest by stimulating these
pressure points gravity blanket
increases serotonin and melatonin levels
while decreasing cortisol levels some
studies even reported that 90 percent of
participants felt an overall calmer
feeling and a reduced sense of anxiety
and it isn't just for sleep the blacki
can be used in bed or it can be used on
the couch after a super long day or it
can assist you in reaching a deeper
meditation or mindfulness we've
developed a range of weighted options
spanning from 15 20 and 25 pounds to fit
your individual needs and preferences
from beautiful design to material
sourcing we set out to create a blanket
that looks and feels as great as it
performs the inner shell is a hundred
percent cotton while the outer shell is
a beautiful and ultra comfortable micro
plush fabric the soft outer shell
provides amazing comfort for warmth
during the colder months and it's easily
removable to remain cool during the Sun
this also makes it super easy to wash
our trusted manufacturing partners are
ready to go all we need is your support
to make this product a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
