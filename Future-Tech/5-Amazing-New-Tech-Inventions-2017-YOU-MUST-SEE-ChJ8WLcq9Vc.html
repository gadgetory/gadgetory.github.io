that way that's what he's been doing for
the past 20 years and he's becoming
pretty damn good at it well I wish this
story was all fun and games but
sometimes you got to take action to
preserve your body Mike's ears are
paying the price whenever he is DJing
and producing he feels fatigue pain and
loss of sensitivity but not anymore
now he uses D but a plus that lets sound
in and keeps noise out ha what is this D
but thing you ask D but is what saved
Mike from imminent silence and can save
a lot of other people featuring a slider
that allows you to adjust to the amount
of decibels you want to filter out D but
gives you a clearer crisper and safer
music experience what's the difference
between D but and a regular ear plug you
might ask well here's some scientific
explanation your ear is designed to
naturally boost frequencies around 2 to
4 Q Hertz like human speech most ear
plugs simply fill out your ear canal to
block sound problem is that they alter
your years resonance frequency causing
muffle to unclear hearing as a result
with D butts you can speak feel listen
move do exactly what you used to do
our acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
diba simply brings you clear safe sound
for Mike this was a decision that
dramatically changed the quality of his
life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it free
text slides it to pitch down the high
notes of joyful children and still be
able to talk to the parents ed and Paul
slide it to tone down machine noise and
keep the creative juices flowing Anna
explains it just so she can hear herself
think at the agency and still be aware
of the latest gossip
Samuel flies it to maintain sanity and
focus and make every chance of small
talk a prolific dialogue after years of
research prototyping and testing we
achieved a sleek design plug with
minimum visual impact perfect fit and
ease of use
this means crisper clearer hearing with
reduced volume every time we're ear less
and our mission is to bring you a better
and safer listening experience no matter
who you are or what you do
help us make a difference for millions
of people around the world d bud let's
sound in keep the noise out we're over
and we just made a whole new way to
chill hi I'm Tommy de Francia and this
is the rover roller Rovers mission is to
make gathering the outdoors more fun I
was tired of soggy foods back-breaking
halls and warm drinks so I decided to
make my own cooler and Rover was born we
started with the best materials the best
manufacturers to make the best cooler
ever even the Bears couldn't handle it
sorry bears and people loved it we got
tons of amazing reviews and couldn't get
enough awesome feedback
now we've taken that feedback and made
the best even fester introducing the
roller 60 the same amazing quality the
same bear proof durability the same
powerful utility all in a compact 60
quart package with even better features
the roller 60 is the mobile hub for your
campsite tailgate picnic or anywhere
else you might find yourself lounging in
the open air it's perfect for people who
love to create outdoors without all the
great outdoor hassle and brings the
comfort of home anywhere we pack the
roller 60 with all the features we
wanted and never found in any other
product we tackled the design by
thinking of three main phases of outdoor
recreation
first there's the getting there we were
sick of the super heavy and super clunky
coolers that were a total hassle to move
anywhere the roller 60s toughest nails
with proto molded construction and it's
also got the most advanced all-terrain
wheels so it easily rolls right along
with you on the most rugged of terrain
we even made the wheels bigger to make
it easier to get across and our dual
grip aluminum t-handle makes for
extremely easy leverage and comfortable
pulling on both ends so it doesn't
matter if you're a lefty or a righty you
won't be getting any more heel knocks
there's probably someone who loves
taking three separate trips to haul gear
from the car to the campsite we just
haven't met them yet that's why we
include our collapsible wagon bin
perfect for hauling sleeping bags dry
goods and all kinds of stuff
quick-release velcro attachments let you
add or remove the bin fully loaded and
if you're not using it it makes a comfy
seat and if two wheels are your thing
then you're really in luck because the
roller 60 is the first cooler with a
bicycle hitch allowing for attaching go
haulage that you literally can't find
anywhere else and because it's durable
it can stand the toughest of abuse
second bears the keeping cool the roller
sixty is even cooler than your average
cooler it's capable of keeping your
stuff cool for 10 whole days you heard
that right over a week of ice retention
that we've battled tested ourselves and
with separate tribe bins there's no more
hamburger meat rub and toes with your
sodas or unidentified juices overtaking
everything else inside you can organize
a roller 6e just like your own fridge
and finally there's a real important
work of parting down while your stuff
stays cool and dry inside the roller 60
turns into your mobile food prep station
and bar to the cutting board dual
cupholders and stash bag that allow
access to the inside of the roller while
in use you can even use the anchor
points to tie the roller down or hook
other accessories up like your
entertainment center and of course it's
still bear proof not today bear with so
many awesome features in an
uncompromised design we knew that the
Kickstarter community was a perfect
place to launch the roller 60 is a
community of people that want stuff that
works with no BS and no gimmicks our
mission is to innovate premium outdoor
products that make gathering in the
outdoors more fun but we need your help
we need funds to get in our first
purchase order and get manufacturing
going so we're asking you the
Kickstarter community to back our
project and get the roller 60 out there
support the cooler that's so much more
than a cooler and be the first to
impress your friends at the next camp
down and put all other neighboring
coolers to shame we just made the great
outdoors even greater and can't wait to
see you out there Cheers
you
you
the battle against clutter is something
we all face clutter is one of those
things you don't want to think about but
it always seems to creep in over time
making it impossible to find things when
you actually need them like many of you
I spend the majority of my day working
at my desk and find myself reaching for
the same things over and over but by the
end of the day my desk always ends up a
complete cluttered mess because I don't
have a place to put everything I search
for a product that would help me solve
this problem but all I found were those
ugly cheaply made organizers they all
pretty much look the same and thought
out of place in my modern workspace they
just seemed to add to the clutter what I
wanted was a beautifully designed
minimal organizer that could gather all
of my essentials into one central place
something that could be customized or
easily repositioned on my desk
rather than fumbling around with a bunch
of bulky containers so for the past
three years I've been designing just
that after working through dozens of
prototypes and sketches I'm proud to
finally show you the result this is
gather gather is a modular home for your
essentials that is thoughtfully designed
to help you cut through the clutter
it adapts to your workspace and workflow
to make sure the tools you need are
always within reach since we all have
different preferences gather can be
configured in hundreds of different ways
- exactly the way that works best for
you I designed everything using a grid
system which allows each of the top
pieces to be rotated or positioned
anywhere along the base so whether
you're right-handed or left-handed like
me gather can easily adapt the magnets
embedded in the base allow you to attach
additional pieces in multiple different
ways you can even combine two full sets
to create a much larger organizer
I love that gathers minimal form-factor
actually forces me to keep only my
essentials on my desk I no longer have
to dig through my drawer of fifty
different pens to find my favorite one
it's always right there in front of me
the more I've used gather the more I've
noticed its impact on my productivity it
eliminates so many of those little
distractions throughout the day even
though I primarily designed gather to
organize my desk I've realized that
actually works great for organizing so
many other spaces as well I've been
designing products for over eight years
and in my opinion this is the best one
yet a tug monk design is at the center
of everything we do
gather may look simple from the outside
but I've put a ton of thought and
engineering into every little detail to
make it the perfect marriage of form and
function so now after three years of
fine-tuning the details of gather I'm
finally ready to do a full manufacturing
run but I need funding for the tooling
costs so we can make it all happen with
your help we can make gather a reality
do you want to travel more with less and
help the environment
well now you can wherever you go say
hello to go bout the world's best
portable multi dispenser traveling with
separate containers consumes valuable
space and the containers often leak no
matter how organized do you try to be
keeping track of too many containers and
be difficult hi I'm Bibi I'm here today
to tell you about go belt
we'll go bout you can customize store
and dispense multiple formats like
shampoo body wash specialist lotion and
conditioner all from one portable
you
cap to the product you want and press on
top viewing windows make it easy to see
which products you are dispensing to
access the capsules for refilling open
the bottom part and take the capsules
out like batteries from a flashlight
robot comes in two sizes a large and a
small reason for the large version is
capsule is less than 3.4 ounces or 100
milliliters which means at some airport
security checks
you just have to remove the capsules
from the main body and for the small
version you don't need to remove the
capsules at airport security because it
complies with air travel easy as that
before go out we have been carrying
separate travel-size bottles usually
inside a plastic bag for lack of a more
suitable smart and sustainable
alternative billions of plastic toiletry
containers end up in West landfills
every year this needs to change if we
are to save our planet from pollution
GoBot help solve this crisis by offering
a convenient comprehensive way of
reusing travel-size
you simply refill your capsules at home
and store them in our beautiful housing
dispenser
ask not what your planet can do for you
ask what you can do for your planet
we are so excited for you to be the
first to have our product feel free to
check out our rewards thank you so much
and hey just be out with Gobert the
world's best portable multi dispenser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
