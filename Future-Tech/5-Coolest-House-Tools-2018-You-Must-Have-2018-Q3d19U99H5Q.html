easier than you've ever imagined to
build projects with drawers which means
you can create projects you might have
only dreamed of before that's because
the drawer slide jig takes the guesswork
and uncertainty out of installing drawer
slides and makes it easier for anyone to
install drawers that fit right and glide
smoothly every time the drawer slide jig
does this by securely supporting the
slide in the exact position needed as
you install them in the cabinet plus the
jig supports the drawer boxes as well to
ensure that the slides get installed on
them with perfect alignment - whether
you're installing drawers in a cabinet
with face frames or in a cabinet or
piece of furniture without frames the
versatile drawer slide jig clamps in
place easily and the jig works with ball
bearing epoxy coated and under mount
slides using the drawer slide jig
couldn't be simpler built-in Tam's
register the jigs brackets in place
precisely just align the tabs with the
face frame and then clamp the bracket in
place this positions the bracket exactly
where you needed to place the jig at the
right height and does it without
measuring ensuring foolproof level
positioning of the slide on frameless
cabinets in cases the process is still
simple the brackets register against the
front edge of the cabinet and clamp in
place at the layout line sitting
straight and level every time once
clamped in place the jigs brackets
support the drawer slide completely
providing that third hand you've always
needed to hold the slides in place no
matter how big or heavy the slide the
drawer slide jig holds it in straight
and level so you have both hands-free to
drive in the screws and the drawer slide
jig doesn't stop there after all the job
isn't complete until the drawer box
itself is aligned and installed that's
why the jigs brackets are reversible so
they can be mounted do protrude out of
the cabinet and hold that drawer box in
the exact right position that allows you
to set the drawer box on the brackets
and then pull the slides into position
the sturdy brackets hold everything in
place as you drive in the mounting
screws with the correct drawer slide jig
you'll have the confidence you need to
take your projects to the next level and
create custom pieces with drawers
because you'll know that you can
drawers that look great fit correctly
and work right for more information

Dan with home right I'm going to show
you how to set up and use the quick
painter the quick painter is a trimming
tool that has a pad a trigger and a fill
handle to fill it we're gonna remove the
pad attachment and put the tip of the
quick painter into our paint we're gonna
depress the trigger pull back on the
fill handle and wait for a moment while
it fills with paint when it's full we
release the trigger we're gonna wipe off
the excess paint from the fill tube and
now we can put the pad attachment back
on
I like the pad attachment opposite of
the trigger and I'll show you why
there's a little air in here so we'll
want to purge that and what we'll do is
we'll want to hold a rag in front of it
and we'll push the trigger and you'll
hear that air come out and now we're
ready to go you can see the paint it's
coming out beginning to come out with
the holes now we're going to use the
quick painter to cut it along this
window to do that I'm going to put the
edge there's a guide on the edge of the
pad here right up against the trim on
the window I'm gonna give the trigger a
little push to feed a little paint as I
do that I'm gonna move it up and down to
work the paint into the pad now is I
need a little paint
I'll give the trigger a push and just
working it in I can cut right up to the
edge of the window
after edging is complete you can remove
the pad attachment he press the trigger
and return unused paint back into the
can this will save paint and speed
cleanup
now we're ready to clean up I have a
wash tub with some warm soapy water here
I'm gonna put the pad attachment in and
let that soak a little rinse that out
next I'm going to show you how to clean
up the handle we're going to hold the
trigger and pull water up into the
handle give it a shake to help loosen
the paint then press the trigger to
discharge the water
we're gonna change the water rinse out
the pad and then we can dry everything
off and reassemble it I'll be ready for
next Drive won't work can be messy and
tough to get right the high mud gun
helps you tackle drywall jobs with
confidence and success and without the
mess it operates like a caulk gun just
squeeze the trigger to release drywall
compound and the mud gun lays down just
the right amount for each kind of
drywall job perfect for taping finishing
and pet repair load directly from a
five-gallon bucket or use a convenient
mud pack depending on your model the
hyde mud gun fast clean and professional
every time this tape here if you pull on
it in this direction will withstand
2,000 pounds of force we have here a new
tape or a ribbon called bran that's
going to be introduced into the
marketplace that literally has thousands
of uses waiting to be discovered
just as ice turns to water and turns
clear at any temperatures above 32
degrees Fahrenheit
this tape requires a tenth temperature
of a hundred and thirty-eight degrees
Fahrenheit to turn clear so by taking
this tape now which is fully
crystallized to powers exposing it to
water above 138 degrees Fahrenheit top
like this this can be inserted into two
holes where a bolt dropped out or if you
want to fasten something it could be
going into a piece of wood where the
screw is stripped it all up
but as this hardens now this becomes
almost indestructible
there's millions of places that you can
put just a plug like that but we can
produce a finger splint for a broken
finger very quickly out of this tape
something that's very very flexible and
you can form a finger point when that
cools it'll be just a stiff or a
strongest deal if you've ever stripped a
screw or broken off the head of a bolt
you know how frustrating that can be
well not anymore
