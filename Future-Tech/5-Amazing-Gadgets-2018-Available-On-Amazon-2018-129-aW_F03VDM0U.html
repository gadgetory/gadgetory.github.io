early bird cafe you and me we're busy
people then being busy means checking
your phone even when you're not supposed
to even when you're on the road but now
there's navdy hold on we gotta get this
Jason talk to me hey Adam quick reminder
first thing today about coffee with
Connie and Greg everybody already on my
way
see what's brilliant about navdy is this
master route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes perfect
never been this way before I'm gonna
switch to Navi - see what's so brilliant
about Navitus it's display is focused in
the distance so your eyes are never off
the road it's also 40 times brighter
than your smartphone and it dims
automatically so it's easy to see day or
night
in fact sorry gotta take this one - Greg
and I actually want to do Rose cafe ad
on 60 - smiley face Oh awesome
luckily Royce is one of my favorites
Abdi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps so you'll never get lost
like out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
rerouting to nearest gas station text
Connie be there in 15
you have arrived
thanks Navi see you soon
being a parent is the hardest job in the
world dude sorry well we wouldn't change
you for the world would we what are we
honey yeah we all know how hard it is to
entertain the entire family together
so I bought this the Roxy it's easy to
set up you just plug and play roxy is a
music entertainment experience for the
whole family
it's got unlimited music streaming
karaoke style singing music trivia games
worldwide radio and a therapeutic sound
machine pretty cool huh
talking to it has millions of tracks to
choose from which is over a hundred
years of great music a hundred years
then hope you moved out by then right
The Roxy also has music quizzes so your
kids will finally be impressed with your
encyclopedic knowledge of all music
that's baby from Justin Bieber's
follow-up to his seminal classic my
world my world - Wow dad it's like you
know everything I want to be as cool as
you when I grow up
The Roxy also has a bundle of
therapeutic sounds for those moments
when you just need to chillax
it even has karaoke scooting fun if kids
could recognize talent when they see it
what do you think so that's the Roxy
with the smart voice search and a bundle
of music entertainment experiences I
think it's gonna make this parenting
thing pretty easy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
