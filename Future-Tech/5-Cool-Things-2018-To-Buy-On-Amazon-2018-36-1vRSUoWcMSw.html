we're out here at Kualoa Park filming
with the new typhoon 8 with intel
realsense technology
I've been filming professionally with
drones since early 2013 and since then
watching the progression with this
technology I'm really excited to show
you what this can do
the amazing thing about the typhoon h
with intel realsense technology is that
it doesn't just fall short of avoiding
an object but it will intelligently
reroute itself around it and continue on
its path
the incredible thing about this new
technology is that it gets smarter and
smarter as you fly it and while you're
flying it it creates a 3d mapping of its
surrounding and it will remember it it's
so easy to use obstacle avoidance just
simply flip the switch into the on
position obstacle avoidance works in
both smart and angle mode if you're in
angle mode you have full control of the
typhoon H but if real sense is activated
it will stop you from moving forward
into an object that it senses but you
can go up down left and right around the
object just not forward into it in smart
mode you can really see how realsense
technology works by selecting follow me
and turning on real sense the typhoon
edge will avoid all obstacles while
tracking your position and keeping you
in the shot
