hi I'm Nate Barr the creator of pocket
monkey I created this multi-tool because
I'm a handy guy who likes to tinker with
things and I'd prefer to carry pocket
monkey instead of a pocket knife because
a pocket knife is bulky this just fits
naturally and one slot of your wallet
and it's got 12 tools so most cases when
you need something you'll find it right
here let me take you through what we
have
we've got bottle opener which is by far
probably the most useful things we've
got a small screwdriver a larger
screwdriver a Phillips head screwdriver
six different sizes of hex wrenches a
letter opener
there are inches on the front
millimeters on the back and if you stick
a credit card through this slot here
you'll end up making a phone stand this
is really good for if you're on a long
flight and you're watching a movie you
don't have to hold your phone the whole
time or crane over your phone just lying
flat on the table initially I thought it
was a 12 function tool but people have
continually suggested new uses for it
for instance the arms of the monkey were
suggested to be an earbud cord wrap it's
something that seems obvious now but my
friend suggested it and it stuck the
thing I use the most these days is
actually the letter opener for tearing
open packages I've always been
interested in creating new things and
after college I started focusing on
really big picture ideas but I got
frustrated with how long it takes to
actually make the next Facebook or the
next Google even if he did have that
idea I was able to create pocket monkey
using open source tools so I could make
it for free while being able to work and
support myself at the same time it's
made out of stainless steel that's been
heat treated to four times the strength
so it can stand up to any task
introducing bran the next step in
material evolution a pure polymer ribbon
the lightest strongest most adaptable
material that has ever been invented one
single ribbon resists over 2,500 pounds
of pull strength dare to go farther dare
to pull harder
strong as steel
then this paper
easy-to-use unlimited possibilities
three rivets weigh one-tenth of an ounce
total are capable of towing a 5,000
pound truck up a 30 degree grade
when in contact with itself under heat
it forms a single homogeneous structure
when cooled totally resistant to cold
abrasion puncture moisture and chemicals
flexible formable reformable can be
form-fitted into medical and athletic
protection bite splints and mouth guards
toe caps and safety guards can be shaped
into a myriad of custom grips and
handles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
