never miss another update what makes a
smart security camera truly intelligent
and how does the ability to
differentiate between objects animals
and people bring us closer to that peace
of mind we all desire when buying a
smart security camera you want to make
sure that wherever you are your home is
always in good hands but smart security
cameras are either overly complicated
unreliable expensive or all of the above
so one year ago we set up to change all
that
hi my name is daniel i'm co-founder and
vp of engineering at iCloud and this is
what we've been working on driven by
Intel Nvidia 12-core vpu iCloud cam is
the first battery-powered security
camera to run an embedded neural network
for efficient power consumption the
camera uses one core while the other
ones are waiting to be wakened by an
event when iCloud cam sees an unknown
person it starts recording and sends a
notification containing the images of
the event along with the option to
trigger an acoustic alarm iCloud cam
captures and encrypts crisp HD videos
day and night and works on hardcore
rechargeable batteries that last up to
six months
truly wireless and cordless it can be
placed anywhere inside or outside
keeping your surroundings cable free and
safe
have been hanging off a metallic object
or simply place it on a flat surface
plug and play a few well except there's
nothing to plug essential to our
innovation was our experience working on
Intel's ma Vidya CPU as well as our
know-how in computer vision image
sensors and AI algorithms we use machine
learning to feed the camera countless
scenarios to ensure the least amount of
false alarms possible we created an
all-in-one smart security camera that
delivers real-time person and face
detection that is truly wireless and
affordable what if I told you the
struggle to combine your phone and
wallet is over no more clumsy money
clips bulky traditional wallet cases or
case pouches and leave your credit cards
and cash exposed what if I told you it's
possible for your cards and cash to be
completely secure while having the
industry's best phone protection let's
face it dropping your phone is
inevitable in the fast-paced world we
live in whether you're running around
trying to carry too much or the phone
just simply slips out of your hand why
not be completely covered for this very
reason the commute offers met lab
certified military-grade drought
protection the met transit drop test is
a rigorous test where an iPhone 7 and 7
plus were each dropped 26 times on each
corner face and edge of the bones the
phones were dropped from 4 feet high
onto 2 inch thick plywood over concrete
floor the B commute passed all tests
meaning the phones were undamaged and
the B commute itself showed no signs of
damage or deterioration all features of
the phones were thoroughly tested and
both phones proved to be 100% functional
still not convinced well we weren't even
so we conducted our own test we dropped
an iPhone 10 5 times from over 4 feet
high onto a sport
not only did it survive the iPhone 10
was in perfect condition and fully
functional so you can have peace of mind
thanks to V commutes exceptional
protection you will also more than
likely make several transactions a day
at the drive-thru at the store online or
the coffee shop the V commute gives you
quick and easy access to cash credit
cards and ID's which are perfectly
secure and out of sight thanks to its
discreet magnetic flap the same magnetic
flap you have a multi aimed state which
allows you to enjoy Netflix Amazon Prime
video Hulu and YouTube and it's free all
while maintaining a slim and sleek
profile that easily fits into any pocket
warmers the V commute is also compatible
with magnetic car mounts so there's no
need for any metal plates on your phone
or in your case the V commutes patented
design gives you three useful features
all in one phone case this is the
commute
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
