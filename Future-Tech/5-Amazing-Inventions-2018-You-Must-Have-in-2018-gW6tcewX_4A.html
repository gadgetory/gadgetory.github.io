Brooklynese a Brooklyn s we love
bicycles and our mission is to get more
people riding bikes that is why we
designed the class enhanced we have been
talkin to users all along the creative
process and we have come out with what
we believe is an awesome helmet we
imagine a bike helmet that people will
love we use design to humanize
technology making a simple and intuitive
so you can write safely we not hassle
the class and helmet has cameras in the
front effect that read the environment
our algorithm uses that data to
translate it to useful information for
the rider then the information is
relayed through our simple and intuitive
visor interface the video recorded can
be accessed in case of an accident and
could help you settle a dispute gesture
sensors read your natural movements and
the turning lights are activated by
indicating your turn with your arms the
brake light is activated when the helmet
feels a reduction in travel speed you
get step-by-step navigation guidance in
the simplest ways the interface is
simple and doesn't require you to take
your eyes off of the road set your
destination and the class and helmet
will guide you there one of the most
exciting things about Classen is that
you have access to the video at anytime

video a gift and share it with friends

beautiful it can be programed easily to
perform all sorts of robotic tasks
point and click in an object on screen
and see ex-fighter navigate to it
automatically we've open-sourced all of
the ex-fighter 3d models you can easily
modify and improve your X later in 3d
print anyone not only connects phyto

imagination is the limit with ex-fighter
hello everybody
this is max and very happy to introduce
your something we have been working on
for the past nine months it is powerful
and the beautiful robot is like spider
but before we get into the details we'd
like to show you the team behind the
direct spider and the how it goes to the
idea to start this project
ex-fighter was created by the rebel if
team the Robo if team is passionate
about making robots most of the team
members came from team water one of the
top college robot teams in China we won
four championships in RoboCup one of the
top robotic competitions for college
students in November 2015 we got the
team back together to create a robot
that is as beautiful as an anime figure
and deserving to be put on display it
also has to be powerful just like a
program with a competition or book for
nine months we worked hard we went
through dozens of designs and hundreds
of 3d printed parts were tested we made
several iterations of ex-fighter and
published them on Facebook we got such a
good response that we got invited to
different shows and forums we went back
to refining and improving our ideas
again and again going through more than
26 redesigns 100 manuscripts and over
500 3d models proves our passion and
persistence for robotics and our
ex-fighter project
