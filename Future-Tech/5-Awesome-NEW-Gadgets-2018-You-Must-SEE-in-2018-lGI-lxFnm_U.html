inventor of the ideal concealed pistol
also known as the cellphone pistol and
that's because it takes the shape of an
ordinary smartphone and allows a pistol
to hide in plain sight
the mission and ideal conceal was to
make a pistol that could be carried the
same as a traditional smartphone this
would be the ideal conceal in its
holster basically to use it you open it
depress the safety which is the handle
will deploy and then it's actually ready
to be used to reload it or load it you
simply open it that way place two shells
in there close it latch it is this youth
gun also has hard sights on it which
some of the other very small pistols did
not have we wanted to have people have a
way to cite it in the future this area
here will be able to carry a small laser
so we're doing all the things that are
necessary to make a really great pistol
but also to conceal it very easily you
should invest an ideal conceal because
it will essentially help to get this
product out on a worldwide basis very
quickly and our goal here is to help
people protect themselves so we invented
the ideal concealed pistol so that you
can carry a pistol for self-defence and
not have to have it be difficult on you
ideal conceal carry the revolution
