changed forever and since then it hasn't
stopped for a second
this April we're returning to
Kickstarter to drive it another step
forward
imagine total control over your iPhone's
camera like never before with no less
than five external buttons just like a
real DSLR imagine a more comfortable and
safer grip for taking pictures
one-handed even with gloves imagine
being able to connect it to a tripod for
much sharper pictures and connecting it
to almost anything you want unleash the
power of your iPhone's camera for better
pictures
time after time picked our DSLR your
iPhone
more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shot each surge of voltage
trains your brain and weakens the neural
connection until the bad habit is
severed next replace the bad habit with
a positive one reward yourself when you
complete your daily goal commit to a
penalty if you fail the fear of loss
stimulates your basal ganglia while the
chance of reward motivates your
prefrontal cortex in fewer than 30 days
the action becomes a habit
Havelock is the first system designed to
help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track

record alvin and the chipmunks on
Netflix tonight alright hi we're here to
tell you about our revolutionary new
product the egg
if you're like us you've probably
accumulated a ton of videos photos and
other personal content it's on your
phones your cameras and all your other
devices which means you're probably
running out of room you're deleting
content or you're storing it somewhere
else like in the cloud however we're
finding out that content in the cloud is
not exactly secure not only our cloud
service company's tracking your every
move but hacking stealing of personal
photos and online data breaches are
becoming all too common for all of this
and more we bring you the egg the egg is
the first handheld device that lets you
instantly create space on your devices
when you need it the most and it lets
you share this personal content without
having to give up your privacy to cloud
services let's look at how you can use
the egg have you ever tried to take a
picture or shoot a video or add some
music only to find out that you've maxed
out your storage well you can solve that
problem by backing up your content to
the egg and you still have access to all
that content from wherever you are just
by using our egg apps on top of that you
can share it with whomever you like and
whenever you like
let's take a look at another way you can
use the egg
have you ever tried to share a hi-def
video that's more than 15 seconds long
it's not easy but with the egg you can
instantly share an HD quality video of
almost any length and you don't have to
upload it to a cloud service like
YouTube or Vimeo and the video remains
completely under your control on the end
with the egg no one can view that video
unless they have your permission and
when you're done sharing you can take it
down instantly the egg comes with up to
256 gigabytes of storage plenty of space
for keeping your ever-growing collection
of personal photos videos and other
content with the eggs self configuring
Wi-Fi it's simple to connect to the
internet from any public or private
hotspot and each egg has an onboard
website with a unique domain name that
you select finally with our Android and
iOS apps you'll be able to control and
access your egg anywhere from your
smartphone the egg is also a great value

and you'll never need to pay for cloud
storage so we hope you're as excited
