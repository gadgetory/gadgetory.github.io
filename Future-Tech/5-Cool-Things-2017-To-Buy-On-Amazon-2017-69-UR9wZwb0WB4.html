changed forever and since then it hasn't
stopped for a second
this April we're returning to
Kickstarter to drive it another step
forward
imagine total control over your iPhone's
camera like never before with no less
than five external buttons just like a
real DSLR imagine a more comfortable and
safer grip for taking pictures
one-handed even with gloves imagine
being able to connect it to a tripod for
much sharper pictures and connecting it
to almost anything you want unleash the
power of your iPhone's camera for better
pictures
time after time picked our DSLR your
iPhone
more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shot each surge of voltage
trains your brain and weakens the neural
connection until the bad habit is
severed next replace the bad habit with
a positive one reward yourself when you
complete your daily goal commit to a
penalty if you fail the fear of loss
stimulates your basal ganglia while the
chance of reward motivates your
prefrontal cortex in fewer than 30 days
the action becomes a habit
Havelock is the first system designed to
help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track
