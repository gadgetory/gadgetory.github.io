wheel you put the pedal to your passion
but nothing gets between you and your
independence faster that are speeding
second take back the freedom of the road
and set your own work with Beltronics
new gt7 radar detector the best-in-class
GT 7 provides extreme radar and laser
detection protection in a sleek design
with supercharged accuracy to block
annoying false alerts from radar laser
guns to red-light cameras to follow lead
on an air patrol there are more ways
than ever to get a ticket but Beltronics
cutting-edge technology has you covered
the GT 7 is powerful digital signal
processing finds far-reaching threats
exceedingly fast while providing
instantly clear voice alerts to keep you
way ahead of what's too far down the
road
the average speeding ticket costs $150
and getting one ticket means you're
likely to pay $900 in increased
insurance costs over the next three
years with radar/laser detector is legal
in every state except Virginia and
Washington DC the Beltronics gt7
pays for itself when saving you from a
single ticket so you can hit the road
with extreme confidence
and xtreme3 the Beltronics gt7 live life
in the passing
hello again empty fastest route sound to
early bird cafe you and me we're busy
people and being busy means checking
your phone even when you're not supposed
to even when you're on the road but now
there's navigate hold on I gotta get
this KC talk to me hey Adam quick
reminder first thing today about coffee
with Connie and Greg at the everybody
already on my way
see what's brilliant about navdy is this
master route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes perfect
never been this way before I'm gonna
switch to nab you - see what's so
brilliant about navdy is its display is
focused in the distance so your eyes are
never off the road
it's also 40 times brighter than your
smartphone and it dims automatically so
it's easy to see day or night
in fact it sorry gotta take this one to
Greg and I actually want to do Bruce
Cafe add-on 60 - smiley face Oh awesome
luckily Royce is one of my favorites NAB
Dee uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps so you'll never get lost
like out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
gas rerouting - nearest gas station text
Connie be there in 15
you have arrived
thanks Navi see you soon
waste when engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete when discarded for the
next big thing for depleting our natural
resources at astonishing rates or public
pollutants and trash into the
environment developments and
sustainability are promising but they're
not happening fast enough and the
solutions are still too expensive and
inaccessible what if we can make a
machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at tribal tax we're tackling the problem
of wastes by creating the first of its
kind nanoparticles that actually repair
machines while increasing performance
and efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem private X
nanoparticles have two faces one
deadlines are one less slides a sticky
side reinforces and strengthens or the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon telling the diamond in a mantle
of the earth TurboTax sulfa life through
a diamond like lattice structure under
the heat and pressure of the engine
unlike other protective proteins this
process actually reverses engine where
particle by particle restores it to a
better than new condition or initial
focus was to make lubricants safer among
many nanomaterials we worked on one
unique outlier reduce friction
dramatically down to super lubricity
level with the help of national labs and
research agencies we understood the
mechanism and developed proprietary
production products after years of
research and rigorous testing were proud
to introduce car boss a safe and green
additive for your car but improves gas
mileage boosts horsepower and extends
the life of your end
car boss comes in a small recyclable
applicator that you inject into the oil
fill of your car as you drive turret X
nanoparticles are forged into a diamond
like armor around engine components
rejuvenating a daily driver to become
more efficient than when it was new a
third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on engine friction with
612 million cars on the road that waste
adds up running on car boss will use
less fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint we're ready to
go to market and we need your help back
our Kickstarter and be the first to
adopt a revolutionary technology they'll
make our world more efficient more
powerful and more sustainable car bombs
