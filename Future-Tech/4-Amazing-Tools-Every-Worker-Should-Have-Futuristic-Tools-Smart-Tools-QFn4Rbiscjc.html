craftsman 25-foot Sidewinder tape
measure standard measuring tapes stand
straight up causing them to frequently
tip over while in use with the
Sidewinder the patented design rotates
the tape to lay flat making it the most
stable tape measure on the market

rear tang provides increased
stabilization and allows you to make
repetitive layout marks based on a given
distance rather than pulling out the
length of the tape and doing difficult
math

fractions a breeze the auto blade block
makes the job easy automatically locking
in place so the tape only retracts when
you want it to and a convenient writable
surface helps you keep track of
