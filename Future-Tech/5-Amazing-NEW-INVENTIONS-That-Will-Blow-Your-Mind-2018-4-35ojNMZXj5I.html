Illuminati meter the first wireless
lighting color meter for photography and
filmmaking back our project and help us
create the most versatile tool for
solving exposure and color problems
the Illuminati meter is the first
battery-powered Bluetooth meter that
works with your smart phone and
SmartWatch to measure both color and
brightness it helps you set exposure
like a standard light meter you set any
two of the ISO f-stop and shutter speed
and then the app gives you the third
setting based on the light level but
that's where the similarities to other
meters end Illuminati meters are small
and Wireless so you can place them
anywhere in your scene and take readings
up to 30 feet away
you control the meters and receive
readings on your smartphone imagine the
speed and convenience of taking readings
in your scene without having to leave
your lights or camera a few quick
readings and your lights will be set
exactly where you want them you can
measure the color temperature to get the
correct white balance the app even helps
you select gel filters to get the
correct lighting for any source the
meter also gives you the actual
chromaticity so you can measure and
correct the magenta green shift of
difficult lights like LEDs or
fluorescents you can mount the
Illuminati meters anywhere in your scene
on a tripod have your models wear them
as a pendant or stick into a metal
surface with a built-in rare-earth
magnet you can also use the included
accessories clip to attach to clothing a
backdrop a boom or anywhere else these
meters can go anywhere the smartphone
app connects to multiple Illuminati
meters yeah we've created the first
multi point measurement system you can
use multiple meters to meter the
foreground and background at the same
time to quickly set lighting ratios or
you can use a grid of meters to get the
green screen lighting perfect in a
fraction of the time measure the color
of all sources in a mixed lighting scene
or perfectly recreate set lighting
between sessions you don't even have to
pull your phone out of your pocket or
let go of your camera the out consent
readings right to your SmartWatch or
even trigger readings from your watch
whether you're a seasoned pro are doing
it for love smartphone app lets you work
quickly and with confidence if you want
to try something new the app also has a
built-in gallery with lighting guides
and step-by-step tutorials to help you
set up all kinds of shots another
powerful feature is the continuous
ambient monitoring the meter
continuously measures the ambient
lighting brightness and color and warns
you of any significant changes if you're
shooting outdoors and a cloud floats in
front of the Sun you'll know right away
to adjust your settings or correct your
lights
if the Setting Sun changes color too
much you'll get an alert to rewrite
balance never be surprised by the light
again the Illuminati meter is perfect
for working with flashes small and large
it works in corded and cordless modes in
addition to giving you dead accurate
exposure readings the Illuminati meter
also provides flash to ambient ratio a
feature that helps you keep your flashes
at your target ratio our meter also
measures the color of both your Flash
and the ambient so you can immediately
see if there's a color difference no
more trying to fix bad lighting and post
because we help you get it right before
you shoot there's no other meter that
offers the power and convenience of the
Illuminati after a lot of hard work were
almost ready for production

are done but we still have to get the
plastic molds made and finish the app
development we know how but we need your

that struggle we are prone to losing our
things our keys our wallet or purse and
what this hide-and-seek with those items
ends up costing us the most is time we
