years ago my team and I came to you with
an idea we wanted to let you know your
home was safe without invasive cameras
or complex security systems that's why
we designed point thanks to you
point is now used by thousands of people
across the world today we're launching
the next generation we've learned from
our community and we've seen from
families and neighbors come together
when the unexpected happens that's why
the new point is through home alone
designed for collaboration we think
you'll love it meet Susan Bob and Judy
Anderson and their neighbor
Alex this is their home with point point
consent smoke
point can sense noise
point can sense movement
traditional alarm systems rely on many
individual devices and senseless the
point combines sound motion and
environmental sensors in one device
through machine learning it identifies
what's happening in the environment much
like a brain when point detects
something important a message is sent to
a group of people chosen by you so you
can help each other out when needed
point is now serious business and the
team behind it is grown after more than
a year of hard work with just a few
months away from shipping the new point
will come with a subscription when it
hits retail but we want to offer you
something special
all Kickstarter backers new and old will
get free lifetime service so please
support us and join us on our journey hi
I'm Chris and I'm Derek and this is pal
a lighting solution that will change the
way you see the world on its own Pal is
a powerful light designed for rugged
applications it transforms by pairing
with accessories to deliver illumination
wherever it's needed it lets you get out
in the world in ways that you didn't
before because life doesn't have to be
indoors when the sun goes down as city
dwellers who double as outdoorsmen we
rely on portable lights to enable our
adventures
whether in the woods the urban streets
for our own backyards but traditional
single-use devices weren't working since
they're made for one purpose they end up
sitting in a drawer and it's time to use
them the batteries are dead or rusted
solid
we wanted a reliable companion as
versatile as our lifestyles that
delivered high performance a light that
can truly adapt to any situation that's
our we design power pal delivers 15
hours of continuous light with flood and
spot modes three brightness settings and
an intuitive 4 button interface when
paired with its accessories how becomes
a flashlight a headlamp a bike light a
lantern and a task light and in each of
these categories that performs among the
best in class we worked with an amazing
team of designers and engineers through
countless iterations of the design we
really focused on developing a
mechanical and electrical connection
that would enable a seamless and
delightful user experience and each of
the pals accessories makes it stronger
flashlights handled doubles the battery
life while the other accessories provide
limitless utility in order to bring our
products to the world we need your help
by supporting our campaign you can
ensure that we have the resources to
move into mass manufacturing and be one
of the first to use al we can't wait to
see where it takes you
my she too is a combination of some
fantastic technology it's really
agreeing bringing in the analog watch
made smart and a digital display that
has not been in the market today
both of the SmartWatch guys are in a
digital arena and we are one of the very
few that is trying to make their analog
watch smart
that you can initiate and intasc from
the watch all from your wrist hub that
is so convenient what's easier than
talking to your watch so when the screen
is off you can even care there is a
screen you still have a beautiful watch
design I think when you create a
timeless design is something that you
want to look in your door 10 years from
now and still say it's wonderful look I
really love that I bought it and I still
think it has value to me it is the first
time in history that modern technology
along many dimensions have converged to
a point where all the conditions are
mature enough to make this a reality
we are curious chip and this is pip pip
is a handheld gaming system for a new
generation of makers it brings learning
coding inventing tinkering and making
together all through play play is
powerful when kids play they learn vital
skills with tip you can play games bring
fresh life to old favorites or invent
brand new games code the classics then
play them your way with say a control
pad made from electric paint and gold
bananas pip gets you inventing in the
real world the more you experiment the
more you learn make an app to check on
your plants or make the Knicks pulpit at
the heart of pip is a Raspberry Pi I've
got a bit for an educational perspective
with some incredibly powerful about
creating content and then BL share these
things are cool they're doubly cool a
tent on the school's if you take them
out so I'm super excited about this
there are so many possibilities because
piff is handheld and has its own screen
battery and Wi-Fi connectivity you can
play wherever you like
drag and drop programming is cool for
with pip you learn to code in multiple
languages real coding skills are like
superpowers you learn to control
technology and that's exciting pip
expands and grows with your creativity
master the basics then move on to the
next thing
pip has many functions as you have ideas
we want our community to grow together
make something you're proud of then
share your projects to our ever-growing
online arcade we're so excited to see
what you make never underestimate the
power of tinkering by breaking things
and making things kids learn the vital
skills they need to understand and
influence their worlds all through Play

your support we can impair the tinkerers
of today to become the makers of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
