I once ate a whole box of Girl Scout
cookies
Samoas or they're really good and daddy
takes a nap I'll eat as much candy as I
can
once I was watching a movie and at the
end I realized I ate a whole pint of ice
cream I love hot cheeto I love bacon I
love hot cheeto
once ate 50 pieces of bacon in a single
day and those that's with hot cheetos I
can't stop eating hot cheetos
help me I'm excited to introduce you to
the kitchen save it fun and easy way to
control temptation the kitchen safe is
atomic container that puts you in
control let me show you how it works
first place an item in the container
next rotate the dial to set the timer
and finally press the dial to activate
the alarm once the container is locked
it cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero it's that easy
I came up with the idea of the kitchen
safe will completing my graduate studies
I was looking for something fun and easy
to use and help me with my food cravings
lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all well still being
able to enjoy the occasional snack to
design a product that lives up to the
highest standards I work with Ryan sang
an engineer and classmate I met while
studying at MIT the kitchen safe is a
time lock containment that puts you in
charge
you put an item in the container and set
the timer once the timer is set and the
button is pressed the container locks
and cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero it is a simple concept that
produces powerful results the goal when
designing the kitchen safe is to create
a high quality product that works well
looks good and it's fun to use
the product has a large clear display a
smooth dial sturdy lock and a clean look
that compares to the highest quality
containers available in stores the
design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype we'll refine the design until
we ended with the great working product
the container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set for short as one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to ensure
a strong seal we have tested the kitchen
safe and we're confident that it is a
great product
there you have it the kitchen safe we
have worked hard to develop a great
product and I've lined up a factory for
production and this is where we need
your help by ordering a kitchen safe and
spreading the words to your friends you
can help us turn it was just an idea
into a product that thousands of people
can use and enjoy from all of us at the
kitchen safe we thank you
this is the aikido bag designed for
smarter carry-on travel i'm wilford
founder of aikido travel is a big part
of my life
and something that I love to do there
are some travel frustrations that we
can't control like bad weather and
flight delays but there are other parts
we can make better the our Kido bag is
designed to make your journey more
organized allowing you to fly it with
just your hand luggage in the past I've
used wheeler cases but I found them
awkward outside the airport now I prefer
to travel with just a single bag because
would leave on board
the al-qaeda bag is purpose-built to
give you the freedom to travel without
checking in anything giving you easy
access to the things you need when you
need them
we wanted to create a bag as just as at
home in the boardroom as on the beach a
bag that's made from waterproof
materials but still has a traditional
feel most importantly a bag that's made
to improve your travel experience the
Aikido bag doesn't come with a rain
cover instead we developed a premium
canvas that's lined with waterproof PVC
then we added waterproof zips to seal
the deal because your passport is the
most important thing to look after we've
created a document holder to map
forget about disposable bags for liquids
the transparent wash bag is designed to
be used again and again and is compliant
with airport security rules
not everyone wants to travel with a bag
on their back
that's why we had its side handles and a
messenger strap for when you want to
carry it on your shoulder
the shoulder straps hide away when
you're not using them the large main
compartment is big enough to handle all
the clothes and shoes you'll need on a
trip
the Aikido bag does a great job
protecting our stuff it's padded and
uses a laptop harness that wraps around
any size blacktop by keeping our
valuables close to your body your stuff
is secure and protected
we'd love it if you could support our
Kickstarter project we're really proud
of what we've achieved so far we need
your help to make it happen but please
pledge today

really started out on the streets one
night I was running down a path I'd run
down a thousand times and knew that
there were potholes in front of me I
couldn't see them and I was worried
about the cars that were surrounding me
and that's really when the idea hit me
I needed headlights for my sneakers with
the night runners you really have this
low trajectory that gives you both the
short-term benefit of seeing what's in
front of you but the long-term benefit
of seeing what's ahead they're easy to
turn onto very easy to use they're
lightweight you don't feel a thing
the whole design mantra throughout this
process was the lightest brightest and
longest you just in your zone running by
yourself at night you have those lights
you have yourself you have your music
just get lost
you just go and it just feels like it's
part of your shoe it helps you see and
not fall it's a great idea they are
fantastic so you can see any obstacle
any insulation you can really just stay
in your head you're not worried that
you're gonna trip you can just
experience the run we're in the final
stretch we've completed the design we're
moving into the design for manufacturing
so what Kickstarter we'll be able to do
is get us through tooling get a short
manufacturing run and get these on the
feet of runners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
