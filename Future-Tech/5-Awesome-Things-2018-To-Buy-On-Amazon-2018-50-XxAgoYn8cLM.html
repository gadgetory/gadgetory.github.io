about human gears new utensil line the
go bites
there's the uno duo and trio we made the
go bites from a proprietary nylon
material that's virtually unbreakable
while other utensils may not hold up
there's a reason we back the go bites
with a lifetime warranty the unos
u-shape is ergonomic and we improved the
fork and spoon ends the spoon is deep
enough for soup and designed to scrape
up every last piece of food the fork
tines are long enough for pasta and the
tapered splitter tines easily cut up
softer foods
the duo has the same optimized fork and
spoon ends and adds some neat tricks of
its own you can use the fork and spoon
separately or connect them together for
a tool that's even longer than most
extra-long utensils so it's no sweat to
reach into deep containers without
getting sauce all over your hands the
trio packs a full sized fork spoon and
knife into an ultra-thin case the tools
feature the same optimized ends and
they're accessible separately just grab
the one you want
the trio's knife is sharp enough to cut
chicken and it even has a bottle opener
we think you'll like the toothpick too
so that's the go bites lineup
super-strong ergonomic smart and backed
100% by our lifetime warranty the go
bites uno duo and trio the civilized
tools for eating on the go
only from human gear
hi I'm John and I invented my phone the
grab-and-go booster seat this is a
regular car booster seat and this is my
fold my fold is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than ten times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe how's that possible
well a regular booster seat lifts a
child to be in the position of an adult
my fold does the exact opposite instead
of lifting the child up it holds the
seat belt down it's that simple my fold
is engineered to protect children from
the age of four all the way up to 12 the
patented design takes the seat belt off
the stomach and the neck making it
comfortable safe and easy to use and
we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world now people often ask me
John where did the idea come from so let
me tell you some stories about when my
four kids were little guys come on when
you were little thank you
carpooling was a big part of our lives
we always had boosters for our own kids
but not for the extras that came along
my phone is so small that kids can keep
one with them all the time when my
parents visited we always had to juggle
bulky booster seats from car to car my
fold is so compact you can store one
almost anywhere and my fold is narrow so
you can easily put three in a row even
in the smallest cars do you live in a
big city how often do you jump in a taxi
they never have a booster seat and
that's not safe and hey by the way that
is not a taxi
thank you last time you rented a car you
probably paid an additional $40 to rent
the booster
that's more than my fault costs and ours
isn't covered in another kid's dinner or
worse so I thought if I could make a
booster that's mighty small and mighty
strong when you could take with you
everywhere then children could always be
safe no matter whose car Barry using
super tough plastic polymers an aircraft
grade aluminium top designers engineers
and industry experts together we've
created my fold the most advanced
compact and portable safety seat ever
invented and we can't wait to start
getting my fold into the hands and the
bags of children all over the world
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
