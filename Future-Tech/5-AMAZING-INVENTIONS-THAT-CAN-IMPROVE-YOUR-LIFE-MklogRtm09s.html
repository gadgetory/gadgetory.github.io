need of a projector to get high quality

I'm here to prove that purple mattress
blows memory foam out of the bedroom
only purple passes the durability test
body heat test and the all-new HED test
or human egg drop test for the layman
the best test to determine a mattresses
comfort and support ready Billy no I did
perfect just look at how the purple
smart comfort grid made from a super
country yet ultra supportive material
called hyper elastic polymer cradled
those unfertilized chickies and yeah
they're pretty real now how about that
memory foam
ready Billy great see unlike memory-foam
Purple's unique design cradles your
pressure points and redistributes
support to the rest of your body leaving
your spine properly aligned so no more
back pain no matter your body type
sleeping position or frequency of
nightmare especially the ones starring
your boss so what does this mean the
purples comfortable good boy Billy Jake
that was terrible form more wrists Oh
Billy can you clean this up please yeah
did you know memory foam was developed
in 1966 that's ten years older than VHS
and what's crazier is the technology
hasn't even changed you're getting half
century old technology with all of its
problems so many companies are desperate
to call their mattresses high-tech so
they sandwich a little bit of tech into
the memory foam 90% memory foam is still
98% crap that's a lot of crap you're
sleeping on brother
and sisters you guys purple is the most
durable comfort technology in scientific
history while the compact structure of
memory foam breaks down it falls apart
over time purples proprietary material
keeps shape and stays strong
no more lumpy mattresses and no more
body impressions speaking of impressions
memory foam has a big problem it sleeps
hot and when it's supposed to body heat
it softens and loses support causing you
to sink faster than my hopes and dreams
of senior prom or Blockbuster Video
those guys I feel bad but they made some
mistakes in their hierarchy and they
just deep sleep requires low stimuli
purple is temperature neutral it's grid
design and aerated sidewalls create
serious airflow so your body heat
doesn't affect your sleep and stop
looking for sleep in all the wrong
places
forget memory foam these tests are real
you really can sleep cooler and more
comfortably all on a mattress that will
outlive the family dog and you can
personalize your purple with our many
different comfort levels purple
perfected the science of sound sleep all
you need to do is experience it and you
can for 100 nights with Purple's no
pressure guarantee so go ahead try the
world's best mattress hey purple earful
he's fine he does this a lot this is his
thing oh they just kind of don't talk
and just don't touch either we gave them
a the don't talk don't touch rule purple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
