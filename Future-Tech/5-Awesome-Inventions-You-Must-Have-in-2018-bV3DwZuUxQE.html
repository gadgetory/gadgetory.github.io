connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures

gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures for different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only feel but
also manipulate things in a versatile
way the current smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constrained the interactive areas of our
hands Vela works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad unlike other
devices Valley gives you tracking and
multiple text to action features so you
are not limited to just one action but
if different patterns to assign for
different actions it is super easy to
use and really works for everyone if you
are a developer you can try new ideas
and figure out different customized
applications with our well-designed API
to track the human gestures Vella uses a
special sonar technology that is
nowadays widely used in military cars
and drones it transmits signal pulses
collects the reflective energy from your
finger and then translates it into the
performed action our team has been
focused on sensing techniques for a
couple of years we are passionate about
making to us which is just human needs
by amplifying human capability
turning any surface around here into a
remote control enables many potential
possibilities in our daily lives we have
been seen lots of products in the market
but we have not found any of them
capable to track and to recognize with
high probability with Wella attracts
your finger with the finest precision
and transform it into customized action

hi Kickstarter and young I've been
trying to go paperless for some years
now I've tried it with the iPad and all
kinds of styluses but it never really
worked it was impossible to write and
rest the hand on the screen styluses
were not precise and mostly it was just
an unsatisfying experience until the new
iPad pro and the Apple pencil came out I
was blown away by its responsiveness and
that you could finally rest the hand on
the iPad while writing regrettably the
plastic you feel when writing on the
iPad with the Apple pencil disappointed
me as I really missed the haptic
feedback I then decided to fix this as
there wasn't a good solution in the
market yet after some extensive research
and testing we created this I call it
the paper like it's an iPad pro screen
protector that makes writing on the iPad
with the Apple pencil feel like writing
on paper it's incredible how it
completes the iPad pro experience no
matter if in a meeting or simply
collecting thoughts handwriting with the
Apple Notes app and the paper like is
the most paper like digital experience
ever
you can even rest your hand on the
display without leaving finger marks
sketching with professional sketching
apps and the paper lag is simply said
awesome with the paper like you have
more stroke control and your hand slides
nicely on the iPad surface making the
sketching experience much more rewarding
no more printing no more heavy books or
documents you can now write directly on
a page make notes or highlight on the
iPad while keeping the paper filled
combine the haptic feedback of paper
with today's connected digital tools
apart from also protecting your screen
from scratches the paper lack
drastically reduces glare without at all
interfering with the Apple pencil
functionality forget that called an
alien sensation of heart dropper on
glass the paper-like is an awesome iPad
pro upgrade for paper people like me
check out the rewards I'm sure there's
still a place for you in there and I'm
looking forward to revolutionizing your
iPad pro experience and having you on
board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
