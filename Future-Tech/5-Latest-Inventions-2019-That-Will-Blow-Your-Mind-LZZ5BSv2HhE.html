years through a prolific career in
BattleBots we've created some of the

combat stomp up was designed to be light
strong and efficient just like our
championship robots we've left no stone
unturned in our design and development
process we truly started from scratch
when creating the stomp up it's not just
a pump design that's been converted to a
foot pump every component has been
purpose-built for the demands of the
foot pump the stop pump will be made
in-house here in Marin County California
of the highest quality materials to
exacting standards by our expert crew
