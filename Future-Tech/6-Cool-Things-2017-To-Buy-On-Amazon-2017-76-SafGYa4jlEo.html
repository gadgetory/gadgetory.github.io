your home connected touch-free hi my
name is Brian men and for those of us
who truly enjoy the tactile act of
typing I want to show you a project that
is guaranteed to bring back a bit of fun
and excitement back to your desktop
computing experience you know as a game
developer I spent a lot of time on my
computer typing a lot so I thought I
want more out of this device that I use
every day to connect with everyone
that's important in my life now I've
been fascinated with vintage typewriters
for some time and I gotta say they are
just beautiful on the other hand I've
been completely obsessed with modern
mechanical keyboards mechanical
keyboards feature individual switches
that will give you the kind of tactile
feedback that will make you smile so I
thought if I could somehow merge the two
now that will be fun and beautiful it
all started with an old discarded
keyboard in my garage all the way to
modding a very popular off-the-shelf
gaming keyboard eventually I built an
entirely conceptual keyboard combining
elements from a real typewriter for the
modern mechanical keyboard
finally that prototype resulted in a
brand new hybrid mechanical keyboard
that is both fun to type on and
beautiful to look at so now I present to
you the quirky Ryder
the quirky rider is an 84 key USB
typewriter inspired mechanical keyboard
it's fun to type on and beautiful to
look at it's even got a place to stand
your favorite tablet the return bar is
cosmetic but I plan on enabling
additional functionalities depending
upon the success of our crowdfunding
including Bluetooth and wireless
capabilities so this is where I'm in the
project I need to raise enough funds for
a final iteration and engineering pass
on the production prototype tooling
costs four key caps in the frame and the
final assembly this is where you the
backers come in we can partner together
to see this project come to life

minutes a day working from lost or
misplaced items that's five hours a
