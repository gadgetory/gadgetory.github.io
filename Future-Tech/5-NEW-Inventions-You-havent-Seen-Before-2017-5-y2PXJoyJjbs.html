handbag like yours can you tell me more
about it
a dead phone is the perfect way to ruin
a good day but with a smart handbag
you'll never have to worry about that
again simply drop your phone into the
charging pocket and keep your phone up
and running for as long as you are no
more searching at length for important
items in your bag with this handbag
everything has its place ready for a
quick retrieval when needed whether at
work or traveling or anywhere in between
our London smart handbag keeps your
items organized and safe to protect your
belongings from theft each handbag
unlocks only to your unique fingerprint
or access via the bluetooth app our
smart bag is also equipped with RFID
protected card holders to keep your
credit card and other sensitive
information safe and the Bluetooth
connectivity feature automatically
notifies your phone if your bag leaves
your sight but we know none of these
features matter much if the handbag
isn't beautiful rest assured we spent
several months diligently working not
only on all the amazing smart features
but on the eye-catching luxurious
leather classic style this bag is the
ultimate smart fashion accessory
hi I'm Danny Richardson creator of fyb
London smart handbags from a young age I
was struck by the phrase follow your
bliss which told me that by doing what
made me happy doors would open to me to
enable my success and I carry that
belief into everything I do I grew up in
a small town in southern Utah but I
always had the vision of doing big
things working in business and having
the opportunity to travel as I began the
journey of following my bliss I began
meeting people in places I never would
have thought possible and doors began
opening to me from growing up in a town
of population 200 people
- now globe-trotting the world
frequently visiting cities like London
New York Shanghai my story is a
testament to how life can expand when
one follows their bliss through personal
experience I was able to identify
limitations that hinder women while out
working and traveling and I wanted to
find a solution to these common
inconveniences and anxieties fyb London
provides the perfect combination of
style organization and functionality
that keep women secure and confident and
allow them to focus on what is important
we need your support to fund our first
production run so we can continue this
amazing journey as well as inspiring
others to get out into the world to
follow their place
you need warm water for so many things
in your life like washing your hands
brushing your teeth doing the dishes god
knows what else
in most places in the world getting
perfectly warm water is as simple as
this
but in some other places you probably
wonder what the is this most like we
tried this maybe even this of course
washing your hands and ice-cold water
might be character building some might
even enjoy it we think it's enough but
fear no more replacing the tops is no
longer the only option now you can keep
your money let's bring on other useless
stuff like this we design these tires
foldable mixer for double taps allowing
you to build one more as much as you
want and put one into that virtual mixer
is easy to install and designed to fit
the vast majority of double tap
configurations it can be easily
disassembled and cleaned either manually
or in a dishwasher its adjustable nozzle
allows direct to stream the way you want
it dole taps are not only a pain they
are also wasteful virtual mixer reduces
water consumption by up to 50% I'm sure
you might just use a plastic bottle
let's face it
retro mixture with a plastic bottle it's
like comparing this to that
you
there's something about being in the
natural world
it's like magic it has a certain feeling
to it we all love technology but what
was life like before it it was an era
where people had time to enjoy the
outdoors and soak up Earth's natural
goodness today we live in a world
overflowing with technology that
benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel and even sleep but
what if there was a way to enjoy our
cell phones tablets and televisions
without the harmful effects introducing
Zen cube
the healthiest lab ever inspired by the
purest places on earth
we used our expertise to create and
build something pure that we would be
proud of and bring the benefits of the
outdoors into where we spend the most
time our homes and offices being in a
waterfall or the beach or in the
countryside gives off lots of negative
ions which is what the body needs to
feel great technology does the opposite
gives off lots of positive ions which
make us feel tired stressed and agitated
Himalayan salt is one of the Earth's
riches substances Zen q harnesses list
to bring the benefits of the outdoors to
you it chemically and physically
transforms a room and has unique healing
effects the Zen cube is designed to
admit negative ions which cleans and
deodorizes the air reducing allergies
coughing reduces radiation and
neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology this also reduces
static in the air increases energy
levels improves mood and concentration
increases blood and oxygen supply to the
brain resulting in better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems
it often melt your hot to the touch use
a boat's electricity it can be messy not
to mention they don't always look the
best Zen cube stays cool does not melt
his long-lasting not to mention its
style we wanted it to look stunning they
had to inspire relaxation a sense of Zen
the shape had to be original but had to
be big enough to exude the right amount
of goodness remind a single block of
pink salt crystal all the way from the
Himalayan mountains we encase it no
robust and sleek outer shell we fitted
it with an RGB LED light source to have
the perfect glow with amazing efficiency
the RGB bulb is controlled by an app
turn it on or off change the color or
intensity while setting comfortably on
your couch nature isn't just about the
way it looks but how it feels and smells
we also fitted in an essential oil
compartment so you can smell a pleasant
fragrance every day looks and
functionality weren't enough materials
had to be top-notch as well the plastic
is made of premium polycarbonate and
robust butylene so it'll last an even
the toughest conditions
the salt exposed on each side is made
from the best and pure Himalayan crystal
we wanted everyone to have the ability
to add a personal touch so starting from
day one you can choose the color to
match your room we've put our heart and
soul into bringing you the Zen cube to
be able to produce it and make it
available we need your support together
we can make this happen make this your
next lamp hey guys my wife and I Hey
we're packing for our trip to Savannah
we've got this new fused smart card
that's gonna help us with our purchases
throughout the trip this card can store
information from almost any card in my
wallet debit cards credit cards reward
cards gift cards gym membership anything
with a barcode and EMV chip a magnetic
strip or NFC tech few stores it you just
swipe or take a picture of a card
through your smartphone and it appears
on fuse now you may be wondering about
security the fused card runs on
Bluetooth and connects directly to your
phone if necessary you can delete all
the information on the card with the
push of a button I've got my key I've
got my phone I've got my wallet fuse
allows you to select any card to use
when you need it for instance when you
pay for gas you might rather use debit
than credit you can also add your gas
pay membership info you can even use
multi pay mode to combine the two cards
for a simpler transaction fuse makes it
all easy
I've got like 30 different cards all at
once oh it's got my debit cards credit
cards gift cards membership cards that's
awesome
see if it works all right it worked
fuse has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payment
using its buttons you can create a six
tap password to lock and unlock the card
so if it ends up in the wrong hands they
won't be able to access your information
by pressing the hold button for three
seconds you can freeze the fuse card so
that your preferred payment method
doesn't accidentally change the card
stays locked and active for 10 minutes
unless it's told otherwise
it's cool too because if you forget your
card your phone will send you an alert
before you get too far away plus its
battery lasts an average of 30 days that
means you have about a month before you
have to worry about recharging it but
when you do have to charge it fuses
portable charging cradle has a built-in
battery
allowing you to charge the card on the
go
in Savannah we had the chance to use the
fuse it's pretty awesome that you can
put all this tech into a card as thin as
this
fuse your whole wallet in one card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
