industrial designer for the Sinclairs LX
range of personal computers including

expect from the QL and others today
gives me great pleasure to reveal my
concept designs for the Sinclair Vega
plus handheld concept enjoy
you

just own a nutshell what is this all
about
so what's special about it yeah
everything look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music oh so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
line in or Bluetooth pair it up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place on the back of a window
and you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put on the side
and think it sounds great
you're going to show people it okay so
the other feature we've got that's
inside there as well I think's really
quite neat so if you're in a space like
this you can place two speakers either
side you've got the stereo sound coming
out of it makes it amazing
