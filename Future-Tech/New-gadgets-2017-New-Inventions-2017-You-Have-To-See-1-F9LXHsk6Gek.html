and starting your day well it's a good
cup of coffee now if you've been
anywhere near a coffee shop lately
you've probably heard of cold brew if
you've tried it you know what I'm
talking about
if you haven't you're missing out once
you've tried cold brew it's hard to go
back to the other stuff and if you're
like me you love a well-made cup of
coffee but spending five dollars every
time you visit the coffee shop adds up
quickly so we set out on a mission to
create the perfect cold brew coffee
system for your home it has to be easy
to use without breaking the bank
something that's sleek elegant and fits
beautifully in your kitchen and it had
to be cool we call it the Arctic up in
less than two brews and for all you home
brewers out there thanks to cold brew
staying fresh in the fridge for up to
two weeks you can just make a batch on
Sunday and you're set for at least the
next week not only does the Arctic save
you money it's beautifully designed and
engineered it's crafted from
borosilicate glass so you can see the
progress of your cold brew the stainless
steel micron filter is laser-cut with
tiny holes making it more durable and
finer than typical wire mesh so coarse
or brown stay out of your brew and the
large 50 ounce capacity will fit
comfortably in your fridge
lastly unlike other options there are no
plastic parts or disposable paper
filters so not only are you helping your
wallet and the environment your coffee
is free from any chemicals or unnatural
flavors it's about time someone stirred
up the coffee scene and what we brewed
up certainly fits the bill join the
movement with your very own Arctic cold
brew coffee systems with your help we
can make cold brew coffee accessible in
every home a system that's so simple it
can be used by anyone yet still
versatile enough that you can customize
every aspect from the bean and grind
level to the brew time and the water to
coffee ratio we've spent months
developing the prototypes and working
with manufacturers to bring this product
from our drawing board into your kitchen

page for more details and thanks for

hi my name is Anthony and I'm a founding
partner of mighty Audio mighty was born
from personal frustration with the
current on-the-go music experience
several years ago I ditched music
downloading for music streaming
the only thing missing after I switched
was a seamless and integrative
experience during my workouts
fast-forward to today and every option
of stream music still requires a smart
phone while exercising we all know how
annoying it is to work out with a bulky
smartphone new phones are only getting
bigger more expensive and consuming more
battery life and heaven forbid if you
drop your phone iPod shuffles are still
around but they don't have any streaming
capabilities and let's not forget the
painful syncing process that requires
cords and computers I was shocked that
there was no product out there that
solved my problem so I thought to myself
well if no one else is gonna create this
product then I'm gonna give it a shot my
tea is very easy to set up
stinky music never requires cords and
computers just Bluetooth and your smart
phone after you download the app onto
your phone and turn on the device that
will automatically detect your vices to
pair with via bluetooth once connected
you'll be asked to sign in to your
account after logging in you can sync
all your playlists onto the mighty
device in the same way that you would
sing playlists for offline play on your
phone on here you'll see all your
current playlists as well as how much
memory you're using
after a quick sync your music is on your
mighty and you're ready to go no more
phone required at this point we honestly
think a screen is unnecessary we are
proud to be the first ones to bring a
device like this to market we're ultra
focus on this one problem and we want to
solve it elegantly and simply music is a
part of almost everyone's life and so we
want my tea to be the bridge between
your music and your fitness so if you've
been asking yourself why doesn't this
exist please help us make this product a
reality say goodbye to your smartphones
and iPod shuffles and be mighty
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
