this December island
the rebirth of a deines ancient craft
which has been existent for more than
1,000 years
it is now an elegant and modern lighting
that fits in any living space and can
create the perfect atmosphere for you
Chinese or umbrella this is the
prototype of the Underland
we're three designers based in China
very coincidently we touched this
industry the codes of academic studies
and we soon found is dying because the
lack of modern values and yannis
characters then the first thought that
occurred was was we have to do something
for it
after learning and communicating with
the artisans we decided to redesign the
umbrella by retaining the core parts of
the tradition and adding modern elements
to create new possibilities and meet new
demands we wanted to revitalize this
ancient craft and to discover its
ination values
we managed to adopt to the lamp the
bamboo ribs Auto paper cover straining
and the collapsible umbrella structure
that have been using in traditional
umbrellas the brass as decoration are
added to provide modern aesthetic
restricted hand making to ensure every
lamp is unique and to bring about main
possibilities to the industrial hi guys
this is Stamper island and it's a story
about a participation of an ancient
traditional craft we hope that you guys
will like it because we really need your
help to make this happen if you're
