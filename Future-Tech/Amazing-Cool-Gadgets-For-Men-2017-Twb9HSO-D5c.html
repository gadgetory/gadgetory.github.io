it it's your point of connection to the
people and the world around you it's
also an incredibly powerful computer the
speed and power of our smartphones
rarely holds us back for the small
screens and limited interface often do
that's why we created the Superbook a
simple plug-and-play device that turns
your android smartphone into a beautiful
laptop computer just connect your phone
to the Superbook using a USB cable the
Superbook provides the keyboard
multi-touch trackpad and display in your
smartphone brings the computing power
along with your files and apps and of
course the Superbook can use your
smartphones data Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connectivity the Superbook has over
eight hours of battery life and it even
charges your smartphone it works with
all modern Android devices and its
future proof when you get a new
smartphone it'll still work with your
super book it's like getting a brand new
laptop every time you upgrade starting
at just $99 the Superbook is a fraction
of the cost of a traditional laptop and
is even more convenient hi I'm Andrew
co-founder of enduro miam makers of the
Superbook I was frustrated with having
such a powerful smartphone but with an
interface designed purely for mobile use
our goal the Superbook is to eliminate
the restrictions that hold smartphones
back the software side of the Superbook
is and Romeo an app that makes Android
function like a familiar desktop
operating system you get a mouse cursor
keyboard shortcuts desktop class
browsing and easy file management
everything is intuitive and optimized
for productivity there's no custom
firmware to install and no technical
knowledge needed simply download the app
from the Play Store and connect to your
Superbook you can use one of our native
apps or any of the millions of Android
apps in the Play Store we're also
introducing an open SDK to enable
developers to add in dro miam
optimization to the apps we've already
released a beta version of and Romeo in
the Play Store where it's received
hundreds of thousands of downloads and
extremely positive reviews we've been
developing the Superbook and entro miam
for over a year and we're excited to
finally release them
our prototypes are complete and we're
ready to move into full production we're
looking for your support to help us make
this new kind of computing a reality the
Superbook is just the beginning and
we're excited for you to be a part of it
thanks for your support
time the only thing in life we can
manage but cannot control for the last
10 years I've dedicated my time doing
something that I love I created more
than 300 watches for Swiss brands that
were sold worldwide but after a few
years gaining understanding of how the
industry works some questions started
popping up in my head how can a product
cost over a thousand times its
production costs how can retailers and
distributors take the biggest cut how
could we add personality to the deluxe
watch experience and still make it more
inclusive things cease to make sense as
I realized I had become part of a cycle
that for me was not real so I decided to
drop out of the process it was time to
reconnect I believe that individuality
can break stereotypes I believe that
collaboration can promote innovation I
believe that together we can challenge
industry rules from the inside out we
are not part of the average pack so let
us do something different the designer
and the market one on one we decide how
when and where we do all the work we get
all the benefits no fat no add-ons and
no markups everybody wins together we
have the opportunity to create something
that is missing merging design and
quality into a new selling proposition
the proposal a bold and eccentric
timepiece featuring a totally innovative
way of showing the time it combines
exquisite battalion design with swiss
precision
do as M to a real and affordable
automatic Swiss watch
this is not fiction this is real the
real deal
you
didn't slip it's the most minimalist
wallet f-forget traditional minimalist
wallets it eliminates the wallet
altogether replacing it with a hidden
pocket on your phone or tablet
you
adding a secure method to store your
items to your devices just seemed like
the natural fit the materials were
chosen with comfort and security in mind
and each have their own special quality
store what you need where and when you
need it
hidden slip get one to find out what
true minimalism feels like thanks very
much for watching yeah thank you
it's seven o'clock hurry up John you'll
be miss your trip John please go faster
hi my love I can connect to your cell
phone
I never let your battery's dying hello I
will lock myself immediately always know
my location
John you are a little bit heavier today
we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost battery don't
you just hate it when your phone runs
out of battery our current solution
includes carrying around our power bank
plugs cables and everything else we need
to ensure we don't run out of juice
imagine if there was a smarter way to
save your precious phone battery from
running out all the time something
lightweight and easy to use say hello to
cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sing and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it in
this tuck away slot you're good to go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in the afternoon instead of messy wires
and power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessories I have
everything when we started to think
about the few look at the existing
technology on the map and we quickly
noticed that most of the available
devices were not completely and not he
was a friend together with fear our head
designer we develop the cube we went
through several prototypes to find a
place designed to keep the designer this
elegans compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design with a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink and quick charging
cable you also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
you
control over York
so that you have more time to do more of
what you love the a motor go is foldable
smart and powered by green energy it's
three wheel design means there's no
training or balancing act required
pairing with your phone is a breeze and
allows you to safely navigate between
your playlist maps and even take a
selfie while commuting the first of its
kind smart battery is packed full of
safety protocols and has been engineered
to do more than just power your commute
it's removable serving as a versatile
power source to charge your laptop and a
variety of other devices on the go the
in motor go has been engineered from the
ground up to truly be a personal device
centered around the goal of allowing
commuters to take back control of their
day whatever the reason for using
personal transport the emote or go as
you in mind
we are on the verge of a new era of
innovation
it will really find a way we live
but not to forget the art of Technology
we must strive to extend our curiosity
we need to translate it to love to
and happiness we need to translate it to
music
