could use a little shaking up so we
created the no keypad lock the world's
first smart padlock no key is won
numerous awards and has been recognized
as a game-changing innovation however
some people need an extra level of
protection so we created the no PU lock
incorporating all the cutting-edge
technology used in the original no key
into a practically indestructible
hardened steel body the nokia lock will
protect your bicycle or motorbike in the
toughest environments while also giving
you easy access using only your
smartphone available with an app for iOS
Android and Windows phones the Nokia
lock uses wireless Bluetooth technology
when clicked it automatically looks for
a phone with a compatible key and
unlocks you don't even need to remove
your phone from your pocket or purse
just click and go no more worrying about
lost keys or forgotten combinations
sharing your bike with others is easy
with just a couple taps you can quickly
and securely share your bike with your
friends even better you can revoke
access automatically without needing to
track down keys the nokia lock
incorporates a long-life rechargeable
battery that will last several years
between charges but we wanted the no key
ulong to do even more so we added an
alarm after locking no key pull down the
button to arm the alarm function if
someone tampers with your enoki for more
than three seconds a loud alarm will
shriek for 30 seconds drawing attention
and likely scaring off the intruder the
alarm function resets every time you
open no key the history function in the
app shows you who when and where no key
was used what if your phone dies or is
lost not a problem just key in your
custom quick click code this ensures
that you'll never be left stranded in
the unlikely event that you ignore the
warning in the app and let your battery
die you can always give Nokia a jump
start with an external battery
finally maybe you don't have a
smartphone or prefer to bike without it
we've got you covered just add the
optional key fob to your order and
you'll be able to access no key with or
without your smartphone no key no

we are waiting for you
hi guys I'm Lorenzo hi I'm Carlo
everyday smartphones are becoming
smarter but the battery life remains
critical we'd like to use our phones
without the fear of running out of
battery of course there are solutions
such as power cases and extra batteries
but are either not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price
we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket and you won't have to fight with
timer cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months designed the product
and testing the prototypes and now we
are finally ready to start the
production in charger will be available
with both lightning connector and micro
USB so it's compatible with most of the
devices out there we are really excited
about this and we hope you are too now
we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket as a supporter you will
get your own in charge at a special
price so please consider backing our
project and share it with your friends
thanks for watching we really appreciate
your support thank you meet the edge the
world's best desk for productivity we
work from everywhere on small mobile
devices but our desks still haven't
evolved they're big cluttered and
uncomfortable until now the edge desk
system is your solution to the way we
work today
it's the world's first integrated desk
and chair set that combines the comfort
and focused posture of a kneeling chair
with the versatility of an adjustable
desk surface
it sets up anywhere in less than 10
seconds and folds down to less than 6
inches to allow for easy storage in an
office corner or studio apartment it's
designed to be a single piece right out
of the box and adjusts in five different
ways to fit all body shapes and sizes
sitting at the edge will put you right
into productivity mode improving your
posture and keeping you focused I work
for myself so a lot of the times I'll be
going to coffee shops your co-working
spaces simply because my desk at home is
a little messy and cluttered I can just
sit slouched over it on a regular desk
and with this I feel like my posture is
amazing as an artist this is kind of a
game changer
it's an easel it could be a table and
it's totally portable so I could take it
to part two mark came to us with the
coolest idea and a really tough
challenge we needed to create something
as comfortable as a kneeling chair that
would take up less space than a standard
desk and chair it's very important to
keep the desktop clear so we created
this edge all the way around the desk to
hold all the accessories I'm mark
creator of the edge
I see people working everywhere I go
libraries coffee shops my daughter and
her friends work anywhere they can on
campus because their room is so small
people are uncomfortable and they can't
focus
we knew there had to be a better way
we've tested the best with hundreds of
people to make a comfortable productive
and versatile it's amazing to see
people's response the first time they
sit in it now we want to bring the edge
to your studio dorm room home or office
over the past 25 years our team has been
lucky enough to bring to market hundreds
of your favorite products you've changed
how you're working and now we're
changing how we work if you value
productivity comfort and mobility we
hope you'll join us on the edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
