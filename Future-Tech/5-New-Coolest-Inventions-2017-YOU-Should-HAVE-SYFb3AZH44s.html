user-friendly your MacBook could easily
fall off the table by accident
bin POC bolt makes charging easier with
quick-release that's easier to plug and
detached it provides extra protection
for your Mac books an instant connection
can be made to charge your smartphone
speaker switch music player and more
volt is small and exquisite you can put
it into your pocket and take it anywhere
this is a must for your you might not
been able to hear that but using Ori I
was able to have a call and that's
because Ori is a voice assistant ring
that turns your finger into a smart
phone all through just a touch of the
ear but why that's because the way in
which we're using their devices is
changing changing from a world where we
use screens and touch to one where we
talk now Ori uses a bone conduction and
bone conduction has been used in many
medical great devices we package it in a
way that ascends vibrations through your
finger directly into years so only you
can hear and that allows you to hear and
talk through just your finger hey man
that's music thanks to bone conduction
and the
noise cancelling microphone you can hear
and talk even and loud places so check
this out
or is perfectly private and discreet
using it makes it feel just like a
secret location
Minori
is more than just a neat gadget for
taking and making calls because behind
it is powerful voice artificial
intelligence our friend Siri and Google
assistant it puts them exactly where you
need them think about all the different
things that you can do and one of my
favorite translation all we have to do
is just motion upwards and you say all
right how do I say where are the
burritos in Spanish understand lost
burritos and just like burritos come in
different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
an Oreo ring for every outfit and every
occasion and even better Ori the splash
proof too
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori app because
it helps you filter out everything else
and there's four LED lights that tell
you what kind of messages are coming
through come on let's hit the streets to
see what people think of all really
clear
thousands of people have tried or it and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the origin with the rest of the
world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad he also happens to be
visually impaired already doesn't just
help the visually impaired access
something that had difficulty before
smartphones but in turn they have
inspired us to use our devices in new
natural screen freeways I really want
our venture in darkness to power the
screen free revolution thanks for
watching guys remember to pack us today
because one day with Ori you too can
find your voice it's not noisy it's good
I don't even hear like it really cools
your body now oh that feels amazing
in the right
that's like the worst spot is on your
back usually up in the emergency room
three times bro give me the address
really cool yeah
yeah that's really good that's like the
spot to soubise one that's here for sure
hi I'm Rob and I live in sunny and hot
Houston Texas I've lived all over the
world and mostly warm places such as LA
Okinawa Hawaii Miami and now Houston I
love warm weather but I don't like
feeling uncomfortable that's why I
create a blow the leader in wearable
cooling technology by combining air flow
with aromatherapy blow allows essential
oil users to bring the health benefits
of their diffuser on the go Pete when it
gets ahold of you there's little to no
relief unless you do this this or even
this is it us or does it seem that the
summers are getting and staying hotter
longer while our homes cars and offices
are set up with a CD
what about Homer on the moon fortunately
there is relief meet blow the world's
first micro cooling device that uses the
natural power of essential oil to cool
you off here's how it works
place your essential oil insert inside
add one drop of peppermint oil turn it
on and choose your speed if you want to
wear it on the front cook your shirt
like this for those of you is short here
who want to wear it on the back clip to
your shirt like this
you also have the option of clipping it
on your pants with the back clip we
recommend tucking your shirt into the
front clip to keep the air between your
shirt and scape use it to cool off
during a variety of activities such as
running hiking biking working out and
anything else but we didn't stop there
what also comes out in summer months
mosquitoes use blow as a personal
mosquito repellent by simply adding
lemongrass oil
goodbye chemicals hello relief we've
already secured the best manufacturer
and source the best durable materials
and now we just need your help make our
first production right so please back
our campaign today claim your very own
personal blow and experience the power
of global cooling technology hi
Kickstarter this is Team neck 'some a
year ago we created aqua which was
successfully funded with the amazing
backers on Kickstarter besides receiving
positive feedback we also learned the
need for a wireless listening experience
we believe music can be easily enjoyed
across devices with lossless
salon-quality therefore we created aqua
plus the world's lightest wireless

technology Aquaplus redefines wireless
audio and achieves beyond the original
sound resolution for the best
performance bringing you low noise low
jitter and clock accuracy to hear the
difference optimizing all audio codecs

the sound is very nice and clear and I
used to have similar products but I
wasn't satisfied to repeat poorly oh the
sound I think this will come very handy
because these days like everything is
staying to wireless I'm using iPhone 7
