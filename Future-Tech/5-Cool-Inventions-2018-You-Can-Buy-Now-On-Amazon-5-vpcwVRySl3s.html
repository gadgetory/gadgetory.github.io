what if we could get some of that energy
back pampy is a wearable device that
captures the energy from your motion
throughout the day and turns it into
power for your phone your movement is
your power and and that's about it
that's that's all there is to it wait
cut that's it yeah you move in your plug
this is supposed to be a three minute
video you're killing me
Tages Mike and I met during our
engineering PhDs at Northwestern we all
had the same problem
our phones would die before the end of
the day so many people have this problem
over the past year and a half we've
refined the technology inside NP we have
optimized the power generation
components to the point where you can
still produce significant power while
maintaining a small form factor you
don't need to be an athlete and emotion
will charge it we knew we were on to
something when MP kept winning crowd
favorite prizes at business competitions
everyone kept asking if they could get
one people loved the idea of taking
control over their charging habits it
frees them from the wall and motivates
them to get moving
an P is designed to just fit into your
life its shape matches the curves of
your body and it's easy to slip into
your pocket or pop into your purse if
you live in a city you probably walk
enough to extend your phone's battery
life by 3 hours if you also go on a run
or maybe go cycling you can extend it by
six hours the more you move the more
power you get or you can use AM P to
charge your wearable devices or any
other device that charges via USB but
you don't need to use the power right
away you can store it for however long
you want and use it when your device is
needed most now we know that everyone's
different and some people move in some
pretty creative ways so we've designed
an accessory kit that lets you move just
about any way
we can't wait to hear how you use aunt
bee if you want to know how much power
you're getting out you can check the
companion smartphone app that lets you
track the energy you've generated along
with the calories you've burned with
ampy you're producing green energy
we've got fully functional prototypes
being tested by our pilot customers and
they love them we're continuously
collecting feedback and making
improvements but now we need your
support for the final step to move ampie
towards full-scale manufacturing we're
so excited about what's to come one day
our technology could be integrated
directly into smart watches fitness
trackers and other crazy wearables that
haven't been invented yet so you never
have to wonder it but it all starts now
so join us and help us bring anthe to
the world
it's that better
your home is your sanctuary worth
protecting but it's filled with smart
devices that can actually open you to
intruders over 70% of Internet connected
devices in your home are vulnerable to
attacks and criminals can use them to
invade your privacy and they can steal
your property identity and sense of
security they can even turn your home
into a hub for illegal activity without
you knowing not cool
safeguard your home with Cujo one device
that protects you against hacks viruses
and malware just plug in Cujo to keep
your entire home secure virtually and
physically it learns how the devices in
your home behave using machine learning
when something's wrong it automatically
blocks the threat so you're connected
life is protected and you're free to be
cool Cujo cool get Cujo now
