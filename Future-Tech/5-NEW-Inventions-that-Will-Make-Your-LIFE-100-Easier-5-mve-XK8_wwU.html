over the past few years the smartphone
has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us however smart phones are
entirely dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
the sonic a wireless communication of
ice through labels your smart phone to
send the instant messages voice
recordings image data and GPS locations
even when there is no internet access or
cellular coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the sonnet and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonnet users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data through
either SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
4000 milliamp hour battery that allows
you to use it continuously for up to 24
hours as a built-in USB port so that you
can even charge your phone with it on
the software side is the sonnet app an
intuitive instant messenger that draws
upon the familiar user experience in
addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the stone an app has a panic button
which will activate the SOS mode
broadcasting your distress call in your
current GPS location to any sonnet users
in range we've been developing the
sonnet for over a year now and we're
super excited but as possibilities my
prototypes are now complete and we're
ready to move in a full production
that's where you come in we're looking
for your support to bring this form of
decentralized communication into the
mainstream sana is just the beginning
and we're so grateful for you to be a
part of it thank you for your help
smart home technology is establishing a
presence in our everyday lives from
simple thermostat comfort and energy
efficiency to more elaborate security
and home automation
hmmm but the question is where to begin
with any new technology boom there are
always going to be several competing
devices wouldn't it be great if there is
just one device that had the capability
to work with all devices we'd like you
to meet-- switch it what better way to
get your smart home started than with
something as familiar as an outlet
switch --it is not an ordinary Ola
installed using only the existing wiring
in your home
switch it provides you with an endless
suite of inserts that allows you to
tailor your needs to the technology you
choose this puts you in control now and
in the future
here's how it works we built the switch
it outlet and have the same look and
feel as a regular wall outlet
alone thus widget outlet will work and
operate as if it were a normal outlet
the real magic of the switch it comes
from the instrument thus widget inserts
are the pieces that can bring to life
the smart home application you already
love or have yet to imagine containing
all of the smarts the insert also
connects to your smart homes network
whether it's Wi-Fi z-wave or any others
think of the switch at outlet as the
smartphone and the inserts is apps the
smartphone provides all the resources
common to all apps but doesn't do a lot
on its own
but the millions of apps available on it
enables the smartphone to do all the
things we love what happens when
technology changes what happens when
your home changes you can simply replace
or rearrange inserts in a snap
there are a ton of great smart home
products and the intent of smart home
technology is to make our lives easier
but easier shouldn't mean more clutter
many current devices choose ease of
installation over aesthetics a
nightlight doesn't need to stick out
from your wall the temperature sensor
doesn't need to go on your dresser a
carbon monoxide sensors should be low to
the ground a motion sensor shouldn't be
visible an outlet should be controlled
from within this is why we created
switching
as early adopters of smart home
technology we see the confusion around
multiple platforms and the rapid
evolution products and it's not going
away anytime soon we want to solve that
as we've been dreaming up all of the
switch
insert possibilities we've realized that
we can't and don't want to do it all
alone switchin is a powerful platform
that enables others to get into the
ever-expanding smart home market or
create an easy in wall application for
your existing smart home technology we
want to encourage and enable the
development of instance by others to
make this process as easy as possible
we've created a development kit that
allows anyone to develop insert safely
and easily as part of the kit you can
provide the documentation circuit board
designs and 3d solid models which makes
developing your own answered similar our
goal is to create a suite ecosystem
without limitations switch it has been
our passion project for two years now
and we are ready to introduce a
community we have completed our detailed
designs and have generated our first
prototypes for the outlet and several
inserts we've completed our pre
regulatory design review with an
external group and have implemented all
the updates requested to the product
we're excited to bring switches to
kick-start we're at a point in our
process where we need to raise funds to
help finalize production and gets widget
into your home as soon as possible
there's a useful application for
everyone in this one
space whether you are new and just
getting started or a veteran and looking
to clean up your device clutter switch
it is in the solution one device all
platforms familiar and future capable

wet sleeve experience your full
potential for the last two years we've
worked obsessively with a top European
athletic wear design firm to create the
most convenient way to stay hydrated
while active we haven't just improved
existing products but created something
truly innovative after countless hours
of developing and testing prototypes
with other athletes to refine every
detail of the design we found the
perfect balance of capacity and comfort
the refillable hydration reservoir has a
volume capacity of 12 ounces or 350
milliliters
it's made of fda approved food grade
materials is durable leak proof and
slush resistant wet sleeves zippered
pockets securely holds the reservoir and
