whether or not I get outside is not an
option it's just a matter of when where
and how I've always loved the outdoors
mountain biking skiing trail running
camping you name it but one thing that
is always bugged me is the hassle of
changing in and out of my gear when it's
dirty wet or snowy out there balancing
my shoes or using my car mat or towel
was never a good option
that's how I created the adventure met
it finally makes changing outdoors
simple
the adventure med is a gateway to the
outdoors it allows you to transition to
nature without the hassle the magical
folding design ensures that the dirty
bottom of the mats never touches between
top
enjoying the outdoors just got that much
more enjoyable
the ultra aqua bag is a revolutionary
water barrier that provides a quick and
effective method for protecting property
against floods water heater leaks broken
pipes overflowing toilets and other
liquid emergencies also known as a
sandless sandbag the aqua bag is simple

similar container allow the pads to
absorb the water in less than three
minutes the pad absorbs water to 90%
