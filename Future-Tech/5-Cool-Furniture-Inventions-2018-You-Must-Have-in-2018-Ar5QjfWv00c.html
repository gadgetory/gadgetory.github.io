into any environment we decided to use
beautiful in high quality wood materials
to create the best
achieving the level of precision that we
insisted on was not easy
however utilizing the decades of
experience and generations of wood
crafting tradition that run in the
family helped us achieve exactly the
beauty and precision that we aimed for
the assembly process is made as easy as
possible you simply connect two modules
with two wooden pins that ensure
vertical strength and alignment and then
easily fasten them together using one
connection screw modulus allows for
numerous combinations of different
modules creating all sorts of different
shapes of the surface and with the
introduction of various functional
modules we can really bring the beauty
of a solid wooden desk into the age of
gadgets and in the end it just looks
stunning

questions about modulo ziz is it solid
