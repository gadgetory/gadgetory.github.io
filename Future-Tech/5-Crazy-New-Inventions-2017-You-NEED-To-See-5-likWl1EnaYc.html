exam so for me like I can't wait to
develop it for everybody
I wanna buy several peers have my
bathroom what a good guy about this
product is the simplicity and the
minimalist design and nature of the shoe
Inc in combination with
the flexible display that's in the back
of the shoe so the fusion of both those
make this an intriguing product both for
the fact that it looks cool and stylish
take a great minimal at the same time
they control the technology allows you

designs in ways never before possible
now we're ready to our final production
join us let's rewrite the story of
footwear together
you
movement was formed to defend by attacks
it's very very good good movement but
besides that uh I really like the fact
that I can hit him anywhere without
affecting him too much all the damaging
him too much knowing that he's protected
yeah so it's good to see and knowing
that he can move quite comfortably as
well around so yeah but and holding the
pads is good bit of weight because I can
feel the weight obviously to the arm ah
so you can fill up more force about the
knees anchor yeah who else with the
kicks even with the patches yeah I hope
you feel a little bit a lot of weight
behind me blood weight folks are they
having battle duster well there's a pen
holder I could kick him and punch him
anytime I want without worrying about
his safety even if I hit him and he
doesn't defend at least he's still quite
safe so that goes nice for the time
officer that's really nice on the shins
to really feel something solid yeah on
the knuckles
it's got a good yeah
we are natural builders of projects big
and small and for many of us that means
building with Legos that's why the team
at microd we know have developed ground
breaking modules that help to bring your
ideas to life introducing the itty bitty
city the world's smartest electronic
building blocks designed to upgrade your
projects like never before
motors give your vehicles the ability to
move on their own
LED lights add millions of colors to any
structure sensors help guide your ideas
and perform endless functions and all of
these can be programmed to do whatever
you like with the help of our extensive
wiki library with the magnetic and
stackable M cookie modules we eliminated
the need for soldering messy wiring in
complicated coding our modules can be
programmed using either Arduino or
scratch for those learning to code the
color-coded modules include core
function communication and extension to
execute your commands and all of our
sensors and components have lego style
brackets that are compatible with the
entire microd we know ecosystem start by
powering up the rechargeable and battery
with a micro USB connection then
magnetically stack your M cookie modules
and connect them to buzzers lights
sensors and motors incorporate the
components directly into your build and
watch as the stories in the world's you
create come to life with my crowed we
know you can use any materials to build
your project the possibilities are
endless the itty bitty city set up will
be shipped directly to your door and
