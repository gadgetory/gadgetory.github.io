tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand

direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter

phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2

the salvo 12 contains a system of rods
and baffles to contain the blast of a
shotgun
the rods allow gas to escape into the
baffles while preserving the function of
the wad
after it exits the barrel
the modular system of Rods baffles and
caps allows for the customization of the
salvo 12 depending on your desired
weight and noise reduction specs this
also allows for easy cleaning of the
suppressor
we have seen significant reduction in
decibel levels making the blast of a
shotgun quieter than an unsuppressed 22
rifle
the salvo 12 also significantly improves
the perceived recoil of a shotgun making
shooting a more enjoyable experience for
all the salvo 12 attaches to your
shotgun through a removable choke system
a variety of chokes are available to fit
your specific weapon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
