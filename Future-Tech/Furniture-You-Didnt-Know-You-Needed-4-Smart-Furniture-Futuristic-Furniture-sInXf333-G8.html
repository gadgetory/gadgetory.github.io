hi I'm Jessica banks I'm a scientist
robot assist and founder of rock paper
robot the design and engineering firm
out of Brooklyn we make kinetic
furniture
what's kinetic furniture well it's
basically decor that moves like these
levitating tables or this bouncing one
or our lay this alley chair inspired by
our experience living and working in New
York see this is our office but this is
our office the city inspires us informs
us and acts as a constant reminder of
the diversity of people and problems
that we have to consider when we design
plus the responsibility we feel to not
create more come see what we mean
the Olli chair retracts to two inches so
it's ideal for small spaces
at flat packs for transport and we all
know how important that is it's
lightweight so it's easy to move around
Dahle chair has a built-in lumbar
support so it's super comfy after a long
day on your feet
and because the chair body is made out
of aluminum and the default amber is
made out of teeth it's great for outdoor
environments and because we're fans of
personal expression
oli is customizable the Tambor the
flexible slanted seat part is
interchangeable so you can swap it out
to suit your style and just for our
Kickstarter backers we're offering some
limited edition finishes for your chairs
including an awesome silkscreen by our
talented friend Wiz be no extra space no
play store your ollie chair on the wall
like a work of art and of course the
chair is perfect for home to Ollie can
be your primary seating or accommodate
your space for extra guests so storing
the chair might seem like sleight of
hand manufacturing it doesn't take magic
it takes money that's where you come in
by supporting your Kickstarter campaign
you'll be the first to get your butts on
the ollie chairs but far lower than the
expected retail price and you'll be
supporting a female run manufacturing
company that's wool manufacturing so
thank you from all of us at rock paper
robot support Ollie and let always
support you and don't forget to share
the chair
