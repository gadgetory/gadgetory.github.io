throughout the day Vanguard Industries
Incorporated is an innovative firm based
in Tokyo Japan we are specialists in
concept solution product and user
experience design people around the
world are drinking more and more bottled
water as they don't like the taste of
tap water and worry about the potential
health impact this year alone 480
billion bottles will be consumed in less
than 7% of these get recycled the rest
end up in landfills nature rivers and
eventually the oceans this catastrophic
for our environment and a waste of money
for consumers
at tap water we decided there has to be
a better way so we spent three years
researching existing water filtering
technologies and we came up with tap a
revolutionary water filter system for
the kitchen tap last year we launched
the first generation tap one and since
then we've been working hard to come up
with a completely redesigned tap - it
takes only 15 seconds to install and
after this you can forget about carrying
heavy expensive bottles just turn on
your tap and drink healthy great tasting
water anytime you want tap 2 uses the
latest carbon block technology made of
100% coconut shells which removes over
80 contaminants including chlorine
pesticides and heavy metals while
letting the good minerals remain it
connects with your phone to give you
updates on when the cartridges need to
be changed and how much money you've
saved in the environmental impact and it
is the first by degradable water filter
so once the cartridge is used it can be
composted so no plastic waste ends up in
our nature and oceans during the
development of the first version tap one
we tested over 50 existing filters and
filtering technologies our goal was to
create a much better product we
succeeded and I've already shipped over
5,000 filters and helping people in more
than 20 countries but we knew we could
do much better tap 2 is our next
generation of water filters it's
connected smarter better filtering and
sustainable so we need your help to
achieve our mission with up - to reduce
plastic waste by 1 billion bottles by
2020 thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
