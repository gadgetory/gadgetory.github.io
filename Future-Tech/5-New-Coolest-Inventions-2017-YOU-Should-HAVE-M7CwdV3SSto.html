that many of us have grown to live with
but for me it just was getting so bad
that I had to do something about it and
that's why I created sweat seal a
patented undershirt with a special
shield that a hundred percent prevents
pit stains sweat seal is truly the
ultimate understood and it frees you to
wear whatever you want without ever
having to worry about pit stains again I
just wanted to make something that would
work all day no matter the season and by
simply putting it on would eliminate pit
stains and that is what's what seal is
no matter how hot or how hard you're
working so what's in was specifically
designed to keep you looking your best
at all times
so what's it 100% about the details from
its hybrid tech neck design allowing it
to be worn with any shirt - its patented
underarm shield that absorbs sweat and
naturally turns of the vapor plus it's
custom ultralight soft tex fabric that
naturally pulls your body
we designed every element of sweat seal
around how you naturally warrior clothes
so that it will seamlessly fit with
whatever you wanted to wear it with so
that any moment you can just put one on
and know that you're sealed no longer do
you have to worry about wearing
particular colors to avoid pit stains
and no longer do you ever have to think
twice about whether our deodorant or
antiperspirant will actually keep you
dry with sweat seal we guarantee but by
simply wearing our shirts no matter the
situation you'll stay dry and that's why
we're here on IndieGoGo we have
everything ready to do our first
production run right here in the US and
all we need is your support by backing
this campaign to make that first one a
reality so what feels a lot more than
just an undershirt it's a tool that will
give you guaranteed confidence so that
no matter what you have on if you're
wearing sweats
this is the whole button the world's
smallest phone grip the whole button is
the simplest way to stop dropping your
phone it improves grip so much you'll
magically be able to type tap and swipe
with just one hand
selfie better shop better everything
better
you can even hook your phone on your
laptop get three whole buttons in every
pack to share or save so stop dropping
your phone and make your phone easy to
use one-handed
get the hold button from the lovely
company hi have you ever looked at your
webcam and wondered hmm could someone be
looking at me right now well the answer
is yes there have been many stories
about webcam hacking and agencies such
as gyro pool or the FBI recently issued
recommendations that people should cover
their webcams the usual advice is to
stick a post-it or some tape over your
webcam but it is just plain ugly and
generally unpractical and we wanted to
find a solution that could be simple
affordable stylish and yet efficient we
introduced you to private cam it is a
web cam cover that is easy to install
and use slide it left or right to open
or close and you are set and can be
protected at all time it's super thin
design won't change anything when you
close your laptop privy cam is the most
seamless and affordable way to protect
your image and privacy in a stylish and
discreet manner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
