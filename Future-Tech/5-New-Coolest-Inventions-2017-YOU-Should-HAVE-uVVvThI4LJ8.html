in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family Wynne
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go wind blends seamlessly
into Lily's life allowing her to breathe
easy no matter where life takes her what
we breathe matters we all have
experiences or no loved ones who have
been affected by poor air quality
whether that's from allergens germs
smoke or industrial pollution I founded
wind because I've watched for too many
years as my relatives in beijing
suffered from poor air quality the air
problem goes way beyond China and we
want to enable everyone no matter where
they live or where life takes them to
enjoy a healthy air environment wind is
designed not just to clean the air but
also understand the environment so that
can proactively take care of any
problems and to do both wherever the
user go
the past 18 months we've been working
hard with an amazing team of engineers
scientists and designers to bring win to
life today we're proud to come to you to
get your support so we can launch the
product spread the word and grow the
community thank you when you are using
the new MacBook Pro you probably need to
connect many devices at the same time
such as a power cable HDMI a flash drive
and a hard drive for backup or time
machine you would have to connect all
these devices whenever you set your
MacBook Pro down on the desk at home or
at work what if there was a beautiful
and multifunctional stand for your
MacBook Pro that is able to provide
multiple connections by one simple
connect
introducing pro bass the first USBC
multifunctional monitors stand now you
can connect all your devices including
your HDMI monitor and make a quick
connection with only one cable to your
MacBook Pro whenever you go home or to
work
probies provides one USBC power delivery

things such as pens cables flash drives
memory cards or even an external hard

bass can also be a laptop stand the
metallic silver finish is the perfect
match for your MacBook Pro now you can
get the first USB C monitor stand in the
world back us today with a special early
bird price only on this campaign many of
us need to carry a badge to work every
day you needed to access doors and show
your identity
we tested more than 50 badge holders and
found many problems however you still
need to carry a badge with your wallet
and keys to work
which can be inconvenient
at gobo we decide to make things simple
introducing gobo badge holder in wallet
we over engineered the construction to
make it durable and easy to use the
cover is made by high-strength
polycarbonate to fully protect your card
the enhance structure on the back
increases strength while reducing weight
the manganese steel clip allows you to
carry the holder anywhere you want
the clip is secured by a reinforced
structure to make sure it consists in
any situation the metal spring holds
cards securely even when only one card
is loaded
all engineering processes have been done
with the go-go badge holder and wallet
and we're ready to go into production
now we invite you to join us help us
bring this project to the world thank
you
