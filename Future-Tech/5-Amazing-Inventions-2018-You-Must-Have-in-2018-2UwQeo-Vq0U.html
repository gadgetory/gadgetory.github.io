design product experiences that inspire
and enable our customers to have fun in
nature we believe outdoor experiences
are better when shared in just over two
years we've established the wild warm
brand as one of the fastest-growing
outdoor venture companies in the
industry Wildhorn Outfitters helped to
popularize the full-face snorkel mask
revolution with our original sea view
180 which quickly became the
best-selling mask on amazon now meet the
sea view 180s v2 the next generation of
a wildly popular sea view 180 snorkel
mask the CB 180s v2 represents our
commitment to constantly innovate expand
boundaries and improve our customers
outdoor venture experiences our goal
with the S v2 is to provide the best
snorkeling experience in the world by
improving fit breathability and
visibility we read over 2000 reviews
with customer feedback after over a year
and a half of design and engineering
behind the concept as well as eight
rounds of prototyping and fine-tuning
the SV - is primed and ready to launch
the circling adventure experience to the
next level
traditional snorkel gear is outdated
awkward uncomfortable and often
unsanitary from leaking and fogging to
gagging and soreness or tubes held in
your mouth the experience can distract
from seeing marine life the cv 180s v2
improves and simplify snorkelling on
every level it all starts with our
unique patent-pending flow tech system
which allows for 100% completely natural
breathing through both your mouth and
low-tech has two chambers to allow air
to circulate in and out freely this
airflow design eliminates breathing
constriction and helps to reduce fogging
in the masts the newly enhanced CV 180
full face design provides a much larger
viewing area giving you a completely
immersive underwater viewing experience
our patent-pending tube design creates
more clearance against waves and helps
prevent unwanted airflow stoppage the
smoke will has a dry top seal to help
keep water from entering the tube if any
water does happen to make it into the
mask simply raise your head out of the
water and the integrated mouthpiece
drains automatically the mask is secured
by a dual comfort strap system for a
customized fit that doesn't pinch or
pull on your hair and scalp we've
designed an action camera mount so that
you can easily capture and share your
experience all these features combine to
make the SP two the most unique
user-friendly snorkelling product ever
Wildhorn cv 180 SV tube is set to make a
huge splash in the water adventure
