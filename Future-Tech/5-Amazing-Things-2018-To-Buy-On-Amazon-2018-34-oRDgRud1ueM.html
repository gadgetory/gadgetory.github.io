we've spent the last few years tweaking
and perfecting the guitar trailer so
that every element performs with
precision the weight length and shape
have all been carefully calibrated and
meticulously crafted for maximum recoil
optimum motion and an ergonomic design
and now we have the perfect guitar
trailer great weather always draws me
out of the house I love feeling the
sunshine on my face and playing ball
with my boys without fail I always
notice a tour too when I'm outside
sweeping the garage or driveway to clear
out dirt leaves and debris can be a
daunting task I dread using a heavy and
awkward push broom it seems to make the
task that much more difficult it always
takes several swipes to get an area
clean and they don't work well on all
surfaces smooth or rough the renegade
broom has changed the way I speak the
renegade is a german-engineered sweeping
tool it's not your typical outdoor push
broom it's handcrafted in Germany and is
the highest quality broom you'll ever
own and it comes with the telescopic
handle that adjust your height what
makes the renegade so revolutionary is
its unique bristle shape it's designed
like a rake so you're pulling or side
sweeping instead of pushing and you have
6,000 bristles all working hard to
quickly and efficiently sweep up your
mess at the moment with the renegade
chores are done in half the time
it also works on a variety of surfaces
concrete bricks carpet decking and even
grass to sweep up snow wet leaves dirt
and pests
it makes my chores less of a chore so I
can get back to doing what I left
