never miss another day
too small too big too many to choose
from always necessary to adjust there is
a solution
every grip every grip is a revolutionary
tool its patented retractable steel rods
that just itself in tightly grips
virtually any type of fastener house
Machinery
training equipment
furniture
and many other day-to-day fixings can be
handled with every grip
this is one of the world's most
universal tools replacing over 100
wrenches and other equipment forget
searching for the right wrench and spoil
yourself with the toolbox fitting in
your pocket
no matter if it's rusty or damaged every
grip works with virtually all types of
bolts nuts and hooks
whatever the job is every grip is going
to be your number one assistant
choose your favorite power drill handle
or ratchet and use it in your preferred
working style don't wait order now
that's what you hear people say right
whether your sightseeing or whether
you're at a sports game or maybe it's
baby's first steps have your camera or
your cell phone on you what do you do I
mean it's not like you can turn back
time or can you well believe it or not
you can with something called the rotor
so just after the fountain started I
actually press the record button the
fascinating thing about this piece of
tech is it's actually buffering video
all the time kind of like a short-term
memory but not recording it if you look
right here on the app and what you'll
see is it's recorded 10 seconds before
the fountain started and 10 seconds
after the rotor is a time machine video
camera we call it that way because it
goes back in time so we wanted to create
a technology that makes it possible even
if the moment has passed you are able to
capture it takes a clip that started 10
seconds back in time until 10 seconds
after and then this 20 seconds clip is
automatically transferred to my phone
you try to grab your smart phone you're
too late
ladies and gentlemen let me introduce to
you the next generation of high-capacity
pedal-assist perfection pure cycles
electric utility bike affordable the 40
mile range GPS enables and automatic
front and rear lights an intelligent
bike that anyone can ride
equally at home propelling you on a
family-style mission complete with all
the accoutrements as it is to a
high-volume session at the skate park
pure cycles electric utility is the
electric bike version of Mary Poppins
and but you're young to know what the
hell I'm talking about
Mary Poppins had a bag that was kind of
average per size but had room for
everything in it everything so don't you
dare think for a second that this
machine is under power to mask the
potentially family sized cargo the
battery has increased pedal assist power
with embarrassing the local roadies in
your neighborhood won't be too much of a
problem when you get back home in case
you're tight on space and leave the bike
outside you can remove the battery for a
quick 2 hour charge but with the
wheelbase shorter than almost any cargo
bike on the market this cargo bike fits
neatly in any corner although of course
I'd suggest putting it in the middle of
your living room especially if you're
entertaining</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
