give to the police

door while you're away from home
hello I have got a package for Debbie

life-changing solution with your support
together we can make our product come
alive we can put the view doorbell into
full-scale production and deliver it to
your door soon the view doorbell the
world's smartest video doorbell at your
fingertips today we're excited to be
unboxing the grip gear the movie maker
set it's a portable dolly and we're
gonna dig right in here when I ordered
it two days ago it was supposed to be a
three-day delay and actually Amazon got
it to us a day earlier which I'm rather
excited about so and we roll that over
here
and slide away so we have two rails that
are included with the system plus the
motion control head it looks like a
couple of adapters here and on the
bottom I find goodies gripped your
instructions and these will be the feet
now the instructions show that it can be
used with both your phone and with a
point of view camera like a GoPro but I
don't see any mounting materials for the
GoPro so you'll have to have the
quarter-twenty adapter for your GoPro or
other point of view camera so the
universal mount for their camera simply
slides in like so and a clip assembly if
the feat is easy I did notice that the
angle of the legs wobbled and that is by
design you can tighten and lock the legs
underneath one of the sets of legs has
the joint which is slide and lock
you
and let's move and go full-speed
and when you come to the end it'll
automatically stop and switch directions
the blue segments here the gear
interface are actually short five
centimeter sections and I've noticed
that they can create a tiny gap in
between there's just a little bit of
motion that's possible there so I'm
going to keep an eye on that I don't
know if that's a design feature or if
it's a non-issue or if I need to put in
some Loctite and keep them from moving
if we turn it we can adapt the panorama
adapter here and with a panorama adapter
that gear will spin which will spin your
camera on top of this unit I hope this
unboxing video is useful for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
