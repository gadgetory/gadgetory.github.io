introducing the view doorbell the
world's smartest video doorbell the idea
is simple whenever motion is detected on
your doorstep our invention will notify
your phone and give you a live video
feed or image of your visitor through
the wide angle 180 degree HD lens oh hey
come on in party's just getting started
in the backyard good see here you can
see who's at your door from anywhere
it's not just about convenience but also
protecting your home and family hey what
do you guys think you're doing and you
have a recorded video or snapshot to
give to the police
you can also chat with people at your
door while you're away from home
hello I have got a package for Debbie
I'm not home right now could you leave
it on the porch all right sounds good
nice thing thank you to the view
doorbell is so easy to use it has a
frustration-free setup it's so
user-friendly that everyone can use it
even kids and grandparents hey son we'll
be right there
it can be installed in less than five
minutes and connects directly to your
home Wi-Fi making it possible to receive
the live video feed through the equus
app from wherever you are
unlike home security systems the view
doorbell has no monthly fee and operates
with a rechargeable battery
whether you like entertaining one more
safety for your family are away from
home or just want to see who's on your
doorstep the view doorbell is a
life-changing solution with your support
together we can make our product come
alive we can put the view doorbell into
full-scale production and deliver it to
your door soon the view doorbell the
world's smartest video doorbell at your
fingertips today we're excited to be
unboxing the grip gear the movie maker
set it's a portable dolly and we're
gonna dig right in here when I ordered
it two days ago it was supposed to be a
three-day delay and actually Amazon got
it to us a day earlier which I'm rather
excited about so and we roll that over
here
and slide away so we have two rails that
are included with the system plus the
motion control head it looks like a
couple of adapters here and on the
bottom I find goodies gripped your
instructions and these will be the feet
now the instructions show that it can be
used with both your phone and with a
point of view camera like a GoPro but I
don't see any mounting materials for the
GoPro so you'll have to have the
quarter-twenty adapter for your GoPro or
other point of view camera so the
universal mount for their camera simply
slides in like so and a clip assembly if
the feat is easy I did notice that the
angle of the legs wobbled and that is by
design you can tighten and lock the legs
underneath one of the sets of legs has
the joint which is slide and lock
you
and let's move and go full-speed
and when you come to the end it'll
automatically stop and switch directions
the blue segments here the gear
interface are actually short five
centimeter sections and I've noticed
that they can create a tiny gap in
between there's just a little bit of
motion that's possible there so I'm
going to keep an eye on that I don't
know if that's a design feature or if
it's a non-issue or if I need to put in
some Loctite and keep them from moving
if we turn it we can adapt the panorama
adapter here and with a panorama adapter
that gear will spin which will spin your
camera on top of this unit I hope this
unboxing video is useful for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
