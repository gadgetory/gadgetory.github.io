it doesn't seem like it's gonna be
strong how strong what's it made of so
definitely not breaking doesn't look
like it's even scratched metal a lot
lighter than my clocks that I have on my
bike right now I like that it's really
flexible I would love to be able to use
something that's this life seems great
it's really light
I obviously couldn't cut it so oh yeah
that's great
most cyclists understand that locks are
deterring it's about having enough
durability to slow a thief in for a
racer like me the huge considerations
are weight size are bulkiness and ease
of use we all know how stressful it is
we have our expensive bikes sitting in
public but no one I know is going to
carry a chain or you lock when training
it's just not going to happen so the
challenge was to create a security
solution that's light enough for
training easy to stow away on your bike
or your pocket and still strong enough
to prevent that and that is when I
started working with auto design works
this has been no small design challenge
locks generally fail the weight and
security trade-off most are clunky weak
or both we figured out how to keep the
way to lock under 115 grams while
holding up to the most rigorous theft
attempts it is able to coil up into this
compact portable package we achieve this
with a patent-pending
product design which uses multiple
reinforced bands high tempered steel
it's brilliant everyone I ride with this
seen my auto lock has been bugging me to
get one we're pretty lucky to have a
world-class pro racer like Jacob
collaborating with us the auto lock
concept was born from the needs of
cyclists first but it didn't take our
team long to realize there were many
more uses it's not even out there yet
and the people with our beta prototypes
are already raving it's showing us many
other uses both on and off the bike
it's just so simple and we're excited
about our new cinch luck changes things
introducing the only ebike small and
light enough to carry in a backpack the
SMAW circle s one small circle is more
than just an e-bike it's your new
everyday companion for better easier
transportation
my name is Chang gravel and the
co-founder and chief marketing officer
as fascicle technology so many of us
experience problems in our commutes
cabbages crowded public transportation
and distance Delta farm we committed to
creating the best possible solutions
because of its carbon fiber frame it
weighs a mere 15 point 4 pounds as soon
as you're ready to ride you can be on
your way in seconds with five easy steps
you
monitor your speed distance your lights
your battery all while charging your
smartphone the s-1 is durable and tough
it can easily carry up to 220 pounds
with its sleek modern design the s-1
gets you from A to B in style the small
circle s1 will keep you cruising at a
speed of twelve point four miles per
hour the simple handlebar thumb control
allows the rider to adjust speed the
left thumb break will quickly and simply
stop the s1 when your ride is done
simply use the small circle app to lock
your s1 making it unusable to anyone of
you smash a go team has spent calculus
days on research and development we want
to design an e-bike not only can save
energy
but also can save ty a space so you can
take with you wherever you can whether
you're commuting to work or cruising
through the park the s ones adjustable
seat and handlebars always make for a
comfortable ride the small circle s1 the
most portable and lightweight e bike
available today
yeah
Oh
for
yeah
Oh
we're tagged up a family by company for
the last seven years we've been creating
bike strollers that are loved and
enjoyed all around the globe this is our
latest project we do not hesitate when
we say this is the next step in the
evolution of family bikes see three
years ago we searched for our next
project we turn to a lot of people and
ask them what they would want in a
family life some answers were strange
you make it fly somewhere eye-opening
young babies should be facing their
parents and some were just adorable
we listened and set out to create the
ultimate family bike for two years we
made sketches prototypes study materials
carried out experiments and explored
every aspect the family bike should have
basically we reinvented the family bike
this is a toga 2.0 the most comfortable
safe easy to ride practical and just
all-around coolest family bike you could
possibly imagine
the targa 2 has everything our customers
wanted and much more
safety first Tonga has three wheels so
it's inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options taga can
take one or two kids facing forwards
backwards or facing each other or a
boatload of laps to keep it versatile in
seconds taka two turns from a family
bike into a lockable cargo bike with
extra load space on top we use this
brakes and a Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory line to which
you can attach a variety of fun add-ons
yes there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else no it can't fly yet but it can all
be taken apart to fit in your car trunk
oh and the seats come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least with the price while
creating the Targa - we never forgot the
one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable you can't
fold them so we did because to turn the
family bike trend into a real revolution
we had to make it accessible for
everyone whether you use it for a
weekend trip drop-off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends pataga - is an ideal solution
our company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
Batsy we need your help to make this
piece of family kana reality so backed
agha and help us make the ultimate
family pine taiga</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
