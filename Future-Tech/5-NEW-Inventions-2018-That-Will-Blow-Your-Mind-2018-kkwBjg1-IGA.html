of our identity remember yourself as a
child in the wonderful moments you had
when building up bricks in your very own
world do it again and build your own
electronic devices for the Internet of
Things just as you did with the bricks
the big clown IOT kit for makers will
help you create your own electronic
devices you can build buttons sensors
detectors displays controls and other
smart home devices these will all have
wireless communication and will run for
years without replacing the batteries
everything we do is open-source and easy
to integrate with our outstanding
technical support we'll never be left
behind unleash your creativity and share
what you do with other people we are all
makers and so are you
spirits are meant to be enjoyed in all
sorts of ways neat on the rocks with
fancy ice or crafted into a cocktail
when we set out to design our ideal
spirits glass we quickly realized we
enjoy drinking spirits in all these ways
but most glasses have a specific use and
we don't like all the glasses we have to
use or the valuable cabinet space that
can take up not only that many of the
designs in our home bar were outdated
and did not embrace modern features
including quick measuring and
specifications for an ice ball that's
why we created the duo glass a
hand-blown glass that is complementary
to every drinking experience it has as
much craft and thought put into it as
the spirits we're drinking why is the
duo glass better the double-wall design
improves the installation of your
libation or providing a condensation
free experience eliminating the need for
coasters the borosilicate glass
structure not only handles temperature
changes better than standard glass it is
lighter
resulting in a design that is an
impressive 5.6 ounces in weight the duo
glass is constructed to nestle a
standard ice wall perfectly to silicone
mold during food last week one ounce
pour indicators were cleverly blown into
the mold of the glass enabling
controlled pores for better mixing it's
handcrafted with purpose whether we are
celebrating with our favorite bourbon
unwinding after a long day or
entertaining friends the dual glass is a
glass we look forward to using no matter
what we are drinking in addition to the
duo of glass we wanted to offer some of
the best in class mixers available we
teamed up with Milwaukee based bitters
company bitter cube to offer for the
first time this Kickstarter exclusive
trio of bitters that are complementary
to Bourbons and cocktails alike we
appreciate your support
