hey guys johnathan here and these are
four ways you can extend your philips
hue set up now with philips hue you're
able to add up to 50 bulbs accent lights
controls and fixtures and today I'm
gonna show you how to install them so
for starters I'm going to begin with the
BR 30 white in color ambience and you
can place this anywhere you would
install recessed lighting all you're
gonna need to do is screw it in turn it
on and add it into your system you'll do
this for any bulb accent light accessory
or fixture and then from there you can
have them in the new or existing scenes
now jump it over to the Philips hue go
there's actually no installation
required it's both portable and
rechargeable so you can place it
anywhere you want without wires it's
awesome as you can either control it
directly on the hugo itself or through
your philips hue system now with life
strip plus which is one of my personal
favorites you can shape it bend it cut
it and really get it into places you
normally couldn't get a light
installation is super simple because it
attaches through adhesive and once you
get it attached and turned on you can
see how killer it looks from there we're
gonna hop over to the controls and the
accessories starting with the hue dimmer
switch with this all you need to do is
mount it onto your wall but what's
awesome is the dimmer switch detaches
magnetically and doubles as a wireless
remote control on top of simply
controlling brightness you're also able
to change moods and scenes and it's a
really convenient way to get instant
access without ever having to touch your
app next the hue tap is super compact at
ninja-like which allows you to place it
pretty much anywhere and with this
you're able to trigger between four
different scenes or programmer to the
point we can turn off lights or even
activate light recipes now if the humo
ssin sensor this gives you control over
light through motion with a ton of
flexibility because it runs off
batteries and there's no wires that will
work standalone where you can place it
pretty much anywhere or you can mount
this to a wall what's awesome is because
it attaches magnetically you can really
fine-tune the angle to ensure you're
getting the most accurate motion
tracking now with you beyond this
install is crazy simple the only thing
you're gonna have to do is where you
want to place this but from there just
plug it in turn it on add it to your app
just like forget everything else and you
are good to go so by now you should be a
lighting master so go crazy how fun let
me know what you do with your philips
hue setup
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
