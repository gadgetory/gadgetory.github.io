support the Kickstarter here thank you
we believe we're diamond-in-the-rough
company made up with diamond or rough
people I think a lot of our success can
be attributed to recognizing where our
strengths are and where the strengths of
experts are my name is Peter Lee I'm the
CEO of urban six to six we make the er
be her B stands for urban electric it's
a foldable compact electric vehicle
weighs 35 pounds it goes 20 miles has a
maximum speed of 15 miles per hour
we believe it's a game-changer in urban
mobility urban 6006 decided to focus on
bringing all production back here in the
u.s. we use design principles from the
world of supercars the structural
components are made out of high-strength
aluminum alloys and carbon fiber I came
up with the concept for the Irby about
three years ago when I was looking at
this growing trend worldwide for people
that are taking public transportation to
get into city centers but they needed
some kind of a last model vehicle
solution and I believe Irby is that
solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
