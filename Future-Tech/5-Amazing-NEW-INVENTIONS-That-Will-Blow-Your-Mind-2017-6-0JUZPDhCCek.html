industries the build one is a fully
featured self calibrating 3d printer for
only $99 we believe that 3d printing
should be easy and affordable for
everyone
inventors kids parents teachers and
students and dogs get a build one and
invent make some toys get creative or
fix something designed from the ground
up to be easy to use strong and
affordable fast and accurate with a
modular design and features like auto
bed leveling Wi-Fi and mobile support it
beats printers several times its price
we've designed a high quality printer
with everything you need to get started
our experienced team of design
electronics supply and Kickstarter
veterans guarantee that a quality
product will be delivered join us today
to reserve your but what if the key to a
better VR experience is the sound
introducing Sony cam the first
professional 360 degree video camera
which not only films amazingly through
its nine 4k cameras but it also records
the sound and boundless depths with its
64 built-in microphones giving you an
experience that will almost make you
shiver sony cams team has studied how we
perceive sound in reality using these
studies we came up with the perfect
algorithm for capturing unique sound
fields that can be played on any type of
sound system you will feel like you're
in a room surrounded by 50 speakers even
if you're just listening with your
headphones Sony camps immersive audio
technology goes way beyond that of the
standard 5.1 surround sound it creates
that lifelike experience using its
beamforming microphone array so you
always know where the sound is coming
from from how far away and the frequency
don't worry at Sony cam we haven't
forgotten to insure an embedded noise
reduction feature Sony cam focus is on
recording the sound you need not that of
those unnecessary background noises sony
cam uniquely recreates the exact scene
that was filmed guaranteeing you that
you will always receive the precise
impression of where the video was taken
Sony cam pinpoints the sound position
exactly so wherever you turn your head
when listening your sound system will
refabricate the exact sound for your
location sony cam is easy to use it only
has three buttons the rest is controlled
by an app don't forget that Sony camp
provides you with a real-time audio and
video preview ensuring you are always in
control of what's being filmed
forget all the extra software used
before for stitching Sony cam does it
all for you simply click on playback and
start editing straight
now you're able to feel it like you've
never felt it before
we are thrilled and excited to bring
this new reality to you back us now
Sonne jam our factory is located in
change in the Xavier center of the world
and we have more than 10 years of
experience in electronica family
sonic ham is built with a full metal
body to improve heat dissipation the
lenses are covered with a special
material that prevents damage and
scratches we build dozens of prototypes
in the development process and now the
design has been optimized for optimum
visual and audio capture well this 3d
camera is amazing the 3d sound in the
video is unlike anything I've seen
before we'll make sure that each one of
the sonic can get inspected before
shipping out let's talk about taking the
perfect photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range and a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensors but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
Arsenal fine settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses state of
the art machine learning to help you
take a great photo in any condition
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo stacking with
Arsenal you can do this in seconds
capture all the details in scenes with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques Arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera sensor or lens four times when
you want complete control you can
wirelessly adjust manual settings see a
live preview and trigger the shutter all
from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time lapses
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing light giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your technique with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
stay you can be one of the first to get
Arsenal we've got exclusive rewards for
our early backers and some awesome
stretch goals in the works I'm really
excited about the photos I've been
getting with us I can't wait to share it
with you and see all the amazing photos
of you we all have these iPhone cable
problems confusing USB orientations slow
charging worn-out cables and cable set
won't charge overtime hey low back super
cable is the ultimate solution
hey low back super cable is strong
enough to pull a car and it can bend
over 20,000 times while on average cable
does 2,000 to 3,000 why is that because
super cable is made from advanced
material with unique design Kevlar yes
the stuff that stop bullets it's
stronger than steel strong is good but
faster is stronger super cable charges
three times as fast as a cable without
MFI certification due to our ultimate
material combination which is a complete
trade secret super cable is more
user-friendly due to our unique organ
ama cosine with our patented blind plug
design you can easily plug in and get
rid of the pain of plug failures
ultimately we advocate a complete
worry-free lifestyle and our products
are designed to reflect it
the charging cable is one of our most
creativity use for advances but this is
not profit indictment I hope to use
better technology were curious and
better be starting to many even met
lastly this sexy cable is MFI certified
what is MFI you ask well that's why all
those cables in the Apple stores are so
expensive other products on the market
that come cheap won't have this and may
damage your devices but now only are we
MFI certified and we are not expensive
one more thing we are confident of super
cables quality that it has a lifetime
warranty this will be the last cable you
need to order for your iPhone we are new
at Kickstarter rewards delivery and this
is not our first hi there are you in
front of your webcam right now most
