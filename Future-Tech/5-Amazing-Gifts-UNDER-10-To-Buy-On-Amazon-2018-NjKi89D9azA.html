Thank You G for you ladies what is it
to behold for I bear witness to the hey
Kickstarter we want to introduce you to
butter up the idea started a little
while ago trying to come up with an
easier way to use real dairy butter out
of all the ideas have explored the
simple and effective design came to be
our favorite and would like to share it
with you today a great cooks tip
whenever a recipe calls to use soft
butter is to run through a grater this
got me thinking why not build this into
a knife we have gone through countless
sticks of butter and loaves of bread
testing numerous prototypes to arrive a
design that's easy to use and easy to
clean we quickly discovered that you
don't need anything as sharp or as
aggressive as a normal grater and
experimented with different hole shapes
and designs that were safe and easy to
use and easy to clean when you're done
we've also included a lightly serrated
edge to cut the crusts we've sourced a
cutter a manufacturer who is ready to
start production but the machinery
materials to make cutlery are only
economical in really large quantities
thanks so much for watching and we'd
love you supporting

guys what I'm showing you now is a USB
clock fan from vodka they recently sent
this out to us we tried it out I really
enjoyed it it's adjustable the blades
are soft so you're not gonna hurt
yourself if you accidentally hit them it
was really handy I mean it gives a nice
little breeze so I'm sitting at the
computer playing a game and I won't lose
track of time either because it makes it
very clear what time it is so that's
perfect for me because I often lose
track of time and complain about it
being too hot so I'm really enjoying
this so I will show you what it does
this is the on/off switch and it also
sets the time I'm not gonna set the time
but I will show you how it works so you
can see what it looks like and there it
goes it's actually pretty awesome I like
it it's reasonably priced I don't
remember the price I'll top my head
we'll have a link in the description and
this will be also going into a blog post
so check that out see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
