the MacBook was designed to encapsulate
perfection but when we designed the
macbook charger we really royally
screwed that up I bet you thought that
was a real Apple commercial didn't you
no that was us the way it should be
though Apple's known for creating high
quality products people loved the
MacBook
however the MacBook charger has a whole
whopping one star on Apple comm and we
didn't make that up the reviews speak
for themselves over and over people are
having the same problems
Bob s says the Achilles heel of Apple
well Bob s you'd be right the whole
point of a laptop is to be taken
wherever the heck you want so why isn't
the charger designed the same way it's
bulky clunky hard to store and is
damaged extremely easily and the only
solution is an $80 replacement at the
Apple Store introducing the Sidewinder
by fuse the Sidewinders patent-pending
design eliminates cable fray ensuring
your charger lasts as long as your
laptop its revolving shell allows you to
wind the cables in under six seconds its
adjustable length control allows you to
stay organized whether you're six inches
or 12 feet from an outlet the Apple s
design allows for sleek portability
making the Sidewinder the ultimate
macbook accessory want to watch
something hands-free

phone there's an easy solution stand
