introducing Linc square SDK a portable

Square uses visible light to determine
the exact colors of objects and it uses

molecular makeup included in your Linc
square SDK is a link square spectrometer
a user's guide a set of sample color
chips USB charging cable and spectral
data collection software connect link
Square to a Windows PC using Wi-Fi next
place the link square in contact with
the object of interest then press the
button on the side of the spectrometer
link Square will gather data on how the
object responds to light and transforms
the data into a spectrum graph as a
developer you'll be able to use the
graphs you collect to careen
applications for personal use you can
cream absolutist English between
medications validate the authenticity of
gemstones and much more link square can
be deployed in a wide range of fields
such as research pharmacy education food
and environmental studies

hi folks Aaron Boyd here wanted to do a
quick video showing how the lifeguard
operates there's a latch here on the
upper part in the frame this is the
barrel latch slide that back you can
tilt the barrel up I'm going to just put
a snap cap in there slide the latch back
close the barrel and it will lock closed
there's a similar latch on the bottom on
the handle just slide that forward and
split the two halves go all the way till
it locks open from there it's going to
operate like a normal gun do you just
 the bolt pull the trigger reset the
bolt to the half cocked flush with the

when I go skiing I like to stay
connected and there's only one way to
ensure I don't lose my iPhone on the
mountain I use Highline here's how it
works put your iPhone into the Highline
case attach the leash then attach the
Lightning line now you can use your
iPhone with no worries about loosing it
off the lift or anywhere else to detach
the leash simply lift up on the tap the
slim case is made of impact resistant
polycarbonate and textured for an
improved grip the leash is made with
grated kevlar meaning it's thin but
tough and it stretches so you can easily
access your iPhone letting you take
calls check in with your friends record
video and of course take selfies all
with your iPhone still safely attached
whether you're skiing fishing traveling
rock climbing or just playing with your
kids make sure your phone stays with you
