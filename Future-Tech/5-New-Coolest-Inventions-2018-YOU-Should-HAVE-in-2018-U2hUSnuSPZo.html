you're careful about eating healthy food
and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing the Spree MO personal air
monitor a keychain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iphone and lets you
see what you smell the app gives you
real-time readings on temperature
humidity and air quality based on
precision measurements of volatile
organic compounds a coloring number
scale tells you the quality of the air
around you opt into our community and
share your results and contribute to a
worldwide real-time air quality map
we are constantly surrounded by toxins
in the air around us from common
products like cleaners and dirty clothes
to smog pollution secondhand smoke paint
and pet waste the most obvious results
are the one in 12 people who suffer from
asthma or the more than half of
Americans who live in areas with
unhealthy air quality but in reality
almost everyone is subjected to poor air
quality at some point during the day
spree mow can monitor your air wherever
you are or confirm your suspicions so
you can do something about it
hello my name is dr. TJ Osborn you know
after 23 years in practice one of the
things that I have found out that it
separates sick people from healthy
people is that healthy people know their
numbers if you don't know your blood
pressure you're going to have heart
issues if you don't know the numbers
about what's in the air that you breathe
you're going to have breathing issues
that's why I find that a personal air
monitor is absolutely required for
people to be healthy primo keeps you
informed whether you're at work home
school outside a bar salon restaurant
for the airport spree Moe was founded by
Ray combs and Harold Hahn Ray has helped
bring about products like the Palm Pilot
and Amazon Kindle and is passionate
about improving indoor air quality to
help his son who has asthma Harold has
been studying chemistry for years at New
York University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside
thus primo air monitor lets you be fully
aware of those deep breaths you're
taking in Spri Moe is helping people
breathe easy Wow the air quality here is
so great

like to keep things clean

that your living environment is hygienic

little secret it isn't you're a hand
sanitizer fangirl you gleefully spray

toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates
