elf Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced state
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn elf Emmett will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting Belle
femme it will calm you down and rock you
into a deep sleep
elf Emmett works in synergy with the
natural rhythm of your mind and body
waves when you're active and focused
your brain frequency is high when you're
resting it slows down however because of
our busy lifestyle our brainwaves aren't
always in tune with what we need elf
Emmett uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do learn and concentrate while
feeling stressed improve the quality of
your sleep stay awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day
we designed the technology around a
beautiful light headband that is powered
by your smartphone or tablet
and operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
train wheels
music
but they all have an effect on us we
always adapt to an external frequency
our entire biological system the brain
and the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mister Nikola Tesla once
said that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
it's music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain and the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger
relax or it says hurry up we have work
to do concentrate elf Emmet works
directly on the cerebellum and can
influence the whole system it tells both
the brainwaves and heartbeat to speed up
or slow down
