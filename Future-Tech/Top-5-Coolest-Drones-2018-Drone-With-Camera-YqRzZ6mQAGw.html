first super tough super fast Bluetooth
controlled carbon fiber drone the carbon
flyer is the ultimate tech toy we've
created a revolutionary plane using
actual carbon fiber we've equipped the
carbon flyer with twin high output Moses
a long-range Bluetooth control module
LED running lights and an on-board
camera
carbon fibers ten times stronger than
aluminum it has 100 times the strength
to weight ratio of steel and it is more
than a thousand times stronger than the
toughest phone this prototype right here
impacted the side of buildings and
concrete surfaces over a dozen times at
high school
the carbon flyer can be controlled at
240 feet away using either an Android or
Apple smartphone bluetooth allows for a
two-way communication with the plane
providing real time battery and
connectivity status our interactive app
allows the pilots to control the plane's
airspeed altitude and steering using
only one hand from the very beginning
the carbon flyer was about the carbon
fiber of the world's strongest and
lightest material we are pushing the
boundaries with this nearly unbreakable
flying toy the carbon flyer is perfect
for RC hobbyists flight enthusiasts and
gadget lovers everywhere
Syria is different from anything on the
market right now in the sense that it
solves the problem of how you control
the entire flying movie and image
capture process from a single device
what it does is make flying easier by
bringing automation of those systems
inside of the flyer and allows you to
concentrate on where you want the
vehicle to be the images and video you
want to capture and then to be able to
rapidly share it with your friends when
is Mark Richardson I'm in charge of poly
hoola which is a group of great
engineers and if physi asks building
drones for people to take photographs of
themselves in the environment and just
generally have fun with
I'm a former planetary scientist and I
was involved with NASA in exploration of
the solar system what's really exciting
about Paula Hilo is the opportunity to
bring a lot of those technologies that
we used and getting vehicles to land on
Mars and to orbit around Venus and use
those to make personal fliers easier to
use
seemi is the first networked camera
drone you control seamlessly from a
single mobile app Cimiez 1080p HD camera
is housed inside of simi extending down
from the flyer at takeoff and retracting
when it lands
seemi is a lightweight compact and
portable drone you can take it anywhere
in a traditional camera bag
Cimiez legs detach easily for travel and
storage part replacement and for future
component upgrades
seemi has multiple flight modes
including orbit pano follow and manual
control simi can orbit clockwise or
counter clockwise around you in panel
mode simi will remain in a fixed
position while turning and capturing
amazing panoramic shots for follow mode
shots simi includes an attachable water
and sweat-proof tracking device this
rugged GPS tracker enables you to put
your mobile device down and focus
completely on your tasks in follow mode
simi will adjust to your position as
well as to increases and decreases in
speed so you don't even have to think
about see me
when flying see me manually you can
select where you want the flyer to go
next
just enter your chosen destination and
see me will takeoff and wait there for
you and your aerial video and photos
will be completely stable because Cimiez
in-house camera unit is controlled on a
unique two axis micro gimbal which
automatically adjusts itself at every
turn
so the Ashima car is a flight control
computer at the hata of CB it's a
powerful little computer that takes care
of all the flight control algorithms
figuring out how to keep the vehicle
stable its ability to understand where
up and down is but it's moving strongly
in one direction and it plugs into the
GPS system allowing for a full
navigation solution while in the flight
seemi allows you to live feed videos
straight to your mobile device then you
can instantly upload your videos and
images to any social media platform with
an open api you can share your video and
grow your social following
before simi touches down at this point
we need your help
in order to get final components
selected and purchased to push us
through the process of testing our
flight software and the entire control
system in order to be able to cut the
molds and get the fuselages built and
shipped the advantages of being our
backers early on you get the flyer below
retail price you're involved in the
development process as we're putting the
vehicles together and you get to shape
the flyer that we ultimately all can get
to go and use out in the field we have
probably Hilo thank you for watching the
video and thank you for your support
please feel free to share this with your
friends with your help we can make simi
a reality
what do you think it takes to get
high-quality drone footage like this a
professional drone operator a cameraman
expensive equipment or simply this
introducing the sci-fi level one drone a
drone that lets absolutely anyone
capture footage like never before
sci-fi the level up technology is the
real breakthrough by using six rotors
the drone can fly without tilting making
it simple and intuitive enough for
anyone to fly plus you get professional
stable footage without an exposed gimbal
because level up gets rid of the usual
multi rotor while tilting the interface
can be simplified to fly just swipe
swiping is a superior interface that
allows you to see what you're capturing
while flying
unlike tilting or joystick only
navigation our flying interface can be
downloaded as an app on your smartphone
it's simple accurate and fun because
drone flying is better when it's shared
the level one can post shots and video
real-time to your social network of
choice and with the new geofence
technology you can define the area in
which you want to fly your drone will
stay within your boundaries of choice
allowing everyone from beginners to
experts to practice their piloting
skills with confidence so far sci-fi
work has been building drones for
industrial application but we want to
bring our drone inventions to everyone
Ekans
friendly prices plus we just love robots
so really we put our full technological
expertise into designing a drone for the
consumer that gives professional video
quality and stability but doesn't
require professional knowledge to fly
our drone will come with a 1080p high
quality camera and it will be ready out
of the box for everything from and
videos to action filming to home
inspection so why Kickstarter sci-fi is
made up of a small passionate group of
robot enthusiasts that wants to make
this breakthrough technology available
to everyone and to make the leap from
commercial to consumer drones we need
your support to keep the price low
compared to other available drones
thanks to the sci-fi level ones
capabilities instead of worrying about
the drone itself you can focus on the
experience the sci-fi level one is
simple to fly captures exactly what you
want
and shares it in real-time this is the
first drone for absolutely everyone from
the drone company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
