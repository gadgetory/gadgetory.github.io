of the camera is made with a micro
suction tape which means you can stick
it and stick it and stick it to just
about anything
evo syncs with your phone using an
internal Wi-Fi chip freeing you to step
out from behind the lens and capture
stunning 1080p video from just about any
angle at only six millimeters then Evo

family can follow along but if that's
not fast enough you can go straight to
livestream in HD and if you have more
than one Evo you can even link them
together to score the perfect shot from
every perspective
Evo is only possible because a designer
and an engineer in Italy saw
introducing one up the first truly
portable and ultra compact life
preserver that can be thrown exactly
where it's needed once it hits the water
itself inflates instantly it's just as
safe as a traditional life preserver but

and beach bags so you can always bring
along peace of mind and keep you and
your family safe

allow anyone to throw it precisely even
in strong winds or currents it's a
domestic security device that will
change the concept about water safety
measures one up makes it easier for you
to be part of the solution by making
water safety simple and preventing
accidents because it inflates on water
contact you can use it in two different
ways you can throw it easily and safely
from long distances or you can directly
enter the water with one up and swim to
the rescue zone if necessary when you
purchase one up you'll receive the self
inflating reusable float a carabiner for
added convenience a waterproof cover to
protect it and guarantee its durability

questions technologies allowed us to
overcome every obstacle in boundary
connecting people and ideas from around
the world uniting us and bringing us
closer together
but what about our data think about it
more information about our lives is
being collected than any other time in
history every day we rely on services
that have failed us time and time again
from getting hacked to the misuse and
selling of private information it seems
almost impossible to keep our data safe

idea with your support

thousands of devices that has improved
online security for individuals and
businesses worldwide but filter was just
the beginning

your home from threats online keeps your
physical location hidden so you can
access any part of the internet from
anywhere in the world it's the world's
