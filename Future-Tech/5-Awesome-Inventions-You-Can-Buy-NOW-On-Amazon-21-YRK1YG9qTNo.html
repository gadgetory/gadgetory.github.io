the square the radical new water bottle
that unscrews from both Anton's for easy
cleaning and a square so it won't roll
away thanks to your support we were able
to launch the square and it went on to
win several Design Awards and even
appeared on the cover of Wired magazine
when we were designing the next
generation we were faced with a choice
to reduce the price or add more features
well we decided to do both
introducing the all-new square it has
the same great look and functionality of
the original but at a fraction of the
price for the new square we decide to
use Triton a bpa-free plastic
specifically designed for use with
liquids so it's totally safe and we've
zero plastic aftertaste using Triton
give us the flexibility to simplify the
design of the square reducing the price
by over 70% while increasing the
capacity by 25% as we brainstorm ways to
improve the square we discovered that we
could take advantage with a removable
bottom to add accessories and give the
square additional features we're excited
to introduce our first two square
modules the fast flow water filter and
the infusion chamber the fast flow water
filter allows you to filter water
on-the-go ensuring great tasting water
wherever you are the thick carbon filter
located in the straws of other bottles
can make drinking difficult the square
makes filtering easy just open the
bottom and fill with water letting
gravity do all the work in seconds you
have great tasting clean water
our second module the infusing chamber
turns the square into a portable front
diffuser offering a tasty healthy
alternative to sugary drinks simply
install the infusing chamber drop in a
mixture of your favorite fresh fruits
and enjoy the refreshing taste for days
when preparing fresh fruit isn't an
option we've designed an alternative
working with Stanford University food
scientists and dietitians we developed a
healthy new way to quickly infuse your
water introducing our bloom infusion
pods
there's selection of dried fruits in an
easy to carry prepackaged pod that you
can drop right into your Square it's a
great way to have the fresh taste of
fruit infused water without all the prep
work and cleanup plus each pod lasts for
several refills
reinventing the square wasn't easy we
need your help to fund our first
production run and pay off our tooling
and as a thank you we're offering
rewards up to 50% off retail pricing the
radical new square it's a great-looking
easy to clean water bottle it's a water
filter it's a fruit infuser and a quick
way to infuse your water on the go it's
the water bottle it's the water bottle

yes to me

improvement comes from monitoring what
you're doing professional golfers they
have a number of different systems
collecting their data the normal weekend
golfers they don't the game platform is
a game changer
game is a platform that allows your
round of golf to be captured
automatically captures all of your
statistics it captures your trends it
allows you to start reviewing your game
allows you to start sharing it with your
friends competing and comparing play
around the gong and we will do the rest
with game we set out to create something
that is easy to use that seamless and
that's why we powerful buddy for hire
one of the top designers in the world to
me great products are about creating a
cohesive experience we wanted to really
make the technology as simple as
possible it's invisible it kind of goes
with you as you play the game and you
never think about it we have a
technology here where you tag and go all
you do is tap the handle of your club
against the device and from there we
collect around the table your greens and
regulation your driving distances
scrambling etc we create all of those
statistics without you having to do
anything
this platform I've never seen anything
like it as far as the the ease of use to
access to measure your game very quickly
and very effectively you tag you go your
hit your shot and really the fun begins
at the end of the day when you input
this data into your iPad your iPhone it
amazes me just how great the feedback is
that you get out of it we show where you
took your shot from we show our club
your views and we give you a bird's-eye
view of that shot golf is again such
fine margin just improving slightly on
certain areas can mean one or two shots
around game is the best thing for an
amateur golfer that I've seen and then
your ability to socialize them to share
that with friends to put it on your
Facebook account and to create
challenges it's really bringing golfing
into a 21st century I can compete with
my brother in Ireland I can compete with
colleagues that are in Japan or in Korea
I can now start competing against Graeme
McDowell I can start competing against
the US would you know that's phenomenal
with this platform I'll be able to share
my runs a golf all over the world via
Twitter and Facebook let's be honest
there's nothing quite like that engulfed
today it's about collecting your data
it's about comparing what you did to
others it's about improving in your
realm of God the game platform is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
