electronic devices in seconds imagine
that you could do so without wiring or
soldering imagine that the installation
of such devices is easy and that they
operate from batteries for years
imagine that everything is Wireless
secure and yet open system
imagine that you are a real maker
you don't have to dream anymore and you
can achieve all of this with the big
long IOT kit
hi I'm Pavel and I'm responsible for the
development of the big long IOT kit
every day we work hard to make big clown
the best IO ticket in the galaxy and we
have some really cool features that make
us different
we believe in majority so we have
introduced a system we call it
make using which you don't need to
struggle with soldering or wiring
moreover the future is wireless as big
long as all the products leverage some
gigahertz radio communication the dis
reliable and secure but worried about
covering these devices well that's
really our strong point some devices
operate more than two years from a
standard alkaline batteries with our
outstanding support documentation and
tutorials you are never left behind our
passion for open source is tremendous so
we share everything what we do
so what are you waiting for
hi I'm Ellen and I'm very very excited
to welcome you in our heart variola it
all started two years ago we left our
jobs in a big company to follow our
dream to dream to get people crazy about
making their own electronics we step out
of our comfort zone and we don't regret
today we are helping people with a
desire to make something and we enjoy
every single moment with them it's not a
job it's a mission in hardware you
we just love hardware we our team of
experienced and skilled software and
hardware developers with the passion to
get people crazy about electronics again
we have collected a lot of feedback from
conferences hackathons exhibitions to
improve our product and to bring the
best IO ticket to the market we have
already manufactured and delivered
hundreds of our kids to our first
customers hobbies schools companies
we have a clear vision about the next
steps new products and technological
improvements at the same time we would
like to say thanks to all customers who
have already purchased our products to
join us and become a next big Kong maker
because with your support we can make
the big Kong I will take it better and
more affordable we are all makers
and so are you
a problem with the traditional shell
valve is it's hard to tell where to push
in the valve in order to get the proper
shower temperature and this ways to
water I realized this overlooked problem
water was preparing the bath for my
newborn daughter that is why we start to
live each other living shower can
prepare your shower at a perfect
temperature all you have to do is set up
your desired temperature only live in
app and tap start levitra will
immediately start running to reach the
target temperature and when it's ready
levitra pauses the water flow to see the
water and send you a notification your
shower is ready when you're ready to
take a shower just by pressing a button
you can start shower at your favorite
temperature
with the living shower you can start
today with your favorite music in the
shower you can connect the Livi shower
to the music if you like play impulse or
skip to the next song till you find a
perfect song to start your day while in
shower
people usually don't close the shower
valve during the shower because we don't
want to have it again to find the right
temperature with the Livi shower it's
just the press of button pause and
resume while preserving your favorite
temperature as easy as that what to
adjust the temperature just rotate diode
to the degree you want
it's known that ending the shower in a
cold water in the morning helps you wake
up better and be more productive during
the day the game by just pressing a
button Lovisa will gradually lower the
temperature for you and all you have to
do is just enjoying the ritual establish
our living a provider amount water used
your average temperature and shower time
to help you understand your water usage
our talented team of engineers designers
and business experts have gone through a
five different working prototypes multi
field tests and user tests to find the
most intuitive way to control the shower
temperature testing
now we are very excited to share live
each era with the Kickstarter community
and you have today will help us to
create a better share experience
introducing the mark to by Mycroft
Mycroft will wake you up hey Mycroft
play my morning jams playing your
morning gems or do simple tests like
tell you what time it is
hey Mycroft what time is it 3:15 p.m.
and all the things you would expect from
a voice assistant things like whether
it's 78 degrees and sunny calendar you
have a 10:00 a.m. team meeting and
conversions there are three teaspoons in
a tablespoon a computer remind me to get
my winter clothes out of storage other
voice assistants can use your
conversations
to sell your data and send you ads
Mycroft never sells your data or send
you ads the new screen is great for
features like setting multiple timers

help with that our open source community
is expanding the capability of the mark
to supporting things like Roku and other
devices mycroft private custom open
hello I'm Joshua Montgomery the CEO of
my craft AI in 2015 we launched the
world's first open-source voice
assistant right here on Kickstarter in
July we delivered the mark 1 to backers
in 56 countries and 38 states the
software that we built for the mark 1
now runs anywhere you can download and
run it on the Linux desktop or the
Raspberry Pi this is the first step
towards our larger goal an artificial
intelligence that runs anywhere and
interacts exactly like a person an AI
that understands context can communicate
naturally and hold a complete
conversation with our second Kickstarter
we're looking to expand the community
and work with them to build software
that allows you to voice enable anything
software that's customizable and lets
you rename the assistant and change its
personality and appearance to fit you
the mark 2 uses an advanced microphone
array so it can hear at long distances
even when music is playing we've also
added a screen so you can see things
like calendar entries timers even
security camera feeds to bring the mark
2 to life we need your help we need to
invest in tooling optimize our design
for manufacturing and continue to
improve the software that's why we're
asking for your support we need you to
help us bring an open transparent
privacy minded intelligent personal
assistant provide
you can begin helping us now by going to
voice stop Mycroft I and donating your
voice installing minecraft on your
Raspberry Pi or backing our Kickstarter

Hey what are you doing here wondering
what that was that's pop beater to your
own personal beard for watching movies
on your mobile device and comfort and
privacy people go to the theater not
only to watch the latest movies but for
the experience that comes with it
hot peter allows you to get that theater
experience wherever you are no longer
will you have to deal with your arm
getting sore from holding your phone up
and hop to positions or your phone
hitting your face when you're holding it
up now you can subtly focus on what it
is you're watching up until now there
hasn't been an all-in-one solution that
keeps your body free while giving you
the privacy you deserve the theater
itself is the main part of the product
it's built from a breathable polyester
material that both blocks off outside
light from entering and provides proper
temperature regulation while inside
inside pop theater a transparent plate
is stitched in near the top providing a
place for your device to rest at the
perfect distance from your eyes by the
way
pas theaters compatible with nearly any
size phone or tablet the custom
Bluetooth enabled remote allow that you
control your video while your device is
out of reach an included dual driver of
a wireless speaker delivers high-quality
sound throughout the feeder that could
not be achieved with the device alone
the speaker also functions as a power
bank so you do not have to worry about
running out of battery while watching
your video the theater is held up by
four poles which are also able to fold
for easy storage
we know you're always on the go so we
designed the feeder to collapse down for
easy portability and storage to use pop
feeder first remove the components from
the carrying bag unfold the poles and
slide each one through the sleeves
located on the outside of the theater
and then fasten them in place insert the
flexible plastic board around the inside
walls of the theater for support connect
both the remote
secret to your device via bluetooth and
open the movie or show your going to
watch on your device make sure your
device's screen is in the correct
orientation before placing it under the
larger elastic strap we need a view from
below like the speaker under the smaller
of the two elastic straps attached to
the plate pop theater lets you get the
most out of your device giving you the
complete cinema experience you can be at
the park at home or even at the movies
and still use pop theater as long as you
have a place to lie down there's been
nothing like this previously that solves
every issue in an all-in-one solution hi
my name is Eli and this is my partner
Samir popular all began as a project in
our engineering class after numerous
designs and prototypes we've developed
the perfect solution to the long lived
problem of watching movies and shows on
mobile devices and discomfort we
currently have three manufacturers lined
up to produce each component of pop
theater what we needs your help to
contribute to our campaign so we can get
the funds necessary to mass-produce our
product thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
