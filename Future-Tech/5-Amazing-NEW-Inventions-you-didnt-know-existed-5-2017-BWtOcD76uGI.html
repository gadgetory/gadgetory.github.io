family of affordable yet high-quality
smart weather station and we've done it
our weather stations are simple to
install require almost no maintenance
and automatically connect with your
smart phone your smart home and the
internet they're better than other
stations sold at twice or three times
the price finally you can have useful
weather information from your own
backyard
this is air air measures temperature
atmospheric pressure and relative
humidity and air does something else
special it detects lightning it'll not
only alert you when lightning strikes
but it'll estimate the strength and
distance of the storm up to 25 miles
away and it'll tell you how fast the
storm is approaching just set it outside
in the shade air has a battery that'll
last years and it connects wirelessly to
your smartphone tablet or home network
you don't have to think about it when
there's something you need to know it'll
alert you you can also view your data
anytime through our smart weather app as
well as other popular weather apps like
Weather Underground and this is sky sky
measures sunlight solar radiation
including UV index it also does two
really cool things
it measures rain and wind with no moving
parts unlike old-school tipping buckets
that can break or fill with things other
than rain sky senses each individual
raindrop using an innovative haptic rain
sensor it can alert you the instant it
starts to rain tell you how hard it's
raining and how much it rained yesterday
or last week sky also measures wind
speed and direction using an array of
sonic transducers this sonic anemometer
is better in many ways in traditional
spinning cups and usually only available
in much more expensive systems like air
Skye comes with a long life battery and
is completely wireless also like air
Skye is simple to install just find a
spot with a clear view of the sky
both sky and air work with all the
popular smart home platforms so you can
do all those nifty smart home things
like reminding you to put on sunscreen
when the UV index is high delaying your
sprinklers when it rains optimizing your
air conditioning system to save money
turning on your lights when the Sun Goes
Down or closing your garage door when
the wind kicks up if you've made it this
far congratulations you're a certified
weather geek just like all of us at
weather forum we're on IndieGoGo now
because we want you to be the first to
get your hands on one of our new weather
stations and because we need your
feedback as we finalize production
details on the hardware and in the app
there's still time to make changes ask
us questions what did we do right what
could be better please take a look at
our perks share this page with your
friends weather geek or otherwise we
want these to be the best home weather
stations in the world because we want
you to have better weather day please
help us do that thank you

that's it our patent-pending technology
combines an indoor positioning system
with motion tracking sensors having
Smart Remote to be incredibly accurate
and highly responsive after years of
research and development we are now

for the Smart Remote
but you have seen is just the beginning
we want a smart remote to be the only
reemerge will ever need be the first to
receive it and help us build an amazing
product that you will love using every
