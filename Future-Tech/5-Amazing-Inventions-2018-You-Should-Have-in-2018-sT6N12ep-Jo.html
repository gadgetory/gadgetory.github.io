valve is it's hard to tell where to push
in the valve in order to get the proper
shower temperature and this ways to
water I realized this over two problem
water was preparing the bath for my
newborn daughter that is why we start to
live each other living shower can
prepare your shower at a perfect
temperature all you have to do is set up
your desired temperature on live in app
and tap start levitra will immediately
start running to reach the target
temperature and when it's ready
Lavie shower pauses the water flow to
see the water and send you a
notification your shower is ready when
you're ready to take a shower
just by pressing a button you can start
shower at your favorite temperature
with the living shower you can start
today with your favorite music in the
shower you can connect the Livi shower
to the music if you like play impulse or
skip to the next song until you find a
perfect song to start your day while in
shower
people usually don't close the shower
valve during the shower because we don't
want to have it again to find the right
temperature with the Livi shower this is
just a press of button pause and resume
when preserving your favorite
temperature as easy as that
what adjust the temperature just rotate
diode to the degree you want it's known
that ending the shower in a cold water
in the morning helps you wake up better
and be more productive during the day
again by just pressing a button Lovisa
will gradually lower the temperature for
you and all you have to do is just
enjoying the ritual after every shower
leaving a provider amount water used
your average temperature and shower turn
to help you understand your water usage
our talented team of engineers designers
and business experts have gone through a
five different working prototypes multi
field tests and user tests to find the
most intuitive way to control the shower
temperature and
now we are very excited to share live
each era with the Kickstarter community
and you have today will help us to
create a better share experience
introducing the mark to by Mycroft
Mycroft will wake you up hey Mycroft
play my morning jams playing your
morning gems or do simple tasks like
tell you what time it is
hey Mycroft what time is it 3:15 p.m.
and all the things you would expect from
a voice assistant things like whether
it's 78 degrees and sunny calendar you
have a 10:00 a.m. team meeting and
conversions there are three teaspoons in
a tablespoon a computer remind me to get
my winter clothes out of storage other
voice assistants can use your
conversations to sell your data and send
you ads Mycroft never sells your data or
send you ads the new screen is great for
features like setting multiple timers
hey Mycroft you've sent another timer
for 10 minutes second time I started
nailed it
it can have a friendly face or
customized widgets choose your wakeup
word hey Mycroft
hey Trinity hey you okay Victoria and
your voice hello my name is Trinity

Minecraft it's game time
hey but it doesn't work with this he can
help with that our open source community
is expanding the capability of the mark
to supporting things like Roku and other
devices mycroft private custom open
wondering what that was that's pop
theater it's your own personal beer for
watching movies on your mobile device
and comfort and privacy people go to the
theater not only to watch the latest
movies but for the experience that comes
with it
pop peter allows you to get that theater
experience wherever you are no longer
will you have to deal with your arm
getting sore from holding your phone up
and off musicians or your phone hitting
your face when you holding it up now you
can simply focus on what it is you're
watching up until now there hasn't been
an all-in-one solution that keeps your
body free while giving you the privacy
you deserve the theater itself is the
main part of the product it's built from
a breathable polyester material that
both blocks off outside light from
entering and provides proper temperature
regulation well inside inside pop
theater a transparent blade is stitched
in near the top providing a place for
your device to rest at the perfect
distance from your eyes
by the way pop theater is compatible
with nearly any size phone or tablet the
custom Bluetooth enabled remote allows
you to control your video while your
device is out of reach an included dual
driver of a wireless speaker delivers
high-quality sound throughout the feeder
that could not be achieved with the
device alone the speaker also functions
as a power bank so you do not have to
worry about running out of battery while
watching your video the theater is held
up by four poles which are also able to
fold for easy storage
we know you're always on the go so we
designed the theater to collapse down
for easy portability and storage to use
up feeder first remove the
from the carrying bag unfold the poles
and slide each one through the sleeves
located on the outside of the theater
and then fasten them in place insert the
flexible plastic board around the inside
walls of the theater for support connect
both the remote and speaker to your
device via bluetooth and open the movie
or show your going to watch on your
device make sure your devices screen is
in the correct orientation before
placing it under the larger elastic
strap create a view from below like the
speaker under the smaller of the two
elastic straps attached to the plate pop
theater lets you get the most out of
your device giving you the complete
cinema experience you can be at the park
at home or even at the movies and still
use pop theater as long as you have a
place to lie down there's been nothing
like this previously that solves every
issue in an all-in-one solution hi my
name is Eli and this is my partner Samir
pop figure all began as a project in our
engineering class after numerous designs
and prototypes we've developed the
perfect solution to the long lived
problem of watching movies and shows on
mobile devices and discomfort we
currently have three manufacturers lined
up to produce each component of pop
theater but we need your help to
contribute to our campaign so we can get
the funds necessary to mass produce our
product thank you
imagine that you could build your
electronic devices in seconds
imagine that you could do so without
wiring or soldering imagine that the
installation of such devices is easy and
that they operate from batteries for
years
imagine that everything is Wireless
secure and yet open system
imagine that you are a real maker
you don't have to dream anymore and you
can achieve all of this with the big
long IOT kit
hi I'm Pavel and I'm responsible for the
development of the big long IOT kit
every day we work hard to make big clown
the best IO ticket in the galaxy and we
have some really cool features that make
us different
we believe in modularity so we have
introduced a system we call it
make using courage you don't need to
struggle with soldering or wiring
moreover the future is wireless as big
long as all the products leverage
something has radio communication that
is reliable and secure but what about
hovering these devices well that's
really our strong point some devices
operate more than two years from a
standard alkaline batteries with our
outstanding support documentation and
tutorials you are never left behind our
passion for open source is tremendous so
we share everything what we do
so what are you waiting for
hi I'm Ellen and I'm very very excited
to welcome you in our heart variola it
all started two years ago we left our
jobs in a big company to follow our
dream to dream to get people crazy about
making their own electronics we step out
of our comfort zone and we don't regret
today we are helping people with a
desire to make something and we enjoy
every single moment with them it's not a
job it's a mission in hardware you we
just love hardware we our team of
experienced and skilled software and
hardware developers with the passion to
get people crazy about electronics again
we have collected a lot of feedback from
conferences hackathons exhibitions to
improve our product and to bring the
best IO ticket to the market we have
already manufactured and delivered
hundreds of our kids to our first
customers hobbies schools companies
we have a clear vision about the next
steps new products and technological
improvements at the same time we would
like to say thanks to all customers who
have already purchased our products to
join us and become a next big Kong maker
