becomes horrifying this is Dennis
January 2016 somewhere in the Alps all
alone with a damaged leg in these
situations
even life-safety to be able to
communicate that's why we created go

paired with your smartphone go taki
enables secure private one-to-one and
group voice communication private
one-to-one in group text messaging
activation of an emergency location
beacon your call for help is
automatically and repeatedly broadcast
and relayed over the go taki network so
each go taki including the ones beyond
your range will receive your distress
call navigation real-time tracking route
recording sharing GPS locations to other
go taki users on the offline detailed
topographic maps creating events
location pinging how does it work go
taki connects wirelessly over Bluetooth
low-energy to pair with your smartphone
it works over licensed free standard
radio frequencies to transmit data to
other go taki users miles away via its
own radio signal no cellular network
Wi-Fi or satellite required all data is
end-to-end encrypted and is technology
patent-pending our solution is C e

create mesh network and double the range
of your communication go taki
automatically is securely relays your
message to other go talkies in your area

an output power of one watt it is up to
eighteen point six miles for the EU and
then output power of half a watt is up
to twenty kilometres to ensure that your
message really gets to your friends who
are usually moving we have developed
very smart protocol with intelligent
algorithms which double check network
delivering potential additionally go
taki can act totally autonomously when

receive and store up to 1000 text
messages go taki is powered by a
long-lasting battery with 72 hours of

designed it wraps up all the complexity
device offers in a simple easy to use
and beautiful to look at user experience
it's a pocket-sized device which is both
waterproof and dust resistant it has a
special loop so it can be hung from a
belt a bag or even somewhere on a tree
or other object in order to get a better
signal go taki is perfect for active
outdoor people to connect and feel safe
in places where there used to be
completely isolated travellers being
abroad and wanting to communicate for
free rather than paying exorbitant
roaming charges if or when natural
disaster strikes which can often leave
cell service is crippled and unreliable
for days or weeks as a professional
working tool for certain occupations
where workers need to stay in constant
group communication and remote working
environments free communication is
highly valuable for people who live in
areas with poor network structure where
distances between urban and rural areas
are huge or in areas without any network
structure this is the new Island pulse
prosthetic hand I've been using it for
about four months you can tell the hand
to switch to up to four out of eight
available grip modes with an included
software the software connects
the hand by a bluetooth this is my setup
you can see the list of available modes
I use a co-contraction for changing from
the default grip mode to wrist rotation
that means I send a saml taneous muscle
signal to both electrodes that is very
useful for a lot of things for example
for pouring a drink
I activate my second grip mode by
sending two quick impulses to the
opening electrode my second grip mode is
called precision pinch it moves the
index finger and opposition to the thumb
it's very useful for picking up small
objects like this
my next grip mode is called index point
I activate it by sending three quick
impulses to the opening electrode one
two three it is very useful for example
for typing which I have to do a lot at
work
my fourth grip mode is called thump Park
I activated with an open signal that
lasts more than two seconds the hand
then pucks the four fingers and only
moves the thumb this is very useful for
donning and doffing clothing in summary
I can tell the island to do five
different things each mode is associated
with its own control signal so there is
no cycling through modes any mode can be
activated from any other mode it is the
most advanced processes that I have ever
had and it has drastically improved my
quality of life thank you so much
touch bionics for making this awesome
device a reality thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
