legs make it possible to achieve perfect
linear and curved movements with one
tool what about cameras just snap the
swivel clip and mount your DSLR
mirrorless or action cameras the secure
ball joint allows you to capture from
any angle the foldable legs make it
compact and create a low center of
gravity providing the best balance even

your creativity attaching the flow
modules will transform Mui into a
motorized dolly flow is the most
intuitive and simple way to have an
automated motion just turn it on and
scroll four speed adjustment with flow X

your camera remotely Mui will go fast
enough to follow the action and slow
enough to capture perfect time lapses

that can be mounted to any tripod it is
made from airplane grade aluminum to
ensure the best quality and stability

shoot steep incline shots on low
climbing freely along the track without
a cable or belt we've gathered an
amazing team of product designers and
engineers we iterated and tested it over
and over again finally creating
