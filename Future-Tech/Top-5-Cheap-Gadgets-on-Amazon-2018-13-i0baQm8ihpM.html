becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as power cases and extra batteries
whether you do not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable

to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket and you won't have to fight with
tangle cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months designed the product
and testing the prototypes and now we
are finally ready to start the
production in charger will be available
with both lightning connector and micro
USB so it's compatible with most of the
devices out there we are really excited
about this and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket as a supporter you will
get your own in charge at a special
price so please consider back in our
project and share it with your friends
thanks for watching we really appreciate
your support thank you

hey my name is Robert Morrison and I am
the founder of axis drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
while a drone is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size of it but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
Weaver you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution and we'll deliver
one right to your pocket
you
