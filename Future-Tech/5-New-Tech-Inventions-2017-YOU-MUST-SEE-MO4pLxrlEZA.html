with the latest MacBook Pro Apple has
embraced us b2c technology well that may
be revolutionary it comes at the expense
of all those ports we know and love
we've seen a flood of hubs and adapters
appear on the market sure they helped to
solve our connectivity issues but who
really likes carrying around a bag full
of dongles sometimes you just can't find
that one connection you need according
to a recent survey only 1 in 10 users is
happy with a MacBook Pros USB see design
and since this current port setup looks
here to stay we felt it was time to find
a dongle free fix introducing docker
case a breakthrough solution for macbook
pro that integrates a protective carry
case with a 9 port docking station we
all know what a drag it is to be faced
with so many different dongles dock case
makes it easy by offering full
functionality and superior protection
all in a sleek and simple design
all ports of the docker case are
embedded right into one side of the case
so when you carry it you have all the
connections you need while your macbook
pro stays perfectly packed and protected
say goodbye to frustration and waste the
time
say hello to simplicity and peace of
mind
docker case features the most complete
connectivity options both in number and
type three traditional USB ports provide
high-speed data transfer while a HDMI
video output links your macbook to a
second displayed in no time there's also
a gigabyte Ethernet port for Wired
network connections plus two card reader
slots for SD micro SD and more of course
we've retained the MacBook Pros
state-of-the-art type C port with USB
3.1 so you can enjoy super speed data
transfer a further type C port with
power delivery lets you charge your
machine at top speed with a total of
nine different ports with five
connection types docker case lets you
connect to your hard drive flash drive
monitor printer camera phone and more
all at the same time it's taken us over
a year to get doc a's ready for
production we've pushed the limit to
make it as powerful and user-friendly as
possible from its design and
functionality to its materials and
durability true to its name doc case is
not just a dock but also a case it
features the same Premium microfiber
leather used in car interiors which is
actually stronger and more eco friendly
than genuine leather
we're so excited to be launching da case
and it's available to pre-order now for
just $69 with da case you're getting a
protective case with nine built-in ports
over the price of a single Apple adapter
but don't delay as this offer is only
valid for this campaign registered our
case now and you'll still be enjoying
the convenience of a fully functional
and well protected MacBook Pro da case
ultimate ports and protection for Mac
this is John John is 200 years old
confused and lost 100 years ago he
started building an IOT product but as
you can see he's still working on it are
you doing John there are many makers
developers and hobbyists like John who
waste a lot of time money and energy
building an IOT product going the
traditional way to build such a product
is boring cumbersome and more suffer and
tough so what should people like John do
they should get this toy this this is
bold an IOT platform that lets you
control or monitor things over the
internet with bold it's just a few steps
connected sensors or actuators to bold
write a short code visualize the data or
control your devices over the internet
my bike else means using too much fuel
and I better get it serviced my plants
tell me they're not getting enough water
or sunlight so what bowl basically does
is that it collects and visualizes the
necessary data for monitoring for many
of your sensors you can even control
anything it could be this robot or the
lights in your house wondering how this
works suppose you wanna know how
efficiently you run every day or keep a
track of it on a daily basis you can do
this either by taking note or by
developing a simple monitoring or
control system using ball
Boult is a completely integrated
platform the ball tap identifies a chip
when it's loud on and connects it to the
internet network you've setup it then
establishes a secure connection with
your cloud accounts and notifies you
once it's complete the cloud dashboard
lets you create products in just two
steps all you need to do is configure
your hardware and write a code to either
monitor the data from your sensors or
controller device the platform's open
API is that you add your own tools to
the dashboard and connect it to
different apps or your own unique
project the cloud lets you receive
notifications of critical events run
machine learning algorithms and remotely
updates all your nodes with a single
click the platform is language
independent and lets you work with any
of your favorite coding languages this
helps you save time and avoid
unnecessary complication and the best
path is the most economical IT platform
available volt is applicable in
large-scale industries as well you can
integrate both with your heavy-duty
machines like this this this and this
and ensure they are performing at their
optimum level but simply vault is where
all / is to build an IT product or
project come to an end so as you see the
possibilities are limitless whether you
want to monitor your own performance or
the performance of your products whether
you're a businessman a developer or a
maker bold will save you lot of time and
effort and we want you to be part of
this revolution with bold we're
launching bolt now on a crowdfunding
campaign to support us and help us to
get bold to you as quickly as possible
today we introduce synapse where we've
spent the last year looking at ways to
themelis Li add a device to your
clothing research led us to a material
which works much like velcro but is soft
and perfect for integrating into
garments and that is exactly what we did
synapse where is a device and a line of
clothing that gives you the freedom to
place the device where you like on your
body the artistic patches you see are
made by tokyo-based brand-new new and
can also be worn on our garments so what
is synapse where it is a creative
focused environmental and motion sensor
we also wanted to make a platform that
could be used for your own creative
pursuits this is why we will open source
everything we make whether for live
performances or everyday fun we hope you
will support us and makes in apps we're
a reality thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
