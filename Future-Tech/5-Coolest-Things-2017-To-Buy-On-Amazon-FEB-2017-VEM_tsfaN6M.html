simple it's about overcoming complexity
simple for us means being smarter about
everything we do we wanted to apply that
idea to make us healthier a main
component of being healthy is are you
moving enough so we wanted to ask that
very simple question and answer it with
a simple product so we came up with the
shine the shine is an activity tracker
that's smart
elegant and really strong it's carved
out of a block of solid metal if you
want to be technical about it it's
carved out of aircraft-grade aluminum by
micro laser drills so we built it to
last
because it's made of solid metal
transmitting wirelessly is almost
impossible but to keep things simple we
developed a new type of wireless sync
technology all you have to do is place
the shine on your smartphone the shine
synchronizes with your phone
communicating with the app which is now
available on the iOS App Store
your sink is complete no wires cables or
pairing simple and I think really cool
after studying how people use their
activity trackers we notice the main use
making sure you reach your daily
activity goal with the shine you check
your progress by tapping the surface the
LED lights display how close you are to
achieving your goal answering the
question are you moving enough it
registers your bike pedals swim strokes
and distance travel but a tight ship
with a small team can make something new
and we're inviting people to create
their own apps it's about making things
smarter through simplicity we put a
tremendous amount of time and energy
into making the shine we're looking to
you to prove you'll love it just as much
as we hope you will by funding our
project you're saying that you want it
and it allows us to overcome the
complexities of manufacturing and lets
us focus on simply making oh great
elegant product
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
