programmer any engineer any designer
will tell you that if you want to do
your job productively if you want to do
it well you need at least two monitors
you need one to write the code and you
need another to check the graphical user
interface changes that are made back in
the old days we had desktops to do this
which were great but you needed to add
an extra graphic card to add another
monitor to it but for us luckily laptops
came along soon after and made
everything a lot more convenient laptops
are great they allow you the flexibility
to work from home hotels restaurants and
friends houses so all of a sudden with
laptops everything got a lot easier and
more convenient for everybody but for
people like us who still need more than
one monitor it wasn't that simple you
can't take a monitor into a coffee shop
a it'd be weird be it totally defeats
the purpose of the ease and convenience
of a laptop so what we do we came up
with expand de expand expands your
laptop's display real estate expander is
a secondary monitor for laptops that
slips on and doubles as protection it
runs efficiently through only your USB
port that's right no extra power cables
to deal with it keeps you portable while
greatly increasing your productivity
Expando only needs one USB port for both
video and power it offsets the very low
consumption of the LED panel with
photovoltaic solar panels on its
backside these panels provide a trickle
that will continue charging your laptop
even when it's not in use on the macbook
model expander we'll add two extra USB
ports allowing for charging and other
peripherals while you're using expander
essentially we've given you the best of
both worlds you get all the portability
and convenience of a laptop plus double
the working space so you can truly work
how you want where you want and when you
want now we've been pretty extensive in
our prototype phase we've designed our
board and have a working prototype the
last 18 months have been spent talking
with vendors both hall
abroad to figure out how to bring you a
really special product and we have
everything in line except for one thing
figuring out our mass production
pipeline and that's where you come in we
need funding to pay for expensive
manufacturing tools we need capital to
buy components at a volume discount and
by contributing to our campaign today
you guarantee yourself a lower price and
bypassing any wait lists when the X
Vanda hits the market thank you so much
for partnering with us as we bring you
guys a really special product that we
believe in
you

huh listen I gotta go
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and you hook on a fish and
you're reeling that sucker and you have
all that action throughout that process
but then when you catch the fish you
know you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
all your friends saying look at this cat
so we want to make it so that you can
share the actual action go fish cam
Incorporated was developed by me and my
brother and then we developed it to be a
technology for what we found to be an
underserved market there are camera
technologies or fish finders in the
market but what we found was they're not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that is
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it's it's it's on the line and it
works with your fishing line so it's not
going to obstruct how you fish or your
fishing style and top of that we have
infrared and green lighting around the
camera rim so that you can fish during
nighttime or in darker lighting and then
we also have the depth of it so that you
can go up to 150 meters underwater as
well as the ability to last for four
hours so we really put in a lot of work
into making sure that when they go fish
that they're doing these go fish camp
when we started the project with go fish
we broke down the process into multiple
steps we started initially with a
conceptual design looking at the product
from a both a visual as well as a future
benefit standpoint it was important to
us that we had a premium product that
had feature benefits that just weren't
available on the market currently in
terms of looking forward to production
the three-dimensional CAD and
animal drawings are all completed the
coding for the app is completed at this
point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the world as well it's an
awesome technology that allow you to
capture kind of action-packed footage
and share it with your friends and
family and it definitely bring a lot of
the excitement to the industry
