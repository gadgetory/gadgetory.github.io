should be fun and part of daily life
this easy Stars world first holographic
smartphones so how do we generate glass
free holograms on smartphones when we're
looking at our smartphone a camera will
quickly track our eye movement my
tracking data is sent to our on trip
signal processing unit it's quickly
processed by our eye tracking system
which will lock on to where our eyes are
looking this is very important our eye
tracking system will adjust the hologram
generated based on where your eyes are
looking and you'll immediately see the
holographic effect this is the world's
first holographic smartphone with our
pioneering eye tracking technology an
innovation dedicated to the smartphone
application we call this smart
holographics you'll find four cameras on
our holographic phone a perfect air
interface the dual lens camera on the
back is not just for taking holographic
images but more importantly it's
designed to collect and process
holographic data
so what new user experience will such an
innovative holographic smartphone bring
us no more dizziness or narrow viewing
angles when virtually isn't really a
truly immersive way to watch videos in
3d game playing becomes more fun and
thrilling distance is no longer a
problem lifelike product displays for
online shopping
complex traffic systems become easy to
navigate education is no longer boring
but fun and lively anytime anywhere 3d
scanning and printer well this is just
the beginning
East our will continue to create new
technologies for holographic
applications we make the impossible
possible and create better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
