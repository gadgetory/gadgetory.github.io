Wow
hello people kick star Brian Comiskey
here from advanced or technologies and
I'm excited to reveal our fourth
generation muscle sensor DeMayo where
you might be asking why Kickstarter we
have two reasons first to give back to
you our awesome customers who have
supported us for last four years and
secondly we've partnered with limitless
solutions a non-profit charity and I'll
get more into both of those later for
those of you that aren't familiar with
muscle sensors they basically pick up
the electrical activity of your muscle
amplify it convert it into the form that
you can use with arduino z' computers to
control robots video games amazing stuff
and you can find them more information
about them on our website or through our
tutorials on Instructables comm okay
like I mentioned earlier my OS or fourth
generation muscle sensor our last
generation was a huge success and we
sold over 3,500 and last year alone in
places like sparkfun we knew we still
had room to improve and so we took your
feedback sprinkled in some ideas of our
own and built a mile where our first
generation sensor was pretty bulky and
handmade so we knew we could improve
from there we went through our
second-generation muscle sensor found a
manufacturer and that allowed us to
reduce the size and the cost then with
our third generation sensor we took some
feedback from our customers and we're
able to add a port so you can directly
attach the cables with the first three
generations of the sensor you had these
bulky cables you had to deal with but
with the fourth generation sensor you no
longer need the cables the sensor snaps
directly to your muscle and finally the
part were most excited about we've
designed the malware to be expanded by
shields
we're playing they have for shields
available in the next year a power
shield cable extension shield a proto
shield and mighty meter shield and plan
that add more in the future that I
mentioned the shield's were open source
will also make all the info and files
necessary design and build your own
shields available on our github
repository but we're not done yet
over the course of the Kickstarter
campaign we're going to be releasing two
new tutorials we'll hope that they'll
make you go berserk so be sure to come
back and check for those updates
as I mentioned earlier
with limitless solutions a nonprofit
company that builds and donates 3d
printed myoelectric prosthetics that
uses our sensors to kids around the
world now you might have seen them
recently using our sensors in
collaboration with another very well
known bionics expert thank you for
watching our video and make sure to
check out all our rewards levels with
your support we can give a lot of kids a
helping hand
cars have had powerful computers inside
them for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic be set up to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it into your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
screen now your car and smartphone will
connect wirelessly whenever you drive
most people don't realize just how big
an impact their driving style can have
on fuel efficiency you can save up to
1/3 on gas with only a few adjustments
to how you drive an automatic helps you
do that without being a backseat driver
it learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas like accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and warns you
if something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions
you can even clear the light yourself
and save a trip to the mechanic
because automatic connects to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and that help is on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic the
smart driving assistant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
