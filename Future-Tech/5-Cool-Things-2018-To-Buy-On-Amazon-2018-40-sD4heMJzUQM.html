sound sound is everywhere there is no
accurate count for how many sounds than
an average person hears in a given day a
Dorado audio we understand that sound is
what inspires us motivates us drives us
and connects us introducing the Apollo 7
the world's most compact true wireless
earphone we just wanted to make
something that just made sense we wanted
to create an earphone a completely
wireless earphone that delivered
incredible sound the Apollo 7 earphones
come in a sleek aluminum case with a
built-in lithium battery that makes it
easy and convenient to store as well as
charge on the go see you'll never run
out of power no matter where your day
takes you these earphones are ready to
go they're coated with a nano
waterproofing technology that makes them
perfect for any situation as an athlete
I absolutely love the Polo 7 not only
are they waterproof they're Wireless
true Wireless meaning no wires involved
at all and they're very small and
compact and they fit in the ear
incredibly comfortably and I've done
products for monster and beats and the
Apollo 7 is truly innovative
well-thought-out design and excellent
execution it's a lot of times you get a
wireless Bluetooth headset and you still
haven't an outside box and this wires
all over the place I can't stand wires
I've gone through like I said several
pairs of headphones that are just like
garbage the Bluetooth like it just
doesn't doesn't sound good at all you're
sacrificing a lot usually when you go to
a small earbud and these just sound
awesome it sounded really really good
that's my favorite part about them well
it's brilliant
you have the carrying case as wireless
charging essentially where you dropped
the earpieces in and then there's a
battery in the case you don't have to
find an outlet to plug it in and charge
it so this is an all-day solution we
wanted to keep the Apollo 7 easy and
intuitive
with its single button features you'll
be able to take a call
skip tracks control volume activate
Google now or even talk to Siri we also
built an omnidirectional microphone for
the Apollo 7 because we know how
important it is to have a crisp
hands-free solution for taking calls on
the go support us now and be one of the
first to experience true wireless audio
the way it should be Apollo 7 by erato
