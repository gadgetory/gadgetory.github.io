geo-tracking shortly after I met my wife
Rakhi she lost her dog Carlton who
disappeared under a fence chasing after
a squirrel I camped out for two days
searching for her dog in the woods
by the second day I had my legs pretty
blighted up from taking on the forest of
trees and cactuses but unfortunately we
never found him since that day I've
wanted to find a way to prevent pets
from ever getting lost again today
though we have two cats Iggy and
Priscilla and we're not gonna let them
loses one of my three goals for tracking
us is to prevent 1 million pets from
ever getting lost again we wanted
something to make it easier to find our

for something that's not only cool but
fashionable our pets have been known to
accessorize around here there are so

just know where your pet is but for them
to always know you're nearby we're in a
