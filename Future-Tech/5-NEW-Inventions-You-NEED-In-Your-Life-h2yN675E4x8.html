chiropractor posture doctor online
educator with a fellowship in the
physics of posture now you might think
you've got your neck covered by regular
exercises you do in the gym but that's
simply not true most of the exercises we
do in the gym fail to address the core
stabilizing neck muscles the ones that
matter most
that's where fit neck comes in fits neck

innovative device designed to strengthen
your neck stabilizer muscles and correct
your posture the exercise can be done

our modern lifestyle we are constantly
looking at phones and computers this is
creating extreme pressure on your neck

research and was developed in
collaboration with professional sports
teams and chiropractors in the United
States and Canada I don't like spending
a lot of time in the gym I like spending
time on my bike but there's some
strengths that are just critical and
your neck is one of them that's why I
like fit neck it's easy it's simple it's

resistance and within two minutes you're

muscles with fit neck your body
automatically pulls your head back in to
correct posture did you know that
anxiety fatigue and even allergies may
all be connected to our posture let me
explain
our head is heavy roughly ten pounds and
if we carry it out in front of us
instead of over top of our shoulders
where it belongs the weight increases
dramatically the nerves are put under
great stress and tension in this
condition and because the central
nervous system runs your entire body
they begin to imagine that a stretch
spinal cord is a significant health risk
over time when we begin to use effective
neck exercise designed to realign our
head back over our shoulders where it
belongs
we look more attractive we feel way more
confident and aged better because our
health improve dramatically so please
support us with our projects and help us
straighten up the world we live in
thanks for watching
