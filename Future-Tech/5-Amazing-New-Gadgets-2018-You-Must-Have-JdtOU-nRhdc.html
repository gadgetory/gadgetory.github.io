much Sun can be harmful UV rays damage
your skin and eyes and lead to skin
cancer
this is preventable as experts in
analyzing weather data we found that
people care about the immediate
environment around them information the
current weather apps cannot provide what
if everyone could have a personalized
weather station that's why we decided to
create one so we set a goal develop the
idea assembled a great team conducted
breakthrough research talk to a lot of
experts and made several prototypes we
collaborated with the best engineers and
have begun manufacturing to provide a
one-of-a-kind device this is Q temp a
remarkably precise weather station built
to fit on your keychain it tells you the
temperature and UV index right where you
are based on the measured UV
environmental situation and your skin
type Q temp alerts when you need sun
protection q temp tells how much time
you have before getting sunburned based
on your skin type it helps create a
comfortable space it notifies you to be
safer whenever you want to go to the
beach explore nature or enjoy a day in
the snow say hello to the Sun again
start your day off smart learn about the
weather wherever you are and wherever
you're headed get ready for your
productive day with real-time
environmental updates either inside or
outside even track and share weather
info to personalize and customize the
experience enjoy your day safely when
you are together or explore alone know
the environment and protect yourself
two seconds is the most a driver can
safely glance away from the road while
operating a motor vehicle the inventors
of male tech were fast to recognize that
the center of your car stereo is where
you can safely glance at navigation
directions while driving and in 2010
mount tech introduced the very first CD
sought smartphone mount to the global
marketplace since then
mount tech has delivered well over
100,000 units of its classic and group
grip to drivers around the world with
5,000 Amazon reviews we have listened to
what drivers want to produce the
ultimate mobile device mount for your
car to celebrate our fifth year
anniversary we are proud to unveil the
all-new mounted grip plus the
anniversary edition now tech grip plus
is the first upgrade to the highly
praised and Griff grip in over five
years it's secured almost any handheld
mobile device your front loading CD slot
where your vehicle manufacturer intended
you to safely interact with your car
stereo what makes the mount a grip plus
truly unique is its ability to hold a
device as narrow as a first generation
iPhone all the way up to the width of a
full-size iPad no other grip mounts on
the market can accommodate this range in
such a compact body take a look at what
it can hold GoPro Hero camera XM Sirius
Radio Garmin Nuvi GPS TomTom GPS iPhone
success in a lifeproof case iPhone 6s
plus in an Otterbox case iPad Mini in an
Otterbox case a full-size iPad and
almost any handheld device in between

the patented and groove blade into a
front-loading CD slot and turn the
tightening knob clockwise we've
perfected the CD blade to provide
maximum hold without activating the
internal mechanics of your CD player
thank you so much from all of us at
mount tech California USA we don't like
leather wallets do we care so we don't
matter so we made this
the micro wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
as we grew frustrated with traditional
leather wallets only lasting several
months instead of several years as
designers we knew we could do better we
set ourselves a pretty challenging brief
to design a minimalist wallet that was
not only aesthetically beautiful but
functionally superior to anything else
on the market our years of industry
experience enabled us to quickly
evaluate our designs taking them from
initial concept through to sourcing
manufacturing partners from mass
production our use of PVD coating would
rival most high-end watches this
provides an extremely high scratch
resistant finish we had concerns about
our product strengths so we decided to
test it ready
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes
holding all your cards securely you no
longer have to remove them to make a
payment one of our proudest achievements
is full functionality of a regular
wallet without the bulk believe it or
not we've even managed to find space for
your change we've sourced the suppliers
we've manufactured our prototypes we've
tested them to their limits and this is
where we need your help the kickstart
community to help fund this campaign and
make the first production run at the
micro wallet a huge success
thank you fortune thank you this is
altered nozzle a beautiful new type of
aerator that fits into your existing tap
by optimizing water and creating a mist
you can do exactly the same things you
do today only with 98% less water this
is what happens with your regular faucet
most of the water either bounces off
your skin or just passes your hands
without touching them at all that's
millions of gallons of water literally
slipping through our fingers and down
the drain we need to change that and
that's why we want your help
so how do we save 98 percent of the
water without losing functionality the
trick is in optimization you break up
the water into millions of droplets and
basically you're creating your heavy
mist with our mist you're getting
contact with much much a greater
percentage of the water almost all of it
that's why you can wash your hands do
your dishes with just a fraction of the
water coming out of your tap but
sometimes you need more water that's why
we developed the switch in switch mode
you still save 85% of the water compared
to your regular tap but you still get
all the water you need approximately 18%
of the water used in our homes is water
running through our taps
that's about 32 gallons of water per
household per day if we do the math and
look at some of the most water stressed
cities in the world that's about 220
million gallons of water running through
the taps in Tokyo 240 millions in
Shanghai 40 million gallons in Los
Angeles and 50 million in Rio de Janeiro
every day and most of it is down the
drain there are already millions of
forces in the world that's why we
developed the auto Nassau to be easily
installed and your existing one by
altering your existing faucet rather
than buying a new one you get the same
effect at the fraction of the cost the
faucet is also part of our interior
design so if it doesn't look good it
just can end up in some drawer that's
why we spend a lot of time designing the
altered nozzle we ended up with this
drop shape it clearly makes a vicious
statement but at the same time it makes
it easy to switch between mist and saver
mode
today over 1 billion people are living
in areas with extreme water stress it
affects people in the United States
Brazil China Spain basically everywhere
and by the end of the year 2020 an
estimated 3 billion people are gonna
live in these areas it's something we
need to do something about we're ready
for production but we need your help
to fund the first line of altered
nozzles be part of creating a really
cool product something we believe can be
a small and simple solution to a huge
problem oh and if you like it please
spread the word Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
