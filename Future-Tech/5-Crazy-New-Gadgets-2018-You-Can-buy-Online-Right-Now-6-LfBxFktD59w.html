love my gear
I love the scratches bruises and stories
my gear carries I love knowing how many
clicks I need from each lens for the
perfect exposure my gear is
irreplaceable that's why I created gear
I see I had a nightmare shoot where it
didn't take my macro lens and ended up
losing a memory card full of great
pictures I'll never capture again that's
when I realized there had to be a better
way to manage my gear I partnered up
with Yulia she's a super smart engineer
together we created gear I your gears
commander-in-chief gear is a small
device that stays in your bag it uses
RFID to scan your bag from inside and
make sure all your gear is there your
eye tells you if all your gears with you
and if not what's missing okay something
is missing VRI helps you locate it and
it's not just about what's missing it's
also about packing light and only taking
what you really need in the gear I app
you can create lists with equipment you
need for different types of shooting
dates and gear I will also tell you if
there's something in your bag you won't
be using today we chose to use RFID
stickers and tags because there's no
need to charge them and they last for
years they're also super affordable and
come in many shapes and sizes
so you can tag all of your gear all of
it
gear eye comes in two forms either as a
standalone device which you just leave
in your bag or as a phone cover which
doubles as a charger we've created gear
eye for photographers but it's really
for anyone who cares about their
equipment from sound engineers to makeup
artists and even travelers or parents
gear eyes the solution for any worried
mind pack light keep track of your gear
don't spend money on Reeb eyeing it and
don't worry
that's what PRI is about so if you care
for your gear as much as we do help us
fund gira let's take care of our gear as
much as our gear takes care of us gear I
our world has an ever-increasing thirst
for energy our machines vehicles and
factories all demanded yet most of the
energy we use is wasted over 30 trillion
watt hours of heat per year are wasted
by power plants alone enough to power
the entire world and our environment is
part of the collateral damage over 15
billion batteries are thrown away in
landfills every year at matrix we wanted
to create technology that makes the way
we use energy more efficient and more
intimate we wanted to start with a
problem everyone has experienced
firsthand feeling frustrated when your
electronic device runs out of power when
you need it the most there has been any
innovation to solve this problem and
that god is excited to solve it using
our thermoelectric technology after five
years and several prototypes we're
introducing our first product the matrix
power launch it's a SmartWatch that's
powered by you it works by converting
your own body heat to electric power and
the best part is you never have to
charge it the watch comes alive because
it's powered by you the human body at
rest and it's 100 watts as heat similar
to that of an incandescent light bulb
when exercising that number jumps to one
kilowatt similar to the average power we
use in a home what's so cool about this
watch is that as you exercise and your
skin gets warmer the power watch
generates more power it's got a unique
power meter that shows how much
electricity your body has generated
right on the face of the wall we can do
some exciting things with this
technology like accurately measure the
amount of calories you burn our
thermoelectric technology measures the
amount of heat you've generated from the
calories you've consumed it's also
packed with all the features you'd
expect in a SmartWatch
it has sensors to track both activity
and sleep quality we're designing
changeable watch faces to suit your mood
which also built micro applications so
you can do more than just tell the time
and of course it syncs with your phone
and your account in the cloud are you
into running mountaineering trailblazing
it works even better when you're out and
about especially in cold weather since
you never have to charge it or replace
the batteries it's very well sealed and
water-resistant to 50 meters and if you
ever take it off you'll go to sleep and
store all your data when you put it back
on it comes back to life we've done most
of the hard work you have a few dozen
prototypes and a ton of data so we know
it works the power watch has been vetted
and certified by arrow electronics we
brought on Andrea Ponton a world-class
SmartWatch designer our engineering and
manufacturing is headed up by Larry side
in Hong Kong who has helped numerous
wearable companies like Fitbit shipped
millions
you
hey everyone my name is michael wagon
for some years now I have a problem
every evening and sometimes several
times a day I have to put my mobile
devices on charge and what is the most
inconvenient about it either the battery
goes out when I have a huge necessity to
is one of them I think I'm not the only
one who get bothered by this problem I'm
pretty sure that every one of you got
into this situation when one of your
gadgets ran out of battery the moment
you needed it the most you should not
worry about this anymore because I got
of that solution the solution is in hand
energy this is your device of unlimited
energy it's unlimited because you can
generate it to yourself and you can
generate this energy as much as you need
canned energy preserves energy inside of
itself that's why you can use it anytime
you need it and of course you can charge
your device during the rotation of
intelligent as well and energy is very
easy to use first you need to rotate the
ring and let it go then just give the
addition good it may be a surprise but
the water reaches inside the kenta
energy device rotates with the average
speed of 5,000 tons per minute that's
why your small pond will be charged by
pent energy with the same speed as you
charge it from the clock
take the Indonesia device with you of
the time and your energy will be safe no
matter where you are and what you do and
energy is indispensable for the people
living in the areas with limited access
to electrical grid
thanks to canÂ´t energy your energy is
in your hands it's one of the most
effective energy generators and what is
more it looks nice
you may choose the hand energy device
according to taste or style developing
the container G device we have performed
a huge amount of experiments created a
huge amount of prototypes and now and
energy is finally done and ready for
production and we need your help
by the way can't energy divide
synchronizes with an F where you can
observe your statistic and also achieve
particular goals win competitions and
get prizes before the gig start a
campaign we've made a tour around Europe
to support hen energy we've shown the
device to people let them take a close
look at it and use it to see what it's
like you may learn about the impression
regarding this experience by yourself
you can get more information about an
energy abundant or about our plans on
Kickstarter page on our website or
following decades tech and energy we
need your support we live in a world
where one value is prized above all
others freedom freedom to speak freedom
to move freedom to live it's what allows
us to chart our own course to be who we
are and to determine our own way when
you think about the internet why should
it be any different
shouldn't technology make us more free
in today's digital world you might think
that your cloud service gives you
freedom
but the big print giveth and the small
print taketh away whether you know it or
not our search for convenience has led
us to give up certain freedoms freedoms
like ownership privacy permission when
it comes to cloud services we've
essentially uploaded all of our
belongings to someone else's computer so
that person or business could then turn
around and rent those things back to us
all for a monthly fee our own stuff
stuff that we paid for why are we ok
with that and you're not
that's weird applet comes in we want to
help you take back what's being lost
her moments her memories the music that
shaped our lives we want to help take
back the power to choose how when and
where our digital lives unfold it's why
we've created cloud by dadly it's the
first personal home cloud that gives you
back the keys
no more renting no more contracts no
more using your data to sell you stuff
because we believe convenience shouldn't
come such a cost are you ready to take
back your digital life join us
