whosh that's also shampoo Mentos and
cola things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical her meek
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
once tried to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy always said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power of the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane attach power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front there
is an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing Beast
out of juice charge the battery with any
microUSB cable absolute and his career
as a pilot planes should be building or
flying and for crashing that's why all
components of the powerup 3 are super
durable and crash proof but here's where
Shai made it really cool power up threes
smart shape is programmed to optimize
user happiness you don't need a PhD in
aeronautics to be able to fly it the
prototype is fully functional and the
super ultra magical power of three is
ready for production this is where Shai
need your magic beans if you help Shai
get to 1,400 backers you'll help him
bring the joy of flight to everyone and
obtain the privilege to look down on
regular paper planes for the rest of
your life
so back power up three and help make the
magical magical earth

hi there it's Sarah here's the link play
specialist and today we're going to be
taking the mystery out of one of our
most popular activity kids design your
own superhero cake
so let's crack this open and see what's
inside the first thing we have is what
will be the blank canvas for your unique
project the blue superhero cake but
before they get started on the cave
they're going to want to sketch out some
ideas so for that we have our design
sheet and a bunch of color pencils so
after they're done with their really
cool design we're going to want to get
started on the project the first thing
we have here is some pre-cut stars but
also blank sheets of both felt and foam
so you can help them cut out any shape
that they want for their cake next we
have our tools to add those pieces to
occasions so we have craft glue and a
brush all of our kits come with all of
the tools that you need to put together
your activity then next we have a bunch
of different colors of glitter glue to
add a colorful pop of sparkle to the
cave and lastly we have some
instructions with some tips for design
but do remember that there's no correct
way to put this game together at
seedling we believe that your child's
ideas are much better than ours so all
of our kits are created to inspire the
creativity of your little one and
inspire open-ended play now let me show
you a few ways that this can come
together
