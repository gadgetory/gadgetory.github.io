complete design solution for virtually
all likely water containing and
purifying needs hi i'm bin Laden and
I've invented a water container a
problem with existing solutions they are
too big and heavy unreliable or
inefficient the recto solves all these
problems whether your weekend warrior
through hiya it's just better than
anything else guarantee available on the
market I wanted something that's easy to
use light simple and will work with as
many options as you can it can work
where the filters with chemical
treatment UV filters you name it it's
just so simple trick to the Andes the
Alps New Zealand all of the UK Israel
and here in the US through my experience
I know firsthand works and what doesn't
help in the trail and along with
extensive trail testing we're able to
develop practical and efficient
solutions real backpackers need vector
is made from bpa-free material it's safe
to use for clean water for dirty water
it's really versatile you can use it as
a gravity feed so you can fill it with
dirty water hang it on anything that you
want and just filter through you can
very easily clean it scrub it at home
soap it keep it open we're sticking the
slider inside and it dries completely
and that's it ready to use with anything
that you want we want to make the vector
a reality it's practical supremely
useful and solves a problem we all have
to deal with good design means you spend
less time with the necessities and more
time enjoying the outdoors through a
Kickstarter you have the opportunity to
get your hands on a discount vector

strikes the Japanese art of folding
paper has simple rules start with a
square no cutting no gluing just folding
it has been said that tearing the paper
means you've stopped believing in the
infinite possibilities of a square to
reshape the kayak industry we've had to
bend a few of the rules we don't work in
squares and we don't work in paper but
we've never stopped believing in the
infinite possibilities of origami
discovery is often a matter of looking
at something familiar through a
different lens ten years ago an article
about Robert Lang an origami specialist
became the inspiration for Anton to
design a folding kayak the first puzzle
to solve was choosing the material to
make the folding hull the foundation of
all of our kayaks is this custom
corrugated polypropylene this incredible
plastic is lightweight and durable but
what makes it special is that it has a
10 year UV treatment and is rated to
twenty thousand fold cycles to improve
the product and the experience we have
revamped the entire manufacturing
process and components for the coast XT
our designers have listened to you and
have combined your feedback with their
drive to perfect our product and bring
you the new coast XT with the new deck
closures it's easier to assemble and has
more leg room as well as improved
comfort and fit the result of all of
this is a 16-foot boat that is 25 inches
wide and 34 pounds she's light fast
maneuverable and durable and best of all
it folds into this
store it in your trunk hop on a bike or
take public transit you can go anywhere
explore sea caves meet friends at the
beach surfing waves tour the coastline
or just get a morning workout it the
possibilities are infinite and when
you're all done you can stash it in your
garage or your closet or under your bed
while you wait for your next adventure
the 2018 coast XT requires special
machines custom tables and more floor
space with your help we can open a new
assembly line dedicated to the coast XT
there's an added bonus we are
recognizing the origins of our company
and the man that sparked the idea of the
origami kayak ten years ago by
decorating this coast XT with a Robert
Lang origami pattern high-performance
streamlined assembly and a more
comfortable fit all we need is you to
bring this boat to market it isn't just
origami that is infinite it is what we
can do with it with your support we hope
to unlock the infinite possibilities of
the origami
