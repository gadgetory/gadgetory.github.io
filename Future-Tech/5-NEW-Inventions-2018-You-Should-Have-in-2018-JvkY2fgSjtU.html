if you want every edge your gear this
Kickstarter is for you we're going to
challenge something you probably take
for granted about your sport watch like
the rest of your performance gear your
watch is evolved to help you achieve
more we simply asked why are your
valuable stats not in your natural line
of sight we want to know our cadence
without losing we want to know our pace
without going slower
we want to know our metrics and we want
to stay focused on a sport and honor
form
today's watches deliver a corn of
information in ways we never could have
imagined so why do we wear them the same
way we always have our vision is a bat a
band that moves your watch to the
optimum position abandonned enables you
to view and interact with your watch
using no arm rotation it means staying
informed
it means improve safety when grabbing a
glance and it means improved comfort and
convenience when using your apps while
looking at your metrics
on top of optimizing the position it's
designed to be ultra lightweight
comfortable to wear and durable during
activity
ergonomic design creates the perfect
angle of view and interacting on the
move and it's adjustable size fits
everyone on the left or right hand
stopping yet another piece of technology
from bending is and more uncomfortable
positions and with a versatile design it
can be worn 24/7 or easily swapped
between events to break a hundred years
of tradition we needed to think
differently we needed to break the
status quo if this sounds like you join
us and help change the face of time
the world produces over 300 million tons
of plastic each year most of it used
once and then thrown away which is a
huge problem for us all because a
disposable lifestyle isn't the
sustainable lifestyle there is a better
way Lumi lets you stop using disposable
plastics like bags plates and straws
at Lumi we want to unplastered the world
with reusable products made of pure
platinum silicon
like glass platinum silicone is made
mostly of sand but it's flexible durable
and completely non-toxic that's because
unlike many silicone products Lumias
filler free no BPA BPS PVC phthalates
all chemicals you don't want in your
food
Lumias freezer oven microwave and
dishwasher safe
it can be used for pretty much anything
over and over again which means looming
can replace thousands of disposable
plastics so you could help save the
environment while saving money this one
lumi bag can replace 240 plastic
sandwich bags in a single school year
and that's just the start of what you
can do
we know we're just one solution to a
global single use plastic problem but
small changes can have big impacts
choose looming and help us unplastered
the world
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
