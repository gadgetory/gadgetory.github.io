technology is continually getting better
and more affordable and this is allowing
us to craft it into places previously
out of reach
it opened - we took a common single-use
device and if used it with technology to
create a stronger or versatile product
that we hope will make your life a
little better
the portable beverage bottle you'll find
these on picnics at the beach or a
mountaintop somewhere most likely being
transported there by bicycle and while
hydration is important we have other
needs of these locations introducing the
Hydra
designed to bring modern creature
comforts along for the ride the most
significant feature is the powerful
Bluetooth speaker built into the cabin
your smartphone playlists provide the
source and the Hydra keeps you rocking
in all these locations and more the
speaker is removable so you can flip it
place it on a table and extend the legs
this augments the sound by bouncing the
high end while the legs transmit the low
end into the table increasing the base
well on your bicycle listening to music
with headphones is simply dangerous they
reduce your aural awareness of your
surroundings with a Hydra your music
goes with you but safely of course we
can't live without our trusty
smartphones especially when out in the
mouth so we built a charger into the
base of the bottle that won't fully
replenished your device keep the music
thumping and charge anyway but guess
what
the Hydra is just getting started we've
added powerful LEDs to the base of the
bottle let's shine up into the frosted
surface and refract through the liquid
at a picnic table the solid white light
makes a great lamp to illuminate your
ghost stories or play game spot or set
your Hydra on your bedside table for a
reading lamp not only does the bottle
provide good neck hydration the lamp can
be set to color
to set the mood for calming sleep now

dreamland the hydras most important

night today we have a fully functioning
prototype the Bluetooth speaker sounds
terrific and our circuit design is
complete and being manufactured the
charging station is working great the
lighting system is being updated with
the RGB functionality and the red light
will be flashing we have sculpted the
body modernize the look and improve the
grip the addition of the speaker ring
will improve upon the already fantastic
sound and we're adding a few more
features such as an FM radio receiver
and even a microphone so you can take
phone calls on the trail plus a
carabiner with a bottle opener and even
a secret storage space that will hold
