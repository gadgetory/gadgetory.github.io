hi my name is yasm Umrah I'm a jazz
drummer I used to work for major record

city we always use the headphones
headphones gives you a good sound
mobility and silence but sometimes I
couldn't stand it headphones are painful
leave them on for more than an hour and
they hurt when running it gets
uncomfortable and sweaty I thought why

these problems this is a shape these
shares 3d molded open-air frame design
allows you to interact with your
environment while you're listening to
your audio this is the first pain-free
bluetooth headphone it doesn't press on
your ears which can cause discomfort

around your ear with minimal body
contact this allows air flow and makes
them comfortable to wear for long
periods of time B shares core audio

module one of Yamahas most advanced
codecs and enables us to provide
superior sound quality our headphones

works with all your music apps and
allows you to customize the sound to
your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones the
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private the airframe keeps
you in touch with the sounds around you

or want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed that VCR headphones have an
interchangeable closed frame as well for
