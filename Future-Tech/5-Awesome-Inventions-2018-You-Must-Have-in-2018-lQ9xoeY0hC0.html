everywhere here in color shape size
style any many other ways but there's
one thing common to make the more you

physically being where they are what if
you can make them work automatically on
their own it's a micro but push Italia
Wireless a robotic finger that could
push any button now I can push this with

turn on your home computer for more
playing music
start making coffee electric fan and
many other things it's only in limited
by your imagination push is simple yet
very sophisticated
we designed the gears and PCB from the
ground up for the lowest possible part
assumption and the maximum torque to
push most of ordinary buttons in fact
you don't even need a smartphone to use
it it just works
Berto boss is between two microphones
and it's what automates them other
translation services using its
groundbreaking user interface all you
need to do is described below note that
describes how you want to automate your
microphones the autocomplete feature
will also help you light bulbs with rota
box you can start making coffee when you
wake up get things on your desk ready
when you enter your office
turn on lights when the Sun Goes Down
and a lot more all automatically without
your smartphone
think about how many times you've
forgotten to charge your smartphone and
the battery has run out right when
you've needed it
we are infinity links and our mission is
to simplify your life
meet wave the world's smallest and
sleekest cable bracelet wave is a true
combination of fashion and technology
and best of all we now have
compatibility with USBC devices iPhone
devices and also microUSB wrapped in
genuine braided leather with the
ultimate craftsmanship combined with a
high-grade metallic build you're able to
charge your devices on the go in the
most convenient way we have crafted this
just like any piece of jewelry from the
ground up after working on several
different prototypes and reducing our
original size by over 50% wave is now
extremely lightweight and thin making
for a comfortable fit on the wrist and
due to its small form factor at first
glance you would not even notice this is
a charging bracelet our magnetic design
means that you'll be able to
conveniently attach the bracelet with no
hassle at all as it will simply clip in
place with a light pole it will reveal

charging cable at arm's length
literally
for over two years we've been developing
a product that pushes the technical
boundaries of what's possible and is
revolutionary and both appearance and
functionality meet the oculus onyx the
world's first additively manufactured 3
axis camera gimbal the future of camera
motion control
current electronic stabilizers help to
keep cameras stable in shooting video
but they also have many shortcomings
they don't consider camera safety they
are heavy cumbersome and hard to operate
our mission was to stabilize your camera
and the most protective lightweight and
agile package possible allowing you to
unleash your creativity in the most
challenging situations and environments
hi Kickstarter together with my brother
Jimmy we're the cofounders of oculus
inspire our love of action sports and
the New Zealand outdoors the Onix needed
to be extremely versatile so it could be
taken on the most wild adventures with
backgrounds and industrial design
mechanical engineering and filmmaking
our complementary skill set has allowed
us to push manufacturing boundaries to
rethink redevelop and redesign what a
camera motion control device can be
creating the ultimate tool for
risk-taking filmmakers
what makes the Onix different the
skeleton the structure has been
additively manufactured using grade five
titanium alloy the highest strength to
weight ratio of any medals this gave us
our design freedom to innovate with
incredible complexity in combination
with topology optimization we have
mathematically calculated material out B
now the current internal structures
every gram of weight has been optimized
to provide maximum structural integrity
the Onyx
is very compact but its unique handle
geometry that is very intuitive to
operate its weight in size then it can
be used in the most awkward and
difficult situations it can be passed
easily between operators and when it's
time to break the gimbal can be placed
without the need for a stand it
maintains a payload weight of up to two
kilos and with our tallest precept
balancing system it genetically reduces
sit-up and rebalancing times a 32 bit
control system with encoded brushless
motors provide optimal image
stabilization performance with a battery
life of up to eight hours it also has
the means to power the camera and other
accessories we've got a great selection
of options available a naked version for
an extremely lightweight setup and the
ultimate protection package with excise
deep foreign foam covering the carbon
fibre shells and the handles along with
the polycarbonate done
oculus we're developing a team of
engineers filmmakers and business
developers with the same goal in mind
inspire creators to take risks and
unleash their creative vision funds from
us campaign are going directly into
expanding our electrical and software
engineering department and further
developing our printing techniques
tolerances and materials we will only be
producing a limited quantity of units
for our Kickstarter campaign and
shipping an order of our backers we've
been getting some amazing results and we
can't wait to see what our backers will
produce let the onyx inspire your
creativity with the confidence that you
need create without compromise and back
us today what is a ring ring is a
promise commitment between two souls
dedicated to each other to the care and
love unbelievable you care about your
audience why are u livestreaming like
this vivo is like having a professional
camera crew in your pocket
well I guess third times which
you can cut and zoom mitsuko mito is if
you're shooting from multiple cameras
or sent me those autopilot and let it to
the live editing for you
neither streams live to every major
platform so you can reach your audience
wherever they are and extremes beautiful
HD video over Wi-Fi or LTE to look great
you got a sound great me though makes it
easy to catch a professional quality
audio
and with the Boost accessory you can
stay live for over 10 hours so whether
you're live-streaming to share a moment
to reach more clients to get your
message out or to connect with your fans
look your best with neva</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
