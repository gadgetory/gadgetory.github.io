reality thank you for supporting this
project
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you the
platform is strong the posts are spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding
providing you the most natural feel
possible through all of your exercise
motions adding or dropping bands easily
provides many resistance uppers we added
accessories to simulate even more
solutions such as handles that will add
weight adding bands are like increasing
your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is

molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
