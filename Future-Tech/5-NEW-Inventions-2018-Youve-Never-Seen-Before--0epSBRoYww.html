think better look better
we just are better level is not just
another fitness tracker it is the first
and only wearable to measure your
hydration letting you know precisely how
much water you need to feel and perform
your best level also measures your heart
rate sleep quality calories activity and
mood and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little gaps and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences
you could lose concentration and could
have an effect on your mood it could
affect your sleep when you first wake up
in the morning your first thing should
be to go grab a glass of water you'll
find that maybe you don't need as much
coffee and you definitely won't need as
much food water will level set actually
just how hungry you are so it prevents
over anything by drinking more water you
suddenly have more energy what do you
have more energy for working out and
when you're working out you have better
endurance your joints and your muscles
don't hurt as much and you don't feel as
much pain The effect of that workout is
continuing on throughout the day you're
wearing more calories now that you've
done the workout studies have shown if
you were hydrated throughout the day
it's better for your sleep and you're
going to be more rested so you have to
see all of this as part of a whole what
I like about level is it gives you the
data and says this is how much you need
to get balanced in life level was
designed for 24/7 wear and can learn
your activity and hydration habits not
only trending them but identifying
patterns that are keeping you from your
best
most consumer wearable devices can only
measure a fraction of the metrics that
are important to us so we focused on
research we turn to the world of medical
devices where accuracy and precision are
tightly monitored
now we've developed a revolutionary red
light technology that can look 10 times
deeper into the body measuring ten times
what any other sensor can all with
industry-leading accuracy we're excited
to return to Kickstarter with level our
mission is to revolutionize wearable
health and performance no matter if you
live to train or train to live we can't
wait to see what you'll accomplish by
measuring what really matters
introducing home drawing
have you ever wondered why you have
never seen a hand dryer in someone's
home maybe you thought about this or
maybe it never crossed your mind a group
of people from different backgrounds
such as business design sales and
chemistry got together to build perfect
home and dryer we've all seen them
before in public restrooms but they're
bulky they're loud and very expensive it
took dozens of concepts and prototypes
hundreds of experimental simulations
thousands of hours of craftsmanship and
an infinite amount of patience to bring
you home drive a cordless beautifully
designed compact an affordable bathroom
and kitchen home and drive home drive is
not only environmentally friendly it has
a built-in patented blue UV light too
kill bacteria that even soap can't get
to hands-free with a rechargeable
battery and wall mountable home DRI will
change your everyday life at home home
draws industrial motor pumps out heated
HEPA filtered air at two times the speed
than a traditional hand dryer
thus we bring you an industrial products
small enough for your home that dries
your hands in 14 seconds home dries
rechargeable battery less 1920 sessions
and on the average 480 days the
removable base doubles as an extra
battery and charging port an LED battery
indicator shows you when battery needs
to be charged when mounted on the wall
simply plug in and used while charging
or remove the battery and charge
separately we are so confident about
what we have created and are excited to
bring home drive market please help us
reach our goal so we can afford to
produce home drug at an affordable price
for everyone
laser works by combining abrasive
particles with the high-pressure water
stream the mixture exits the nozzle and
cuts through the workpiece it's great
for any workshop it cuts every material
it's compact and contains and it's
digital so you can make precise cuts
that are impossible to make any other
way as an industrial designer I've used
a variety of desktop application tools
but they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines with a desktop water
jet we can go from design to component
to fitting that component and testing
within a couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of as
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making an eliminate Edition
waser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things they're
capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut a broader range of materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime as mechanical
electrical and manufacturing engineers
we design products manufactured
components and set up assembly line
in the past now we're preparing for
production but we need enough orders to
produce the machines cost-effectively
we've created a unique desktop tool and
we're really looking forward to all the
amazing things that people create with
it hi there I'm dr. diva Tomei and as
many of you know I'm the CEO of Salonika
and inventor of kaya the natural
lighting robot kaya first premiered on
IndieGoGo this past September and ever
since we've been offering her on
IndieGoGo in demand as a pre-order over
the past several months kaya has evolved
past even what I could have dreamed we
have changed her name for those of you
who remember Lucy and have significantly
improved her design to the point that
today we call the final version kaya 2.0
we are now in the process of getting
kaya manufactured and the entire
Salonika team is absolutely thrilled
that we'll be able to start shipping
soon to our backers in just a few short
months but now let me tell you a little
bit more about what she does
using kaya couldn't be easier just place
in a sunny spot
point her towards the room you want to
illuminate and turn her on she'll find
the Sun all in her own and redirect its
life into your home or office
kaya solar-powered so you never have to
worry if she's charged and she
continuously monitors the movement of
the Sun throughout the day and remembers
where you want to send the sunlight so
you have natural light indoors all day
long
if you have a dark or gloomy room in
your home or office then kya is for you
with more than half a million dollars
raised to date on IndieGoGo it's been a
truly life-changing experience to see
the amount of support for kya around the
world as an organization we here at
Salonika believe in the importance of
upgrading our indoor spaces into places
in which we don't only live but we
thrive we won't be on IndieGoGo forever
so I strongly encourage you to take
advantage of our limited pre-order
offers on IndieGoGo and as always have a
bright day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
