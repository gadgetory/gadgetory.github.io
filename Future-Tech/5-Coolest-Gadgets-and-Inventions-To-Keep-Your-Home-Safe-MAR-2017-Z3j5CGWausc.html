aluminium shell nor is he just a 3-axis
motor system he's not even just a
connected device he's one of the
families geebo this little bot of mine
what if technology actually treated you
like a human being
what if technology helps you to feel
closer to the ones you love what if
technology helped you like a partner
rather than simply being a tool that's
what she was about that's why I created
this company and I've got the right team
to do it people with a proven track
record of bringing innovative
technologies and exciting content to
market but now we need your help to
build Gebo to bring it to the world and
to grow the community let's work
together to make Cibo truly great and
together we can humanize technology
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
and turbo controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then to find all the
things you'd like Nike to do Nike can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
put one in your living room for the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes you just
bought 10 more minutes in bed and you'll
definitely want to put one in your kids
bedroom it's exciting to think of how
naki will spark their imagination as
they figure out all kinds of ways to use
it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be far
more reliable and would better reach
than bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but even
if you're new to the smart technology
world you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
which tactics our patent-pending
technology uses non acoustic sensors
it's able to distinguish deliberate tap
or knock patterns from random vibrations
in the environment the beauty of our
product is that it makes any regular
environment into a user interface think
about the surfaces around you so many of
them serve one or two purposes add an AH
key to them and you instantly have a hub
for automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through a series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on your surfaces we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of naki
as a mother I know how crazy life can
get there's always something going on
and never enough time to get it all done
I was constantly looking for ways to
bring efficiency to my home that's when
I found new bright new bright is an
all-in-one smart home solution that
replaces your existing lighting switches
but it's so much more than a light
switch with new bright we have built in
home security
smart lighting and other family
management tools that have brought
much-needed automation to our home
things like using the home intercom
system to call the kids when it's time
to eat or using the family calendar to
schedule our appointments have been a
lifesaver
my kids were always leaving the lights
on so we love the advanced lighting
modes with new bright apps we can
schedule our lights to come on and off
at certain times activate motion
detection lighting and even have our
lights come on when we're gone to make
it look like someone's home plus we can
monitor how much energy our lighting is
using and it's been great to see how
much energy and money we've been saving
new bright also has a built in home
security
with a camera and motion detector so I
know my kids are safe I've always been
one to worry about someone breaking in
but now that we have new right I have
that extra peace of mind with new bright
we feel safe comfortable and more
organized and that is a good feeling
thanks new bright for making our life
easier for making it better
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house
you can stick your flicks anywhere like
in your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me
like now oh I'm so sorry I have to take
this but flight can be so much more than
just a shortcut to your phone it could
be integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team all
right you guys ready yeah one two three
flick high three Swedish team has been
working for almost two years to create
flick and we're really excited to
finally show it to you we've gone
through a hardware incubator in San
Francisco we traveled all across Europe
and China to finalize design and to find
the right partners we have developed a
flake app to be super simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an ISA software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky we already have some amazing apps
that will work with flick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
flick to the market and into your hands
we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return

very first flakes ever made thank you
