there's something mystical about being
in nature its peacefulness its freedom
from disturbances uplifting to the soul
and leveling to the mind
it's not always so easy to make a
getaway to a cabin in the woods though
but what if there is a way to bring the
spirit of the natural world right into
your own home we asked ourselves that
question and we came up with something
beautiful earthy it's an aquatic LED
lamp with an appealing design fusing
elements of water light and nature
earthy is about bringing the natural
peace of the outdoors indoors the
whisper-quiet
air pump gently bubbles and floats
plants in a tray the RGB LEDs create the
perfect atmosphere sending streams of
light through the gently bubbling water
and reflecting off the surrounding
surfaces earthy smartphone app gives the
user full control over every dynamic
feature turning a ceiling into a
fascinating skyline of glowing light and
silhouettes your favorite plants create
a dreamlike charm floating atop the
bubbling water and casting haunting and
peaceful shadows that drift around the
room color changing LED lights can be
set to match any color or to scroll
through any palette to create the
perfect atmosphere to suit any mood
brightness can be easily adjusted for
any setting while the app can wirelessly
sync up to ten separate earthy lamps at
the same time
introducing natural energy signal from
Toyota retro-style both robots
and it's in the palm of your hand
u.s. people accept any USB majoras retro
and not
my famous people accept an adapter for a
first controller hub for a bluetooth
dongle HDMI lookup directly to modern
service come to the 5 volt power supply
which plugs into your wall
the retro engine is not retro gaming
simplified
project shadow is bringing back the
ultimate outerwear to Kickstarter this
time we redesigned and took our
windbreaker to the next level for people
with innovative minds we needed a jacket
that was super lightweight and
weatherproof
yet keeps you dry with maximum
visibility for safety this jacket is
packed and ready for any occasion and
has a fashion-forward design for the
urban outdoors we call it the ultimate
lumen jacket
these weatherproof high visibility
jackets are specially designed for
travelers commuters or anyone who wants
to make their travel beyond ordinary
based on the feedback from our backers
we designed our lumen jacket to provide
maximum visibility in low-light
condition to keep commuters safe we've
made upgrades to existing features such
as adding mesh line vents on the chest
and back for maximum airflow an
invisible back pocket with a larger
eight and a half inch opening on side
seam to keep your essentials an elastic
cuff and hem band for more comfort and
flexibility a larger hood to give you
extra coverage in harsher weather
and front pockets that are finished with
water resistant zippers to keep your
belongings dry we've made multiple
prototypes tested materials improve the
fit and explored every aspect to create
the ultimate lumen jacket packed with
new features the ultimate lumen jacket
gives you total control with an added
earphone outlet inside the left chest
you can now listen to music with the
earphones locked in place we've also
added a detachable patch with magnets to
easily hold your earphones we came up
with three jackets that will fit any
need first the ghost mate with a special
fabric that absorbs the light and glows
in dark second the Olympian made with
flash reflective fabric so you will
always be seen in the city streets third
the shadow made from fully water
repellent materials will always keep you
dry in the harshest conditions
I'm not fat of course not sweetie
I can drop weight real quick and I can
put it on so I have a high metabolism
The Voice hat I basically count calories
oh my god to be so embarrassing enough
it's great on my ABS I just really feel
this working we can measure a lot with
breath specifically we can measure the
amount of carbon dioxide you breathe out
and the amount of oxygen you breathe in
if we take a ratio of those two numbers
we get what's called re R &amp;amp; R er can
give us basically how much carbohydrates
vs. fat you're burning you can see when
we run a test in the lab persons
exercising longer and longer they're
going to be burning more carbohydrates
the duration of exercise at a certain
intensity dramatically changes their
body's metabolism for 24 hours with the
band on your wrist you use breath for
five minutes once a month while you take
a walk after five minutes of analysis
the app shows you how you burn fat in
those five minutes how much you could
burn in 24 hours in your capacity to
lose weight this month other fitness
trackers based on heart rate zone
training and create you to workout at
the low intensity for a prolonged period
of time and make assumptions for your
fat or sugar bird instead path precisely
measures how you burn fat to your breath
and nose when you install voting for
overtime Pat learns how your exercise
changes of fat and sugar burn throughout
the day and starts recommending the
minimum minutes of exercise you need
every day to achieve your goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
