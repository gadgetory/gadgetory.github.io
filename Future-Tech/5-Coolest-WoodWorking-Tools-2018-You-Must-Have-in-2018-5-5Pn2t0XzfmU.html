product manager for Crescent tools and
today I'm going to show you a powerful
new professional demolition and
renovation tool the bulldog bite recipe
at the core of the boulevard is an
innovative double fork design an
indexing head specifically designed for
removing deck boards wood siding and
pallet deconstruction the double fork
provide balanced lift on both sides of
the nail and have gripping teeth to help
reduce slippage boards are removed
faster cleaner and with less effort
compare that to traditional pry bars
which require more force and
repositioning bull bars indexing head
adjusts for optimal leverage a closed
angle gives the user fast action for
shorter pulls a more open angle allows
for powerful downward force on larger
planks or when demolition is above
ground level the bull bar has a
patent-pending center nail puller
offering better balance and more
leverage great when removing ring shank
nails and stubborn lager nails the nail
puller utilizes the round portion of the
indexing head this design acts as a camp
to allow the head to rock against the
wood rather than dig into the material
the result of easy smooth removal
precision tips with gripping teeth are
designed to easily fit between boards
and are wide enough to straddle two
floor joists reclaimers salvagers and
other professionals will appreciate the
narrow blades as they greatly reduce
material damage the bull bar is
extremely rugged the head and 44 inch
knurled handle are made from heavy-duty
steel and an oxidized head and powder
coated handle protect the bull bar from
the elements
