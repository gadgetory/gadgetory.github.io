time we are proud to present the world's
first carbon fiber speed water our
passion for luxury goods in fast cars
let us define cx6 the same soft carbon
fiber used by the world's best hyper car
manufacturers it's point 33 millimeter
thickness allowed us to go crazy in
terms of design we were able to make it
just three to six millimeter fake and
just about as big as a standard credit
card we also chose this fabric because
it develops a 3d pattern over time that
makes each height and unique to
complement this exclusive material we
decided to use the best Italian leather
we could find to make it one of the most
on the market in addition to its compact
and small design it provides easier
access than any other wallet no more
folding deals are digging to find a car
you're looking for just full tango the

hey there this is Alice Itachi today I'm
going to show you our new type C power
meter and what this will do is measure
power input or power output to your type
C device I'll show you how it works here
so I've got my power bank and my type C
cable
so what I'm going to do is connect the
type-c cable to the power meter and then
plug it into my macbook pro you'll see
this the tachi logo come up here and on
this readout it will measure the voltage
and volts the current and amps as well
as the current over time in milliampere
that's flowing into the MacBook Pro now
let's change modes and we'll show you
how to measure output power so grab my
sitaji hub over here like this into the
power meter then plug my power meter
into the macbook and then I grab my
iPhone and plug this in to the hub
you'll be able to see on the screen of
the power meter that arrow has changed
directions so it's measuring output
power now
so again it'll give you the same the
voltage the current as well as the
milliamp hours so this device is really
useful for testing your accessories and
peripherals to make sure that they're
operating at their advertised
specifications this will let you weed
out if you have any counterfeit products
or any products that aren't functioning
as they should as well as showing you if
you're charging your type C device such
as the MacBook Pro it will show you how
many milliamp hours have charged over
time as well as showing the drain how
many milliamp hours have left the
macbook pro to charge the iPhone so yeah
that's our new type C power meter hope
you guys liked it let me know in the
comments if you have any questions and
check us out on our websites attach net
as well as Facebook Twitter and
Instagram thanks
here's rain in the morning after that's
the sound of damage family and my
friends had the same problem so I wanted
to find a solution
one day a protects the protected my ears
but still member I could enjoy going to
gigs with loud music without feeling
like I was listening to music underwater
conventional earplugs are fiddly uncool
and not fun to wear especially at
concerts engaged because they make the
music sound muffled through developing
our earphones which was successfully
funded on Kickstarter last year I
discovered a revolutionary way of
protecting our ears I'd like to
introduce isolate ear protectors
traditional ear protection products try
to absorb sound from entering your ears
they ruin your music experience and
failed to isolate you properly from bass
weaknesses and you miss out on the
details of the higher frequencies making
what you do here sound very unbalanced
by using our own patent-pending
technology
I discovered a way I could create ear
protectors that don't absorb sound they
block it giving you sensation that you
are simply lowered the volume using
flower isolator a concert is really
something else you can hear every
instrument every detail at a safe low
level like never before everyone who
loves gonna gigs and festivals is going
to love isolate they take out peaks in
excessive bass which means you can hear
details at Constance that's normally
masked and no dangerous ear pain from
sudden whistles and screams from behind
you in the crowd our bodies and bone
structure act like dynamic dampeners to
your ears as the sound gets louder your
body feels everything but your is stay
safe and an amazing comfort with
isolates you simply pinch roll and
insert they can be used in any
environment you wish to isolate your
ears one we use the highest quality
materials in the design of isolate solid
titanium and aluminium our entry-level
isolate products are solid aerospace and
ammonium and are isolate Pro uses solid
titanium for the ultimate ear plug
experience
titanium is a denser of the two metals
and so attenuates sound to a higher
level as you can see the isolate design
is finalized and moved ago now you too
can be one of the very first people in
the world to join the ear protection
revolution isolate by Flair number it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
