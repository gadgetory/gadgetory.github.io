again we've designed a brighter diffuser
and a more compact versatile light that
can charge your phone mount to your bike
as a headlight and light up any space
lantern makes diffuse light simple and
easy with up to 1,000 lumens and a
700-foot beam Lantern comes with a
unique 360-degree bike mount
shock-resistant you can drop lantern
from six feet and it's IPX six
water-resistant lanterns started out as
a simple idea a paper cone cut out and
founder Corey's home workshop he was
amazed at the result and it was quickly
off to the 3d printer then finally into
the beautiful handmade prototype so how
could you use Lantern for backpacking
and camping perfect for roadside
emergencies lighting up a photo or video
shoot in the glove box when you really
need it
awesome for family-type around the
campfire and staying up past your
bedtime Lantern can charge things on the
go for longer rides and is the perfect
hands-free light for around the house
you can clip Lantern to anything
anywhere and it's rugged enough for
industrial settings
don't get caught unprepared in a
blackout always keep a lantern nearby in
under a month we've received over 1,500
followers on Instagram and here's what
they've been saying about Lantern so
what's in the box
Lantern comes with a simple wrist strap
360-degree bike mount carabiner charging
cable beautiful Lantern diffuser and the
powerful Lantern flashlights here's the
founder of Lantern Corps II cry here I
set out nearly 8 months ago to design a
better camping life and in that time
Lantern has become so much more it would
mean the world to me
if you would consider helping to bring
my idea to the light by backing Lantern
today thank you so much introducing bite
helper mosquitoes can ruin anyone's day
mosquitoes are everywhere think about
the last time you were bitten when a
mosquito bites it injects its saliva
into your blood that's what causes the
itch and makes you scratch bite helper
is the itch Terminator bite helpers
thermal pulse technology works on
neutralizing the itch with heat and
vibration a fight helper gives you the
power to terminate the itch of mosquito
bites for yourself and your loved ones
