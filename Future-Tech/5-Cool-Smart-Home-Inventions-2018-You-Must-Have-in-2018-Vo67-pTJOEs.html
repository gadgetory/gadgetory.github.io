and irrigation system designed for
gardeners and farmers loam comprises of
three key parts a soil sensor module
that sends real-time data smart valve
system that controls water and a gateway
that manages sensors and valves remotely
the way you use gnome is that you plug
sensor into the soil and the easy to
install valve to the sprinkler system
and link everything up with the known
gateway you can then monitor soil
condition and control water using the
gnome app anywhere we design gnome to be
as flexible as possible because every
garden is unique the Gateway has a range
of one kilometer and can connect up to
30 nodes all nodes are solar-powered and
weatherproof and the smart valve can be
adapted to existing irrigation set up
via converters interested in growing a
new plant but not sure about what to do
gnome can help by analyzing plant type
location and other factors gnome can
recommend optimal parameters and
fine-tune how you water and fertilize as
a former researcher and organic farmer
we want to improve people's lives by
technology and agriculture we first
developed known for urban farming and
soon I realized it could be used for
other gardening and farming purposes our
goal is to help people grow healthier
plants and use resources efficiently
please support us on IndieGoGo and make
gnome a great success

do you remember the first time you
stream the video on your smartphone at
that moment you are no longer tied to
your living room for your entertainment
or to your office for work you could
access your content anywhere but there's
one small problem
your small mobile device screen almost
all of us prefer large displays for
entertainment and for work and those
work deadlines are approaching a large
desktop monitor our dual screen setup
will significantly boost your
productivity so what if there is a way
to have the mobility of a phone tablet
or laptop without losing the benefit of
a large screen it sounds impossible but
that's exactly what we did introducing
sput the spontaneous pop-up display spud
is a high-resolution 24 inch display
that collapses down to the size of a
book and weighs less than 2 pounds this
revolutionary product is the first truly
collapsible display and the only device
that gives you both portability and a
large screen for entertainment and
productivity throughout the spa design
process we focus on image quality and
ease of use we use the latest projection
technology combined with our own custom
optics to project a large high-quality
image over very short distance this
enables spa to produce a bright sharp
image that's about 4 times larger than a
laptop screen and 23 times larger than a
smartphone screen to mix but as easy to
use as possible
we designed to work just like a
ruggedized umbrella you can pop up the
screen in a very intuitive way and you
have this bus set up and run in less
than 10 seconds and since but it's also
lightweight battery-powered and uses a
hassle-free HDMI connection you can get
straight to the big screen you want
without wasting any time on setup
one of the most exciting things about
spud is the many different ways that you
can use on the entertainment side spud
is basically a portable TV or movie
screen
whether you're traveling camping hanging
out with friends at a coffee shop or
just lounging around your house it's the
big screen that you can use anywhere for
work having a dual screen setup is great
for productivity but you can also use it
for presentations and as a collaboration
it's great for trade shows sales visits
or any kind of field work
spud gives you the flexibility you need
no matter the situation and it's great
because it's a complete solution in a
very small package that you can take
anywhere we have the team the product
and the vision to execute on spud and
