beauty all around us like these giant
redwoods that are hundreds of years old
but that doesn't mean we still have to
experience the outdoors like it's the
eighteen hundreds
introducing the jakhary Paulo club a
portable 578 watt our generator designed
to power everything you take with you
and keep your adventures going with AC
and DC outlets and two high speed USB
ports the power pro allows you to charge
multiple devices at once with a massive
578 watt hours of power the power pro is
the most powerful energy storage
solution in its class the power Pro is
sold already so your power will always
last as long as your adventure state
the onboard LED screen gives you
real-time status of the remaining charge
and input and output wattage and the
internal smart controller optimizes
output and protects your devices from
surges overcharging and overheating and
it's great to have at home as a backup
if the power goes out just because
you're off the grid doesn't mean you
need to stop discovering sharing Soren
and capturing memories
unlimited power opens a whole new world
to what's possible outside with one full
charge the jakhary power bro can run a
mini-fridge for ten hours an LCD TV for
four hours recharge a drone battery
seven times and a typical smartphone
forty five times keep all the devices
that help you enjoy the great outdoors
charged because it's not just about with
you see what happier it's about what you
take back with you
ha I'm Stan I don't have to describe the
amazing feeling of being outdoors just
you and kayak battling across Clearwater
you the sky and the sound of gliding
across this surface but here's the rub
have you tried to keep the kayak in your
flat imagine traveling on a plane or
train with one destination inconvenience
trying to fit it into your car and then
to keep it in place can be a nightmare
so I got some friends together and we
decided to hack the kayak which I cut in
the bulk away we even thought about our
organic kayaks but that wasn't enough we
needed something better something strong
lightweight and environmentally
conscious something to fill that compact
with active lifestyles
so we hunkered down with the map the
engineering and product design we
sourced the most reliable materials
selected the latest technologies that's
the throttle type after prototype until
we were satisfied a year of iteration
and innovation later we are proud to
bring Justin case kayak imagine swinging
your tire or wheel shoulder before I set
out exploring outdoors or paddling
across the lake with that romantic
picnic spot we did and we set out on a
mission to make outdoor exploring easy
with the just in case kayak you can
decide on a moment's notice if you want
to walk around the lake or paddle across
hey you have the freedom adventure we
were looking for our weekend kayak just
like a weekend bikes so we asked
ourselves what if everyone had a kayak
that could fit into their back to
experience kayaking wherever they are
just in case is made from a lightweight
carbon-fiber frame have together buy
custom 3d printed connectors we use a
durable rip stop skin made with woven
nylon that has remarkable strength to
weight ratio waiting only 7 pounds the
just in case kayak can carry more than
250 pounds and measures no more than 40
bicep
inches when folded you will be able to
assemble our kaya in 10 minutes after
first experience we believe adventure
doesn't stop at the beaten path
we believe in taken the road less
traveled and staying curious
let's make kayaking affordable make
nature accessible and adventuring easy
let's embrace the idea the traveling
light while exploring our course is
possible please support us on
Kickstarter
hello Kickstarter's I'm Shannon Chang
the CEO and designer of York I first
want to thank all the supporters of our
first solar project solar aid following
the success of the solar aid this year
we are coming back to present new solar
paper the thinnest and lightest Solar
Charger in the world let's take a look
you
solar paper is super small and slim so
you can conveniently carry the solar
paper when traveling or even in daily
life and use solar energy anywhere under
the Sun it can fully charge iPhone 6
within two and a half hours also Solar
paper is the world's first solar charger
that can auto reset by a comparison
operator so you don't have to worry
about shadow or crowd on solar panels
also it allows users to know exact power
amount via numbers displayed on the LCD
screen
various devices such as gopro external
battery Bluetooth speaker digital camera
double a battery charger flashlight
smartphone and even tablet PC that
requires more power can be charged by
adding additional panels magnet
connectors help to conveniently add or
subtract solar panels we are so proud of
that we've come this far but to meet the
price point for more people we need your
support and green we truly believe that
the solar technology can relieve the
battery problem we face every day and
contribute to making the word greener

enjoy the sunshine bye
