distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work bagel has
three different modes string mode wheel
mode and remote my string mode is great
for measuring straight lines curves and
around corners wheel mode lets you
measure irregular or odd shaped objects
and it also makes taking measurements
with one hand much easier remote mode
lets you measure objects that are far
away and out of your reach after you're
done measuring you'll need a way to
record your measurements using pen and
paper can be a real hassle with bagel
you can quickly and easily save your
measurements with voice descriptions
just take your measurement push the save
button and then tag a voice memo to it
dog the future Raider when you're done
bangle will send your measurements to
bagels mobile app via bluetooth this
mobile application lets you review your
saved measurements and share them with
your friends bagel is precise it uses
our patented technology to make sure you
always get an accurate measurement also
bagel has an easy-to-read digital
display that's viewable and most
lighting conditions in the past few
years also some measuring devices have
become smarter and made our lives easier
it's my scales smart thermometers and
even smart watches but when it comes to
measuring size we still use a tape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't innovate the way we measure
size so we created bagel a smart a
measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team work night and

seal bites are completely we're looking
water spots the retractable hand paddles
put them on and they instantly feel like
part of your honor working alongside
industry experts we developed an
innovative hand paddle system that's
lightweight comfortable and able to
power you through the water up to thirty
five percent faster than just using your
hands it's just really amazing you can
really feel the pull of the water
awesome fun they're easy to use you feel
that you're putting like a super piracy
on great fun just so much fun I've been
designing pedals for world champions and
Olympians the last 30 years and I think
seal blades are an absolutely fantastic
piece okay the reason that steel blades
work is our unique patented
quick-release system allows you simply
to release your grip and the blade
retracts leaving your hands-free you
like cool and they peg back and it's
like they're not even there and they're
just so clever is they kind of snap back
which was felt cool so a bit like anyone
spider-man is only to actually catch
waves and get into the sport it's a
no-brainer we're currently building the
tools for the manufacturing process so
we'll have seal blades produced and
ready to ship later this year we're also
offering to exclusive lectures and
Kickstarter steel blades zero for adults
and seal a zero rush designed for
smaller adults and teens thanks for
watching the video and please back our
county
again ok let me get mine where is it no
I had it in here don't look at me if
you're passionate about ultimate and
this has happened to you we're here to
help I Kickstarter i'm dave and this is
our story I've been lucky enough to have
spent the past 14 years traveling and
playing ultimate every chance I got I've
played in 30 countries on four
continents from joining a team in Buenos
Aires to pick up in a park in India from
China Nationals in Beijing to throwing
around on a beach in Brazil those were
some amazing trips with a lot of great
ultimate but at times it was frustrating
I never found the right bag to get my
gear to the field if it was easy to
carry it was too disorganized or just
not big enough for all my gear if it
rained everything inside would get wet
when I got back home I met up with some
teammates they were all so tired of
trying to make do with bags designed for
other sports I want a backpack I want a
duffel I'm sick of my water bottle
always smell like sweaty socks where do
I put my beer so we put our heads
together throwing on all collective 35
years of experience playing ultimate and
a combined 40 years in manufacturing
we're set out to make the bass bass for
ultimate we partnered with a
professional bag factory work on
different designs and materials and
after many iterations we created the
greatest bag the greatest bag has an
easy access organization system that has
been specifically designed for ultimate
you can comfortably carry your darks
lights and even a sleeping bag you can
carry two pairs of cleats so that a
teammate doesn't have to play barefoot
that's right you can keep your snacks
energy bars and accessories handy and
organ
eyes and your wallet and phone protected
your wet smelly clothes will never stink
up your other gear it holds up the two
disks securely you can carry it to the
field as a duffle or as a backpack it's
made with water resistant durable rip
stop material and it's the only ultimate
bag with a built in cooler compartment
you can cool off ice injuries and it
keeps your drinks frosty cold yep for
ultimate players this is our answer to
all those crappy bags you've been using
over the years but this isn't just a
tournament bag the possibilities are
endless I've have this greatest back for
a week now just took it to the east
coast for a frisbee trip are the ISO
compartment the rain fly those are two
of my favorite features pretty smooth
worked really well on the airport really
great it is very durable very spacious
this greatest i've used to create the
greatest bag our team has worked for the
past two years and we now have a bag
that's blown us all away and now we need
your help kickstarter team up with us to
turn our great idea into your greatest
bag
