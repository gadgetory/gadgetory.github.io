what if your smartphone could stay ahead
of the pack what if you could add
additional features that you never
thought would be possible on your mobile
device
hi guys my name is Alex I'm Kofun of
next thing I'm more than a phone case
that will change your life next pack is
a modular smartphone case that allows
you to customize your phone to do more
than to allow you to do more with your
phone how does it work
slide your phone into the next pack case
add some modules access the app and
enjoy the unique features in each module
provides we've already created 12
modules to get you going and there's
more to come
next pack is the first phone case that
allows you to switch Hardware between
Android and Apple devices this means you
can trade modules with friends and
family and experience the different
features each module provides if you do
choose to upgrade your phone all you'll
need to do is change your case and your
modules will always work with you from
the first idea it took us about two
years to arrive where we are now
we were originally inspired by
brainstorming cases that allowed you to
add one new feature to your phone and we
thought why not make one case that
allows for many features that you can
customize for your lifestyle we have an
experienced team with members spread
across the world all bonded together
through our passion for next pack we've
been working around the clock to
collaborate on each other's time zones
and get our device to where it is today
what comes out of this campaign is just
the beginning we are currently working
on additional modules for the near
future
but even more importantly we are
building a community for developers to
thrive and meet the needs and wants of
next pack users think about an app store
for modules that can enhance your phone
whenever we show it to someone we get
some crazy ideas for future modules what
about a tiny lipgloss or a little blush
night vision camera 3d camera walkie
talkies to talk with your friends food
books a fingerprint scanner a game
controller a baby monitor a light
detector for my boyfriend you see this
really is just the beginning we need
your help to fund an icepack to bring it
to you but more importantly we need your
ideas to call the future of next pack so
if you're as excited about next figures
we are pledge today pledge today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
