most prized possessions yet we are
constantly racing the clock against
fading battery life Mira Q's mission is
to set us free from chargers cables and
bulky batteries while connecting both
Android and iPhone users to charge
seamlessly and wirelessly want to say
goodbye to yesterday well say hello to
connect whether you're using an Apple or
Android phone connect go keeps your
phone charged all day anywhere you go
it's easy fast portable and shareable
only connect keeps your phone fully
charged around-the-clock when it needs
to be recharged plug the power bank into
any USB outlet you keep on using your
phone and before the battery drops to
90% you'll already have go fully charged
again that's amazing I think it's good
for busy people connect power bank is
already in production along with our
first cases for iPhone 8 and Galaxy s8
but this is just the beginning place a
pledge and join our development team and
help us decide which cases we should
produce next Connect is the birth of an
ecosystem that needs your support we are
seeking your engagement and
collaboration to enhance the connect
wireless ecosystem in the car home and
even with nature your support goes right
back into the design development and
production so please join the connect
revolution and help us connect
innovative products to make a real
difference in people's lives to be the
first to enjoy connect just select a
color for your connect kit add a couple
of cases and form your first users group
with family and friends
choose the case for your current phone
model and when you're ready to upgrade
we'll have the latest case ready for you
see we're looking forward to connecting
with Thank You Kickstarter
what if your smartphone could stay ahead
of the pack what if you could add
additional features that you never
thought would be possible on your mobile
device
hi guys my name is Alex I'm Kofun of
next thing I'm more than a phone case
that will change your life next pack is
a modular smartphone case that allows
you to customize your phone to do more
than to allow you to do more with your
phone how does it work
slide your phone into the next pack case
add some modules access the app and
enjoy the unique features in each module
provides we've already created 12
modules to get you going and there's
more to come
next pack is the first phone case that
allows you to switch Hardware between
Android and Apple devices this means you
can trade modules with friends and
family and experience the different
features each module provides if you do
choose to upgrade your phone all you'll
need to do is change your case and your
modules will always work with you from
the first idea it took us about two
years to arrive where we are now
we were originally inspired by
brainstorming cases that allowed you to
add one new feature to your phone and we
thought why not make one case that
allows for many features that you can
customize for your lifestyle we have an
experienced team with members spread
across the world all bonded together
through our passion for next pack we've
been working around the clock to
collaborate on each other's time zones
and get our device to where it is today
what comes out of this campaign is just
the beginning we are currently working
on additional modules for the near
future
but even more importantly we are
building a community for developers to
thrive and meet the needs and wants of
next pack users think about an app store
for modules that can enhance your phone
whenever we show it to someone we get
some crazy ideas for future modules what
about a tiny lipgloss or a little blush
night vision camera 3d camera walkie
talkies to talk with your friends food
books a fingerprint scanner a game
controller a baby monitor a light
detector for my boyfriend you see this
really is just the beginning we need
your help to fund an icepack to bring it
to you but more importantly we need your
ideas to call the future of next pack so
if you're as excited about next figures
we are pledge today pledge today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
