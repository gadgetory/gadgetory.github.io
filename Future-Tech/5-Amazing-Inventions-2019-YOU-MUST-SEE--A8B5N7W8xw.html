never miss another update the Hydra
shredders are for that upper level
athlete she's very strong and fit and
really needs that extra resistance in
the water to give them that high level
workout you don't get that 0 to 400
pounds of pressure from any other
workout thing it doesn't exist so the
Hydra shredders they come in pairs and
you can use them like anything else that
you're used to in a dryland environment
you can do the same thing in the water
we did actually open up and really
amplify that inner cavity to allow you
to use it one in each hand or use both
hands on one of the products if I pull
it really slowly through the water I'm
only gonna put 10 pounds at most of
pressure on my body if I'm more
physically able the faster I pull it the
more it pushes back
so it's an accessible object and then
you can get into just a full hardcore
crazy workout anyone who thinks that
aquatic fitness isn't challenging enough
I would give them the Hydra shredders
and say try these because they'll work
you
I am Bruce and this is Chris
we designed coffee and tea equipment
together we invented the espera press
and solved major issues that limited
enjoyment of the French press for the
last 50 years we've become used to
enjoying quality brews on a daily basis
so we were inspired to create a travel
press so that we could brew and enjoy on
the go so we've created the espera
travel press a complete overhaul of what
a travel mug can be there are so many
places you can enjoy a cup of freshly
brewed French press or pour over style
coffee or even loose leaf or bag tea
when you have a custom coffee or tea
filter right there in your travel mug to
make the perfect french press style
coffee we created a portable version of
our legendary s pro press filter it
removes the grit it allows the aromatic
coffee oils to come through since
extraction is blocked after you press
down the filter the last sip will taste
just like the first
for pour over coffee lovers we introduce
paper filtered press coffee a custom
paper filter Nestle's between two micro
filters and absorbs the coffee oils to
deliver that ultra clean cup of coffee
you Kray while stopping extraction for
tea enthusiasts there's no more over
extracted tea burnt fingers or leaves in
your teeth the custom double filter is
12 times finer than your current filter
and automatically closes to stop
extraction the double lid won't leak in
your backpack purse or briefcase enjoy
it when you're ready extraction is
stopped the 12 ounce vacuum insulated
stainless steel container and stays hot
for hours the design is ready to go and
we have the best production partners in
the world the next steps are tooling and
large-scale production every piece of
the S Pro travel press is unique join us
so you can take your favorite brews to
go and please share this video so we can
make your travel press a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
