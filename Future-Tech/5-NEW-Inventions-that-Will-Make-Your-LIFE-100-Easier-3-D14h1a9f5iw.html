the first scanner came into the world in
1984 since then the scanning technology
updates very slowly in a highly
developed smart office today people
still have to use the traditional
scanner which is not user-friendly or
efficient enough we want to make a
change this is the Caesar scanner a
redefined smart office equipment it is
fast able to store data in the cloud and
it can easily scan books to improve the
scanning speed to less than 1.5 seconds
per page
Caesar innovatively uses the CMOS
scanning technology and equipped with
32-bit m IPS cpu to transfer the
information easily and omit the
complicated procedures of installing
driver Caesar cloud enables automatic
cloud processing and storage to achieve
the goal of scanning bounded books
Caesar is equipped with the advanced
smart algorithms which can flatten
curved remove fingerprints purify
background and split pages automatically
in addition with Sony HD camera Caesar
can guarantee the high quality of
scanning with embedded OCR function
Caesar can make image editable with one
click with the innovative visual
presenter function Caesar can output
1080 video at 30 frames per second
Caesar is a smart scanner based on cloud
computing and IOT technology no matter
where you are in office or at home no
matter what they are financial invoices
business contracts or private collection
books Caesar can always help you scan
easily and efficiently
we use technology we rely on it it
connects us to what we care about
yet there are times when we find
ourselves on our own again
what if you could charge your device
using only a candle
all you need is water
a kennel
then plug-in in charge
it's dependable
provides an instant source of power
where you need it most
now no matter where you are or whatever
happens to the electricity the candle
charger will be there to keep you
connected
if you're like me you like to sleep
every night there's science behind how
sleep makes us more productive and
prevents disease but I mostly like it
because it feels good I happen to be on
the road tonight for the national speed
cubers Expo and room 214 just decided it
was a good time to re-watch Rambo
totally understandable
sweet flat but I don't think anyone's
counting on them to give a big keynote
at the morning on 5 sided techniques
that's why I brought my snooze this
little guy is the Delta between
contaminant noise and ambience and
that's fancy talk for helps keep me
asleep so Stallone doesn't knock me out
of my REM cycle you hear that it sounds
good it's because there's no looping
tracks of crickets or waterfalls no
waves crashing on the beach but I'm the
Midwest he uses a real fan but unlike a
real fan I can pack this thing in my
carry-on it's not too cold in the winter
and it uses 98 percent less energy whoa
that's like almost 100 I'm just gonna go
100 close enough bet you think is just
pretty important will does yet
well it's adjustable too you can
customize the tone for light fan too
deep fan which is like packing a billion
fans and you can turn up the volume
which is great when you're doing the 5
by 5 and you need that extra
concentration I used to have to take em
and I think we've all been in that
position before plus you can control it
from your phone you know for all those
times you forget to turn your snooze off
before leaving your house thank you
Navin you think it's noisy on the rubix
circuit
you should try sleeping next to my wife
it's also great for kids studies have
shown that babies are three times more
likely to fall asleep when exposed to
white noise in my own personal studies
it's more like four but hey I'm not a
scientist sleep is important and those
cubers are counting on you that's why I
used my snooze okay technically it's not
my snooze it's my brother's snooze I
stayed at his house and I accidentally
took it with me that's why I used to
think anyway I like to think of it as a
snooze button for the beginning of my
sleep
come on Michael
Carson was not fellow Somali it's
happened to all of us having a fever or
someone from our family has had it
recently it happened to my daughter who
suffered from high fevers for two days
on the second day I called the emergency
room to see if I should take any action
the doctors first question was what kind
of symptoms does my kid have how long
does it last
then how high the fever is I didn't
remember all the details of course
so we developed a smart thermometer that
will mark the whole course of the fever
and will warn us if needed
the thermometer consists of the base
station a sensor that is placed directly
on the person of whom we need to measure
temperature and a mobile lamp it's a
small sensor as big is about 2 euros
dime which is connected directly to the
base station the base station aside from
the display has three different under
lighting colors which will change
depending on the temperature this is
butterfly our new smart thermometer so
so we floated the yellow blue key
designs I wanted to create a simple
design of the station so that it would
be usable in different interiors it's
some kind of a combination of natural
shape and geometry multiplied by white
color for easier control there's an
under lighting system to give quick
information about the temperature
one simple look is enough no need to
touch anything the handling of butterfly
thermometer is really simple no need for
computer or technical skills each family
member can easily use it the basic part
of the smart thermometer is a sensor
that will place on the person of whom we
need to measure temperature the base
station which is used for communication
between the mobile amp and sensor always
shows the current temperature now for
example I see that my daughter who is
playing in the garden has no temperature
and everything is fine a big advantage
of this thermometer is that you can
continue with your regular activity that
you used to do without the need of
manual checking the temperature of the
child every 10 to 20 minutes you can
relax by reading a book
thanks to this app you will always know
if your kid has a fever or is ok without
having to bother her or wake him up
during the night and cause stress from
having a fever or having to go to the
doctor
butterfly really offers high comfort and
safety also for the patient butterflies
smart thermometer helps greatly in the
care of relatives to whom we care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
