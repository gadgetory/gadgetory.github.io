here a laminated bench top is being
fitted to a wall
you will note the imperfections in the
wall surface that the bench table has
been fitted to the bench top is placed
in the desired position and the biggest
gap between the bench top and the wall
is located as this is the amount for two
will need to be set to this can be done
with a ruler or by placing the tool
against the wall where the largest gap
is rotate the tool sharp while holding
the blade body still until the blade tip
touches the edge of the bench top you'll
note the foot pad cover is fitted in
this instance four millimeters needs to
be removed so the tool will be set to
three millimeters to compensate for the
foot pad cover thickness the lock dot is
then tighten to lock the blades at the
required height now simply hold the tool
so does at 90 degrees to the bench top
move the tool across the wall applying
slight pressure against the blade to
commence MA continue this process for
you're happy you can see the scribed
line
now use an electric planer and trim off
the excess bench top to the scribed line
ensuring you don't go past the lock
you will notice one of the benefits of
describing tool is that the laminate
does not chip past the scribe line due
to the scribing tool blade creating a
break in the surface now the bench top
is replaced to show the perfect fit here
we see a 2-pack painted thick rail front
is been fitted to a timber floor the
picker front is placed on the floor and
set in a level position again the blades
of the scribing tool are set to the
amount required to be turned off the
scribing tool is then held at 90 degrees
to the tikka front slide the tool across
the floor to mark the entire length of
the park
it is then trimmed with an electric
planer once again paint does not chip
past the scribe line to describe it to a
blade creating a break in the surface
now the kicker front is replaced to show
the perfect fit
scribing has never been so fast and
accurate with hosted features the
scrubbing tool only needs one hand to
operate provides the flush joined when
fitting cabinetry skirting boards and
more scribes internal corners with these
groups on laminate painted surfaces
soft metals stone wood and more are you
trying to get things done nothing is
more frustrating than working where it's
hard to reach or where you can't see
till now meet the cordless flip out an
incredible power driver
it's compact to get in the tight spaces
other drivers can't yet drives with the
same power and torque as much larger
tools but here's a real magic with flip
out you'll always come at your work from
just the right angle
flip-out delivers torque and power using
a design based on industrial robots
there are three pivoting joints the top
one pivots to reach into tight spots the
middle joint lets you reach around or
over and the third joint gives you all
this flexibility with 360 degrees of
rotation the result flip-out locks into
over 380 positions giving you power and
tight spots power and hard-to-reach
spots power where you need it
flip-out gets the job done use a drill
driver at the wrong angle and you'll
quickly strip screws a flip-out adjust
to drive screw straight on and with the
drill driver you just don't have control
for our tea furniture a flip-outs
variable speed switch gives you the
touch you need to assemble furniture
quickly flip out runs on a built-in 8
volt max lithium ion battery and you can
fully recharge it in just 45 minutes and
even if it sits for a full year flip out
still holds its charge and maybe the
best thing about the flip out is it only
weighs 1 pound so whether you're working
in hard-to-reach places on electrical or
plumbing or just need a powerful driver
around the house flip out is a tool for
you make any place your workspace with
the Kreg track horse this sturdy
versatile and portable work support
makes it easy to set up a workspace
anywhere and then store it compactly
away when not in use the steel on
aluminum track horse is packed with
features that take it beyond the
capabilities of an ordinary sawhorse to
provide solid support for a variety of
DIY and woodworking tasks those features
start with sturdy adjustable legs they
fold out and lock in place securely and
can be set at six working heights to
match your needs and your tasks the legs
also fold completely away which allows
you to set up a handy ground level work
platform with the legs folded the track
horse is also easy to transport to
wherever you want to work built-in dual
mode clamping adds even more versatility
with the included Craig bench clamp you
can hold items in place in the long
track or place the clamp in either end
of the track horse for secure vice style
clamping and thanks to Craig's auto max
Auto adjusting technology you never have
to readjust the clamp when you move from
one material thickness to another in
addition to holding the clamp the track
can also be used to mount a sacrificial
cutting surface on top of the track
horse
simply attach the included bushings to a
2x4 and then slide it into the track now
you can cut without worrying about
damaging the track course or your saw
when you want more room to work you'll
appreciate how easy it is to create an
expanded workspace pair to track courses
together using the included support
brackets and ordinary two by fours and
you can create a large cutting platform
that will support long boards and heavy
plywood sheets easily so you can cut
safely and more accurately or reposition
the brackets and two by fours and you
can span between two tract horses with
3/4 inch plywood to create an extra
large work table with built-in clamping
that means you can create a big
workbench and a sturdy one that can hold
up to 2,200 pounds the track horse also
pairs with the Craig mobile project
