companion hi I'm Jordan and I wanted to
tell you about human gears new utensil
line the go bytes
there's the uno duo and trio we made the
go bytes from a proprietary nylon
material that's virtually unbreakable
while other utensils may not hold up
there's a reason we back the go bytes
with a lifetime warranty the Uno's you
shape is ergonomic and we improved the
fork and spoon ends the spoon is deep
enough for soup and designed to scrape
up every last piece of food the fork
tines are long enough for pasta and the
tapered splitter tines easily cut up
softer foods
the duo has the same optimized fork and
spoon ends and adds some neat tricks of
its own you can use the fork and spoon
separately or connect them together for
a tool that's even longer than most
extra-long utensils so it's no sweat to
reach into deep containers without
getting sauce all over your hands
the trio packs a full sized fork spoon
and knife into an ultra-thin case the
tools feature the same optimized ends
and they're accessible separately just
grab the one you want
the trio's knife is sharp enough to cut
chicken and it even has a bottle opener
we think you'll like the toothpick too
so that's the go bites lineup
super-strong
ergonomic smart and backed 100% by our
lifetime warranty the go bites uno duo
and trio the civilized tools for eating
on the go
only from human deer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
