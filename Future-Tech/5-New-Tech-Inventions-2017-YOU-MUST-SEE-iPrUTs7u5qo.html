the everyday camera you need to um I'm a
music listener and I'm constantly using
earbuds but every pair of headphones
I've used seem to fall short
they sound bad break easily and just
don't adapt to my lifestyle I've spent
more time getting new earbuds than
actually listening to music so that's
why our tune and mixers audio eschar
mustace with the perfect solution

problems with regular happens with

hey guys are you tired of seeing the
same one it's day in day out they're
either too bulky and give you back pain
or they're just a shot the one pocket
box let's bring back the classic buy
fold without the classic bulk
introducing slide the one it affected
there's a super fast RFID protected
thumb slot on either side so you can
quickly slide out your most used cards

rummage through it has a stainless steel
money clip to securely hold as many
notes as you want with a fast and
discreet way to pick through and remove
them it has a super fast pull tab pocket

unlike most one its it features a
specialist designed coin compartment
which opens with one finger and can hold
plenty of coins when it's closed the
coins will never fall out slim down and
stay secure with slide electronics it's
great it can make life so much easier
but if your host is anything like money
you probably got chargers and other
device
everybody look my name is Shawna Tula
and this is the final device fireball is
a patent-pending first of its kind
safety tech gadget it says in Berlin
when it detects temperatures over 64
degrees Celsius from the surface which
is attached like many other startups
final came from a problem I will see
every day I worked as an electrician for
years I attended a lot of fires caused
by electrical and electronic devices but
was only after an instant of my own home
that got me thinking about developing
the final device so here's what happened
late one night just before I went to bed
the lights began flicker I went to check
the electricity supply box in the house
to see what is going on and this is what
the switch inside it malfunctioned the
wires became
kind of generated a lot of heat these
could have turned out a lot differently
if I hadn't caught it in time this got
me thinking why is there no easy to use
the voice that can warn people at high
temperatures are detected from high risk
items around home or business the device
like for a moment just makes sense with
kids having so many challenges other
devices in their room fire bowl is an
extra their safety that would at the
very least give people particularly
parents a piece of life but at the very
best firewall is the device that could
save a life a home or a business plan
old sounds in book to learn when it
detects temperatures over fifty four
degrees Celsius the surface to which it
is attached sometimes when it comes to
safety simplicity is best and that's why
this version of firemen doesn't need any
apps or other downloads to work pull the
battery tap in the back here the film
from the adhesive base and press it
against a surface which you want to
monitor whether one is powered by
replaceable three what battery was last
season once there's a test button which
will also sign us the device
firewall can protect you your home and
your family with faulty aging or
counterfeit devices we were tired over
the last year I've caught fire more
through the concept market research and
manufacturing stages we're now market
ready but we need your help we've spoken
to investor the velocity once and
they're trying to take ready half of the
company we're very little investment we
can't let that happen by supporting your
crowdfunding campaign you're helping us
show investors that level is a product
that people want there's also no riskier
contribution as we are ready to ship the
first 3,000 fighter motors are ready to
go now with the second shipment arriving
in November just in time for Christmas
