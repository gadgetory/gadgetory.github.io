extended periods of time
without a reliable power source where
your phone could save your life it's
also ideal for a variety of everyday
situations like hiking camping and

in California from high-quality parts
the combination of hard polycarbonate
and rubberized edges makes for a
comfortable durable case to start
generating power insert your phone into
the case and then connect the plug at
the bottom the crank on the back flips
out and the rubberized handle pops up
for a better grip a green LED at the
bottom of the case indicates that you
are rotating at the right speed the
power output depends on the speed at
which you rotate the handle and at a
good speed you can get close to the
power of a wall charger one minute of
crank time is usually enough for a
two-minute call compare that to common
solar chargers which only give you a
fraction of power and only on the
brightest of days with the abwehr crank
