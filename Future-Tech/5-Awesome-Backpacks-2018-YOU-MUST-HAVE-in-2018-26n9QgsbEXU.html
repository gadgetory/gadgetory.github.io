the 21st century has redefined the way
that we live our lives you're no longer
tied to an office 37% of US workers say
they work from home in the past month

I'm pretty sure that your phone's been
upgraded since then and it's time that
your bag was too good life pack we've
reinvented with the mobile office does

worried about your bag getting stolen or
broken into do you have a hard time
keeping organized well lucky for you

let's start with why you're never gonna
have to deal with a dead phone again the
solar bank is a removable unit which has
a solar panel and a battery with enough
power to charge an iPhone 6 up to 12
times you can charge the solar bank via
USB and then when you're out and about
the solar panel keeps the power topped
up the solar bank also has built-in
Bluetooth speakers so you have great
sounding audio with you when you're on
the go life pack has an integrated lock
this means you can lock the zipper shut
when you're on the go and what's really
cool about this lock is that you can
actually unlock the bag
to something when you're sitting still
because of the unique design of the
zippers you can also lock the zipper
shut while locking it to a fixed point
the bottom of the cable can not be
removed and the exit point is reinforced
so it's super strong also the end of the
lock works is a bottle openness cheers
salud so on things go

a separate section for your laptop iPad
there's a space for your wallet there's
a key hook business cards pens there's
also a section for loose papers and a
separate pocket so you don't lose
receipts in the life zone is a protected
pocket for your sunglasses there's room
for clothes and any of your non-work
stuff because you don't want your undies
falling out into work bleeding cuz we
all know that is that just me that's
happened to there are 4 hidden
compartments on this bag on your
shoulder straps are 2 pockets these are
big enough for credit cards travel cards
