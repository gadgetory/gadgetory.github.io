own garden without any of the hard work
introducing grow chef the easy-to-use
device that produces at least one pot of
greens every day you can collect your
own ecologically clean harvest without
doing any dirty work
you can save around 360 euros after just
one year of growing your own greens with
grow chef's grow chef has an endless
cycle of cultivation first the pots are
placed on the top level after the greens
reach 3 to 5 centimeters the pots are
moved to the middle level as you move
pots to the next levels just fill the
old spots with new pots all you need for
healthy plants is a nutrient solution
you pour each month into the bottom slot
the solution is pumped to fill all three
levels automatically the three color LED
illumination gives light to the plans so
you can keep grow chef wherever you want
you can even change the timer settings
of lighting using the grow chef app hi

optical glasses too stylish sunglasses

hi I'm David and I'm Thomas we're two
product designers from the north of
England and the creators of Nina
sketching and visualizing is critical to
our everyday lives which is why we find
the iPad pro with Apple pencil to be
such amazing products using the Apple
pencil on the go is where we encountered
our first problem in the beginning we
made do with carrying a pencil and it's
accessories loose in a backpack what was
missing was one secure place for
everything
the second issue we faced was the
sketching position owning the smart
Keyboard means you can have the tablet
flat at your desk or almost completely
upright what was needed was that truly
comfortable low angle we knew that both
of these problems could be solved with
one simple product
say hello to Lena an iPad pro an Apple
pencil companion through months of
design prototyping and testing we've
arrived at what we feel is a complete
solution Nina acts as a protective case
for the Apple pencil holding the
lightning adapter and up to four spare
nibs using the pencil itself the nibs
are removed with ease when the lid
slides back Nina transformed into a stun
for the iPad pro holding the tablet at a
comfortable 10 degree angle and creating
your artwork and contact Nina is made
from only four components the hard
shells are made from an engineering
polymer ensuring a high-quality scratch
resistant case the top and base are made
from a soft touch polymer gripping the
iPod to the care so it's anchored to the
desk this creates a secure worker
platform all of this and Nina is still
only 22 millimeters high her compact
size fits easily into any bug that is
perfect for on-the-go Nina has been
brought to life using our skills as
product designers but now we need your
help to make her a reality your pledges
will pay for to learn from the first
production run to bring Nina to market
hi I'm here to share a useful idea that
I'll explain about quickly after several
unpleasant experiences with handheld
navigational devices getting stolen we
decided to create a comfortable device
that practically everyone can use on a
daily basis
it's called tactile track an innovative
bracelet equipped with revolutionary
tactile navigational systems this
bracelet is absolutely irreplaceable for
people who love bicycling motorcycle
riding the tourists and sightseers who
love to explore new cities and
surroundings on foot and others who all
get back to at the end of the video
bicyclists no longer have to worry about
how to fasten their mobile phone to the
handlebars or worry about where their
devices or getting in an accident while
looking down at the navigator for
motorcycles it's the same story it's a
lifesaver
imagine not having to worry about where
to put your navigator how to attach your
phone to the bike where to look going
over a hundred kilometres per hour can
cost you your life if you don't pay
attention to the road just wear tactile
track on your wrist and your eyes always
stay on the road for fans of walking
tactile track is more than a navigator
its protection I'll explain once my
friend and his wife are traveling around
Europe and while visiting one of the
cities along the way they held up their
smartphones practically every corner to
check the map and at 1 intersection some
thief ripped the phone right out of my
friends hands and ran off with our
bracelet this will never happen
everything I've shared can we summed up
in three basic features of tactile track
safety your eyes are always free to view
the situation on the road battery
economy enjoy saving significant battery
life since your smartphone screen is
always turned off comfort
what can be more convenient than a
bracelet you're probably asking yourself
how does this thing work the bracelet
connects to your phone via bluetooth
using our Companion program tactile
track using a built in navigation map
you choose your desired route and push
go now you can put away your smartphone
and start moving before every turn the
bracelet vibrates to tell you which way
to go
vibration on the left turn left
vibration on the right turn right
vibration on the top of the wrist keep
going forward comfortably fastened to
your wrist the bracelet guides you to
your destination by pressing home on the
center of the bracelet you easily follow
the return route back to your starting
location you don't even need to lift the
phone out of your pocket and it doesn't
matter where you are wherever you go off
the route on the route it takes you back
home the bracelet is designed so that
each of the three built-in vibrating
motors vibrates its signal over a
precise part of your wrist the vibration
never spreads across the whole wrist but
gives a localized vibrating signal
precisely where it needs to be on the
left top or right of the wrist at the
very beginning of the video I promise to
tell you who else will find this
bracelet useful the tactile track
navigation bracelet will prove an
irreplaceable tool for people with
eyesight problems with our device you
won't have to worry that you left your
glasses at home can't see the screen on
your phone not a problem you're not
using your phone this isn't another
useless toy but a seriously useful tool
once our project is successful we will
be able in the very near future to begin
the second stage of development white
ring a tactile navigation bracelet
specifically designed for individuals
with serious vision problems following
some reworking and additional
improvements to the software the tactile
track bracelet will significantly ease
and help those with serious eyesight
problems to orient themselves in urban
environments without a dish
no outside help with your support not
only can we make life easier and safer
for many people but also help those who
need our care and safekeeping much work
remains ahead and we need your help
