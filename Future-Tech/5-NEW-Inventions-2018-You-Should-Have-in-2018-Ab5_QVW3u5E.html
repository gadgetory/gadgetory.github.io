say hello to dusk
a unique wall clock that changes shades
when time goes by we designed dusk to
adapt its colors and transparency
depending on the time of day at dawn the
light shades of grey start the cycle of
your day and while the day progresses
the shades turn darker
and darker
until the dusk turns into a night shade
of black
this cycle from start to finish takes 12
hours to turn dark and another 12 hours
to become light again dusk is incredibly
easy to install and calibrate to any
timezone
dusk never look at time the same way
again so this is the bulb that is
actually being up to space and pass the
drop test from a hundred thousand feet
back to earth
the world is switching to LED but LEDs
are kind of pretty horrible at the
moment doing products with lightbulbs
we've experienced and notice that the
light that we want is not really what we
can find in the market lighting has a
really big role in how we feel and
recreating this filament with this new
design that sort of characterizes fire
at the same time create something that
is also energy efficient and that's
really where the idea of art came out
before we start flights we used to send
things up into space now that we've
gotten to making crazy levitating light
bulbs we thought we want to send
something from flight up into space the
idea of nature and lightness and then
kind of fit perfectly with the idea of
our launch so we went in the middle of
nowhere in one of the darkest days of
the year
it's freezing here it's more of the
coldest and darkest places to be we're
going to set a light bulb free by
putting it on a near space balloon we've
done a few film shoots here at flight
and we have never done anything where
you spend weeks preparing but as soon as
you let go you can't do anything
a lot of preparation is necessary timing
is critical it's about 95 percent
planning and 5% execution every little
angular of the cameras every little
sensor everything has to be perfect
there is no adjustment afterwards
we managed to pull it off then we had
the challenge of actually finding and
after three or four hours we didn't get
any communication from our rig we had a
problem with the GPS transponder we
think it's because of the extreme cold
it's minus 60 up there that's when our
team sort of gave up on the idea of ever
recovering it again but the next day we
got a call from a local ice fisherman an
ice fisherman found it the next morning
in the middle of nowhere so it was a
really nice interesting mix of
randomness and human kindness that
brought this whole project together
we all know the advantages of having LED
lights in our homes in our offices
everywhere the thing is that with this
advancement we forgot about one
important factor is that early days to
be appreciated they must also look nice
we want to make an affordable version
one that can hang in bars and cafes and
homes all around the world our LEDs last
30,000 light hours so that's 14 years at
six hours a day so if they're gonna be
lasting a long time they might as well
look really nice we're working with one
of the best manufacturers in the world
but nevertheless who still needs your
help with your support on this journey
we could really bring this product to
life and set the light bulb free so this
is the actual light bulb that's been up
to space as much as we'd love to keep it
we do plan on letting one lucky backer
take it home so if you're into the idea
of having something in your home or
business that has been into the
stratosphere this might be the pledge
level for you thank you
try to innovate the coffee and tea space
by creating some of the most amazing
commercial coffee brewers that is out
there today
and the domain she is an American
company which was founded back in Utah
in 2012 we made the Steampunk to really
make the best cup of coffee in a really
beautiful way in a commercial
environment we really wanted to distill
that down to something that you can use
at home super simply and it's much
easier to clean the flask is a full
immersion brewer it's really similar to
a French press but it makes a much
cleaner cup
you
when we design a new product it
product and whether it's a product for
home we believe in three core values of
that product it has to be beautifully
designed aesthetics is very important
for us it has to deliver a perfect cup
every single time and it has to be
sustainable in a way that we're using
our materials and we believe as well
that the sign in itself is a sustainable
factor because it broke beautiful the
product is the longer you will use it we
believe that the flask is a perfect
extension of our core values we're
bringing this to Kickstarter because all
of our current equipment is handmade
machined and hand assembled in Salt Lake
City it's high-quality its high cost its
commercial equipment with flat spur we
want to bring this to the home and so we
need to make it affordable which means
we need to make a lot of expensive
tooling or coming to the Kickstarter
community to help us fund this and get
it off the ground and get it into your
hands we wanted to bring that beauty of
brewing and and make a really good cup
of coffee really simple to make at home
so that's why we made the flask and it
really makes an extraordinary cup of
coffee at home super easy
