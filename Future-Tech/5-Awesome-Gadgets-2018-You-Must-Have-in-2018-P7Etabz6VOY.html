life's about exploring new possibilities
but while the goal is to lose our
inhibitions most of us end up losing our
stuff instead the more technology
evolves the more gadgets we buy and the
dream of travel can be replaced by a
nightmare we had enough of those
panic-stricken moments and what if we
could prevent disaster before it happens
this is the reality of the mute egg a
smart rechargeable tag that notifies you
immediately if you forget something
got an upcoming calendar notification
like a flight where you'll need to
remember a long list of stuff you'll be
reminded just in time ensuring you never
miss a beat just open the app name the
item and stick it on focus on your trip
while your new tech takes care of the
rest
this smart learning tech gets to know
you and your habits when you use your
stuff notifying you accordingly
depending on your location you can
adjust the range
no matter what phase of your journey
you're at the new tack has your back
every step of the way the only thing you
need to worry about is whether you're
brave enough to tackle that bungee jump
roller coaster or wherever Adventures
calling you to with the new tag you can
check in your tag items in just a few
clicks Travel should be simple not more
stressful than a day at the office
once you've touched down and need to
collect your luggage you'll never have
to fight your way through a mob of
passengers ever again just chill out and
when it arrives on the belt you'll know
through an instant notification when
it's ready for collection no more
searching and no more stress
heading home can't find your car the tag
will navigate you to your vehicle
hassle-free the past year has been a
roller coaster of our own developing and
perfecting the mutex potential our team
has made it possible and we couldn't be
more excited to have partnered with the
top manufacturing names in the business
we're ready to bring the new tech to you
but we need your help to cover our
growing manufacturing costs in overhead
we need funding to turn our dream into
your reality we're dreamers creating
world of stress free travelers and
hassle-free journey oh the places you'll
go
so what a quick way to measure stuff
what if you could measure anything just
by walking
this is Moser one it can measure as far
as a 1,000 foot tape measure measure
through walls and obstacles as if they
weren't there measure winding cable
lines or tracks measure angles and
curves calculate the area of a room
volume for storage or a shipping package
get the right game Klein for your decade
or stairwell photos find the right
horizontal level and distance for your
poster frames measure circular objects
cylinders even irregular shapes all with
one hand just need to move it from one
point to the other pin you're done other
measuring tools fail when there's too
much light
wrong surface or if the space prevents
them because it doesn't use lasers or a
camera Moser one isn't restricted by
light or space use it anywhere anytime
no matter the circumstance Moser one is
waterproof dustproof and shockproof your
recordings are immediately saved in the
app which is already being sold in the
App Store
the app also turns your phone into a
rudimentary Moser device and already has
70,000 downloads and a solid 4 star
rating from users so how does it work
Moser one uses an advanced technology
called motion measuring motion measuring
is the same technology used in rocket
guidance systems to accurately track the
movement and locations of Rockets in 3d
using gyros accelerometers and
magnetometers moser one plots its
three-dimensional position in any space
to measure distance angle level and much
more Moser is the first motion measure
device ever made for consumer use it
puts the same technology found in
rockets in the palm of your hand so what
are you waiting for back our campaign
now and step into the future of
measuring with Moser one you're careful
about eating healthy food and drinking
clean water but what about the air you
breathe do you realize that you actually
ingest 12 times more air than food and
five times more than water introducing
the Spree Moe personal air monitor a
keychain sized air monitor that plugs
into your iphone and lets you see what
you breathe the app gives you real-time
readings for temperature humidity and
air quality based on precision
measurements of volatile organic
compounds a coloring number scale tells
you the quality of the air around you
opt into our community and share your
results and contribute to a worldwide
real-time air quality map we are
constantly surrounded by toxins in the
air around us from common products like
cleaners to smog pollution and pet waste
the most obvious results are the 1 in 12
people who suffer from asthma or the
more than half of Americans who live in
areas with unhealthy air quality but in
reality almost everyone is subjected to
poor air quality at some point during
the day spree Moe can monitor your air
wherever you are or confirm your
suspicions so you can do something about
it
hello my name is dr. TJ Osborn you know
after 23 years in practice one of the
things that I have found out that it
separates sick people from healthy
people is that healthy people know their
numbers if you don't know your blood
pressure you're gonna have heart issues
if you don't know the numbers about
what's in the air that you breathe
you're gonna have breathing issues
that's why I find that a personal air
monitor is absolutely required for
people to be healthy
spree moe keeps you informed whether
you're at work home school or the
airport spree Moe was founded by Ray
combs and Harold Hahn Ray has helped
bring about products like the Palm Pilot
and Amazon Kindle and is passionate
about improving indoor air quality to
help his son who has asthma Harold has
been studying chemistry for years at New
York University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside
thus primo air monitor lets you be fully
aware of those deep breaths you're
taking in Spri Moe is helping people
breathe easy Wow the air quality here is
so great today okay everyone let's take
a deep breath
you like to keep things clean
you have great hygiene you might think
that your living environment is hygienic
- well I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret
it isn't you're a hand sanitizer fan
girl you gleefully spray chemicals like
alcohol dimethyl benzyl ammonium
chloride willy-nilly all over your
baby's room even though it's highly
toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates
oh don't worry it's only slightly toxic
to humans
you're the hygiene hero so it's no
wonder you think you're winning the
constant battle against microbes that
can spread like wildfire and make your
entire family sick nasty little buggers
sure your personal hygiene is phenomenal
but what about the hygiene of all the
products and environments that that your
loved ones use every day we call this
enviro hygiene and if you're ignoring it
it is a real problem here is your
solution
take back your personal space hygiene
with our orb anti microbial light ball
scientists have known for decades that
certain wavelengths of light eradicate
all kinds of gross microbes like mold
and bacteria do you really want her
inhaling any of the microorganisms
breathing like millions of lovestruck
bunnies inside of that mm-hmm
nope not this mama so what's so special
about our orb anti microbial lights it
uses sub UV light wavelengths that are
safe for humans and are still ultra
powerful at killing microbes it's
convenient size and shape means it can
fit into all kinds of products it's
waterproof these three attributes make
the orb incredibly useful
don't be gross just because you have
good personal hygiene doesn't mean you

some of the billions of ways that our
product can help putrid pet bulls and
stinky water bottles
