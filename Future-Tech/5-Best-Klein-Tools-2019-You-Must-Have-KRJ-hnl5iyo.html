you
hey guys re-up i'm here to talk to you
today about the new 1106 t1 automatic
wire stripper from clang tools now many
of you are probably familiar with the
everyday kind of wire stripper the stamp
type wire stripper has all the different
gauges of what size wire and the
stripping hole is associated with it
this tool don't need to know it takes
all the guesswork out why self a self
adjusting so what's really neat about
this is these heads right up here that
come down these grab the wire won't
deform it and then as I pull through it
will actually strip the wire out and
I'll demonstrate that in a second for
you the other nice thing about this is
if I'm doing smaller gauge wires 2022 I
have this adjusting feature right here
that you just turn the knob and it
actually just the tension coming down on
top of the head the other feature is if
I need to make a certain length of a cut
I have this wire stop here that's also
adjustable determining on what size
length of strip I want the other feature
here is this the cutting built-in cutter
cutting the wire to a specific length
before I want to strip it so let me
demonstrate for you how this Tool Works
so I'm going to take out and move this
away because I just want to show you the
actual size of wire that I'm gonna be
cutting but I don't know what size gauge
wire I'm gonna be using here let me
actually get my cut out here cut my wire
I'm gonna just do a end cut right here
so as I put it through just squeeze down
and it separates and I got a nice clean
cut now the other nice feature about
this tool is if I want to cut and strip
in between the wires to have like a mid
span all I have to do is go in here pull
apart now separates the wire and allows
me to have a mid span nice feature for
this tool this is a great tool to have
in your pouch the 1106 t1 automatic wire
stripper from Klein tools
