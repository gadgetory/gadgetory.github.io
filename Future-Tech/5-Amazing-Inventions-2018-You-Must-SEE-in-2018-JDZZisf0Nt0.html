what if I said choose a table that will
last you for the rest of your life of
course how are you going to predict what
kind of table you need in say 10 years
time that's what I wanted I'm an
architect and I thought maybe I can
design something living in a big city is
amazing but when it comes to finding an
apartment or workspace you need to be
super flexible remove house more
frequently than ever and we throw away
more and more of our old junk each year
because it can't always adapt to our
changing lives I wanted an endlessly
adaptable table and I wanted it to be
beautiful resilient and never go out of
style most of all I wanted to be the
last table that I ever bought
introducing table it's a new take on a
concept I love bring your own flat
surface and attach the table legs and in
minutes you'll have your new custom
piece of furniture all you need for
assemble is the included element
place your tabletop on the floor and
slide in the legs tighten the three
bolts of her leg to fasten and most
rigid plant ever on a modular table leg
stand it up and that's it table is
designed to give you the most
flexibility possible here's how first
and foremost table is super sturdy the
unique clamp mechanism is CNC machined
from a solid piece of brass giving you
an incredibly rigid connection three
adjustment screws below are designed to
spread the load and account for any
misalignment in the surface this clamp
will never come loose or wobbly and it's
safe from tampering
there's no bracing or additional fixing
so you can configure table in almost any
way to suit your chosen tabletop you can
use any number of legs and clamp them to
any edge of the surface not just the
corners and this means that your
tabletop doesn't need to be a rectangle
say hello to circles triangles weird
vlogs or even very long tables that use
more than just four legs for support the
design is modular allowing you to change
the height of your legs in the future
the wooden portion will come in three
Heights coffee table table or desk and
counter height and will offer upsize or
downsize kits online and modular means
repairable we'll have a full suite of
spare parts on hand to get you back up
and running in no time if your leg to
get somehow damaged the clamp accepts a
wide range of tabletop thicknesses
between 19 millimeters three-quarter
inch 45 millimeters one and
three-quarter inches with a weight
capacity of up to 60 kilogram 140 pounds
you're not limited to the light flimsy
tabletops use solid wood stone plywood
or upcycle reclaimed materials to create
any look your table is durable and
repairable so it will never fail you
it's modular and adaptable so it will
always be useful it's a clean minimal
design made from authentic raw materials
that will always look great in your home
or office
i'm nick flutter I work for a cool New
York design firm by day and I design
stuff for myself by night through a
series of past projects I put up a
network of suppliers and manufacturers
who can make stuff like this to exacting
specifications and with a quick
turnaround I've spent almost a year in
rating and testing the design and build
a production ready prototype in
collaboration with a manufacturing
partner who's ready and waiting to get
started on the first batch we need to
meet a minimum batch size to kick-start
this product and our company if we meet
our goal it allow us to start
manufacturing table as a sustainable
business but I need your help if you get
in early you'll save up to 175 bucks off
the retail price for a set of four legs
and secure one of the very first
Kickstarter edition sets back this
campaign today to be one of the first to
own this beautiful table that you'll
enjoy
in many permutations for the rest of
your life
