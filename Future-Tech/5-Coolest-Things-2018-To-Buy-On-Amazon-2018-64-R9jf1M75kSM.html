the Wi-Fi router is one of the most
important utilities in our lives that we
usually take for granted but many
routers are really difficult to set up
configure and maintain security for our
Wi-Fi shouldn't be taken lightly but we
usually don't want a password that's too
complicated and hard to remember we've
sacrificed security for convenience so
the combination is typical home routers
are optimized for just a few devices but
nowadays each of us owns multiple
devices cheap components equal a weak
signal which means we're sometimes loved
to do some signal strength yoga we're
gonna say it a good Wi-Fi router is
something that's worth investing I'm
going to show you the greatest pain your
eyes have ever been go key Wi-Fi is
designed to be simple sophisticated and
secure to set up key Wi-Fi just plug it
in
and you're done we've simplified it all
to connect we've patented a unique
authentication procedure that is simple
and secure just go to the Wi-Fi
selection page kalki Wi-Fi and you're
authenticated now you're able to connect
devices that aren't authenticated simply
can't join everyone notices when the
internet slows down there are thousands
of possible problems that might have
nothing to do with your internet
connection but something to do with the
connection between your modem and your
router or your router and your devices
we've designed something that's so much
more than a simple reset button the Zen
button it runs a self-diagnosis the most
common connectivity issues and attempts
to resolve them automatically and you
can also use key Wi-Fi as a range
extender for your existing routers even
configure multiple Wi-Fi networks using
either traditional passwords or our
proximity authentication procedure your
choice
so that's key Wi-Fi easy to set up and
use a new secure way to authenticate
devices and protect your information and
