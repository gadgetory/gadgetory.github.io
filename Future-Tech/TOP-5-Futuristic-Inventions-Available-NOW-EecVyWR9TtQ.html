desire and need to make technology even

happy with this massive worldwide
support our theme spend many hours on
brainstorming designing and prototyping
and we are very excited to present our
second Pocket PC the OCO Sirius B black
cherry the OCO Sirius B black cherry is
equipped with the most advanced
technologies available we've included
five upgraded hardware components such
as a powerful Intel processor four
gigabytes of RAM and a first-class Wi-Fi
chip set to give you the best
performance possible as a result of the
increase in speed and performance the
black cherry version generates more heat
this required us to design a completely
new passive heatsink passive heat sinks
make our pocket pcs 100% silence as they
don't require a fan for cooling we
combine their passion for functional
innovations and everything related to
space and develop the heatsink for the
black cherry with the pattern of the
Canis Major star constant
