most important component of our day
sleep studies show that waking abruptly
are in the wrong phase of sleep can be
as harmful as no sleep at all we all
have to wake up on time but how we've
been doing it is unnatural and needs to
change most of us aren't even aware that
waking delight the way nature intended
can be the difference between another
groggy morning or revolutionising your
day here at mode modern we want to
change them the sunrise pillow is the
world's first smart pillow that tracks
your sleep wakes you naturally with
light and reinvents the alarm our
specially designed LED lights speakers
and sensors are embedded beneath layers
of premium memory foam simply set your
alarm
choose your wakeup music and go to sleep
in the morning your pillow will glow
from a soft morning red to orange until
your room is filled with light then your
music plays to ensure you're awake by
mimicking the Rising Sun your body will
be stimulated and wake up naturally
fully refreshed and ready for the day
the sunrise pillows smart alarm you
knows when to wake you in your lightest
phase of sleep so you wake up focused
and energized the moment you open your
eyes our sensors monitor your sleep and
give you a sleep score if your sleeps
interrupted at 2:00 a.m. you should be
able to hear what it was so you can
adjust your surroundings to perfect your
sleep fall asleep to nature sounds your
favorite audio book or mask out unwanted
noise with the built-in sound
conditioner you can even fall asleep the
old-fashioned way with the adjustable
reading lights that turn off
automatically once you've fallen asleep
here at mode modern we've been hard at
work we're a team of designers and
engineers with over 10 years of
experience making a pillow for you to
rest your head on may seem simple but
making it intelligent and easy to use
takes even more finesse that's why we're
working closely with materials experts
and software engineers to source the
most comfortable materials and design
the simplest system that works
seamlessly to improve your
the popularity and wearables is proof
that we all care about improving our
body state of mind well we shouldn't
have to wear something to become better
at it the sunrise pillow is designed to
give you insight into one of the most
important processes of your life in your
sleep when designing the sunrise pillow
we went through many iterations to make
sure it was not only the most intuitive
smart alarm but also the most
comfortable
we used soft breathable fabrics and
integrated coin technology to keep you
cool and comfortable the entire night
sleep plays a critical role in all our
lives so we didn't want to make this
pillow without your help we want the
Kickstarter community to help us bring
better sleep to everyone with your
support we can together help people get
more out of their days by improving the
quality of their lives
we're so excited to build the sunrise
pillow and get it we've all been there
you're traveling on a plane a train or
even a bus and you see them you know who
I'm talking about
you have the head bobber that person
that just can't seem to keep their head
up next the determined conversationalist
the person that will not stop talking to
you when all you really want to do is
catch some Z's there's also the
accidental cuddler and of course you
have the space invader that person that
has their stuff everywhere there are
countless travel pillows on the market
today but none of them quite get the job
done they're either too big and bulky
don't give enough support for your head
and neck irritate the skin too much work
to inflate and deflate or too small and
quite frankly useless finally there's a
pillow that solves each of these
problems we call it the duo the ultimate
travel pillow and we packed in nine
features that will get you to your
destination rested and relaxed the duo
allows you to wear the pillow in four
unique positions depending on how you
prefer to rest the first position is the
shoulder pads which allows you to wear
like a traditional neck pillow that
wraps around the back of the neck and
provides additional support between your
shoulders and the seat the second is the
beard this gives that bobbing head of
yours a break the duo design carries the
weight of your head just lay your chin
on the
portion of the pillow then there's the
bear hug if you like to lean forward on
the tray table or the C in front of you
then the bear hug is for you by flipping
the pillow vertical it provides a wedge
shape to support your head and neck
finally there is a field goal by
flipping the duo with the supports
pointing upward it allows your head to
be nestled between the supports while
still allowing your head to lean back
being travelers ourselves we know that
space always comes at a premium so we've
designed the duo as a compact inflatable
pillow with our patented wide mouth
inflation valve you can literally get
the duo blown up in two breaths
no more huffing and puffing on the
standard tiny valve
it also deflates in just a few seconds
the bladder of the duo is wrapped in a
soft touch micro fleece imagine cuddling
up with your favorite blanket with the
duo's removable hood you can give
yourself the privacy you want or even
send a message here over talkative
neighbor the hoods adjustable strings
allow you to get cozy or as dark as you
wish
it can also be used in any of the four
pillow positions the soft touch micro
fleece is removable making it simple to
throw in the wash to get rid of those
drool stains we all do it on the outside
of the pillow we've included a small
pocket that can be used to keep your
phone or other valuables close by no
more digging through the seat pocket in
front of you to change a song or having
it fall out of your lab when unexpected
turbulence occurs you may be thinking
cool features but does the pillow
actually work don't take it from us we
show the pillow to these travelers and
here's what they had to say I like it I
should like it it holds your head in a
neutral position no matter what because
you have these top parts nice big
opening
I like this a lot better than mine cuz
uh the thing in the back is just it's
real skinny so I don't feel like my head
is like for trying to sleep like that
you can use it in different ways
um obviously the first side with the
with my neck up against the back and
then this way is another good way to use
it cuz I sleep with my head forward like
this a lot on the plane and this keeps
it propped up so that I'm not like all
the way down on my chest with my
experience with traveling with a pillow
my neck just kind of gets crunched up in
the corner and I like that this will
hold your head upright and I like that
it just has lots of different ways that
you can get comfy on an airplane because
we know that's one of the hardest things
to be able to do we are so confident in
our product that if this is not the best
travel pillow that you've ever owned
we'll take it back no questions asked
backer project today so you can arrive
to your final destination rested and
relaxed
mrs. Kay trimming away with his ostrich
pillow
hi we're studio kg and we created the
ostrich Minh perfect companion to nap
pretty much anyone be it for an express
pound Apple work for a good snooze and
long distance Jen did you know that
power Navi increases productivity by 34
percent we spend so much time at work in
front of the screen or in transit and we
thought why not create something that
helps us nap disconnect and dream all
you have to do is find a place to nap
slip on the ostrich pillow and you're
set to go
our first prototype was a turtle head on
the web I will discover thousands of
people also shared the need to nap
ostrich pillow is supported by studio
banana things and with your Kickstarter
help
we can't wait to go into production we
want to share this dream with you thank
you for supporting
hi I'm Cedric Walker inventor of the sky
dreamer we all want a great sleep on a
long trip and this pillow will allow you
to have that no matter what seat you are
in let's say you're on an airplane
you've gotten to know your neighbors and
now you're settling in for the long life
if you like me you don't understand why
there isn't a simple comfortable way to
sleep while traveling so a while ago I
was packing for a trip and an idea hit
me like a sack of potatoes this is how
we'll travel in the future no more
slouching next and no more drooling on
your neighbors they'll appreciate that
this is my friend and colleague Liz hi
she has endured every iteration of my
pillow designs a lot of design liz has
helped to ensure the material comfort
the functionality and the look of our
final product this pillow is comfortable
as my design philosophy has been
influenced by many years of working as
an aerospace research engineer and just
as NASA has led in scientific
exploration I want to help you explore
the world our world in comfort so
working with our manufacturing partner
we have finalized our design well
several patents pending we are certain
with delivering the best possible
product all we need now is your support
help us make your sky dreams a reality
sky dreamer it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to design a travel film unless
it's this one
Thank You Kickstarter and Thank You Liz
oh good one there's no way I would make
this flight without just Jackie just
wait
this will be fine sir thank you
soon
