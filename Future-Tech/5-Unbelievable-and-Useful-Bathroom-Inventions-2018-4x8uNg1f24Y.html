fundamental elements
it makes them about 70% of the Earth's
surface and a similar percentage of our
bodies each day we have an intimate
interaction with water for most of us
this starts with our showers our showers
are deeply personal our long time to
wake up to think to rejuvenate to unwind
at Nebbia we set out to see if we can
make this important part of our daily
rituals better in every way
we started with the knees Carlos one of
our co-founders ran a large Fitness Club
company and was deeply concerned about
the high use of water together with his
father Emilio they search for a solution
it turns out showers are one of the
highest wasters of water and there
hasn't been any meaningful innovation
over a century nearly five years later
dozens of prototypes built we've had 500
people try it and now we think we've
built something pretty special imagine
being totally embraced by water from the
moment you step into your shower imagine
an experience with water so moving you
never want to step out your skin feels
soft hydrated maybe is about
experiencing water in a way that you
never have before to innovate on the
shower experience we had to look outside
of the current industry and approach the
engineering problem from a completely
new angle the last half century of
nozzle technology has completely changed
what we can do with droplet sizes and
distributions however this technology
has only been applied to very
specialized fields like rocket engines
and medical devices we use these same
tools and technology to develop Nebbia
what we do is atomized streams of water
into millions of tiny droplets by doing
this we can achieve 10 times the surface
area of water compared to a regular
shower while using a fraction of the
volume
I just got out of my first neviah shower
it was a total unique experience and I
loved it I was getting hit with these
little water droplets I loved the
feeling all the droplets hitting your
skin it's like you're being enveloped by
water and as an Airbnb host there are a
lot of showers going on in my place and
this is important you know this thing is
it not only make the experience better
for my guests but it's a few money I
felt great it was a really fun
comfortable experience the whole thing
just felt awesome
I could take that shower every day we
put nebula to the test on average
Americans take about eight minutes to
shower for the normal shower that's over
20 gallons of water with an obeah it's
only six that's 70% less what we built
Nebbia to be easy to install you simply
unscrew your existing shower and screw
on Nebbia with a wrench some plumbers
tape and included adhesive you don't
have to call the plumber or break tile
in addition Nivea slides up and down a
couple of feet pivots at an angle and
includes a portable wand which you can
position wherever you choose mnemba
provides a totally new and refreshing
shower experience we've partnered with
world-class design firm box clever to
create a design that is both beautiful
and intuitive yet offers a totally new
degree of adjustability on top of that
the water and energy savings just makes
sense we still have to build a company
that will transform the way we interact
with water over the course of the next
few decades we've assembled a team
thermal fluids experts to solve some of
the difficult engineering challenges
that have prevented innovation in
showers for a long time and finally
we're ready to bring navi to the world
and we've decided to start with you
the Kickstarter community our us-based
manufacturers are ready to go and all we
need is your initial support thank you

introducing new blade a revolution in
toilet cleaning technology hi I'm here
to tell you about an invention that will
revolutionize a chore that we all love
to heat cleaning the toilet recognized
this the classic toilet brush design has
remained unchanged for decades the sad
fact is it's completely unfit for
purpose the bristles clog up very easily
meaning they're extremely unhygienic and
hard to clean they retain water meaning
they drip everywhere and they're also
extremely inefficient you have to scrub
back and forth and they never clean
under the room two years ago I decided
to do something about it
in 2013 Gary brought together a team of
product designers engineers and material
specialists and went into the lab to
work on a new product that would help
change the way that toilets are cleaned
forever with its patented swipe clean
technology the silicon blades follow the
contours of the toilet ball and reach
under the rim with ease
swiping the surface clean a silver based
additive kills germs both during and
after cleaning and helps cut down bleach
use the blades do not get clogged up
like bristles and have a hydrophobic
coating that sheds water and dries
quickly a hollow-point head feature also
helps clear blockages air flows freely
through the holder to quickly evaporate
any remaining moisture
the let's look at how Lou blade helps
overcome the main failings of the toilet
brush the bristles of a toilet brush
quickly become clocked which is hard to
dislodge especially after it has dried
with Lou blade the smooth flat surfaces
are easily kept clean and clear with
just a gentle shake after shaking look
how much potentially germ filled and
smelly water is still contained in the
brush Lou glades hydrophobic coating
ensures that all water is almost
immediately removed the bristles of a
brush only touch part of the surface
which is why you need to scrub back and
forth to get things clean with
continuous contact Lou blade swipes the
surface clean in a single pass so there
you have it we have a very strong team a
great product manufacturing channels are
ready and we can be shipping by early
December we just need your help to raise
funds so that tooling can be made and
manufacturing again helped us to take
clinic to the edge introducing Lou blade
a revolution in toilet cleaning
technology take cleaning to the edge
shaving us we know it is far from
perfect
it causes razor burn ingrown hair cuts
bleeding and even infection and if you
have sensitive skin or a skin condition
it's even more difficult the u.s. alone
throws out two billion raises a year
most can't be recycled because they pose
a health risk so they end up in garbage
dumps there must be a better way can we
create the eraser that does not cause
irritation a razor that shaves smoother
chrome a razor that helps reduce waste
this is why we created the score
appraiser once working on lasers for
cosmetic and medical purposes I wondered
could I put this technology to better
use I wanted something that would
benefit every single one of us shaving
what's the obvious answer the industry
has been looking for a laser shaver for
home use but discovering a viable
technology has eluded everyone until now
wavelengths of light have been to stop
at the cut through dark hair but not
light or gray hair we wanted a laser
that could cut all hair many prototypes
were built and after years of
experimentation we had found exactly
what we were looking for we identified
molecules in the hair that absorb a
particular wavelength these are called
chromatophores this chroma forests are
the only continuous structure in the
hair they're shared by every human
regardless of age gender and for race
the scalp razor is for everyone to use
and it works great on any area this is
how it works
a traditional razor cuts the hair shaft
at an angle this is what causes your
skin to fill run when the scalp reason
makes contact the laser melts through
the hair shot completely level to the
surface of the skin this leaves a
smoother softer finish the last longer
to the touch we really need your support
to put the scarf razor into production
we have preliminary agreements with
manufacturers we require capital to
getting orders we've spent many years
developing this razor because we believe
after 5000 years of using the same
technology it's time to make shaving
easier safer and greener help us bring
shaving into the 21st century
we wake up each morning to a brand new
day a day of balance and wellness we
nourish our body with healthy foods we
physically stretch our bodies in hopes
of stretching our minds everything we do
goes back to our well being but there is
one piece we often tend to neglect from
the wellness puzzle introducing turbo a
simple and effective addition to your
daily routine before the 19th century
toilets were non-existent people used to
squat to release two thirds of the world
actually still do and for good reason as
we adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements studies have
shown us the perpendicular posture
brought on by the toilet creates a kink
in the colon which makes it difficult to
go it also makes us susceptible to a
number of other health issues by
elevating your feet that kink disappears
your muscles are able to relax and your
colon is open for quick and efficient
release and that's why we invented turbo
turbo is an elegant yet affordable
solution that makes a great addition to
any bathroom it's sleek design allows
for flexibility and comfort the unique
ramp design makes using turbo easier for
any person of any size the lower toe
area allows you to easily load your feet
then you can position your feet forward
or backward on the ramp to adjust to a
squat that's just right for you and with
turbo squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time to
Oh massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your support
