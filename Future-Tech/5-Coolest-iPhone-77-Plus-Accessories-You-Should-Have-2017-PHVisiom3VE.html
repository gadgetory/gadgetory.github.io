world's first magnetic connector for
iPhone 7 because Apple is combine the
audio jack and the power jack into one
connector on the iPhone 7 we are now
able to give you a magnetic connector
that connects your data audio and fast
charging in a single click it's never
been working
magnetic connectors are vastly superior
to mechanical connectors not only are
they way more convenient
they're also far more resistant to dust
water and other contaminants all this
added reliability can greatly improve
your peace of mind our engineering team
has worked very hard to make this
connector as small as possible we have
also developed the two-in-one connector
that works with Android and Apple
devices you've already successfully
completed a pilot manufacturing run of
over 1,000 units we have done extensive
testing to ensure the reliability over
extending these if you're interested
please contact us now through our early
review

reality we cannot do it without you

amplifier designed specifically for and

resolution audio imaginable TVs used to
have yeah picked one now imagine a TV in
your house right now plans free the
difference in the details and clarity is
what you will get from the

here is Kevin high cabinet table
aw measures of these focus on your
monitors I mean working closely with the
Kaiser that comes out for the last few
years
I'm excited to tell you about the excess
ah
li-mei company we use surprising
connection to provided hallmark and if
it doesn't maintain or function develop
iOS app and it's a two-part silk charm
quality we have specially developed as a
hand to meet an American government and
also keep the program how to date any
future movements additionally we've also
added help an equalizer couple whose
excess for combat fire to make you hear
everything
York's a timber young music how do you
ever found yourself in a situation where
handling your smartphone with one hand
was an impossible task that's why we
invented popsicles
the first eco-friendly iPhone case that
makes it easier for you Pudsey case has
a fold away handle that helps you hold
your smartphone in a natural way using
your hand instinctively there are so
many situations during the day when we
need to use the phone with one hand
while the other hand does other things
the poxy case handle allows you to
manage your smartphone with one hand
more confidently and safely without
using additional accessories
but popsie case is not just a very
comfortable phone case we are very
excited to announce that it is made with
100% of cycled material that comes from
fishing nets from old Mediterranean Sea
so we are contributing to decrease the
amount of waste in our seas and on our
land
hello my name is Paulo hello my name is
a deficit hello my name is Anna
we're cofounders of popsicles and we
like to tell you how we got here
Pablo and Lanson came up with the idea
of popsicles when he was having a hard
time trying to take a picture with one
hand he thought that a handle would
solve this problem so he built the first
prototype when Pablo embedded this case
we knew that we had something very
simple but revolutionary on our hands
we're excited to announce our new line
of bendy charging cables
today I'd like to show you why we've
poured so much of our energy into this
cool little cable the Apple certified
bindi charging cable comes in six
vibrant colors orange blue green pink
white and black the bindi cable is 7
inches long from tip to tip we know how
frustrating it is to spend more money on
another USB charging cable because it
just keeps breaking or to have that
anxiety and annoyance that you won't
have access to your phone because
another one just came apart the durable
bendy cable is tailor-made to solve this
problem
the bendy is durable because the weak
problem areas on a typical USB cable are
coated in a strong thick rubbery silicon
coating that's still super flexible and
bendy this allows a full range of motion
for charging your iPhone or iPad in most
places that you need the other issue is
that longer cables are overkill for most
uses like charging your phone with a
power bank charging your phone with a
laptop on a desk or connected to a USB
outlet in your car long cords just leave
a tangled and disheveled mess you can
easily slip the bendy cable into a
pocket even with the phone and a small
power bank connected the bendy cable
easily fits into a purse briefcase or
even a small side pocket of a backpack
it's almost guaranteed if you bought an
uncertified USB lightning cable that
you'll eventually get those dumb and
annoying accessory unsupported error
messages on your phone and if the cables
will stop charging and syncing
eventually the Apple MFI certification
is pending and should come through any
day now the bendy cable is a must-have
for anyone who uses an external power
bank or battery to charge their iPhone
or iPad the bendy Cable is also perfect
for charging your iPhone with the USB
outlet in your car or truck
I use the bendy cable to charge my
iPhone on my desk at work with my laptop
it keeps my desk area super neat and
clean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
