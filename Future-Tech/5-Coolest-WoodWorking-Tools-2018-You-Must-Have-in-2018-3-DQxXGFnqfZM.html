12v - twenty twelve volt professional
quarters planer

10.8 volt battery systems it has a 56
millimeter reversible blade and there's
a spare one in the back of the unit here
it has a brushless motor a champ for
groove in the front here and the optimum
cutting depth per pass is one millimeter
but at the touch of a button you can
increase this to two if you take it easy
the product also has right or left-hand
chip ejection simply by removing this
little chute and replacing it in the
other side you can determine which side
the chips are ejected so that's the gho
12v - 2012 volt professional planer from

Kreg jig in place of the normal drill

in place and drill in the same way that
is used for creating pocket holes to
create the plugs just Chuck the plug
cutting bit and do any drill this high
performance bed features a specially
designed cutting tip that sheers cleanly
for a smooth consistent plug the bit
also has an open design that presents
wood from jamming inside the bit and
fluting that reduces heat and friction
for better plugs and longer bit life a
stop collar ensures perfect depth every
time to produce accurately
sighs plugs the custom pocket hull plug
cutter comes with one bit that creates
plugs for standard size Craig pocket
