you a brief overview of the all-new gho
12v - twenty twelve volt professional
quarters planer
it's 100% compatible with 12 volt and
10.8 volt battery systems it has a 56
millimeter reversible blade and there's
a spare one in the back of the unit here
it has a brushless motor a champ for
groove in the front here and the optimum
cutting depth per pass is one millimeter
but at the touch of a button you can
increase this to two if you take it easy
the product also has right or left-hand
chip ejection simply by removing this
little chute and replacing it in the
other side you can determine which side
the chips are ejected so that's the gho
12v - 2012 volt professional planer from
bosch the crank custom pocket hole plug
cutter makes it possible to take Craig
joinery projects to the next level by
giving you complete freedom to create
your own custom plugs from any wood
species that means you can cut plugs
from your own project stock to create
plugs with color that matches your
project better than has ever been
possible before plus the custom pocket
hole plug cutter allows you to create
face green plugs that blend in amazingly
well the plug cutter simply slips into a
Kreg jig in place of the normal drill
guide block and works with the Kreg jig
K 5 K 4 or even an older K 3 model that
allows you to clamp your plug material
in place and drill in the same way that
is used for creating pocket holes to
create the plugs just Chuck the plug
cutting bit and do any drill this high
performance bed features a specially
designed cutting tip that sheers cleanly
for a smooth consistent plug the bit
also has an open design that presents
wood from jamming inside the bit and
fluting that reduces heat and friction
for better plugs and longer bit life a
stop collar ensures perfect depth every
time to produce accurately
sighs plugs the custom pocket hull plug
cutter comes with one bit that creates
plugs for standard size Craig pocket
holes for even greater versatility two
optional bits are also available one
makes smaller diameter plugs that fit
Craig micro pocket pocket holes
the other bit creates large plugs to
work with the Kreg jig HD a plug size
that's only possible using the custom
pocket hole plug cutter
after cutting the custom-made plugs free
they simply slip into the pocket holes
the plugs are sized to protrude only
slightly above the surrounding surface
that means it's easy to sand or trim the
plugs flush producing a plug that
virtually disappears when you want the
best matching pocket hole plugs possible
and when you want the freedom to create
plugs from any type of wood the Craig
