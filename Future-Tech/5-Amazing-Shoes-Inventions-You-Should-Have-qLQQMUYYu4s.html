hi my name is Krista I'm from Vancouver
BC and I'm a registered nurse I'm on my
feet for 12 hours of the day and these
insoles are gonna change my life I'm in
the middle of training for my first half
marathon
I've never weren't insulted for my life
I just came back from my first friend
and I'm so excited to wear them to work
everyday objects of our lives are
constantly evolving phones have become
handheld computers cars are smarter and
cleaner watches it turned into personal
assistance but what about our shoes we
spent most of our lives wearing them but
besides fashion designs they have seen
little evolution in the last few decades
we bend over to tie them to untie them
they come undone they get stuck in our
bike chain we leave the laces tied all
the time and damage our shoes sure
we have velcro shoes and zippers but you
still have to bend over and they don't
fit nearly as firmly as good old laces
at power lace we wanted to figure out a
way to create shoes that fit firmly and
comfortably without ever having to lace
or unlace them we decided to think
differently and we found a solution we
are proud to introduce the p1 our new
Auto lacing system allows for efficient
hands-free shoelace time the first time
you wear them slide your foot in adjust
the tension once and you're set you'll
never have to bend over again to take
off the shoes use your other foot to
press down on the back lever it's that
simple it's a nice product it's a very
streamlined it's not bulky a thin sole
lot of companies have big bulky soles
kevlar lace on any products the definite
advantage in working in the street for
25 years to see two pairs of killer ice
is broken power lace shoes will simplify
tasks of everyday life allowing you to
take advantage of a snug shoe fit while
on the go
in my 15 years in the footwear industry
I've never seen such a innovation they
are comfortable they are very stable too
so I think it's amazing our shoes are
made of the very best materials and
combined proven shoe design with our
innovative technology we have working
prototypes and have met with
manufacturers we are ready to start
production
our very first men's shoe the p1 will
soon be available in many different
colors help us make Auto lacing shoes a
reality pre-order your pair today and
become</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
