past year our team has been working on
creating the best fidget toy in the
world
this is fidget power the world's only
fidgeting device that charges your
electronics with fidget power you get 10
awesome buttons and switches plus
powerful internal battery storage that
can charge up your smartphone give your
tablet hours of extra use or supply
power to nearly any USB charger the
device for the first time ever you can
simultaneously charge your favorite
device as you click twist slide roll and
mash all in one ultra portable package
and let's not forget about the optional
bag it makes everything so much more fun
backers get to choose from a bunch of
sweet color options and can go with
either a non-magnetic rolling ball or
select the magnetic version at no
additional cost but honestly that's just
half the story we engineered fidget
power from the ground up to be the
smartest fidgeting device out there we
turned to economists psychologists
product designers and even shapes used
in anti-anxiety exercises for
inspiration with the design and after
several months of prototyping we have
created a shape that rests effortlessly
in your hand providing a calming feeling
that reduces anxiety also improving your
focus let's not forget about the built
in gadgets there's 10 of them each one
meticulously placed to further develop
your coordination and reaction skills
and now there's really only one thing
this you guys we need to get enough
pledges for our first big mass
production we have built great
relationships with our manufacturers
they can't wait to start producing for
us we're giving our backers awesome
perks like huge discounts and even
surprise just for supporting us early on
and of course our factors here will get
fidgets power way before anyone else
so remember fidget better fidget smarter
with fidget power
it's no secret that we live in a world
where everything is becoming wireless
and digital perhaps one of the most
popular examples are digital key cards
they give us access to home public
transportation work and so much more but
as convenient as they are they're easily
forgotten leaving us left out we wanted
to take a good idea and update it for
the modern world with our phones doing
pretty much everything these days
we figured why not add one more feature
we've created magic kit the world's
first iPhone case that integrates your
digital key cards into one convenient
product as long as you have your iPhone
with you you don't need to worry about
carrying those digital key cards anymore
with magic kit your iPhone can work the
same as any other Android device with
NFC functionality here's how it works
with magic --get phone case you'll be
able to incorporate up to three of your
digital cards by syncing up the two
guards to the NFC modules that are
embedded at the top of the case and by
inserting one physical card at the
bottom of the case this won't work for
any regular iPhone cases because the
iPhone will block or influence the
signal we have a patented technology on
the magic kit to ensure that the signal
will always go through first by placing
it on the magic kit box sync it to the
box then place your case on the
indicated area of the magic kit box then
just follow the instructions on iOS app
this works for 90% of que cards or que
fobs in the US market what makes magic
it's so unique is it's the world's first
iPhone case with NFC functionalities for
RFID but you can read or write an RFID
tag with magic it your phone can work
the same as any other Android device
with NFC functionality there are so many
exciting functionalities and features
that we can achieve by using the iPhone
with magic kit digital key cards are
just the beginning we are striving to
make all of our lives a little better
