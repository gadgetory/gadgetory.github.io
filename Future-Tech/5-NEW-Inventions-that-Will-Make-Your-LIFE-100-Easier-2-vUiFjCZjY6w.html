distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing beigel the smart tape
measure bagel lets you measure just

Time Matters
whether crafting creating
preparing or rebuilding it's amazing
what you can do when you put your mind
to it
all it takes is unwavering perseverance
and the right tool in your hands
when you combine your creativity and
know-how with a Leatherman you have the
confidence you need to take on whatever
arises in your everyday real life
no matter what real-life entails your
Leatherman is right there by your side
helping you tackle challenges go on
adventures and Excel under pressure
together you and your Leatherman become
a powerful force the Pens that many of
you been waiting for the EDC pins now
made from incredible titanium never be
caught without a pen again the edy sink
pens are ultra compact rugged and
designed to always be with you I really
love the reaction I get every time I
show off the seamless joint where the
cap meets the barrel of the pen it
really is fun to see their amazement two
years ago here on Kickstarter I launched
the original EDC pens made from
stainless steel and have sold thousands
of them unfortunately they've been out
of stock for some time since I've been
busy with my last project the pocket
bolt pens so I can't wait to get
production of these new pens under way
if you're not familiar with titanium
it's an incredible metal due to its
lightweight strength and toughness it's
used to build spaceships and the most
advanced fighter jets titanium also has
another very unique property when it's
heated to very high temperatures the
material surface transforms into
incredibly vibrant and beautiful colors
all of these unique characteristics
makes it the perfect material for an
everyday carry pen
the titanium EDC pens come in two sizes
the t1 is the smallest most compact
version and is perfect for jotting down
a quick note or capturing a quick idea
the t2 is a little longer and is better
if you have larger hands or plan to do
more writing or sketching both sizes use
the same standard d1 refill the standard
refill is made by most of the major pen
manufacturers and is easy to find your
pen will ship with the auto black ink
refill installed and ready to use these
are really great and smooth writing
refills since this will be my third pen
project here on Kickstarter I've learned
the process
and now I have the infrastructure in
place to move quickly from the
manufacturing and finishing of all the
parts to the assembly and laser
engraving and finally the packaging and
shipping all parts of your pen will be
made by me here in Los Angeles
California ensuring the highest level of
quality my workshop is set up and I've
already prototype the titanium versions
of the EDC pens using my CNC lathe this
ensures that I can make them in titanium
to my exacting specifications so now I
hope you'll join me on this cool new
project and help to make it happen as
you can see from the comments on my
previous two pen projects here on
Kickstarter I work hard for you to make
sure I deliver what I promised my goal
is that you enjoy the entire experience
I'll share photos and videos of each
step in the process of making your pens
your pen will also come beautifully
packaged so they're really great to give
a super high quality gifts now that I
have everything in place I really need
your help to purchase all of the
titanium and production tooling with
your pledge I will be able to bulk
purchase all of the material and pass
the savings on to you now is your chance
to have a super high quality go
everywhere pen made it from a real
space-age material that you can enjoy
and use every day I really love the
community here on Kickstarter and I look
forward to working with you again to
make this project happen your support
really means a lot so please send me a
message if you have any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
