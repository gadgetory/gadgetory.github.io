with a keyboard but the keyboard wasn't
designed for gaming professionals in
their early twenties are suffering
frequent neck back and wrist issues if
they're already experiencing health
problems
what will be like in 10 years and for
the millions playing computer games
every day hi I'm Lewis dialer Siviglia
founder and CEO of digna former fnatic
League of Legends head coach and 2 times
EU LCS champion looking for solutions
for my players I discovered that the
keyword that we use for gaming hasn't
changed in 30 years and that's way too
long during the last 14 months we've
been prototyping and dusting with users
we've created a beautiful premium
quality mechanical gaming keyboard
design team good performance health and
comfort it's called race
a normal keyboard forces the risk to
vent over the inside of your hand races
flip design allows you to rotate both
halves so you reduce the strain in
wrists and shoulders race has a cool
aluminum body their connectors and
joints are magnetic and the cable gives
you an extra USB port you can create
multiple fully configurable layouts and
toggle instantly between them and assign
to each group of keys a different
backlight color and the underglow will
give you visual feedback when you change
layouts race has the functionality of a
full-size or in a much smaller footprint
it's crazy that we use both thumbs for
only one massive key race has eight
thumb keys they are comfortable to use
because they're in the area where our
thumbs naturally rest race is a keyboard
and again in keypad in the same device
you can detach any side and the other
will still work this way you can have
more space for your mouth while you're
gaming it's comfortable for both left
and right-handed gamers there are many
kinds of mechanical switches all races
switches are hot swappable so you can
easily pull them out and replace them
whenever you want regular keyboards then
the wrists up creating strain over time
punters are needed to raise the wrist
making a neutral angle if you want a
premium quality mechanical gaming
keyboard with a beautiful design that
can help you improve performance health
and comfort support us let's make race a
reality
the helmet for the digital age has truly
arrived apply is the embedded system
technology motorcycle helmet with an
integrated dashcam and hands-free call
functionality
ply keeps you connected whether to
bluetooth Wi-Fi or GPS with an embedded
HD camera and noise cancelling mic and
speakers state-of-the-art features have
been integrated without interrupting
your riding experience
1/3 inch sensor shoots HD resolution
footage so you can relive right with E
sells and the chin alignment the dashcam
offers sweeping 120 degree views over 10
no more GoPro or other accessories the
dashcam is embedded right into the
helmet connected through Wi-Fi you can
view real-time previews of the footage
directly on your smartphone no need to
export to PC and with plies GPS
timestamp your videos will automatically
be cataloged to show your driving around
she calls on the road by seeking
I be on my way now see you soon with
active wind and traffic noise cancel
and we heard clearly intuitive button
placement and one touch control keeps
your hands on the handlebars and your
eyes focus on the road
we all love the new MacBook it's
brilliantly designed but don't you wish
that it should have some more ports when
you need to use your external hard
drives or sync your iPhone and iPad
connect external monitors or even
transfer photos and flash drive contents
there's a problem introducing Vista the
all-in-one hub for all the connectivity
you need on your matic unlike some other
devices it requires only one type C port
to connect to your macbook so now you
just need one device to sync or charge
your iPhones and iPads to connect SD
micro SD cards flash drives and external
hard drives you can also connect
external monitors using HDMI VGA DP or
mini DP designs to complement the look
and feel of your macbook V Star is made
with precision milled aluminum alloy the
same as your MacBook this star
incorporates all the ports you need and
the most compact design to deliver the
best user experience this one hub is all
you need to bid goodbye to your tangled
up desk it's sleek its smart and it
makes life convenient this dark
uncluttering your life
our mission is to help people take back
the outdoors from insects and we want to
do that in a different way
mosquitoes are actually a growing
problem there's new diseases there's
Zika there's dengue there's West Nile
the season for mosquitoes is getting
longer and longer and they just get in a
way of spending time outdoors enjoying
the activities that each of us love and
spending time with friends and family in
our backyard sprays and repellents that
you put on your skin just get in the way
of outdoor fun
so thermos L solution to that is zone
repellency so we came out with radius
radius is a new and better way to fight
mosquitos you just turn it on and
mosquitoes are gone the radius of ice is
so easy to use it's push-button simple
literally one button on the front of the
vise push that to turn it on you
instantly see the light come on and that
lets you know that the device is active
and working radius uses an epa-approved
active ingredient that is based on a
naturally occurring repellent found in
the chrysanthemum flower and our
scientists have worked on a formula that
can be activated at a lower temperature
which enables us to use a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery as the heat source
this is the first time that battery
power technology has been combined with
this active ingredient
I love the refill of the system to
deliver a simple refill system it had to
last a long time longer than any of the
products that are out there what we
deliberated was an incredibly easy to
use easy to replace refill process it
was definitely a great moment for us
when we were first able to put the
product out in the field and see that
everything that we knew on paper
hypothetically was supposed to work
actually did work we've been through
several rounds of prototype testing on
radius and we do that before we even
begin to think about mass production our
test facility in Georgia has put radius
through its paces in fact they're seeing
reductions in mosquito pressure amongst
the best they've ever seen we think
radius is a perfect fit for Kickstarter
it's a novel new and different way to
fight mosquitoes we're really close to
development we have everything about the
product designed we have the approval
from the EPA now we just need to do our
first production run
radius is convenient it's portable you
can take it with you anywhere and
because it's lithium ion powered you can
even take it on a plane so your next
trip or adventure
destination you can take radius with you
so we really think the Kickstarter
community is going to embrace radius
because it's innovative it's new it's
different and it's effective it really
really works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
