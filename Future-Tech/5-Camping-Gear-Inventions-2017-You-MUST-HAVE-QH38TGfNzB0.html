with great mother nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to E string it's a portable water
powered generator it converts any type
of running water into stored energy you
can get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy this is how it
works remove the cover unfold the
turbines and lock them
hook and release e string into running
water let it spin freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one east stream which
can charge up to three smartphones
GoPros or tablet PCs two times faster
than charging through an outlet you can
also use it as a lantern with four
different modes even underwater
east stream works well even in wheat
currents for behind a kayak and
regardless of the weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any size backpack
it's ideal for use while you enjoy
camping fishing kayaking biking or any
other outdoor activities we didn't start
it just to charge your smartphone at the
campsite we wanted to provide a personal
own demand energy our goal is to
discover every energy resource around
you and convert them into your own power
we've been working hard to get here to
meet you
our journey has just begun please join
us in our adventure let's embark on this
journey together to stay connected as
one
I know cover charge Thank You sigma
brush thank you thank you every
adventure is fueled by water where many
adventures are found water is rarely
safe
at Grail we get outside of travel the
globe whenever we can
we've used let down by dozens of water
filters and purifiers are slow and aqua
be use bulkier complicated some of our
sucking and squeezing batteries needed
chemicals our goal is fundamentally
change how you hydrate on the go after
four years of obsessing over every
detail of design and performance we're
excited to unveil it poured our heart
and soul into grail ultralight purifier
bottle the ultralight with the most
advanced purifier bottle femoral its
fastest most convenient compact it's
easy to use you can purify water from
virtually any freshwater source
definitely make room for it in your bag

we are you filling out the questionable
hotel city really gnarly trail need

home prepping a disaster game purify
water anywhere in the world full
spectrum purification plus the
filtration means you're protected
against pathogens like viruses bacteria
protozoa plus particulates chemicals and
heavy metals the ultra light filters and
purifies at the same time filtering mix

integrated attach the clip on your back
readily my way running only 10 point
nine hours the Grail ultralight bottom
represents a sheer distillation
everything we've sought to create over
the past four years back only bottle
anyone anywhere will ever need please
help us change status quo how people
access safe clean drinking water on
thank you
the world is getting smaller and more of
us are traveling to distant and remote
places when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee that the
water we are drinking is safe there are
currently dozens of personal water
filters &amp;amp; filter bottles on the market
that claim to solve this issue the
problem is that water filters only trap
bacteria insists that then remain in the
filter and continue to live and multiply
this can add up to a major health
concern in addition water filters do not
eliminate or even trap water borne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filter meat pure to go
the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world peer to go kills bacteria and
viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia there is absolutely no waiting
time or preparation required as
contaminated water passes through peer
to go it is purified instantly without
the holding timer procedures other true
water purifiers require
here to go can be used by one person or
multiple users with cleanable and
replaceable insert cartridges it can be
used over and over again for many years
and more importantly it can be stored
for long periods without the same danger
posed by filters how do we come up with
this design over nearly half a century
water one has provided ultra-pure water
to science and industry and premium
bottled drinking water to customers
throughout the world an industry
innovator we developed a proprietary
water purification mediafire robach that
kills bacteria and viruses on contact
and on demand so why is this different
pierre de goes insert cartridges provide
three tiers of filtration and
purification with a flow rate of up to
16 ounces per minute contaminated water
under ghost three separate filtration
and purification steps ensuring the
water is completely safe to drink with
no danger from any pathogens including
viruses the pier to go comes in too
convenient packages first the pier to go
travelers kit it fits in a small travel
pouch that takes up minimal space in any
suitcase or backpack inside comes a 27
ounce collapsible water bottle that
screws directly into the pier to go the
second package option is the pier to go
kit like the travelers kit it includes a
collapsible water bottle and a purifying
filter but also a lot more the go kit
also contains a two liter gravity feed
water bag a hand pump suitable for water
or air and lots of other accessories for
incredible versatility Perrigo can even
adapt in line with hydration backpacks
now we may not be the most well-known
producer of water purifier is yet but we
are confident that with appear to go we
have made the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world we invite you to join us on
our business journey to bring pure to go
to global markets and to continue our
research development and independent
testing whether it is the pier to go
travelers kit or a multifunctional pier
to go kit puter go is the only personal
water purifier you will ever need thank
you and safe travel the outdoors is not
just somewhere you pass through to get
from your apartment to work there is no
end to the adventures we can have if
only we seek them with our eyes wide
open we weren't meant to live and work
in a world of cramped spaces so cruel is
here to help
take me where
me
me
me
I'm here long
when you want to get outdoors planning
and searching ruin the moment so well
don't just grab your crew the hybrid is
a tent and a hammock plus we have
engineered and built in an insulated air
mattress and a customized sleeping bag
all in one meet the world's coolest and
most versatile shelter we haven't
sacrifice performance in any way to
incorporate these unique features quite
the opposite the crew a hybrid boasts
high quality design and craftsmanship
throughout and it has been tested by the
experts we listen to you and we have
developed your crew a hybrid accordingly
whether it's for a hike in the back
country or a lounge in the backyard the
hybrid will exceed your expectations
we're back on Kickstarter to once again
enhance your outdoor experience after
our successful campaign last year we
listened to you and we have designed the
crew bhai bread for you you can order
yours now right here we believed tents
should be better now they are it's
amazing to think that our journey began
in less than a year ago when a passion
for the outdoors and a love for people
converged in the simple idea of Kemet
mechanics the centerpiece of our brain
and it embodies the spirit of adventure
mechanics designed to go where no bad
has gone before as long as you have two
points in relatively close distance that
are capable of bearing your body weight
you can virtually kick back and your
kamik anywhere thanks to our
revolutionary new suspension straps KMX
are perfect for the urban artists
finding spiration while hanging out the
surfer who needs to break after
shredding some killer waves or the
college student wanting a comfortable
release from a long study session but
mainly we designed a camming with the
outdoor it says yes YKK is the leader
when it comes to producing plastic
components we want with our ultra
lightweight series for our buckles the
kamik paps is a water resistant
compression sack that doubles as a
utility pocket that can hold items like
your keys phone or water when you're in
your hammock when searching for
materials we weren't able to find a
fabric that met the standards that we
desired for accounting so working with
socially responsible manufacturers we
have developed the lunar white fabric
lunar waves is an incredibly strong yet
lightweight fabric that has a reinforced
diamond ripstop weed making it
incredibly tear resistant the fabric
briefs and let's go reasons in when it's
hot but keeps warmth in when it's chilly
we made it a priority to source the
strongest and lightest thread we could
find to reinforce the camming so you can
rest easy the high tensile strength poly
blended thread is sewn in a triple
stitched interlocking pattern which
allows thread fibers to get stronger as
your weight is applied the rope we chose
for the cam extend points is designed
for high break strength applications and
is UV mildew resistant we even went the
extra mile and developed a nano aluminum
wire gate carabiner for an easy
connection to the Python straps the
Python straps are 10 feet long tree
friendly daisy chains with 18 connecting
points allowing you to have complete
adjustability for getting the perfect
hang the Python straps are comprised of
polyester webbing they've bonded nylon
bartek stitches that are designed to
safely suspend your weight we spent the
last year designing and testing our
products sourcing the best materials and
building relationships with
manufacturers they can produce the
highest quality product we specifically
chose manufacturers that are passionate
we are about treating people and the
environment with reverence and respect
we can't believe it's possible to invent
revolutionary products while fostering a
culture that focuses on humanitarian aid
and good environmental stewardship
maintaining this balance creates an
environment where great ideas are
generated and people are valued to this
end web cammin are committed to giving
product people and profits
to nonprofit organizations around the
world our mission is to equip and
inspire for life-changing adventure join
us as we engage the adventure in
changing plans
