Wonderland and yet here we find fill
pools forgotten the combination of his
travel lock is the current solution to
that problem we live in an era filled
with technological marvels and yet this
is what happens when Phil forgets Allah
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you control with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
air ball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your life that's
fine the settings on this air ball
require me to went to a password into
the app or maybe your air bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air ball to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
phone or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man it's the Justice
the future deserves hi Bill hi tell them
what happened bill I lost my bag you
lost your we live in a world where I can
use my smartphone to model my sleeping

hi my name is dice and this is guy we
already found as of innovation in motion
the startup behind slide I came up with
the idea for slide when I was looking
for a solution to automate my curtains I
liked the idea of waking up the sunlight
and being able to leave my house without
exposing it to burglars existing
solutions I found were very complex
I'd have to install on this system with
special mounting mechanisms besides that
these systems were very expensive guy
and I are both excited about Smart Home
Solutions together we've developed a
slide the world's first retrofit smart
curtain system this light is not just
about automating the opening or closing
of your curtains it's about adding a
whole new set of functionalities you
didn't have before
many of these functionalities will be
available right from the slide app on
your phone but to unleash its full
potential were integrating slide into
the if distended platform through if'
triple T the possibilities are endless
including using a smart button like
flick and voice support for Google home
and Amazon echo installation of slide is
easy it only takes a few minutes and no
technical expertise is required once you
attach it either to the rod the rails or
curtains themselves you won't even
notice it's there anymore because it's
retrofit slide is designed to work in
virtually all existing horizontal
coordinate systems over the past two
years we have worked tirelessly to
create slide after more than 20
iterations of prototyping slide is now
ready for production but we need your
support to bring slide to the market
back us on Kickstarter today to be the
first to receive slide when it releases
at a sharply discounted rate slide a
simple stylish secure and sustainable
we're excited to see it change your
window on the world on behalf of Dyson

running no pounding of the joints just
this bionic chair an app and a wrap that
goes around your tights electronic
impulses stimulates the muscles to
exercise the uses of low levels be
prevented walking you can burn calories
at work maybe to slim down you can train
clean video games it's pretty good
project 54
and then peak levels my heart is beating
as fast as it can maintain this for an
hour and stop I tried to taxes calories
this was tough
it's well researched and proven we've
loved scientific publications we've even
tried it with European Space Agency in
zero-gravity
it works up there too that was fun hi
I'm Barry Broderick the nitronic
engineer responsible for bionic Jim's
physical device we have a working
prototype but before we go to market I
mean to shrink the size of electronic
components to make it ready for mass

the consumer ready we can only achieve
