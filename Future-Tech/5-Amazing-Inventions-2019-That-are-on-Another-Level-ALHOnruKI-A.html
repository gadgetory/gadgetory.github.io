thousands of years ago the sport of
skiing was invented and since then the
sport has been evolving 50 years ago
snowboards came bringing the joy of
surfing to the slopes today the ultimate
evolution of skiing has arrived
introducing snow feet the next
revolution in winter sports a
combination of skis and skates that
brings a thrill of skating to the slopes
they're essentially like ice skates for
the ski slopes snow feet attach right to
your winter shoes or snowboard boots so
all you do is step in strap on and take
off with these you can do anything you
would do with skis and so much more
impossible twist jumps and tricks use
them for downhill on and off the slopes
in snow parks through forest trails and
even for cross-country skiing snow feet
lets you do it all without all the heavy
and expensive equipment they are
lightweight and small enough to fit in a
backpack so you can take them anywhere
media outlets like fashionable and now
this uncrate and many others are already
raving about them they also called snow
feet the next big thing to hit the ski
slopes snow feet are made of highly
durable fiberglass reinforced material
they've got metal ski edges for quick
stopping a heel break for slowing down
adjustable bindings to attach to any
shoe and best of all one size fits all
we've already delivered thousands of
pairs of the first model to our
customers around the world and the
positive feedback has been overwhelming
so many people are excited about this
new winter sport it's going to take the
world by storm

Olympic sport we're ready to ship the
first 2,000 pairs to our supporters
