but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history
relaxing fast is his thing just look he
focuses on his breathing and he
progressively slows it down and by
slowing his breathing all the way down
to about six breaths a minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
role even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs
that's why we've designed dota it helps
you fall asleep by making you almost as
chill as a shrimp I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome dodo
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps to relieve your anxiety and so in
less than eight minutes you'll find
yourself ready to doze off
dodo won't turn you into a Buddhist monk
but it will help you fall asleep faster
and that's probably all you need this is
the world's first double wall and slate
a cycling bottle this innovative bottle
is engineered to fit most standard
bottle cages on the market its 18:8
stainless steel construction and vacuum
insulation is best in class best of all
it only asked the weight of a spare tube
compared to a cheap plastic bottle it
comes standard with two lip
configurations the stroller will allow
you to drink without tilting your head
back allowing you to keep your eyes on
the road the simple it lets you enjoy
warm beverages in those chilly mornings
cold beverages will stay cold for two
days and warm beverages will stay warm
up to a full day this is perfect for
commuters mountain bikers and even road
cyclists who appreciates an ice-cold
drink during and after a long ride we
are launching this project with two auto
finishes version one with exposed
stainless finish for a classic look
version two with a black powder-coated
finish
to add texture for a better grip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
