we rely heavily on technology to keep us
connected and productive in our daily
lives and a dead phone battery could be
costly the you volt watch is our way of
solving this problem in a way that also
helps preserve the environment the watch
is equipped with a solar panel that
passively captures energy from the Sun
that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watch's power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day
low battery just pull out the power
reserve from the watch and start
charging your mobile device we are also
including a wireless charging dock if
you need to start your day with a full
charge simply place the watch on the
dock and a fully charged in under 45
minutes to save energy the dock only
uses power when a device is placed on it
and automatically turns off when it
reaches full charge the power aim with
the u volt watch was to create a simple
yet highly functional object it's
minimal lines and analog interface makes
it an easy fit for any wardrobe it is
meant to be a comfortable and personal
everyday companion that supports our
values as well as our mobile lives we
chose a mechanical watch instead of
digital because it would draw less power
while providing precise time the watch
hands have a minimal width to maximize
the performance of the solar panel which
covers the entire face of the watch it
is also covered with a thin sheet of
anti reflective mineral glass to further
enhance the solar capacity the power
reserve combines a custom circuit that
handles the electrical flow of the watch
with a high density lithium ion battery
the reserve has an integrated Lightning
port for Apple devices or microUSB B and
C for Android devices it could even go
entirely wireless the charging wire
stays inside the power reserve so it's
virtually impossible to forget or
at the bottom sits the wireless receiver
for inductive charging through the
included dock it all fits in a durable
aluminum body and on top of that we
filled the band with batteries to add
more capacity allowing a second charge
after the power reserve has been used to
achieve this addition we developed a
custom hinge that lets current go back
and forth within the body of the you
volt watch today we need your support to
bring this project to life and together
step into a sustainable I'm Johannes I'm
a creative technologist from Berlin I
always had a passion for music I was
teaching for a couple of years with
vinyl and then with digital tools as
well
so I wanted to go out of the computer I
wanted to go away from screen like I
want to enable people to make music and
this hands-on fashion the ultimate is a
controller to control motors like to
bang on stuff or to control acoustic
instruments with MIDI signals
you can simply plug in your iPhone or
iPad or MIDI sequencer or keyboard or a
laptop and then you can hook up to 12
motors and play on objects or like
acoustic instrument and make crazy sound
the tool kit comes with everything you
need so the motors are included the
mounting stuff is included to have
everything to get started to create
music machines you can basically use
everything to create sound together with
the toolkit you can use your club multi
bottle your beer bottle you can use what
you find in your basement and then
there's adapters like for microphone
stands to play your drum kit so you have
ready to go to a kid for trayvion
percussive sounds my comedy demands on
theater kind meant the theater of the
London from the Amish beard began notice
comes Allison elementor's for the techno
track 20 artists took diversity team
passes from eight years
we are using the other machines because
it brings in a very new sound aesthetics
it's a nice combination of robots
playing acoustic instruments in a very
special and unique way
we are production-ready we found the
right partners to manufacture here in
Germany it's ready to be out there so if
you want to create awesome sound in an
analogue fashion please help and back to
project now the average office prays for
work and creation but in recent years a
new hazardous phenomenon has arisen it
is known as the screen slouched this is
a screen sloucher look at him slouching
in front of a screen here is the female
screen sloucher slouching in front of a
much smaller screen the slouching makes
her appearance less confident her back
aches every day for 8 to 12 hours
slouching is an inherent part of the
office habitat this is upright girl a
small wearable that helps the slouches
become upright it is the simplest way to
improve your posture just stick it on
your back and press the button that's it
a bright would vibrate everytime slouch
look at the effect it has on the screen
slouches such a smile has not been seen
on their faces for a long time since
upright go sits directly on the back it
is the only device that truly senses the
back it's also the only posture trainer
that works no matter what you're doing
sitting standing or walking oh look one
of the screens slouches has disguise
that if you press the button once more
up right go switches to tracking mode a
mode that doesn't vibrate when you
slouch but still keeps all your daily
posture data in the upright app
incredible to conclude our research we
returned to the office two weeks later
the results were astonishing after two
weeks being upright became second nature
here is one sloucher two weeks ago and
here he is now see how much more
confident and better looking he appears
notice also how he doesn't suffer from
back pains
oh we're in luck it seems the male ex
sloucher finally feels confident enough
to approach the female ex sloucher
exciting so if you two wish to stop
being a screen sloucher get up right go
incredible how in only two week oh dear
we've been spotted abort abort
communication is beautiful
it keeps us together
it brings us close it is the key element
of love but although we can find it
almost anywhere it hardly exists on the
roads driving and communicating at the
same time is almost impossible how many
times have we wanted to say please let
me merge
or please lower your lights
or thank you for waiting
what if we could tap our finger to
deliver our message
introducing auto top
a digital sign that shows anything we
wish to say by a touch of our finger
it can easily be installed on any car
window and program to display our own
list of messages from our smartphone
pour from a special remote control we
can add or delete messages based on our
need
with support for different languages and
even emojis we can use it for our safety
for our assistance or just for fun Auto
talk is based on LED lighting technology
to ensure that our message will be seen
in any time of the day and in any
weather conditions
it's a beautiful and simple way to greet
the world and to let the world greet us
back we see communication devices
everywhere these days people are more
connected than ever by inventing on a
talk we wish to connect the roads to
this new age of communication after six
months of development we finally have a
functioning prototype our goal now is to
complete design and bring the product to
consumer level and we can't do that
without your help help us bring
communication to the road
imagine how we interact with the world
but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letter Surat your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures through different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only feel but
also manipulate things in a versatile
way the current smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constraint the interactive areas of our
hands Vela works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad unlike other
devices Vela gives you tracking and
multiple text to action features so you
are not limited to just one action but
if different patterns to assign for
different actions it is super easy to
use and really works for everyone if you
are a developer you can try new ideas
and figure out different customized
applications with our well-designed API
to track the human gestures Vela uses a
special sonar technology that is
nowadays widely used in military cars
and drones it transmits signal pulses
collects the reflective energy from your
finger and then translates it into the
performed action our team has been
focused on sensing techniques for coming
we are passionate about making tours
which are just human needs by amplifying
human capabilities turning any surface
around you into a remote control enables
many potential possibilities in our
daily lives we have been seeing lots of
products in the market but we have not
found any of them capable to track and
to recognize with high probability with
Wella attracts your finger with the
finest precision and transform it into
customized action
Weller brings magic to your daily life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
