motor
it looks ways and costs pretty much the
same as a regular push bike except it
uses an electric motor to assist the
puddling making moving to cities easier
safer and way more fun
the average daily trip is less than 20
miles so we built on a mile a bike we
use a compact battery and a lightweight
moisture to create an e-bike that weighs
just 13.5 kilos it doubles your power
with only a negligible increase in
weight for a regular push bike you think
the battery pack is just gonna make it
super heavy but you can pick it up with
just like one hand it looks like a noble
back
you don't bulky or anything so here's
how it works
clip the battery and turn it on and ride
just like a bike if you want to go
faster turn it up if you want more of a
challenge turn it off and the am one
rides like a normal single speed bike
when you arrive simply take the battery
with you and plug it in like a phone to
recharge it and if you need more range
just take another battery with you and
add another 20 miles for the first time
ever you can buy an electric bike at the
price of a regular city bikes each a.m.
one is flat packed in the factory and
reassemble by you and because 90% of the
bike parts are standard this allows for
unlimited customization using readily
available parts found in your local bike
store we have a combined experience over
a decade of designing and delivering
products to consumers we've spent the
last four years signing prototyping and
testing the m1 to ensure that it's
reliable robust and works in any weather
to make sure the m1 is of the highest
quality we've worked with multiple
factories around the world to select the
perfect manufacturing partner and now
we're ready to manufacture and ship the
a m1 around the world
the m1 is the first affordable
lightweight electric bike garden join us
and be the first to own one
I wish that I had a well-designed
container that wasn't an eyesore to keep
my bikes it's awkward storing the bike
it's greasy and falls over it gets
rained on it rusts so I designed a
container a sculpture really to house
and protect the bike it's circular
design offers protection from the
elements from damage and theft you can
secure it to any surface structure or
even the bed of your truck it's quite
satisfying to open the capsule it's
almost like a blooming flower
this is bike storage for the enthusiast
finally a proper home for your bike the
only way to get it is through our
website Alban storage comm join our
community and order your Alpen bike
capsule today hi Kickstarter my name is
nicko classic and I'm a founder of like
life I have a passion for bicycles and
technologies for many years now after
introducing the first line of electric
bicycles in United States we got a lot
of ideas how to make an electric
bicycles more simple and accessible we
decided to turn ordinary bike into a
smart bike and after working closely
with a team we have a working prototype
ready earlier this year fly climb smart
wheel is an all-in-one design pedal
assist that means it has the motor the
battery and all the electronics inside
the rear wheel it's a pedal assist
because the motor turns on when you
start pedaling and it makes the riding
effortless this way you can always dress
for the destination not for the ride and
never worry about sweating
you simply control the smartwheel with
your smartphone by setting up the top
speed on your flight line app with
speeds up to 20 miles per hour it takes
you as far as 30 miles not only does it
help you climb the steep hills but it
also recharges itself when you're riding
downhill you can also plug it in a wall
socket and fully recharge it in just two
to three hours when you leave your bike
behind you you can simply lock it with a
touch of a button on the app and in case
it still gets stolen the app sends you a
short message saying your bike is moving
without you and even lets you track your
bike with GPS included with the smart
wheel is our smart light it's not only a
light but also phone holder and the
charger so your folder will never run
out of battery again the sticky pad and
additional safety straps from the smart
light tightly and securely hold your
smartphone in place because it's smart
smart wheel lowers your cycling habits
and routines and uses this knowledge to
suggest faster safer and more fun routes
to take you can even create your own
favorite routes and share them with your
friends
the flight app constantly monitors the
smartphone's components and
functionality in case anything happens
to go wrong we're already a step ahead
at suggesting a solution this way
we can offer you the quickest and most
efficient support in all of the
electronic components are firmly
installed on the motor itself and
encased in a robust housing a separate
housing holds the battery and the two
combine to make the whole package that
is neatly fitted onto the spokes of the
wheel frame but an easy to mount access
going through smart wheel is designed to
fit on any bicycle frame it also comes
in eight different colors smart wheels
iOS Android and pebble wash compatible
we worked really hard for the last
couple of years and combined knowledge
of a group of young and enthusiastic
engineers software developers designers
and bicycle culture researchers to
create smart wheel is easy to use
affordable and efficient as possible
we're a team of co-working friends and
big supporters of utilitarian bicycle
culture we want to make cities more
livable and want to make them more
people not car friendly and that's why
we need your help we need to raise these
funds to invest in tools and equipment
to play some Bach holders and last but
not least to produce smart wheel locally
in New York please help us by pledging
