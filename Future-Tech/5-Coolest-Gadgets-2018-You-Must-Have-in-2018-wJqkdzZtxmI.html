here are seven pool shots you can do
with the moviemaker the first shot is
the basic panorama time-lapse now a
really simple way to make any time like
shot more dynamic is by adding some
movement with the camera
so simply attach your smartphone GoPro a
compact camera to the motorized head of
the slider and you're ready to go set
the speed of the motor to three for some
really slow silky smooth shots the
second shot is what we call the
staircase shot now another way to make a
shot more dramatic and cinematic is to
have a very distinctive background
mid-ground and foreground the more
movement you can get into the different
grounds the better the effect here we
place the moviemaker onto the staircase
to achieve this effect the next shot is
the reveal shot this is probably the
easiest but the most cinematic shot in
this list set up your moviemaker so it's
right behind an object that's blocking
say some beautiful scenery then refocus
and use the exposure lock set the movie
maker to manual mode and manually push
the head next up we have macro shots
when you're shooting close-up on a
product or object the slightest camera
movement will be exaggerated and
emphasized so this makes the movie maker
incredibly useful for getting smoother
and more cinematic movements the fifth
shot is the crane shot because the
moviemakers slider is so portable and
light you can attach it vertically to a
tripod for crane light shots shots that
are otherwise impossible to get this
could come in handy when you're again
doing cinematic shots or product or in
short films where you want to place
emphasis on an important object the
sixth shot is a standard yet classic
slider shot slow smooth motion
the final seven shot is the inverted
shot here we put the movie make a slider
and phone upside down so you can get
really close to the foreground and at
the same time gradually rise vertically
so there you go seven simple cinematic
and fun shots you can take with the
moviemaker
you can take these shots even further
with the iMovie app on your iPhone or an
equivalent on your Android phone or even
on your computer so remember the movie
maker will go wherever you go so let's
get out there guys and start shooting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
