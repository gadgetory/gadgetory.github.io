living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights - face it
we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find fill
pools forgotten the combination of his
travel lock is the current solution to
that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lot
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts has a
travel lock you control it with your
smartphone it's a lot the future
deserves a lock with customizable
security settings this airball opens
whenever my phone is within Bluetooth
range well maybe you don't trust anyone
in your lives that's fine the settings
on this airball require me to enter a
password into the app well maybe you're
a bolts been solar that's fine too
because you can sit your air bomb to
activate an alarm when it moves too far
away from your phone's or you can
activate the alarm manually stop that
man it's the justice the future deserves
hi Bill I tell them what happened bill I
lost my back you lost your we live in a
world where I can use my smartphone to
one of my sleeping patterns but bill
here can't find his bag if bill have
been using the air bolt instead of some
antique you could have located it using
the air box Kraus or CBS network or if
you lose your phone well you can still
unlock your air ball by logging in from
another device well you can enter our
backup button code using your hand like
some kind of prehistoric man
the airport has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's TSA approved so airport security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your Airport you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends

it's designed to completely simplify the
safe storage of your photos and videos
two years ago I lost a whole month of
baby footage of my new bundle we lose
and break our phones all the time yet
most of us hardly ever backup her photos
as much as we should and even if we do
they end up scattered across folders
hard drives and devices making it
difficult to find that one special
moment our team came together with one
clear mission to change the way we think
about preserving
experiencing and sharing our favorite
memories we also wanted to create
something that's affordable and easy
anyone we'd beat cloud storage companies
we're handing out all our memories to
them and paying them monthly they
routinely scan our photos analyze them
and sell that information to the bodies
we capsule your photos videos everything
lives in your home totally private
we set out to design a product solely
for people and the families capsule is a
smart little device for home that backs
up and organizes all your photos and
videos so you can always find the
perfect memory with just a few taps we
design capsule to be as simple as
possible you plug it in and it literally
just works in the background when you
take a photo outside it automatically
backs up to your capsule in your home
instantly well to save mobile data just
set capsule to Alice only any will
backup photos only when you're on your
home Wi-Fi once the photos and video is
already in your capsule it arranges them
by people events location and dates
capsule also automatically generates
albums and slideshows for you
empowering you to keep all your favorite
moments and memories safe in one place
and when you can't always be there
capsule smartly shares your favorite
memories with your family capsule works

videos are available on your devices

anyway capsule protects your family
memories backs up your photography and
frees up space on your phone forever
convenience and security of your data

we've been perfecting capsule for two
years the software works and we've
already lined up supplies for mass
production we just need your support to
cover tooling and manufacturing costs so
that we can bring capsule to you we want
to make it easy for everyone to relive
their favorite memories to keep their
special moments safe in doorways within
reach help make have show a reality
reserve a capsule for you and your
family
hello my name is Peter rudder and this
is the client model the Klein bottle was
designed for noise makers soundscape
artists endless tinker's
and tone Wizards this epic pedal starts
by splitting the input signals into
three effects loops and each effects
loop has dedicated controls for pregame
bandwidth filters and main mix level and
this allows you to send different parts
of the signal to different effects and
blend them all back together to create
new tones out of your existing pedals
but wait there's more the magic happens
when you use the independent feedback
controls to send the signal from what
effects loop into another and then back
again keep your existing tone intact
with the dry knob while layering a
cornucopia of sonic goodness on top I'm
not only the owner of vfe pedals but
also a full time teacher at idea high
school in Tacoma Washington idea stands
for industrial design engineering and
art idea is an innovative public school
that teaches real-world hands-on skills
through project-based learning as part
of the EFI's partnership with idea high
school I am working with students to
plan out this Kickstarter campaign even
this video has been planned chopped and
edited by an idea student this
Kickstarter will help buy students
experience and learn the many facets of
entrepreneurship without your support
the Klein bottle won't go into
production but even more importantly
I'll have to cut back on the number of
paid internship opportunities I'll be
able to offer my students next school
year
check out the demos and the many rewards
below you can help us by sharing on
social media and with every musician you
know thank you
pelvis ticks always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six even ten feet high on but also take
any where you want to go the v4 is the
portable trampoline we've always dreamed
up with the v4 you have the ability to
add or remove air and completely change
the stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact v4 as someone who only weighs 80
pounds all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately
it's a killer cardio workout and the
best part is that while you're having
fun bouncing around you won't even
realize how quickly you build a sweat in
order to achieve superior build quality
and maintain the high tolerance is
necessary for the v4 to work we
manufacture and assemble it right here
in our Southern California shop we work
closely with our suppliers to become a
part of the build process and as each
component is made or right there to test
them
this streamlines our manufacturing and
ensures that every before we make is up
to our standards if you're looking for
the portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks racine forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
