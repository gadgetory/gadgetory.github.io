and any outdoor activity hydration is
absolutely critical we are excited to
introduce the most innovative hydration
product of the year and our
patent-pending solution to this problem
about door hydration infuse infuse is an
easy to use inline flavoring system that
attaches to the end of any existing
hydration pack without any sort of
cutting or damage you can drink pure
water or switch to electrolytes and
flavor with the turn of a dial the way
infuse works is by our patented venturi
and rolling seal design when suction is
applied the diaphragm pulls forward at
the same time this rolls the seals away
from the pork and infuses your water
with a perfect mix of flavor as soon as
you release suction the diaphragm snaps
shut and the seal roll back in place not
to mention that you can change the
cartridges at any time they are 100%
refillable with any water enhancer you
already love with infuse there's no
cleanup no flavor staining just flavor
and electrolytes or water exactly how
and when you want
you
