performance with 4k sixty 1080p 240
video you're gonna get this really
buttery smooth slow motion that doesn't
drop a frame every aspect of the shot is
that much more brilliant that much more
lifelike and when you combine it with
quick stories the experience is unlike
anything before quick stories is a way
to go from capturing a great experience
to the story that you can share your
GoPro will automatically copy any new
photos and videos over to your phone
where the GoPro app will edit that into
a video for you hero six is our smartest
camera yet we have algorithms for faces
and audio accelerometers GPS and we're
able to take that data and pull them
into your edit so we can create the most
compelling story for you
when you're able to capture something
and slow it down it really allows you to
appreciate the moment what was the water
doing what were you doing life happens
fast and using a GoPro helps you capture
your life slow it down and see it in a
whole new way hero six the stabilization
is far beyond anything we've ever
accomplished to go Piro six can analyze
your footage and then adjust the
stabilization to take out any of the
shake take out the roll and really make
it look like your GoPro is mounted on a
stabilizer people are using their GoPros
to film everything and you can't always
get close to the action and now with
hero 6 in the built-in touch zoom
capability you can with hero 6 you're
getting more voice commands you're going
to get this hands-free fluid experience

360-degree camera
about skydiving

social media apps well without here is
called a tortoise you can also do
360-degree time-lapse and I'm using the
app to adjust it for communicating
delicious it's very good
introducing alpha and alpha s the first
wearable camera that provides a shutter
wheel to control the shutter speed
allowing you to set it up to 1 mm of a
second for 32 seconds freely if you

world's smallest 4k camera the rotatable
screen module allows you to find the
best filming angle and double the
battery life the spare battery that
simply snaps on magnetically can extend
your battery life to 4 hours for video
filming now alpha brings more surprises

mocha can alpha s has an umbrella Image
Processor

1080p 120 frames per second video
features it means you can get 1/5 speed
full HD slow motion video Hussain -
GoPro Hero 5 with the 1.5 5 micrometers
Sony image sensor the low-light
performance has been significantly
improved in addition the Wi-Fi alpha
provides Bluetooth connection which is
more stable and consumes less power they
can turn your phone into a Bluetooth
remote and get GPS information for
geo-tagging or show the trajectory with
the built in G sensor alpha can get
better image stabilization on video
recording alpha has dual status lights
so even if there's no screen module it
can show the camera status clearly the
dual mic system provides stereo
recording capability
alpha uses a type C port to connect the
camera and screen the micro HDMI port
provides a new preview and playback mode
now it's the totally new feature and
most important part the shutter wheel
with the new design buttons in manual
mode you can turn the shutter wheel to
set the shutter speed freely up to 1 mm
of a second or 32 seconds in other words
you can now use multicam shooting long
exposure night pics or even the stars
what's more after applying all these
great features alpha is 20% smaller than
the previous generation and 35 percent
smaller than GoPro Hero 5 we're also
able to offer two options this time
alpha and alpha s alpha uses the same
image processor - mocha cam the
framerate is similar to gopro hero4 and
provides all the other features of alpha
s
so please order a mocha cam today and
share it with your friends help us to
make it a reality
hi my name is Eric I'm a passionate kite
surfer engineer and the CEO of Revell
the Revell Arc is the world's smartest
4k action camera
so why is our cameras so smart well
we've built in four different sensors
into this camera that measure elevation
rotation speed magnetic north as well as
other motion to limit trees
we use it for electronic image
stabilization which takes out all the
bumps and jitters from your video but
beyond that we've built in a secondary
stabilization system which has a motor
built into the back of the camera which
keeps it always level to the horizon no
matter what you're doing including if
you mount the camera on a hubcap of back
think of it as a gimbal a camera and
more combined into one compact camera
which is waterproof and you can mount
anywhere you're not going to mount this
anywhere this means you can kite loop
barrel roll and even backflip while the
rebel art keeps your footage stable and
level to the horizon this has never been
possible before with any other camera or
a gimbal system so what else do we do
with all this information we capture all
kinds of live data including how fast
you were going
how much airtime you got even how many
g-forces you pulled on top of all that
you can connect external sensors like a
heart rate monitor to measure your
excitement when things get a little
crazy
the final piece of the puzzle is our
sensory AI which analyzes the data
associated with your footage and makes
intelligent decisions it then determines
your most exciting moments and
automatically creates a shareable video
without hours of physical editing or
even a computer at revel we believe that
life was made for adventuring not
editing we want to make it as easy as
possible for you to shoot edit and share
your best moments instantly we can't
wait to see what you will be able to
create with the Revel art thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
