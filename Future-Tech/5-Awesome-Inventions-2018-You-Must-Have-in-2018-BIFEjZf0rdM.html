struggles of a traditional keyboard
that's why we set out to find a solution
after much brainstorming and product
design we finally came up with this
the deluxe designer a specialized
keyboard with mechanical switches
crafted out of aluminum with a premium
finish the deluxe designer is
customizable keyboard makes designing a
breeze it's the perfect tool to assist
any designer this product is truly
amazing with that I can set up my own
shortcuts to whatever I want so when I
have multiple projects going on at the
same time and I need to do different
tasks for all the different projects I
can set up command sequences with and
with a single push of a button it does
it for me saving me so much more time
now so especially when I'm doing
repetitive work is the less designer is
the deluxe designer comes with a
multi-function dollars it is compatible
with nine major design software's and
this dial makes design
seamlessly zoom in and out choose
between colors switch pages and focus in
and on different elements with the
deluxe designer what the dial cons is
remarkable I can do so much without to
have to lift my hand part of the
keyboard I can use it to scroll up/down
zoom in zoom out switch between layers
change colors almost anything it has
really made the design process a lot the
deluxe designer is also compatible Wacha
making it extremely convenient when
drawing seamlessly change paint brush
sizes or Swift from 10 to eraser
designing has never been easy
we know designers everywhere are in need
of a single tool that can streamline
work and boost work efficiency we love
the deluxe designer and we know you will
to help us bring this project to life
this is linked it connects two or more
people together so they can find each
other
it's a simple one-button interface
just pair two or more devices
and then follow the arrow and distance
right to your people
that's it all without the need for
phones maps connectivity or
subscriptions have you ever been lost or
separated from your group then unsure at
a fork in the road anxiously waited for
your group to return struggle to
describe where you are
turned around in a crowded place and
your child is gone but link is as much
for fun as it is for safety
find your friends at music festivals
stay together in large crowds reunite
easily on ski trips
allow your kids to explore with more
peace of mind
or simply enjoy your outdoor activities
with more confidence link uses a new
approach to GPS and has arranged between
devices of up to three months
scroll through groups of up to 12 user
interface that's simple enough for a
young child to use length lasts up to
three days without recharging and its
built-in clip allows you to attach the
device to your clothes gear or even pets
engineered to endure the harshest
environments from snowy descents the
young kids link is more than a people
compass you can set meetup locations
that everyone in your group can easily
find and return to a safe zone feature
alert you when anyone strays outside the
boundary that you choose it's great for
kids and pets
no more worrying wandering or waiting
around link will find your people when
nothing else will a lot of the most
meaningful photographs come from
traveling to places that people have
never experienced before in the effort
that goes into capturing that moment for
people enjoy those are the moments that
I live for those moments are rarely
captured into the best conditions
adding Riverbanks to my gear kit enables
me to go further off the grid and handle
any situation
Riverbanks is the first module portable
power solution of its kind the main
module has two USB C and two USB a ports
in the supports wireless charging
there's also an LED screen that shows
you how much battery life you have left
how much power your devices are drawing
and what ports are using the AC module
has a standard 110 volt AC port and can
be connected to the main module to
increase my overall power capacity the
versatility of combining both modules
allows me to create a portable
workstation wherever I can charge my
laptop 4 x camera batteries 18 to 20
times and phone 18 to 30 times even when
I'm all out of courts of my laptop I can
use riverbank as an USB hub to transfer
photos from my sd card to my computer
the card jumpstarter module could
jumpstart my car up to 10 times in one
charge and also adds power capacity when
stacked with the riverbank main module
and this thing keeps me on the road and
on time for the next shoot all three
modules are less than 100 watt hours
each this makes riverbank the largest
capacity power station you can legally
fly with the riverbank can be used to
power the whole team during a meeting
if you power my laptop and busy coffee
shops where wall outlets aren't
accessible and the extra adapter tips
make riverbanks compatible with most
laptop models and I can recharge it with
eco flows portable solar panels when I'm
outside so I still have to use to power
my barbecues with friends at the end of
the day wherever I am in the world
riverbank eg powered and connected so I
never miss a moment
gah solution nice to meet you another
pipe you can have done
