hi my name is Jessica founder of talk
tech I went to my parents place one day
and saw a note on the door that says
turn off stove it's a note they look for
themselves this got me thinking there

came up with the idea of smartphones

over 20 years of experience in wireless
product development we went through many
revisions of the design making sure that
the product is easy to use reliable and
does not require any change of behaviour
from users now we need your help to
bring this product to market to benefit
millions of people please help us to

you
welcome to vollrath University I'm chef
rich and today we're here to talk to you
about the red coat five-pointer unit
this manual processor can do a multitude
of different things it's probably our
most versatile piece because with this
piece you can dice slice wedge and core
so frightened was like peppers onions
zucchini soft vegetables like squash and
cucumber celery diced and sliced very
accurately okay that consistent result
each and every time then fry times like
lemons and limes and apples and oranges
pears you know there we can do the
wedging and coring if we want to core
that product as well so with this one
piece of equipment we can perform all
these different tasks the blade changing
out on this unit as I said we've got
these four different blades very simply
to change them out on the back we want
to just loosen up this nut pop out the
blade assembly and it's that easy notice
the blade assembly thermoset plastic the
blades are permanently attached so
there's any screws or blades to attach
to this and it's dishwasher safe again
very easy to replace blades in the
five-point oil unit and then how about
this last feature I want to point out to
you hear a six inch deep sixed size food
pan slides right underneath the unit so
when we're prepping product right into
the pan how convenient is that our
competitors you can't do that with talk
about the construction notice this unit
is diecast nice smooth finish easy to
clean some of the sand cast units out
there a little bit bumpier finish not as
easy to clean the sled design on the leg
okay that's for strength if we were to
drop this unit these are always going to
stay straight so you won't get that
wobble much more sturdy design and even
the uprights much easier to replace
should you ever need to replace these
let's say the unit gets dropped in these
get bent on the bottom there's simply a
nut you loosen it out change out the
upright tighten it back up our
competitors you have to tap out a little
pressure pin and that's not always so
easy to do take my word for it so that's
the red kool five-point oh let me show
you how this unit works
well so after cutting all these fruits
and vegetables the slide rods are made
smooth if they should ever get little
tacky or gummy never vegetable oil we
recommend petrol gel it's a product we
sell a little bit on each one right back
to normal so there you have it the
five-point oh what a versatile piece of
equipment it is remember we dice we can
slice we can wedge and we can core all
from this one piece of equipment okay
remember this is speed much faster we
can do with a knife or any other
traditional means savings of labor we
can have those less experienced workers
provide these consistent results each
and every time and also take advantage
of locally grown sourced fruits and
vegetables okay Organic much better
processed here on site versus somewhere
else with they have to use chemicals
prevent the oxidation remember my dad
always said fresh is best should you
have any problems with these products
remember all the red co-products full
two year warranty and the support of the
vollrath technical support team you
