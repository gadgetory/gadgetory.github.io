never miss another update hey everybody
my name is James Amburgey I'm marketing
director at bio bidet at bio bidet we're
really focused on offering products that
enhance the beauty and function of your
home after the success of our first
Kickstarter campaign America proved that
it was ready to move towards a cleaner
healthier lifestyle an alternative to
toilet paper we got a lot of feedback
during that time and we heard things
like what if I don't have an outlet in
my bathroom or what about a non electric
version it's been eight months and I'm
excited to announce the latest bio the
day project introducing the slim zero
you get a lot of great features with
this product you get a dual nozzle you
get adjustable water pressure soft
closing seat soft closing lid and best
of all something that we've newly
developed a battery-operated nightlight

we hear all the time from new customers
I didn't know a product like this exists

to design a product that was for
everyone for every home simple easy to
use with plenty of features you don't
need to call a plumber you don't need to
call an electrician fifteen minutes
later with a quick easy DIY install
you're done so the great thing about the
slim zero and the dual nozzles is that
you get our effective posterior wash and
then you also have the option for a
softer front feminine wash one of the
things I'm most excited about with this
project is the high and low stage
nightlight you've got two different
brightnesses to choose from so it gives
you that additional flexibility for a
night time you don't have to worry about
you know having a bright light on or
keeping your partner up or keeping
yourself up
it gives you options it gives you
flexibility it comes with everything you
need to get the product installed we've
got a user manual plus we have resources
like our service team is happy to help
if you call in or we also have videos
that you can watch complete installation

been offering these products the entire
