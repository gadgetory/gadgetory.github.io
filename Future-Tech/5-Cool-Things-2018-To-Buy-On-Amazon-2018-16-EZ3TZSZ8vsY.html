very own device for storage and charging

epic day out a bonafide selfie time as
they say just need to squeeze a teeny
bit no oh oh never mind ah more

outside on a sunny day with lots of
friends let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
air selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they'd
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control air
selfie through the app by holding the
phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos and what
would have happened at the barbecue
enough with the squeezing
just select the selfie mode use only two
buttons to find the right distance to
shoot and take a great picture what
about an indoor location whatever it may
be a party at somebody's house for a
night out in a club there are no issues
there selfie fly's easily it's simple to
control and very safe and once you shoot
a great picture don't keep it to
yourself it's so easy to share it right
from your phone as easy as grabbing the
air selfie safely while it's still
