exploring online is a key part of
kid these days but as parents we need to
set limits sometimes we want our kids to
simply unplug and play outside what if
you could set those limits with the push
of a button on your phone what if you
could do this from any location like
from your desk at work now you can

button for your kids Wi-Fi the ryfi
plugs into your current internet
creating a second network just for your

their own internet separate from yours

order yours today to create new content
for yato hi I'm Ben and I'm thrilled to
introduce you yato a clever speaker for
kids
yato gives your children access to
wonderful music stories and learning
that grows and adapts over time kids get
to choose what they listen to using
physical cards which means fewer
distractions from screens and phones and
more family time together
inspired by Montessori philosophy kids
control yato with physical cards and can
listen to their favorite music and
stories as well as the best children's
podcasts and radio from around the world
yato can help fire their imagination for
learning and language with games they
love to play
yato includes loads of content out of
the box and with new cards coming out
all the time
yato can grow with your children and not
become another discarded toy parents can
even upload their own content and create
personalized cards for all the family
yato accesses a curated library of safe
age-appropriate content selected by a
team of editors and parents can use the
yato parents app to order new cards set
sleep times and to turn yato
on and off from a monster point of view
I think it's absolutely fantastic piece
of equipment because it gives a child
the freedom which promotes the
independence it gives them freedom to
choose what they want to play and when
they want to play it so we tested an
early prototype and the least favorite
part was this you could just listen to
the music whenever she wanted to after
couple of days Lily wanted to bring it
to her room and you loved it the new to
create yato we've assembled a team of
experts from the worlds of music and
publishing as well as product design and
manufacturing and we're working with
leading educational institutions and
renowned authors and artists to build a
great library of content yato is
designed by families for families and
we've been testing in homes for over two
years it's all of the good things about
Internet content where none of the bad
stuff like addictive screens or dubious
tube videos it's fun but it's also
educational and inspirational it's about
giving our kids the best start in life
now we need your help to bring yato to
families everywhere so please back our
campaign on Kickstarter it's amazing how
we take our vision for granted yet our
eyes are one of our most precious senses
