phone we all know the frustration of
using multiple SIM cards been there done
that
it's annoying and time-consuming to
change SIM cards when traveling or when
switching between business and personal
modes imagine having an extra SIM slot
always available sim Pro is a sim card
adapter that easily connects to your
smart devices via bluetooth once the
device is connected to your phone you
can take advantage of a second SIM card
slot to change between cards seamlessly
be it for data calls or just switching
numbers anywhere at any time
sim pro is the one solution that is
changing how we use our smart phones
synchro is essential if you have to
carry two phones with sim pro too bulky
phones become one after having
downloaded the sim pro app you can now
easily shift between sim cards using
only one device and you can even record
your phone conversation with the app
with simple everything becomes simpler
and more organized
there are many cases that prove the
convenience of using simple use theta
and switch between your devices with
simpler whenever and wherever
I need just 20 seconds to your time this
is the eye pockit drive what does it do
I'll tell ya so usually people use cable
or the internet or the cloud to transfer
their files I don't trust the cloud with
my personal information so I use the eye
pockit Drive and this is why I can plug
this directly into my iPhone iPad and
computer and transfer the files from
that device to whatever device I want to
the streaming for this is immediate I
can watch video files they play right
off of that I pocket drive and it works
completely from there okay so I may have
lied about that 20 seconds
but hey you're interested now so let's
continue using the eye pockit Drive you
can stream all your music right off the
drive you can even export your own
contacts onto the drive and have them
accessible on any device you use all
right now that's pretty amazing but the
coolest thing about the eye pockit drive
is it's completely portable you can take
this anywhere you go planes trains buses
and even the middle of the desert the
eye pockit drive small useful and
portable hi I'm Jean with the power
company since January I've run two
successful campaigns on IndieGoGo and
now I'm releasing my third one for the
eye pockit drive I developed this with a
partner company over in China currently
the only way to move files from an iPad
or an iPhone to a PC or a Mac is through
the cloud or the internet I don't
believe in the security of the cloud
that's why we've created this product
you can transfer files directly onto
this as a hard drive and even backup
files from your PC and Mac and keep them
on you that way they're safe and secure
as two reasons we're running this
campaign one for inventory and to prefer
the development of the app currently the
app is done but there are many more
functions that we can add to the
hi my name is Joseph and my name is alia
and we are from Sweden we're really
happy to bring you the world's first
wearable private cloud
we are from being shipping in Sweden
Northern Europe Silicon Valley the
public cloud gives you the convenience
to access your files online from any
device but it has major security issues
local storage works securely offline but
it lacks sex disability and smartness of
the cloud we have created an entirely
new type of storage device that gives
you the smartness and convenience of the
online cloud and the security of local
storage thoria files locally are reball
and get all the benefits of the cloud
offline such as auto backup of documents
music and context and the ability to
synchronize them across your devices on
top of that we've also added media
streaming two-factor authentication
encryption notifications and a custom
API all in all you get a smarter faster
and more secure storage solution the
wearable private cloud comes in the
sizes of 32 and 128 gigabytes revolt has
up to three days of battery life
communicates with your pair devices you
see Wi-Fi and Bluetooth our
user-friendly app gives you full control
of connected devices as well as the
files stored in your wearable private
cloud stream your music and video on the
go without an internet connection never
worry about lag or data transfer costs
again automatically backup your files to
revolt for example when you take
pictures on the go when your devices run
low on memory free up space by simply
storing your files on revolt
with revolt all you devices work as a
team
me they can access the same content on
all your devices if you save a file on
one device you can find it on another we
are a highly experienced team of 16
members and our members have experience
building stony smart watches unmanned
helicopters fighter aircrafts and
automatic cars with some of the world's
leading engineers and advanced
technology but we would not have come
this far it was not for our online
community with over 2,000 members hi oh
there my name is Sean and I'm from small
town in Massachusetts I'm Matt I'm a
cloud architect from Chicago
hi everybody what's up my name is Ashley
and from the US their feedback is shaped
every aspect of reball together we have
created a device that you can wear as a
risk for pocket item revolt can tell the
time and give you vital statistics about
your private cloud
we've come a long way but now we need
your help from this product so please
back up reclaim your ghetto
hi I'm David
laptops are getting smaller and smaller
with fewer fewer USB ports two ports
you've got two ports to plug in your
cell phone your tablet your printer your
mouse your keyboard external hard drive
there's so much to plug in there's just
not enough to plug into hot-swap and
device doesn't work either you can't use
two devices at the same time you want to
transfer files between your flash drives
we've got unplug your mouse and your
keyboard that doesn't make much sense
and I just going through crazy mess of
tangled cords just to get one that you
need that's why we're introducing
infinite USB if an USB is an open chain
of USB ports granted literally an
unlimited supply of available course
it's just that simple it's just that
easy
I was the designer when they came up
with idea it was just a concept at first
but after earning the Hyades Ottawa
Germany the design caught fire Pender's
of solace of social media websites and
Peck walks like he gathered Nashville
all my favorites but talking about my
design it totally blew me away so why
not I decided to make me other and
partner with the most prettiest USB
cable manufacturer in China I'm going to
make the euphony USB to be perfect
small elegant and stood which made
complete small cosmetic prototypes I'm
determined provided best possible
product for those who love the idea of
exhausted almost every method I could
think of to be the Phoenix in circular
and now I'm competent to say the product
be just a perfect aesthetically slinging
cheerful beautiful and the penalized
thing is even smaller than
imagine during perceptual time you can
put it wherever you want is yours
infinite USB is available in micro
lightning and female USB ports you can
charge your Apple or Android or any
smartphone or tablet all day then taking
up serial ports my favorite part those
are no more wild wires are crazy cable
Ness and check this up it's so cool it's
so simple the mixed world difference is
the magnet design we need your help to
bring infinite USB to life we've built
the projects we've built the
partnerships now we just need to build a
capital we want to reduce product costs
for new customers and we need your help
to do it
this is infinite USB small design big
change
a couple years ago we set out to build a
family of affordable yet high-quality
smart weather station and we've done it
our weather stations are simple to
install require almost no maintenance
and automatically connect with your
smart phone your smart home and the
internet they're better than other
stations sold at twice or three times
the price finally you can have useful
weather information from your own
backyard
this is air air measures temperature
atmospheric pressure and relative
humidity and air does something else
special it detects lightning it'll not
only alert you when lightning strikes
but it'll estimate the strength and
distance of the storm up to 25 miles
away and it'll tell you how fast the
storm is approaching just set it outside
in the shade air has a battery that'll
last years and it connects wirelessly to
your smartphone tablet or home network
you don't have to think about it when
there's something you need to know it'll
alert you you can also view your data
anytime through our smart weather app as
well as other popular weather apps like
Weather Underground and this is sky sky
measures sunlight solar radiation
including UV index it also does two
really cool things
it measures rain and wind with no moving
parts unlike old-school tipping buckets
that can break or fill with things other
than rain sky senses each individual
raindrop using an innovative haptic rain
sensor it can alert you the instant it
starts to rain tell you how hard it's
raining and how much it rained yesterday
or last week sky also measures wind
speed and direction using an array of
sonic transducers this sonic anemometer
is better in many ways in traditional
spinning cups and usually only available
in much more expensive systems like air
Skye comes with a long life battery and
is completely wireless also like air
Skye is simple to install just find a
spot with a clear view of the sky
both sky and air work with all the
popular smart home platforms so you can
do all those nifty smart home things
like reminding you to put on sunscreen
when the UV index is high delaying your
sprinklers when it rains optimizing your
air conditioning system to save money
turning on your lights when the sun goes
down or closing your garage door when
the wind kicks up if you've made it this
far congratulations you're a certified
weather geek just like all of us at
weather forum we're on IndieGoGo now
because we want you to be the first to
get your hands on one of our new weather
stations and because we need your
feedback as we finalize production
details on the hardware and in the app
there's still time to make changes ask
us questions what did we do right what
could be better please take a look at
our perks
share this page with your friends
weather geek or otherwise we want these
to be the best home weather stations in
the world because we want you to have
better weather data please help us do
that thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
