other car extinguishers he because up
the beaten track let's see what exactly
it can do generally speaking car fire
always secure firstly around engine
usually the driver cannot that is in
time and the situation become more
serious
ten minutes past the situation will end
like this if you have out of Herman the
situation will be completely different
now I'm in selling an out of Herman in
the engine compartment thus two magnets
will be attached to the engine
compartment the installation is within
30 seconds
not only the installation is fast but it
also can put out fire quickly when the
temperature in the engine compartment is
up to 600 Celsius the pillion sensor
will detect the high temperature or up
and higher it will activate the auto
extinguisher and start to release the
extinguishing the car fire can be put
out within 30 seconds
no one would think of leaving their
child behind in a burning hot car or a
freezing cold car but it's a tragedy
that repeats itself time and time again
my name is Michael Brown old and I'm the
CEO of LFO and my name is Michael J and
i'm the president of LFO for the past
decade we've been creating lifestyle
devices enhancing quality of life to the
whole family we decided to design a
low-cost solution that could possibly
prevent children from being left behind
it's called the eclip and it attaches to
the baby's car seat a seat belts just
attach the e clip and switch it on using
safe low energy bluetooth communication
and our Android or iOS smartphone app
Eclipse sounds an alarm if you
accidentally go more than 15 feet from
your car without removing your child or
turning off the e clip eclip can also
send a text message to your spouse
parents or friend to remind them to take
the baby out of the car a tip will also
warn you if the temperature in the
backseat is too high or low ensuring
it's comfortable and safe for your baby
no smart phone equip comes with a
Bluetooth ephod for your keychain it
will sound an alarm if you've left a
baby in the car
the e clip is expected to have a retail
cost below eighty dollars making it not
just a necessary safety tool but an
affordable one as well the unique equip
app will be available via the Apple or
Google store so anyone with a smartphone
will be able to use it we have a lot of
experience with wellness technology our
products are in most US changed tools
including Walgreens CVS Duane Reade and
we're in Walmart so why are we on
Kickstarter we are looking for your
support to help recover the cost of
product Knowles software development and
marketing costs we already have interest
from parents associations who are keen
to get access to this new and innovative
product so join us because together you
can create a low-cost solution that put
an end to these tragedies
