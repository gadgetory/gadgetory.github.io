oh yeah come on camera is already
running okay i beliee and levin stood
guard to go since already 25 years I'm
in the bike business now mostly in
leading position in particular I'm a
companion the evolution of ebikes since
2010 and in these last year's I
developed a dream I dreamt of an e-bike
that is small but excellent that is
uncomplicated but reliable so first of
all it has to be really lightweight this
dream became reality together with our
friends in Barcelona we present you our
models at 0-3 during the last year we
gained a lot of experience to see that
bike in the hectic traffic of Paco Luna
that helped us to optimize the bike now
we are sure having developed that's the
perfect bike for all European cities as
you might know barthelona
got enough hilts but believe me stood
guard got even more but with our bike
all these hills transformed into a
nearly flat surface you don't sweat and
reach your destination faster than with
any other modes of transport G's in
future you can order our smartie bike
around the clock all over Europe we
guarantee fast delivery and an express
spare parts service for this we have to
invest money things after careful
consideration we decided against taking
out loans from banks instead of paying
high interest we want to reward you our
supporters by offering large discounts
during this campaign and at last but not
least we want to contribute with all our
activities to save the miracle of this
planet for us and future generations
I'm sure together we can make a big
difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
