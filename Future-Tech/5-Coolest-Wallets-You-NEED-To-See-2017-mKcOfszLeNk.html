so we don't matter so we made this the
Micra wallet was conceived as a joint
appreciation of minimalist design as we
grew frustrated with traditional leather
wallets only lasting several months
instead of several years as designers we
knew we can do better we set ourselves a
pretty challenging brief to design a
minimalist wallet that was not only
aesthetically beautiful but functionally
superior to anything else on the market
our years of industry experience the
neighbourhood has to quickly evaluate
our designs taking them from initial
concept through to sourcing
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating would rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strengths so we decided to test it ready
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes
holding all your cards securely you no
longer have to remove them to make a
payment one of our proudest achievements
is its full functionality of a regular
wallet without the bulk believe it or
not we've even managed to find space for
your change
hi I'm Adam he's kind of a big day for
me and that's why I have wall-e while
he's connected to my phone and sends me
instant notification whenever I leave or
forget about la which happens a lot
that's not even the best part
I never even have to charge wall-e to
swap out the battery whatever it's time
for a new one if I ever lose my phone I
just tap my wallet twice my phone will
start ringing yep goes both ways
you
you
you
you
you
oh I'll have my card
oh yeah
wall-e lets me know if I leave my card
buffer so I'm always covered
you
hello Pig start on Philip I'm Alex I'm
Gabi and this is ping wallet the world's
thinnest smartest wallet Fitness a smart
wallet that connects to your smartphone
using bluetooth we designed a wallet to
look better than a traditional wallet
it's sleek it's modern and you can
customize it to the color of your choice
big wallet can outlast the traditional
wallet because it's made with the
durable single piece of aluminum and a
commercial-grade elastic band not only
is it durable and modern it's smart as
well and pin wallet is the only wallet
that protects itself and you from ID
theft getting stolen or being misplaced
what makes things so smart it has
multiple effects sensors that can detect
you send someone or you move a car
something we remind you to become to
come back to the wallet if you out at a
bar or restaurant you can use the pin
out to open a tab to a manager at a
later time because we use Hall effect
sensors and stop artemius sensors in the
custom battery the battery can last up
to two meters after three years you can
replace the battery for another two
years
once you couldn't pin to your iPhone or
Android they instantly protect each
other if someone takes your wallet you
want to reply to the phone
like this or someone takes you for
penguin or a fire do sound
our world is constantly moving faster
and it's getting harder to remember all
the important things
it's easy to lose track
probably loves things
that's why we created woman
it's the slimmest smart wallet that
you'll never lose
will it protects your valuable cards
documents and money
you

give you peace of mind
hi my name is marek and i'm launcher of
products and services I do it for
companies I do it for myself and I'm
very busy and because of that I lack of
product service that can give me better
control over things
well it's something more than just a
leather wallets it's something that I
can describe as a sense of security so
right now we're giving you bullet super
smart wallet that you will never lose
bullet is the first wallet you can't
lose will it protects you from anyone
who wants to steal your cash art or
identity
hi and I'd like to tell you about our
new product smart we've been using
wallets for hundreds of years and we
think it's crazy that we've been using
the same wallet
essentially the same wallet that our
great-great-grandparents use
that's why we want to make a wallet
smart
the first function in my opinion it's a
two-way notification system your wallet
also to get up from you take care of
your wallet starts beeping to remind if
you've left your phone behind
if you've misplaced your wallet we're
from the spot wallet can also serve as
time device you can use the Smart wallet
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
