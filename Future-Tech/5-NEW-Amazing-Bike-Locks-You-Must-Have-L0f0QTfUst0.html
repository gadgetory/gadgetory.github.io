technology by launching the Fort Knox
magnetic bike pedals now we have created
the vault pedals making your favorite
mag lock technology into a lighter
smaller less expensive sleek design it
is designed to be used in any
circumstance whether hitting jumps on
your favorite downhill trail or cruising
around town the included shoe clips are
compatible with standard bike shoes you
can customize how strong you want to be
connected by adding or removing magnets
the flat design of the mag lock pedals
allows them to be used with street shoes
for a leisurely cruise around town with
friends there is no awkward clip or
Tooting from the pedals this makes them
the only truly clipless pedals these
pedals are for all levels of riders they
are also for all sales of bike commuting
downhill fat bikes and euro bike packing
and even mountain unicycle the magnets
are surprisingly strong with 30 pounds
of attractive force to keep your bike
firmly attached to your feet when
jumping for those who are hesitant to be
clipped into their pedals worry no
longer getting out as easy by peeling or
pushing your foot off to the side that
easily unclips
if you wreck your feet naturally come
out it's just as easy to clip back in
just hover the shoe clip over the pedal
and the magnets will draw it right in
the Maglev bike pedal is the only
clipping pedal that has an infinite
float no matter how far you twist your
foot to the side it won't unclip
