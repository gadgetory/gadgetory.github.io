seconds to steal a bike that is one of

amazing lock so I pedal anything else on
behalf of Tom's family of mine we want
to say thank you for watching and
remember don't just peddle
last year we revolutionized bike pedal
technology by launching the Fort Knox
magnetic bike pedals now we have created
the vault pedals making your favorite
mag lock technology into a lighter
smaller less expensive sleek design it
is designed to be used in any
circumstance whether hitting jumps on
your favorite downhill trail or cruising
around town the included shoe clips are
compatible with standard bike shoes you
can customize how strong you want to be
connected by adding or removing magnets
the flat design of the mag lock pedals
allows them to be used with street shoes
for a leisurely cruise around town with
friends there is no awkward clip or
Tooting from the pedals this makes them
the only truly clipless pedals these
pedals are for all levels of riders they
are also for all sales of bike commuting
downhill fat bikes and euro bike packing
and even mountain unicycle the magnets
are surprisingly strong with 30 pounds
of attractive force to keep your bike
firmly attached to your feet when
jumping for those who are hesitant to be
clipped into their pedals worry no
longer getting out as easy by peeling or
pushing your foot off to the side that
easily unclips
if you wreck your feet naturally come
out it's just as easy to clip back in
just hover the shoe clip over the pedal
and the magnets will draw it right in
the Maglev bike pedal is the only
clipping pedal that has an infinite
float no matter how far you twist your
foot to the side it won't unclip
in order to keep the adventure going we
need your help to launch this new pedal
with enough support we will be able to
produce the ball pedals at a low cost
these savings will be passed on to you
please spread the word by sharing this
with your friends thank you for your
support
