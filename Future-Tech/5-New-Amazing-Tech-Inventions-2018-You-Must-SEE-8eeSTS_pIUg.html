shouldn't be called an unreachable it
should be fun and part of daily life
this is e stars world first holographic
smartphone so how do we generate glass
free holograms on smartphones when we're
looking at our smart phone a camera will
quickly track our I mu I tracking data

unit
it's quickly processed by our eye
tracking system which will lock on to
where our eyes are looking this is very
important our eye tracking system will
adjust the hologram generated based on
where your eyes are looking and you'll
immediately see the holographic effect
