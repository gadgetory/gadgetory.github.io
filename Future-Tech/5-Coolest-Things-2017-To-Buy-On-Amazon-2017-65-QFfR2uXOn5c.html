you
hi my name is Brian Davis and I'd like
to welcome you to my fifth Kickstarter
today I'm gonna introduce you to the
weather neck a modular balaclava so why
do you need this well for me when I
start out my rides I like to be warm and
then oftentimes I'll overheat and it's
nice to be able to adjust when I start
to heat up too much so that's why I
created the weather neck our breakaway
balaclava allows you to adjust to your
environment by quickly and quietly
removing the face shield with one hand
in one second you may remember that we
launched the weather neck last season
that's true then we spent the entire
summer improving it and creating the all
new mullet hat so what are the features
of the new weather neck system well we
have magnets again three metal
connectors are sewn into the back of the
Hat we've improved the mesh for better
breathing and ventilation we have a
secret mullet pocket also in the back of
the Hat and we've created a hat that
actually covers your ears we've got all
new colors this time around okay well
just black really because black is the
new black so how does it work
well there's magnets in the face shield
and they connect to three metal tabs
that are sewn into the back of the Hat
those three tabs give you three
different sizing options also it
prevents any spinning and it stays high
in your face but most importantly you
can easily and quietly remove it with
one hand in one second
you
the Hat fits under your helmet you
connect the mask and roll out simple as
that
it's a hundred percent black 100% made
in the USA and a hundred percent freakin
awesome now listen I need you for just
one more second if you can click on that
green button over there pledge this
project and then share it with at least
one other person you know who shares
your passion for being awesome I would
greatly appreciate that thank you very
much tired of being in the 70% of
smartphone users with weak cell signal
issues introducing the EM juice three in
one case the case for better signal
coverage giving you stronger signal
juice and up to 120 percent battery
boost in an attractive case that reduces
radiation exposure by up to 70 percent
our breakthrough patented technology
addresses the weak signal problem you'll
see more bars and more places by simply
turning on the amp and placing a call to
see the bars go up it's the industry's
first cell signal amplifying technology
in a case that improves signal strength
by up to 100 times our case creates a
better handshake with the towers so you
get stronger signals for better
reception and clearer calls where ever
you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
