these days children my smartphones
tablets and handheld devices a much more
attractive to them than watching TV an
addiction to the use of the devices is
not healthy perspect by the body or mind
think about this issue we came up with
an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children
introducing the agar AR projector it is
our belief that great idea come from
grid camera such as great media and this
camera should be adorable cute inovative
and a nurture a child's imagination this
is our agar it looks like an egg but
your child it could be a monster or at
first a monster and now a pretty girl
and before it was a pretty girl by a
rarity it's a boy although at first it
may seem like just a toy we have
developed this way to preserve a child's
innocence agar was built with our
consideration for the whole children
such as knowing that children are
naturally sensitive to light so we have
scared projection brightness down to 100
lumens to ensure a child's comfort and
safety agar also supports a smart
lighting system which automatically
adjust its brightness depending it
Ronde agar is tailored for children so
it's very easy to operate with our safe
contact charging system using magnetic
pole connect to technology offer a
simple fast and safe charging operation
even while charging AG a remains of ku
and cute
intuitive and versatile agar is made for
children to enjoy with just a few case
of operation which is demonstrated in
the design of Agra remote controller our
sincere hope is that there could be a
screen tailor designed our children</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
