that's really good extraordinary
although equipment makers produce their
products as if we are the exact same
here when in fact just like we have you
need fingerprints we all have unique
earring prints our mule maps a hearing
print for each year and entails the
sound by filling in the missing
frequencies bringing a hearing to the
optimal level and letting you experience
sound like never before getting started
is easy first you map out the unique
hearing prints to the app then you
simply connect audio to whatever you
want to listen to and that section can
watch movies enjoy swimming music and
listen to all other audio parts of your
life knowing that has been tailored just
for you there is a range of frequencies
that the human ear is sensitive to and
each ear has different sensitivities
across that range and that is the reason
why audio should not be on the size fits
all is well known that listening to
sound and large volumes damages one's
hearing and that loss can be permanent
not only can emil provide you with audio
like you've never heard it before but
because it customizes it specifically
for you
it helps you to hear at lower volumes
this will spare your hearing and provide
you with clarity of sound
your lifetime although accurately maps
to killing print for each year and then
tailors to South should get here all the
audio passive head but don't take my
word for it listen to what others have
to say
here we are going to try to find out
what you're hearing Prentiss so you
should hear the beeping sound each year
we tried six tones and that's where we
map out the whole year this is what your
audio sounds like without your hands
whoo this is for you it's really cool
you can really tell the difference in
trouble the bass it was all very clear
much clearer than before I like the idea
that it's also a bit about kind of
particular about we're not a lot better
I love it yeah thank you
the product is made from a solid piece
of aluminum to be extremely lightweight
yet durable we wanted to make a product
that really embodies simplicity
functionality portability people must
immerse it in a shawl away today you
hear a lot about audio advancements such
as glasses file format or high profits
hot
these are all great achievements but
they're still missing one important
factor your unique pair we have been
working on this technology since 2000
and we're now ready for the defection
with your support and help we can now
finally share audio thank you and happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
