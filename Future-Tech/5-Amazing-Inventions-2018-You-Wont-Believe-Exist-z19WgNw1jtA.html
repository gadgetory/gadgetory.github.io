easy as you might think I mean we have
the ideas we have the motivation and we
have all the potential in the world but
sometimes you just don't have the tools
you need that's why we've decided it's
time to make our own tools there have
been amazing advances and innovations in
the world of 3d printing but the
machines are too complicated and unsafe
for kids but kids are smart creative and
curious too why should adults have all
the fun
so we created yeehaw the only three
printer design of us kids in mind we
made it easy to use or 100% safe for
kids it's controlled directly by its
quad system either online or through its
expertly designed app there's no need
for manually adjusting anything you can
create unique and original designs pixel
by pixel or knife or you can choose from
an always growing library of more than
two thousand ready to print toys all you
need to do is pick your color Press
print and yeehaw does the rest it's
fully enclosed by a safety door so
there's absolutely no danger when the
machine is printing if the door is open
or the machine is tilted or anything
else goes wrong the machine will
automatically stop printing and will
trap its nozzles you are a sleek compact
and see-through all around which allows
you to see ideas come to us in any angle
all four filaments are eco-friendly and
non-toxic and they come in 12 different
colors we wanted to make sure that
yee-hah allowed kiss towards further
creativity in whole new ways we can be
innovative in our problem-solving we
could dream up new and exciting world we
can help each other learn grow and
achieve our potential and our parents
are less easy turned out wherever our
imaginations take us we'll be safe and
sound
and don't worry we made it safe for
grownups too we made DeHoff for all the
families out there who know that there's
no limit to what we can create and
support us on IndieGoGo and share our
campaign with family and friends
the yeehaw it's already available and is
ready to be shipped in time for the
holidays yeehaw
the 3d printer designed with kids in
mind this is your macbook air and yeah
it doesn't have a touchscreen uh how
boring but now there's air bar just plug
it in and you have touch finally you can
swipe away unwanted mess or find a
needle in a haystack
wait is that a poodle cool now you're
the poodle scroll away the sky is the
limit just go bananas or I don't know
maybe you just want to eat a banana
anyway if you want touch on your macbook
air get air bar
this is air bar air bar brings touch to
your newer existing PC by projecting an
invisible light field over the screen
and what's good about light is that it
responds to pretty much anything so you
can swipe with your gloves or long
fingernails pinch with your chopsticks
scroll while you're cooking or why not
use a paintbrush you get the idea with
air bar you get touch gestures when you
need them it's easy to attach it's sleek
it won't drain your battery and you can
unplug it when you want to best of all
there's no manual no installation it's
plug and touch it just works air bar
plug and touch when you need it
much better
glass can be smelly
that's why you need vents for it the
best weapon to take out stinky odors it
works like add in ventilation to your
trash can another closed spaces freshen
up the air so you can actually relax
when it turns into this guy it keeps us
smelling this area a lot more tolerable
and we make sure that you can smell the
sweet scent of this little devil right
here rather than this you can install a
fancy fresh to your trash can easily
within seconds just leave alone no
maintenance it's a high-tech ventilation
system combined in UV lighting and
platinum dioxide technology to break
down autumn Allah pools and yield fresh
air a light sensor starts the
deodorization when the trashcan is
closed Fanta fresh adapts to all kinds
of trash cans and you can use any
regular garbage bags
there's no consumables that keep you
spending more and with an additional
portable power bank you can use ven
fresh all around the house such as
treats in the fridge when needed under
the kitchen sink and of course your
smelly shoe cabinets so go get a fancy
fresh so easy to install and 100% hassle
free and acid I call clean job
salt-and-pepper I have a charger port
says me electronic portable microphone
sprinkler head an attachment for a
camera or something a spy go to eleven
