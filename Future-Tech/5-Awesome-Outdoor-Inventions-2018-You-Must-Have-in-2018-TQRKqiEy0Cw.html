that it can turn a picnic into a party
it keeps your drinks cold and your food
fresh so you can enjoy the outdoors in
even the harshest conditions but what if
it could do more than just that meet the
chiller chair packing 70 litres of cold
storage space a Bluetooth waterproof
dustproof speaker a fishing rod holder
and LED light 2 USB plugs a picnic set a
solar panel to charge the battery an
Oliphant fabric weather resistant
cushioned dry cold storage space and
even a slide-out draw to ensure your
chilling does not get disturbed if you
haven't noticed yet the chiller chair
isn't just about keeping your drinks
cold now what you see is a prototype the
actual product will be more refined with
injection molding and insulation
technology that will have your ice
lasting for up to 72 hours there's
nothing wrong with the normal old cooler
it has served us well keeping our drinks
cold over the years but enough of the
dodgy vent lids broken handles missing
bung plugs and short ice life we are
ready for production with a very
experienced factory who already produce
our killer Group knapsacks so while your
mates are carrying their coolers you're
wheeling yours in like a boss and while
they're sitting on their cooler lids and
bending them out of shape you can be
sitting back in style and comfort with
access to your drinks without having to
get up thanks for watching
we hope you get on board and enjoy the
latest and greatest in chiller
technology
recent innovations and backpacking water
treatment options have been access to
drinking water on the trail easier than
ever
however the products designed to be used
with them have proven to be cumbersome
and incomplete solutions introducing the
vecto container a complete design
solution for virtually all lightweight
water containing and purifying needs hi
I'm Billy Laden and I invented a water
container a problem with existing
solutions they are too big and heavy
unreliable or inefficient the recto
solves all these problems whether your
weekend warrior through higher
it's just better than anything else
guarantee available on the market
I wanted something that's easy to use
light simple and will work with as many
options as you can it can work where the
filters with chemical treatment UV
filters you name it it's just so simple
trick to the Andes the Alps New Zealand
all of the UK Israel and here in the US
through my experience I know firsthand
works and what doesn't out on the trail
and along with extensive trail testing
we're able to develop practical and
efficient solutions real backpackers
need vector is made from bpa-free
material it's safe to use for clean
water for 30 water it's really versatile
you can use it as a gravity feed so you
can fill it with dirty water hang in on
anything that you want and just filter
through you can very easily clean it
scrub it at home soap it keep it open
we're sticking the slider inside and it
dries completely and that's it ready to
use with anything that you want we want
to make the vector a reality it's
practical supremely useful and solves a
problem we all have to deal with and
good design means you need to spend less
time with the necessities and more time
enjoying the
through a Kickstarter you have the
opportunity to get your hands on a
discount vector container garden fun
adventure or many other options you can
have a look at please spread the word
for your fellow backpackers and campers
on Facebook Pinterest Instagram Twitter
or any social media that you choose it
