bonds to almost any other material
overnight it turns into a strong durable
rubber one of our customers described it
best when they said super glue and
play-doh had a lovechild than this would
be it it's soft enough to mold into any
shape yet durable enough to fix almost
anything I invented us to make fixing
and making easy for everyone over the
last few generations we've grown out of
the habit of fixing stuff and now
there's far too much waste in this world
what if we could have a more thoughtful
relationship with the stuff we own and
our environment instead of buying new
things all the time why don't we fix
improve and reimagine the stuff we
already have so it works better for us I
grew up on a farm and on a farm fixing
is a way of life when something breaks
you don't go to the shops you get the
well direct I thought everyone lived
like this when I realized they didn't I
wanted to do something about I decided
to go to school in London to become a
product designer I was so excited about
it but a few weeks in it wasn't what I'd
imagined designing more new things for
the world just didn't seem like the
right thing to do I felt totally lost
one day I did a random experiment mixing
silicone polymers with sawdust that led
to
look like wood but it bounced like a
ping pong ball that to me was magic
I really wanted to find out what this
curious thing could be but I just
couldn't figure out what it was for
until one night my boyfriend James said
I said follow me to the kitchen look at
what you've been doing you've been using
your leftover material to fix them what
if it was normal for everyone to fix and
redesign this stuff like this and I was
like wow that's an amazing idea and
that's when my mind went wild I started
to imagine the countless things that
people could do with it I could make
this work it could be so useful for
millions of people so I teamed up with
some amazing scientists who helped me
get started I had a lot to learn and I
needed to get hands-on again this time
in a lab we had to learn about silicone
polymer chains designing a cross-linking
process that could be catalyzed simply
by exposure to air on how to make
something that could be a pleasure to
mold in your hands
if bombed like crazy almost any other
surface and then we had to figure out
how it could be industrially robust and
produced and packed at scale thousands
of experiments in engineering errors
later we have made the world's most
versatile balloon
this material is absolutely amazing
because of what you can do with it it
really is the world's most versatile
glue it's an adhesive that allows you to
stick anything to anything you can mold
it into any shape to fill those weird
gaps between things creating a strong
secure bond and that's a tall it's got
some pretty cool properties too
it's strong but flexible cold and heat
resistant sticky yet removable
waterproof and UV resistant good for
indoors and out grippy and even shock
absorbing just stick it shape it and in
24 hours it turns into a strong flexible
rubber and can make your cables last
longer you can make handy hooks to hang
anything anywhere fix broken plastics
and even fix my favorite drinking mug it
helps keep your feet warm and dry it's
waterproof he's in cold resistance so
you can easily fix a broken seal punch
community
suger is super durable so perfect for
use indoors and out people love silver
because fixing things just make sense
feels great now customizing its
playstation controller or like Steph fan
who transformed an old digital camera
into a kick-ass kid's camp or likes
knowing who's given a new foot made with
suger these ideas come from people all
over the world who are you
in suru to make their stuff last longer
and work better for them they've grown
into a community it's just people who
love to share their ideas and stories to
help inspire the world to get fixing
again sugru the world's most versatile
blue come on over to see recom join in
and get excited how does your phone
survive with today's common cable do you
carry a bulky cable around or just put
up with your phone dying let's face it
the time for a breakthrough in cable
design is long overdue this is life link
the ultra portable cable that makes
charging on-the-go easy and stress-free
keep lifelink in your purse and it's
always there for you store it in your
wallet or your phone case and you're
good to go attach it to your keys and

life link is easy to use just plug it
into any USB port and get charged fast
be in your car on a flight at work with
a portable battery on a laptop tablet or
even a TV so what makes lifelink such a
breakthrough in cable design firstly
it's as long as your credit card and
amazingly as thin as two combined but
when opened it extends to more than
double its length
secondly the tough red cable is
engineered with Teflon technology this
makes your life link a heavy-duty
compact cable it's both flexible and
builds the last life link works with all
Android and Apple smartphones and
tablets and because it's always with you
you can share it with your friends so
they can stay connected to hi I'm vice
one of the cofounders of Plus us we
realized more and more people were
getting frustrated like we were by
getting stranded with a dead phone and
no cable so we started developing life
link to create an ultra portable cable
the best supports your lifestyle and the
way that you use your phone the life
link is much more than a breakthrough in
cable design
it goes beyond that with every lifelink
ordered plus US will contribute towards
a cause of your choice provide education
for a child shelter for a family or
clean water for a community you choose
pre-order now and be one of the first to
join our community and get your life
