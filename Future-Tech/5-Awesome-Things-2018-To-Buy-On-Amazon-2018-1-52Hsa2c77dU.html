art has the ability to change the
feeling of any room digital art
specifically has the ability to bring
life and movement into our room it can
change that feel many times over with
the push of a button blacktips mission
is to make art accessible into that and
we've created a distribution platform
for digital art blogged up debts of the
future digital art is now and they have
created this platform that allows for
the circulation of art to extend outside
of just the white box makes it a lot
more accessible to a lot more people
digital art is traditionally very
difficult to collect it used to be we'd
sell something and they'd get a DVD and
then it changed to a USB Drive and so
now having this universal system is
fantastic Samsung makes black does
vision to bring digital art to living
rooms and commercial interiors a reality
well one thing that I find so exciting
being both an art lover and a
restaurateur is the ability to really
bring the gallery experience into my
restaurant the ambience of hecho and
Dumbo is engineered to reflect the
contemporary arts culture of Mexico the
digital canvas allows our artwork to
change as our tastes might the black
dove digital canvas is the best solution
for me to ship digital art this being an
old house I like to contradict that by
having more contemporary works in space
and I think there's nothing more
contemporary and new
than digital art one of the reasons I
think the black platform is going to be
so quickly adopted is because of
ease-of-use whether I'm here alone or if
I'm hosting guests at my house I'm able
to change the entire feel of the room
with the push of a button using this new
platform the collaboration between black
dove and Samsung creates a standardized
platform it's a great platform because
you can see the art the way that the
artist had intended and that's really
fantastic we want people to be able to
share artist and artwork like people are
sharing other things like music or
photos it's now possible to do this
through the black dove app we've seen in
television in movies and music that they
have embraced the 21st century and now
we're finally at a time where visual
artists and the visual arts also has
that opportunity with a platform like
Black deaf where they can reach a global
audience where it can be shared it can
get art out there into more of the
public realm and just become a lot more
accessible I think it's a wonderful
thing
