sleeping your dearest one wakes up
silently it has already preheated the
seat and water temperature using its
heating system and has been waiting for
you patiently to have a wonderful day
the design of voice is smart Washlet
makes it easy for the aged people and
young children to operate the remote
control you will feel comfortable by the
intelligence of Technology when you sit
there
it trades your bottom gently' by
intelligent remote warm air drying and
intelligent washing function the design
of user-friendly remote control makes
you enjoy your time in the toilet just
like a noble smart wash lake has the
service of speech recognition and you
can operate it with your voice
it offers your family members more
convenience to have a great experience
in the toilet
smart Washlet gives you freshness and
enjoyment every single day the whole
family health starts from the beginning
of Sanitation we have spent two years
for the development of his smart
Waterloo and we would like to provide
superior quality for the consumers
around the world
now we urgently need the support of
sponsors and we expect to bring you a
quality sanitation experience in the
future
we're surrounded by compelling design
and our home is our most important space
our time is spent creating safe
comfortable environments for our
families but there's a product in our
home that hasn't been improved in over a
hundred years the toilet brush is filthy
it drips on the floor and is full of
bacteria it's often covered in toxic
chemicals which are dangerous for
children and using one is never pleasant
the only alternative or flushable pads
which looked cheap and cost over $100 a
year in refills they're also terrible
for the environment because they're made
in factories packaged and shipped around
the world I need to be thrown away with
each use the Lucan is a groundbreaking
solution for keeping the bathroom
hygienic simple to use requires no
installation and cleans the toilet with
a powerful spray of clean water it's
neutral design suits any bathroom and
has it never touches the toilet it stays
clean and safe for children the powerful
motor delivers the perfect level of
power to clean above and below water and
is designed to ensure there is no splash
back the clean submerged surfaces with a
sharp spray and the simple design means
anyone can use it the reservoir holds a
full 300 mils of clean water it attaches
with a simple click and can be filled
under any tap in just a few seconds it
comes with a floor stand to sit neatly
next to the toilet and the four double A
batteries will last for around nine
months if you use it once a day to
create an amazing product
our team has spent two years on design
engineering and testing to perfect every
detail our patents are filed and we have
one of the world's leading manufacturing
companies lined up and ready to start
production
if you like the new gun please support
us by selecting one of the reward levels
down the right we're super excited to
share project with you and hope that if
you just like toilet brushes as much as
we do you'll help us bring it to life
imagine being cocooned by a pure mist
warm gentle and luxurious Cirrus is like
showering in the clouds I'm really
impressed
it was an amazing shower they say that
it's like showering in a cloud it really
is
Cirrus is a revolutionary showerhead
that elevates the bathing ritual into
the stratosphere our atomizing cloud
maker nozzle technology produces a miss
so fine that it totally envelops you and
by creating a miss so fine Cirrus
reduces water and energy consumption by
75% compared to conventional showerheads
meaning you'll see a rapid return on
your investment Cirrus also purifies the
water in which you'll bathe our easy to
replace nano filters contain three
layers of mineralized stones which
enhance water quality by filtering
impurities reducing chlorine adding
minerals and balancing pH levels each
nano filter lasts two to three months of
use for an average family you can also
choose from our range of organic
essential oil aromatherapy infusers
simply add an infuser each time you
shower for a completely invigorating
experience personally I'm not really one
for the aromatherapy but my girlfriend
is she says it's like having a spa home
our essential oils are both colorless
and soap free meaning they do not
perfume your hair or body or discolor
the water so how does Cirrus work our
eco-friendly cloud maker water atomizing
technology
delivers a consistent spray by splitting
the incoming water stream into myriad
nano droplets creating a mist that is
both all-embracing
and highly efficient well to be honest
that was a little skeptical about the
water savings but I've been using it for
about a month now and I've seen a
significant drop in water consumption I
can see this thing paying for itself in
no time and Cirrus does not compromise
rinse ability in fact foamy shampoo
rinses out of your hair easier with
Cirrus thanks to its optimized water
distribution I'm really surprised if
anything the shower rinsed off the
shampoo on my hair faster than a normal
shower which really surprised me because
my hair is really thick Cirrus is
designed in France and uses Chrome and
white polycarbonate to produce a stylish
unapologetically modern bathroom
showerhead
it's made with standard Universal
fittings and installs in seconds it is
adaptable to any bathroom and setup is
both to lists and foolproof the
installation is the easiest thing in the
world I'm no handyman
it took me seconds to do it if I can do
it anyone can do it I have been managing
to complex logistics of production and
distribution for major retailers and
businesses since I arrived in Asia ten
years ago we have a team permanently
based here in Hong Kong so we can
closely monitor the development and
Shaan processes and importantly to keep
a keen eye on quality control you can
count on us to deliver on our work so
where's the catch the catch is now I'll
take even longer to get ready now if
you'll excuse me
cirrus like showering in the clouds
every now and then a piece of technology
comes along that completely
revolutionizes a major part of our
everyday lives
something so groundbreaking so
remarkable it inspires a movement for
your movements we designed fusion the
ultimate experience in elimination while
using the system fusion enables optimal
movement efficiency allowing you to
double your output in a single plop
engineered to precision fusion allows
users to relieve tension from their
internal components creating optimal
conditions for optimized output this
squatting posture is a part of our DNA
in perfect harmony with the workings of
the colon in designing the fusion our
goal was to engineer a device that works
regardless of your height experience or
taste its unique support platform is
adjustable on so many levels this allows
for a completely personalized experience
altered with a simple gesture and to
encourage maximum relaxation we've added
float a foot massage is specifically
designed to lighten the load while you
like in your load
this turns the elimination process into
a delightful experience a
thirty-year-old has an average of 52
more years of life that's more than
18,000 daily movements with most of
those occurring at home wouldn't you
like a device that makes the experience
healthier more efficient and more
enjoyable what we have designed in
fusion is lightyears ahead precision of
adjustable levels gives you the ability
to perform to perfection we're talking
about maximum output with minimal effort
the ultimate step forward in ship
technology
that's me I don't want to get out of the
shower
why because I hate my towels these ones
don't really dry me anymore it's more
like smearing water around with moist
sandpaper and these ones these fluffier
has everyone seemed to soak up a little
more water at first but then they stay
wet and start to smell musty which means
there's bacteria growing and maybe even
fungus of course you could avoid this
but a washing and drying your towels
every day but who has time for that
in my search for a better towel I found
a staggering number of options mostly
just variations of the same old towel so
to cut through the confusion I took a
different approach one that redefines
what a towel should be this is the own
scent app purposefully designed to its
core the waffle weave is what makes it
different delivering a multi-layer feel
its luscious inside with an exfoliating
texture and tries like its job depended
on it
having maximum surface area exposed
enables the towel to try itself faster
which is important because the dry towel
is a clean towel this towel is great at
least as perceived by me even shower
time is a daily ritual for me it's the
first yeah
even before coffee why do I care so much
about a towel oh because I'm sick of
musty tiles that don't work properly and
I know a few people who share my
frustration so this is my solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
