better paper better thinking the average
American workers spend six hours a day
at their desk the average gamer spends
an additional seven hours a week in
their desk the average under desk
temperature that's only 32 degrees
Fahrenheit yet this is what we do with
our feet during the hours and hours we
spend at our desk we could continue
doing this but there's a better way to
sit at your desk
we call it the foot hammock the most
comfortable way city
I'm a college student and a gamer so I
spend more than my fair share of time
sitting at my desk really more hours
than I spend sleeping and I was I was
sitting at my desk I realized my feet
were getting cold my legs weren't really
supported I wasn't really as comfortable
as I wanted to be as I started looking
for better solutions I tried a bunch of
different things I tried a cardboard box
that wasn't very comfortable I tried my
printer I need up breaking that so I got
together with my roommate Brent and we
began developing the foot hammock the
two main problems we're going to solve
for how to support your feet and keep
them warm we wanted a product that would
be comfortable
machine washable easy to take off and
put back on and most importantly we want
to work on every desk after going
through the design process we went
through 50 different types of fabrics
over 20 different ways to attach it to
your desk using velcro suction cups
double-sided tapes and we finally came
up with a product that we have for you
today the foot hammock seamlessly sticks
to the bottom of any desk using a
powerful patented adhesive technology
that can hold up to a hundred pounds
it's easy to put on it's easy to take
off and it works under every desk the
foot habit can be adjusted to any
position desired whether you want it
close to the ground or up and out of the
way we've created a product that is
really amazing and comfortable to use so
let's take a look at our rewards we've
created three versions of this product
the first version is the original it's
made of mesh which allows you to use a
product with your shoes on you can also
use the product with your shoes off and
the breathable material lets your feet
keep cool
the second version is our fleece version
this can be used with your shoes but it
was really made to be used barefoot it's
really comfortable and allows you to
keep your feet cozy and very warm
finally we have a heated version of the
fleece blanket this allows you to adjust
the heat to your desired level keeping
your feet out of 10 out of 10 on the
warmest scale now is a stretch goal we
hit a hundred thousand dollars for all
fleece packers we'll provide a free
fleece blanket attachment that envelops
the heat and keeps your feet extra warm
with your help acting and sharing this
project I know that we can hit this goal
you spend a lot of money making sure
your sleeping experience is as
comfortable as possible
you spent just about as much time at a
desk as you do sleeping so we think you
should invest in your comfort here too
and that's why I invented the float
hammock
we appreciate all your support and
thanks for backing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
