world's
we are eating our fleece we're eating
our yoga pants and we're eating our gym
clothes
my name is Rachel Miller and this
problem I'm talking about it's
microfiber pollution our clothes are
breaking up into tiny little pieces and
flowing out our washing machines into
our public water ways these pieces of
microfiber are so small smaller even
than a red blood cell that they're eaten
by creatures of all sizes and in all
levels of the marine food web and what
they eat we eat everyone who wears in
washes clothes is part of this problem
but don't be overwhelmed we have a
solution meet the core of all the core
of all is the first microfiber catching
laundry ball it's a human scale consumer
based solution to the problem of
microfiber pollution the core of all is
inspired by coral because coral does
what we need coral allows water to flow
and picks little things out of that
flowing water the coral ball is really
really easy to use you just throw or
drop it in a washing machine it works in
any washing machine you don't need a
plumber there are no installation costs
and you don't need extra space this is
what coral looks like while doing her
job once your laundry is done
you clean coral like you clean a
hairbrush you just pick out the bits of
fuzz and throw them in the trash bin
there is a big bonus the core ball
catches hair that is a big deal in this
household and I am only one-third of the
story
our team has been working on this
solution for over a year
Korra was born out of our work on the
water this is a true social enterprise
the success of the Korra ball first and
foremost means a cleaner ocean secondly
proceeds support Rizal you project swear
cleaning and protecting the ocean and
developing and implementing more
solutions to the problem of marine
debris our backers are really important
to this project and to the team we've
already had the funding to order the
mold and file the patent so this
Kickstarter it's all about production
you will help us get the car ball out
into the world if 10% of US households
use a car bomb we can keep the plastic
equivalent of over 30 million water
bottles out of our public waterways
every year that's a big impact for a
clean ocean we hope you'll help us get
the car ball out into the world the
average office prays for work and
creation but in recent years a new
hazardous phenomenon has arisen it is
known as the screen slouched this is a
screen sloucher look at him slouching in
front of a screen here is the female
screen sloucher slouching in front of a
much smaller screen the slouching makes
her appearance less confident her back
aches every day for 8 to 12 hours
slouching is an inherent part of the
office habitat the
is up right go a small wearable that
helps the slouches become upright it is
the simplest way to improve your posture
just stick it on your back and press the
button that's it a bright would vibrate
every time slouch look at the effect it
has on the screen slouches such a smile
has not been seen on their faces for a
long time since upright go sits directly
on the back it is the only device that
truly senses the back it's also the only
posture trainer that works no matter
what you're doing sitting standing or
walking oh look one of the screen
slouches has discovered that if you
press the button once more upright go
switches to tracking mode a mode that
doesn't vibrate when you slouch but
still keeps all your daily posture data
in the upright app incredible to
conclude our research we returned to the
office two weeks later the results were
astonishing after two weeks being
upright became second nature
here is one sloucher two weeks ago and
here he is now see how much more
confident and better looking he appears
notice also how he doesn't suffer from
back pains oh we're in luck
it seems the male ex sloucher finally
feels confident enough to approach the
female ex sloucher exciting so if you
too wish to stop being a screen sloucher
get upright go incredible how in only
two week oh dear we've been spotted
abort abort
hi my name is Odette Cohen CEO of up
right when we started up right three
years ago we were just three founders
with a mission to help people correct
their posture and prevent back pain
since then operated ship thousands of
units of our professional product to
happy users our team grew to twenty
engineers designers and marketers but
our mission haven't changed we want to
help more people have better posture
that is why we decided to create a more
casual version the upright go now in
order to put it in the market we need
your help if you care about your back
support us and get upright go
hearing protection should be a concern
to all but these plugs aren't created
solely for avoiding hearing loss we've
created plugs that you'll want to have
for those times when you need to
minimize distraction focus more intently
sleep more deeply and simply control
your environment better while other
plugs may reduce sound they're awkward
and unattractive design is far from
something you would want to wear in
public
the Tulip tip on the XP reactor and the
XP defender has been designed to fit so
comfortably that they can be worn for
long periods of time when worn properly
they fit inside the ear which makes them
discreet with minimal visibility the XP
defender has the added capability of
allowing you to easily open and close
the sound valve with just the push of a
button imagine the power to quickly and
easily reduce bothersome noise around
you and then quickly disable them for
full hearing capability as one of our
five senses the ability to hear is a
precious gift that we need to protect
unfortunately we take our hearing for
granted and as a result one in three
people in America over the age of 65 has
hearing loss loud sounds can occur
long-term damage to your hearing as a
sound enters the ear fluid is pushed
through the cochlea which contains
80,000 hair cells that convert
vibrations into electrical pulses these
pulses are then sent to the audio
receptors of the brain when exposed to
loud noise the hair cells in the cochlea
will receive a reparable damage causing
permanent hearing loss for you these
innovative plugs are the stylish and
convenient solution for hearing
protection and reduction when you need
it the most support this product today
to receive these innovative ear plugs at
a discounted price and
for the rest of the market does thank
you for your there the most convenient
piece of footwear we own we all have
memories wearing them out on the beach
on vacation out on the hot sunny day but
a sandal is not some of you unaware all
day because they're really bad for your
feet they're mass-manufactured made for
no one in particular and they use the
cheapest materials they can find just to
get something you can put on and off the
ones that do offer some kind of support
really falls short because they're not
actually custom and we just said well we
can fix that introducing the world's
first custom fit sandal captured from
your smartphone using the photos
submitted through our app our technology
digitally maps each foot with over 200
points in the arch the heel and the top
of foot this data is used to create a
biomechanical enhanced sandal that is
truly custom to your Anatomy in every
way the leading feature of the sandal is
the custom arch support leveraging 3d
printing technology every arch is
completely custom person-to-person left
foot to right foot one of the biggest
complaints of sandal wears is how
annoying the toe fungus we've completely
reinvented the toe foam construction
making it ultra durable and more
comfortable and based on the width of
your foot we know where to place the toe
phone within two millimeters of accuracy
one of the things that helps us take
advantage of the custom arch support is
the deep contoured heel cup we use a
triple density foam and a really soft
drop-in footbed that helps contour the
foot and absorb heel strike another
feature that makes a sandal custom is an
interchangeable strap system the ability
to adjust the strap position based on
foot volume helps ensure a perfect fit
every time the straps are also
interchangeable to fit your taste and
personal style making it a saemmul you
can wear for any occasion we're
celebrating what makes a sandal easy and
comfortable while also factoring in
sustainability we've sourced a premium
material that feels great the moment you
put it on and it's 100% closed-loop
recyclable by 3d printing and assembling
in San Diego California it allows us to
reduce our carbon footprint and deliver
to your doorstep faster we were done a
variety of studies with our custom in
size only found dramatic evidence that
custom makes a huge difference for
running economy by maximum pronation
angles your ankle stability and so on
besides we've learned through the insole
project is being applied to the sandal
weaves end-to-end technology stack
represents probably the biggest leap in
footwear in the last 50 years we've got
a software system which can not only
take foot shape but it can also take
their preferences their size their shape
we mix that in with a system which
allows us to have conventionally
manufactured pieces that integrate with
those 3d printed parts to make it the
best shoe it possibly can be for them
one of the things I really enjoyed about
working with weave is the bigger vision
that they have for what Footwear can be
they combine technology 3d printing with
solid innovative design in an
interactive way that no other product on
the market does right now the kicks our
community's been great to us we launched
our first product at custom 3d printed
insole not knowing what would happen and
we became the most funded 3d printed
product ever people love having the
custom support in their shoes but they
can't get it with their sandal the thing
they wear all the time and as we started
to talk to more customers we kept
hearing a theme hey can you make a
custom flip-flop my insoles are awesome
oh so it was kind of like okay it's a
no-brainer we're gonna go do a sandal by
having an entire unique products that
ensures that your body moves correct
loads itself correctly you significantly
reduce the strains and stresses that you
put on your body and that can prevent
you from incurring injuries in the
future but it can also improve your
performance today
Kickstarter we're coming to you today
because we need your help we spent the
last 15 months creating the sandal we
have material source and process is
defined and we need the funds to get
first units out to production like last
time we'll ship on schedule what the
first pair is arriving this summer we
believe this will be the best sandal
you'll ever wear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
