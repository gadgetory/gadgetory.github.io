hey this is Jared Greene I'm one of the
cofounders of pod straps I'm going to
take you behind the scenes as we go for
the first time and pair our pod straps
with the new Apple earpods which
released in stores last week you'll see
a picture at the beginning of an Apple
employee sporting our new pod straps
with the air pods he was demoing them
with us we took the opportunity to make
sure the fit was tight which it was make
sure that the straps fit properly around
our neck and we already decided to
lengthen the straps
and the port cinch will allow a person
of any size to adjust the fit perfectly
for them and we think it's a great
product
introducing the mango magnet snap grip
mount in the box you'll find user
instructions for metal plates and two
magnets and app grip mounts the mount
can be applied to nearly any flat
surface to install the magna snap grip
mount find a surfaces flat to apply the
adhesive mount to clean the surface and
let it dry remove the sticker from the
back of the adhesive strip and push the
mount firmly into the desired mounting
area holding for at least two minutes
for the strongest hold allow the
adhesive to bond for at least two hours
before using there are three options to
apply the metal plates adhere the plate
directly to the back of the device place
the metal plate between the battery and
the battery cover or simply place the
plate inside your phone's case your
device is now ready to grip strong with
the mango magna snap grip
you
hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo everyday smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as barrier cases and extra
batteries whether you they're not
portable enough or is to forget we
designed a product so compact that will
follow you everywhere a cable the size
of an inch we call it in charge it's a
very simple product it's so useful that
we believe everybody should own one
that's why one of our main goals was to
keep it affordable
a tiny product at a tiny price we spend
an average 70% of our day next to a USB
port and every time it's a chance to
top-up for batteries there are over five
billion USB ports around the world in
charge will fit in your pocket and you
won't have to fight with tangle cords
ever again thanks to its remarkably
compact design you can snap it onto your
keyring and there's no chance to forget
it at all we spent the last three months
design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket
as a supporter you will get your own in
charge at a special price so please
consider backing our project and share
it with your friends thanks for watching
we really appreciate your support thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
