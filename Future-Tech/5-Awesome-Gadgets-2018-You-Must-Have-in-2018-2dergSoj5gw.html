but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination
and you only need one valid device to
control multiple devices or applications
you can use our presets like letter
Surat your own gestures according to
your preference simply assign gestures
through different scenarios and switch
between them just by moving your hands
our human hand is fantastic they can not
only feel but also manipulate things in
a versatile way the current smartphone
technologies are just putting everything
into small tiny screen which highly
limits and constraint the interactive
areas of our hands Vella works on any
surface so you can clip it anywhere you
like or even design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vella gives you
tracking and multiple text to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone if you are a developer you can
try new ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vella uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal pulses collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on sensing
techniques for Kavya
we are passionate about making tours
which are just human needs by amplifying
human capabilities turning any surface
around here into a remote control
enables many potential possibilities in
our daily lives we have been seen lots
of products in the market but we have
not found any of them capable to track
and to recognize with high probability
with Wella attracts your finger with the
finest precision and transform it into
customized action Weller brings magic to
your daily life we love our smartphones
we take them everywhere we go they help
us plan our day keep in touch with
friends and family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Q simply wrap it into this
tuck away slot and you're good to go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
