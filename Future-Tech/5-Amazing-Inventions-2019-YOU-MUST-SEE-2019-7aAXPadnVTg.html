Plinko was the first product to come out
of Klim technologies we are a young
company a small team of Europeans based
in Hong Kong with the goal to bring
quality electronics at a fair price we
started selling it on the french amazon
marketplace where it quickly became a
best-seller and got great reviews
overheating is a major issue for laptops
it is the number one reason for laptops
to stop working it causes your laptops
components to deteriorate faster which
leads to a lower life expectancy for
your computer the Klim product is an
investment
protecting your laptop against
overheating here's how it works
most laptop coolers blow air toward the
laptop which is not the most effective
since it prevents the hot air from
getting out the Klim cool acts as a
super fan it evacuates the hot air
faster than your laptop can on its own
thus it rapidly lowers your laptop
temperature first you need to pick the
best sleeve try them to place it as best
you can next to the air exhaust mind you
if it doesn't fit perfectly it's no big
deal thanks to the suction effect it
will still be effective proceed to plug
in the USB and press the on button for a
couple of seconds it is simple to use
you plug it in it works you will then
have two options
automatic mode and manual mode what the
automatic mode does is measure the
temperature of the air coming out of
your air exhaust and adjusting the speed
of its fan to make sure your laptop
remains at a reasonable temperature but
if you wish to lower the temperature
further you can use the manual mode and
pick the fans rotation speed yourself it
can go up to 4,000 rotations per minute
based on the acquired momentum for
comparison the fastest cooling pads do
not exceed 1400 rotations per minute
the Clem cool can both display the speed
of the fan and the temperature measured
you can either position the Clem cool or
stick it using our 3m adhesive band
though the Clem cool is better suited
for use on a flat surface such as a
desktop or table if all of this seems a
bit confusing we provide a complete
manual in your language whether you have
an old laptop that is getting a bit too
hot or you're an avid gamer and wish to
maximize the lifetime of your high-end
laptop the clincal will meet your needs
the efficiency can vary from model to
model but based on our tests on more
than 150 laptops we measured an average
temperature job of 17.5 degrees on the
processor
additionally the Clem call is rather
quiet and will rarely make more noise
than the laptop itself one big issue
with cooling pads is it they're big and
heavy our product fits into your hand
and weighs a hundred and fifty-five
grams you can carry it with you anywhere
you wish at Clem we pride ourselves on
our customer support every inquiry will
be answered and we will provide a
special two year warranty it's a
risk-free purchase if you wish to
purchase the Clem core you will find the
link to our Amazon store in the video's
description if you have any questions
feel free to ask them in the comments we
will answer them as fast as possible
