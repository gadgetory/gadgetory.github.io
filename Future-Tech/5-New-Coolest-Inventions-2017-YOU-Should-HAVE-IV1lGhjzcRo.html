watch in a medical quality device it's
made of leather and metal it's very easy
to wear and it is a ring that
illuminates time but hours in minutes in
today's world the nonstop action is
tough to achieve the right balance
embrace makes it very easy to monitor
physiological stress arousal sleep and

during their lifetime everybody with
epilepsy should be able to have a device
that alerts a friend or a family member
to come help at the time that they might
need it
this device will measure both movement
and physiological signals the
combination is likely to be very
important for detecting potentially
life-threatening seizures these sensors
and algorithms were originally developed
here at the MIT Media Lab we learned
that combining the stress data we could
sense from the rest with the activity
data led to the most accurate seizure
detection
we have been working on a medical
quality wearable for many years our III
sensor is being used by the top
physicians and scientists in the world
to acquire clinical quality data for
their studies no other device on the
market today can do anything like this
now we are making a brace so that
everyone can benefit from our technology
we've done a lot of work with a truly
passionate team that believes in this
project many of you have asked for a
device like this and here we are also
thanks to IndieGoGo in the Epilepsy
Foundation but we need your help and
support to make this product a reality
together we can make the difference in
the lives of 3 million Americans and 65
million people worldwide
they live with epilepsy this is what
we'll do for every brace you buy will
donate one to a Charlie suffers from
epilepsy and they cannot afford the
device so you get a gorgeous and useful
watch and a child gets a better life
because of you we are on the verge of a
new era of innovation
it will really find the way we live
