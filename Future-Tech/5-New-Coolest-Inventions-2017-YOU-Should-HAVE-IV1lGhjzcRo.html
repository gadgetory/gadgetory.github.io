that alerts a friend or a family member
to come help at the time that they might
need it
this device will measure both movement
and physiological signals the
combination is likely to be very
important for detecting potentially
life-threatening seizures these sensors
and algorithms were originally developed
here at the MIT Media Lab we learned
that combining the stress data we could
sense from the rest with the activity
data led to the most accurate seizure
detection
we have been working on a medical
quality wearable for many years our III
sensor is being used by the top
physicians and scientists in the world
to acquire clinical quality data for
their studies no other device on the
market today can do anything like this
now we are making a brace so that
everyone can benefit from our technology
we've done a lot of work with a truly
passionate team that believes in this
project many of you have asked for a
device like this and here we are also
thanks to IndieGoGo in the Epilepsy
Foundation but we need your help and
support to make this product a reality

million people worldwide

we'll do for every brace you buy will
donate one to a Charlie suffers from
epilepsy and they cannot afford the
device so you get a gorgeous and useful
watch and a child gets a better life
