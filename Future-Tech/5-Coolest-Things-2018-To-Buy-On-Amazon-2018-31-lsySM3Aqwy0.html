an important part of managing a wide
variety of health care conditions that's
why doing this accurately is so
important
introducing the Accu tensions death oh
it's the world's first calibrator for
automatic blood pressure monitors and
working with a smartphone app Stephan
lets you check the accuracy and
discrepancies of the home blood pressure
monitors you already use using it
couldn't be easier
simply plug one end into your smartphone
put on your blood pressure cuff and tuck
sit at those head onto your artery
beneath the cuff next start the app
enter calibrate and start your blood
pressure machine focusing the video
screen on it from your smartphone once
the numbers begin to decrease and as
your cuff deflate s-- press the record
button keeping the numbers on the video
screen within the app once deflation
stops hit the record button again and
you're ready to determine your precise
accurate blood pressure press playback
to listen to the sounds yourself to
double check once you do this take a
moment to slide your finger along the
progress bar and you'll see the exact
cuff pressure that corresponds to the
sound you heard the higher number the
one that's visible when the sound first
appears is your systolic blood pressure
and the lower number the last number you
see just after the sound stops is your
diastolic blood pressure you'll now have
both your systolic and diastolic blood
pressure numbers you're done the act
hello and welcome to sky buds
hi my name is Brian men and for those of
us who truly enjoy the tactile act of
typing I'm gonna show you a project that
is guaranteed to bring back a bit of fun
and excitement back to your desktop
computing experience you know as a game
developer I spent a lot of time on my
computer typing a lot so I thought I
want more out of this device that I use
every day to connect with everyone
that's important in my life now I've
been fascinated with vintage typewriters
for some time and I gotta say they are
just beautiful on the other hand I've
been completely obsessed with modern
mechanical keyboards mechanical
keyboards feature individual switches
and will give you the kind of tactile
feedback that will make you smile so I
thought if I could somehow merge the two
now that will be fun and the beautiful
it all started with an old discarded
keyboard in my garage all the way to
modding a very popular off-the-shelf
gaming keyboard
eventually I built an entirely
conceptual keyboard combining elements
from a real typewriter for the modern
mechanical keyboard finally that
prototype resulted in a brand new hybrid
mechanical keyboard that is both fun to
type on and beautiful to look at so now
I present to you the quirky writer the
porky rider is an 84 key USB typewriter
inspired mechanical keyboard it's fun to
type on and beautiful to look at
it's even got a place to stand your
favorite tablet the return bar is
cosmetic but I plan on enabling
additional functionalities depending
upon the success of our crowdfunding
including Bluetooth and wireless
capabilities so this is where I'm in the
project I need to raise enough funds for
a final iteration and engineering pass
on the production prototype tooling
costs four key caps in the frame and the
final assembly
this is where you the backers come in we
can partner together to see this project
come to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
