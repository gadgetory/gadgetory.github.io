is fascinating an immersive flying
experience it is a drum without remote
control simplify your filling and tilt
reform to control positioned in
direction if you want to fly forward
just a tilt forward how do you fall flat
in the drum will remain in that exact
position using advanced ad lined and
sensor technology for this reason we
have named our flagship flight mode
avatar flying the ghost roan is super
easy because all you have to do is just
tell your smartphone to control it a lot
of times remote controls can be tricky
and hard to use and you're not sure
which way to move this things as for
controlling the gimbal it doesn't use
dials on remote controller anymore it
has been integrated with VR goggles
looking up and down what do you see is
what I get I have no I can't even swipe
my computer clean but anyways I flew
this just held the phone and tilted it
and it did whatever I wanted I looked
around in a camera move from takeoff to
Waypoint from orbit mode to selfie mode
even those maneuvers that take two
operators with remote control all of
these functions have been integrated
into even play app what's more you can
download the videos and pictures from
the 4k spherical camera through Wi-Fi
and share them to your social media oh
so you can keep your stories of flying
in flying records and flight rankings
similar to driving cars some people
prefer a manual transmission and other
automatic we like to think of ghosts
drawn as an automatic transmission
flying experience making
save inconvenient for anyone to fly with
zero experience required the Mavic pro
is not just a new drone it's a whole new
type of drone we merged power and smart
features making it easy for everyone to
fly and create beautiful images the
toughest challenge for us was to find
the sweet spots between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible we really wanted to make it
quick to unfold and leave enough room
for the powerful processors and system
system this took several attempts and
many many prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space when
folded almost two-thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals
this meant the Mavic was much larger
than we wanted and another attempt the
Amazonia took up half the volume but
there's a lot of wasted space in between
body and arms eventually we solved this
problem and creates an easy flick to
unfold mechanism seam from above the
Phenom sit flush against the body when
folded we carved out two indents at the
rear of the airframe to fit the motors
saving additional space the rear arms
fold out in a three-dimensional motion
and snap into place in one sweep with
this design you can have your maverick
Pro unfolded in under five seconds
powerful components generate a lot of
heat especially when they're placed
close together so for the first time
ever on a DJI drone we integrated a heat
sink at the base made from magnesium
aluminum alloy and a centrifugal fan
behind the gimbal
the fan pulls in air from the front of
the aircraft and channels it across the
heatsink anticipating heat we wouldn't
go through all this trouble without
making sure you have a great camera we
spent thousands of hours trying to
region air and shrink the stabilization
technology found in our phantom series
one of the major challenges we ran into
when making a stabilized camera this
small was a stiffness of the electrical
wires the mechanics the structure and
the brushless motors had to be
specifically engineered to take this
into account plus it's the first DJ
camera that's able to rotate 90 degrees
for portrait shots we also wanted a
remote controller for the maverick pro
that would feel natural and familiar in
people's hands so they would be more
confident when they fly that's how we
came up with a small controller that
expands with a pair of grips these grips
also clamp your phone keeping all of
your controls in easy reach the Maverick
pro concentrates some of our most
advanced technologies into one compact
body it's an incredible tool to turn
everyday moments into fantastic art
wherever you go
meet spark small colorful smart a
powerful flying camera that you can take
anywhere it's so clever it activates by
recognizing you just launch it from the
palm of your hand
it even returns when you call it and
land like this easy can't get everyone
in the shot no problem watch as it
hovers precisely in place always at your
command control it with your hands
remote controller mobile device or DJI
goggles using GPS spark knows where it
is even if you don't it'll even sense
obstacles to avoid things in front of it
and come home safely
think you got smooth moves Sparks
footage is smoother it takes the shake
out of your shot so you look like a pro
not feeling the control sticks performed
preset flight maneuvers with a single
click and get those epic shots
here's a way to stand out from the crowd
spark automatically adds shallow
depth-of-field to your photos if you
don't know how to fly
just tap fly let's see if you can handle
sport mode
spark keeps you in the frame so all you
need to do is act naturally
edit your epic videos and share them
instantly
spark your aerial creativity anywhere
all you need to do is seize the moment
what do you need for incredible aerial
imaging a brilliant camera an aircraft
you can trust and the intelligence to
make every shot cinematic the new
phantom 4 Pro has all this and much more
The Phantom 4 pro camera has an F 2.8
apertures mechanical shutter and large
one-inch sensor coming together to make
brighter more detailed imagery record
cinematic 4k video at higher bit rates
with more advanced compression and a
wider dynamic range 4k 60 frames per
second recording gives you stunning
detailed slow-motion aerial video the
phantom 4 pro is as adept at stills as
it is with video capturing every detail
at 20 megapixels its mechanical shutter
eliminates rolling shutter bending grab
the perfect moment using burst mode
all of this makes the phantom4 pro the
most advanced aerial camera ever found
in the Phantom series The Phantom 4 pro
is now a huge step forward I'm taking
photos of the lava when it's darker out
and the glow of the lavas coming off of
it the image sensor that's in this
camera now is 1/f sensor 20 megapixels
that extra dynamic range allows me to
really get everything into one shot in
landscape that's extremely important see
your shot clearly even in direct
sunlight with the new ultra bright 5.5
inch monitor that's more than twice as
bright as most tablets inside is DJI
light bridge technology it automatically
detects interference and switches from
two point four to five point eight
gigahertz transmission and takeoff
cutting through the noise for more
reliability the built-in monitor on the
Phantom 4 Pro is so bright I'm actually
able to see in direct sunlight and
that's really allowing me to compose my
shot and get what I really want to
capture active Trek has now been
expanded with three new intelligent
flight modes profile tracks your subject
horizontally from any side spotlight
locks the camera on a subject while you
fly in almost any direction circle
swings 360 degrees around the subject
Tapp fly has also been improved adding
reverse tap fly making it perfect for
aerial selfies flying The Phantom 4 pro
is even more worryfree a set of rear
visual sensors has been added to
existing forward and downward sensors
combined with new infrared obstacle
sensors on its sides the Phantom 4 Pro
has five directions of sensing if image
signal is lost it returns home while
dynamically avoiding obstacles and even
flies back along its original flight
path until signal is regained every
minute in the air counts the new
high-capacity battery flight time has
been increased to 30 minutes when it
comes to speed the Phantom 4 Pro is ten
miles per hour faster with full support
of its obstacle sensing systems
with it's stunning camera 1 inch sensor
ultra bright monitor obstacle sensing
and intelligence the phantom 4 pro
brings professional quality aerial
imaging and flight capabilities to more
pilots around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
