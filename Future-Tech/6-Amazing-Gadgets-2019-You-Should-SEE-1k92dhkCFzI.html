people across the world we need your
support to make the dream this is filter
it may not look like much but this small
device solves some very large problems
we live in a time where everything you
do online is monitored tracked or
censored just because you don't have
anything to hide doesn't mean you don't
deserve privacy finding a way to stay
private and secure is not such an easy
task services are fragmented and none
provide coverage on multiple devices
making it a hassle to stay protected
we created filter in order to make
privacy and security more accessible and
easier to use Filton provides VPN
support ad blocking capability and tor
anonymity and all the devices in your
home this is especially important for
devices that don't normally support
these applications like gaming consoles
smart TVs and media players those who
not only protects you from unwanted ad
targeting but to prevents companies
governments and internet providers from
seeing more personal information like
your web activity searches and even
physical location in VPN mode filter
uses enterprise-grade encryption to
protect all the devices in your homes
volcania sleep this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters app is incredibly
easy to use
select the VPN setting the region you'd
like to connect to or automatic for the
speediest connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings filter also does
the job of blocking advertisements
dangerous websites trackers and malware
infected advertising is a huge threat
and annoyance with filter you'll never
have to see him luscious to add again to
stay ahead of threats all security
features and lists are kept up to date
automatically you can choose what you
want to have updated or turn this off at
any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier
run all of your network traffic through
filters simply by connecting it between
any modem and router filter will start
working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet filter is ultra portable and
can even be powered off an external
battery even if you're in a public area
you don't have to worry about saying
secure and finding power we have a great
idea and an industrious team working to
make filter the best it can be
but we need your help we need to meet
manufacturing requirements and volume in
order to make filter affordable for
everyone we hope you'll support us and
help spread the word about our campaign

us closer to our goal to make your
