ago we ventured out to create a small
wireless device to help you keep track
of your items using a smartphone since
that time we've worked tirelessly to
perfect the technology today we're proud
to announce tracker Bravo the simplest
way to track all your items tracker
Bravo is a coin size device that easily
attaches to a purse slips inside the
wallet sticks to a bike or attaches to
anything you would like to track
using the tracker' app you can see how
far away you are from your items and
with the tap of your finger you can ring
the device and find the lost item in
seconds and it works both ways
if you can't find your phone press the
button on the device and cause your
phone to ring even on silent mode
in case something goes missing the app
notifies our crowd GPS Network to search
for your lost item if your item comes
within 100 feet of one of our millions
of users you will receive a GPS update
of where your item was last seen tracker
Bravo your search is over
for the past one and a half year we have
been researching developing and
exploring how new technologies can
disrupt a mobile gaming sector the
limitation with mobile gaming isn't
actually computing power its fingers
hiding their screen and in accuracy of
control the controls are not accurate
because there is no tactile feedback no
sense that you are pushing a button or
moving a drastic using a gamepad
controller with the phone isn't the
answer either the controllers need to be
part of the phone for a gaming
revolution to really take place that's
why we created Fletcher the first
smartphone case with a built in game
controller
falesha uses the unused space on the
back of your phone transforming your
phone to a controller in a revolutionary
shift the controls are pressure
sensitive so the harder you press the
faster you will punch fire or run so to
make feature instantly accessible we
needed to make it as simple as possible
so we made it battery less and connector
free we use NFC technology and the idle
power of the phone for each game you can
customize the controls mapping you
define which button does what the main
challenge was sighs getting the
technology into the space still the
thickness of your standard everyday
phone case what we wanted was the
functionality of a normal joystick we
had to design something that was super
slim but the final product must be
simple and intuitive to use as reviews
different surface finishes and textures
to help navigate your fingers around the
back of the controller playing
first-person shooter games on a
touchscreen has never really felt right
but thanks to Fletcher's dual control
sticks this is actually no longer the
case every game our testers have played
with flick show they've said is actually
better than playing with touchscreen
control just as an example it's really
easy to steer a car in something like GT
racing or even control our Croft in Tomb
Raider you really feel like you're much
closer to the console version
Fletcher is also a really exciting
opportunity for game developers game
developers can explore tactile feedback
and a whole host of other future gaming
possibilities and for other app
developers Fletcher provides a whole new
user interface on the back of the phone
they can use the software development
kit to enhance the functionality of
their existing apps for example you
could take a selfie with the back of the
phone you could explore browsing zooming
controlling music there's a whole host
of possibilities to be explored and what
we really love about this is when you
get it in your hand it feels really
solid its high-quality it's got a good
grip and you get it and you just wanna
stop playing we have built tweaked and
tested six iterations of prototype over
the last one and a half years all of the
research and development to create this
fully functioning prototype has been
funded by us friends family and groans
from innovate UK now we need your help
to start manufacturing furniture we are
really excited about making mobile
gaming better please back us and a
spreadable
my name is Olivia Latimer and I am a
lifestyle photographer and vlogger
I'm inspired to create by those around
me who are creating and striving to
achieve their goals
I'm also heavily inspired by colors and
textures and just the world around me so
that is why I love shooting outdoors in
nature I originally got a camera because
I wanted to start vlogging on YouTube
and make youtube videos so I did that
for a while until a couple friends of
mine were like hey you have a camera why
aren't you taking pictures so from then
on I started taking pictures of my
friends family people around me and it's
become a passion of mine that has
fortunately turned into a career we're
out here parked on the side of the road
coming to the one and only my favorite
house most of the time when I'm vlogging
I'm shooting with the front camera which
is super tight and doesn't really let
anyone see what's going on around me and
that's why I love using
olloclip because it allows me to have a
wider angle on the front and rear camera
to show people a writer field of view
right now what if the bad were to stop
the wall yep the bad words so on the
wall so we're not gonna go in there
shooting on mobile is super convenient
as I always have my phone on me and for
those days and I don't want to carry
around my larger DSLR camera it's easy
to pick up my phone to capture day to
day moments with all Eclipse Connect
system I'm able to create the perfect
combination for vlogging with an ultra
wide lens on the front camera and the
right angle lens
I love vlogging my photo adventures
because I love giving my audience in
inside take as to what it's really like
when I'm out exploring taking photos as
it's not always as glamorous as it seems
with a lifestyle that revolves around
photo and video / clip lenses gives me a
field of view I just can't get from my
iPhone alone I said to this photo which
I have posted this photo like a million
times already before but true that right
there good stuff good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
