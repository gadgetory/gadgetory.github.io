we spend about 90% of our time indoors
and the air we breathe in here is 2 to 5
times more polluted than outdoors
imagine all the chemicals dust and toxic
gases trapped in a room nowhere to go
and the worst part is we do nothing
about it simply because you don't know
you who is a smart indoor air quality
sensor that detects and alerts you of
allergens and toxins in the air you
breathe think of the places you and your
loved ones spend the most time in do you
know the quality of the air in your
office at work in your hotel room when
you travel how about in your own living
room or your child's bedroom these are
important because VOCs are found in
paint and household cleaning products
dust can accumulate unseen in fabric
around us and humidity encourages the
growth of bacteria and mold all these
cause respiratory problems skin
irritations and overall poor health in
the long run you who let you know when
something's not right and what you can
do the simplest and easiest things to do
make the biggest difference cut down on
chemical cleaners wash your child's
favorite toys air out your living areas
and check on possible gas leaks don't
leave it to chance or guesswork you who
keeps track of the air you breathe
round-the-clock so that you and your
loved ones get to live work and play in
the best and safest possible environment
it is the most comprehensive indoor air
quality detector on the market today
with eight dedicated sensors that detect
volatile organic compounds dust carbon
monoxide carbon dioxide ozone air
pressure temperature and humidity hi I'm
Dustin co-founder of U and there's a
very simple reason why we created you is
there's a real need for the air we
breathe affects all of us why do we
spend so much energy and money on
nutrients and supplements and yet ignore
the air that we breathe we spoke to
numerous professionals who are otherwise
healthy with all his fatigue we heard
from asthma sufferers who have
persistent symptoms and travellers who
fall ill because the air quality in
their hotel rooms are not of optimal
levels we also heard from parents who
always worried about what their kids are
exposed to both at home and in school
and the thing is we can fix what we
don't know and there has never been an
easy and affordable way to point out
until now
with yoo-hoo your world just got a
little safer and you and your family
just got healthier from the moment our
baby enters our lives we follow its
every move admiring each smile sound and
smell but then we have to go back to
work leaving it to the care of others
and we not only miss them but we also
miss out on so many precious moments
memories that will never return
that's why we've developed in video the
first intelligent monitor in the world
that uses both face and emotion
recognition technology and identifies
important events in your child's day to
create a daily magic moments clip so
you'll never miss a magic moment again
but that's not all and video is packed
with so many more incredible features
that turn it into the most advanced
monitor ever built it notifies you when
your kids return from school or when an
unrecognized person enters the room
it monitors the air quality humidity and
temperature of the room it sends alerts
when your child is crying and you can
speak through it from anywhere you are
you can even see your baby at night and
have it automatically play their
favorite lullaby and best of all using
smile detection we store all of those
lovely smiles for years instead of
watching hours of footage each day to
see if something significant happened in
video automatically finds these moments
for you creating a short clip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
