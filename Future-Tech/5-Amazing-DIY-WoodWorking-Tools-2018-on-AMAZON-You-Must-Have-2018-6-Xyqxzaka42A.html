by holding the button upwards to adjust

your horizontal and vertical marks using
the edges of the reveal gauge scale the
front and back of the trim 45 are used
to make all marks or measurements for
your jams and trim casings then repeat
this for all four corners then to
measure for your projects trim nail the

holes just above the reveal gauge to
insert nails then using the tape measure
slots in the body the trim 45 measure
the distance between your marks to
determine the finish trim length
to help hold the tape measure in place
there's two magnets next to each of the
tape measure slots after you've measured
the length to your trim pieces set your
miter saw for a 45 degree cut and cut
one end of the trim casing then using
that 45-degree end you just cut use the
built-in trim plate to clamp your 45
degree miter cut piece onto the trim

the trim 45 over and make a 45-degree
angle mark on the trim at the finish
length using the 45 degree angle head
your mark should start at the corner of
the reveal gauge and follow the 45
degree angle after marking the finished
length cut the trim along the angle mark
repeat the cutting action for the
remaining trim pieces and then install
