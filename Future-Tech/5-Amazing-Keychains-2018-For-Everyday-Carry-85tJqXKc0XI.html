consistent blow is best there is a
miniature air pump inside the mobile

sample you can actually feel the click
at the end of your test this proprietary
breath capture system ensures that only
a precise breath sample enters the
alcohol sensor while ambient air and
external pollutants are kept out your

screen along with a short summary of how
alcohol is likely affecting you at this
point after clicking ok the next screen
shows your zero line this is an estimate
of when your BAC will return to zero you

screens which give you more information
about your BAC level your past BAC
results as well as an option to add
drink notes info
