introduce to you the first and only
spray that uses real butter and goes
from butter stick to butter spray in
just a few seconds it's called
bean
if you love cooking eating and
entertaining like I do then you probably
love using real butter I've been
involved in launching a number of
healthy food brands Benito's for one and
I've also been around long enough to
remember when butter was given a bad rap
and we were all told to eat margarine
and now we know that margarine didn't
have such a great impact on our health
just like you I like to use real butter
while I'm cooking or just eating toast
but the problem with butter is that when
people keep it in the fridge it's always
hard cold it tears up the toasts or if
you're cooking with it by the time it
melts in the pan you burn it so we've
decided to invent a better way to store
and use butter and here it is the bean
butter sprayer we created the beam with
a team of world-class engineers from San
Francisco we wanted something that was
beautiful simple and easy to use
something that you'd be proud of to have
in your kitchen or dining room and we
think we've done it just insert a stick
of butter here and in seconds being
liquefies only the butter you need not
the whole stick and you're ready to
spray in a steady even feeding you can
bean pans for cooking and food release
you can beam bread and rolls or make the
perfect grilled cheese sandwich you can
beam vegetables with just the right
amount of butter and my favorite bean
popcorn for perfect coverage without
getting soggy you can even use the bean
with your favorite cooking wheels even
coconut oil if that's what you like the
beam has a patent-pending nozzle design
that won't clog and a high-density
rechargeable battery you can store it on
the countertop or in the fridge it's
easy to clean with water and a drop of
detergent and it rinses clean with just
the push of a button we've spent the
last two years in design and research to
perfect the spray the reliability and a
long life of the beam and now we're
nearly ready for production we're asking
food lovers like you people who are
passionate about having real butter at
their finger
to join us your support will help us
fund our tooling and set up our initial
manufacturing run of the beam
please join us by supporting beam and
help bring our passion for real butter
to your kitchen thanks
this is the American press born in
Chicago and raised in Detroit the second
nearly five years and every petty
friends and family will integrate it
originally I was inspired by solving the
problem of coffee presses that were
messy and frustrating to clean and pod
based Brewers that were best free but
provided no connection with the brewing
experience and generated thousands of
tons playboys
along the way I discovered the visual
beauty of cramping hand press coffee was
an American press watching water
transform into coffee as you press it
it's really unlike anything you've seen
or experienced before it's a hands-on
experience that engages sight and touch
an anticipation of the smell and taste
of fresh brewed coffee the coffee itself
is clean and complex with aromas and
flavors preserved by forcing water
through an enclosed reusable pod and an
ultrafine little filter setup is quick
and easy and because the American press
brews as you press there's no waiting
just press import and when you're done
through to solving the original problem
that inspired us our patented reusable
pod technology keeps must contain and
waste out of landfills so the American
press is easy to clean and eco-friendly
too it also offers the hand side control
casters look the American press quite
literally put green control in your
hands you control the speed pressure and
timing of extraction the way you want
and now after working for years to
create a machine that will make
high-quality coffee as enjoyable as
drinking it there's just one step left
we need to raise most of the money
required for tooling and our first
production run and we genuinely need
your help so please back our campaign
now and join us as we work to finish
during the idea of the American press
into a reality

what a lot of trips I go on vacations I
go visit my kids around the country and
on business meetings and traveling for
me is always been a nightmare for the
people behind me in the security line
and the people behind me as I'm getting
to my seat in an airplane Global Travel
clothing company has come up with the
answer to my issues they've designed a
jacket with all kinds of pockets it's
called the Joey jacket this jacket is
designed with so many different pockets
that I can get organized and just take
my jacket with me on the plane when I
get to the security line I just take the
jacket off and put it on that belt
that's how you make friends with your
neighbors when I get to the plane and
get to my seat I just take my jacket
with me and have it near me with
everything in the pocket I used to have
to dig around in my carry-on to get
exactly what I needed for the trip with
the Joey jacket I can just put those
things in those pockets for everything I
need on my trip I like to have a book or
magazine for takeoff and I like my iPad
to use during the trip
I need my chargers I need my wallet and
I need to hide my wallet with this Joey
jacket I no longer have to carry a purse
around my shoulder which makes me so
much more free when I'm traveling the
Joey jacket is lightweight sturdy and
weather resistant I like it with the
fleece lining because that keeps me
really warm when it's cold on an
airplane or in an airport it has many
kinds of pockets in it there are two
that's for iPad or books there are two
other hidden pockets that keep valuables
and there's even velcro in them so you
can separate what's in that pocket
there's two water bottle straps so you
can keep a water right on you without
having to hold it I love the compartment
for my iPhone that you thread your
earphones through and it threads all the
way so it's coming right out near your
neck so it's handy there's an eyeglass
in the sunglass pocket with a microfiber
cloths so you can clean your glasses
every time you take them out there's a
built-in I'm asked to sleep in darkness
on your trips the jacket has zip off
sleeves so if it gets hot just take your
sleeves off and put them in the pockets
there's also side vents it comes with a
detachable hood for the times you don't
need a hood the luggage strap that's
built in makes it so you don't always
have to carry your jacket
this Dewey jacket is great for all trips
trains planes or automobiles as a
seasoned traveler I really love mine and
I know you will too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
