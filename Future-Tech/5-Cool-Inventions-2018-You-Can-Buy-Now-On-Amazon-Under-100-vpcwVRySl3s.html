Oh
you
we put a lot of energy into our days
what if we could get some of that energy
back ampe is a wearable device that
captures the energy from your motion
throughout the day and turns it into
power for your phone your movement is
your power and that's about it that's
that's all there is to it wait cut
that's it yeah you you move and your
plug this is supposed to be a 3-minute
video you're killing me tages Mike and I
met during our engineering PhDs at
Northwestern we all had the same problem
our phones would die before the end of
the day so many people have this problem
over the past year and a half we've
refined the technology inside NP we have
optimized the power generation
components to the point where you can
still produce significant power while
maintaining a small form factor you
don't need to be an athlete any motion
will charge it we knew we were onto
something when MP kept winning crowd
favorite prizes of business competitions
everyone kept asking if they could get
one people love the idea of taking
control over their charging habits it
frees them from the wall and motivates
them to get moving ampe is designed to
just fit into your life its shape
matches the curves of your body and it's
easy to slip into your pocket or pop
into your purse if you live in a city
you probably walk enough to extend your
phone's battery life by three hours if
you also go on a run or maybe go cycling
you can extend it by six hours the more
you move the more power you get or you
can use ampe to charge your wearable
devices or any other device the charges
via USB but you don't need to use the
power right away you can store it for
however long you want and use it when
your device is needed most now we know
that everyone's different and some
people move in some pretty creative ways
so we've designed an accessory kit that
lets you move just about any way you
want we can't wait to hear how you use
Andy
if you want to know how much power
you're getting out you can check the
Companions marks on it it lets you track
the energy you've generated along with
the calories you burn with ampe you're
producing green energy we've got fully
functional prototypes being tested by
our pilot customers and they love them
we're continuously collecting feedback
and making improvements but now we need
your support for the final step to move
ampe towards full-scale manufacturing
we're so excited about what's to come
one day our technology can be integrated
directly into smartwatches fitness
trackers and other crazy wearables that
haven't been invented yet so you never
have to put them in but it all starts
now so join us help us bring auntie to
the world
that better uh yeah can I get one
your home is your sanctuary worth
protecting but it's filled with smart
devices that can actually open you to
intruders over seventy percent of
internet-connected devices in your home
are vulnerable to attacks and criminals
can use them to invade your privacy and
they can steal your property identity
and sense of security they can even turn
your home into a hub for illegal
activity without you knowing not cool
safeguard your home with Cujo one device
that protects you against hacks viruses
and malware just plug in Cujo to keep
your entire home secure virtually and
physically it learns how the devices in
your home behave using machine learning
when something's wrong it automatically
blocks the threat so you're connected
life is protected and you're free to be
cool Cujo cool get Cujo now that's Karma
