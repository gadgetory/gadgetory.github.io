water is the fundamental source of life
and we all want to be sure we are
drinking the best water possible Mitter
created the world's first smart water
system that delivers you safe and
healthy water inspired by nature mitr
reproduces the natural water cycle
through evaporation
condensation
and mineralization meter brings you
healthy water directly in your kitchen
healthy waters through things clean
purified water and enhanced with
minerals
mitr gets rid of everything bad and puts
a lot of good in it
Mita has been designed and tested going
through a thousand hours of 3d printing
for working prototypes just to arrive at
the final model and to make sure that
you get the healthiest water meters
proprietary purification technology
first rules all the contaminants like
bacterias and viruses even hormones and
nitrates water from it is 60 times
cleaner than from a picture filter and
three times cleaner than a reverse
osmosis system after purification the
waters and hands through a mineral
cartridge you can personalize the water
you want to drink soft with low minerals
crisp high mineral water and alkaline
with high pH the result is always a
perfectly balanced mineralized water of
your choice maybe you're like Anna and
she wants what's best for children
Mittal helps her difficult the
healthiest and safest water she also
cares about the environment and meter
allows her to get rid of all plastic
bottles
well like Katherine who cares deeply
about her health and well-being she's
obsessed with team and with meter she's
sure it will always be the perfect
temperature
or maybe in from about like Philip who
is passionate about his performance the
minerals and nutrients and the water
flow meter will help him with his diet
and this training he's also a technology
enthusiast with an app that tracks and
monitors the water quality and
automatically since new cartridges
whenever you need them this is what
meter offers the right healthy water for
you
meet Braille the first backpack designed
to make cyclists visible is by commuters
we oftentimes find ourselves under
dangerous situations especially at night
and it's all because we're far less
visible than other vehicles in traffic
and this is Rhett round comes in
inspiron captain herring Joseph round
round comes with a set of LED strips to
allow you to not only be more visible in
traffic but also signal left-to-right
terms to people behind you the LED
strips are controlled with a wireless
controller that allows you to signal
your changes in direction in a very
intuitive way and it also comes with a
built-in accelerometer that
automatically flashes a brake lights to
allow people behind you to react in time
Brown is also water resistant so no
matter if it's sunny or raining you will
always be ready to go round is also
great on the inside don't believe me
just watch
but it doesn't in there Brown comes with
a whole set of features to make your
commutes more practical such as an anti
sweat anti-theft design in a highly
efficient battery that allows you to use
it for three days in a single charge and
also charge any type of smartphone
Romney's patent registered and ready for
production by pledging to our campaign
you'll be one of the first to receive
our backpack at an LED scan and allow us
to perfect it for mass production we
believe in a world where worlds are
safer for cyclists around is just a
beginning thank you so much for your
support
be safe this is Jack Jack and his wife
love to take vacations but vacations
mean photos and photos mean files lots
of them put that all together and you
have a recipe for disaster in the Attic
heat it up here so do your files so like
most people jack relies on free accounts
from places like Dropbox and Google
Drive just to stay afloat but what if
there was a way to offer truly endless
file storage with speeds never before
seen with no monthly subscription meat
file gear file gear lets you take your
files from your hard drives computers
cloud drives and mobile devices and puts
them all together finally giving you
access to everything you own in one
convenient place once you've connected a
device file gear automatically analyzes
and organizes each and every file into
categories allowing you to browse
through your photos videos music or
documents by date location content and
more honey I found it with file gear
sharing things like photos is a breeze
you can share by links email or by using
the apps you already know and love like
Facebook Instagram and Google+ file gear
can be used by other family members too
so you don't have to pay for multiple
storage accounts for each user now let's
talk about safety we already know that
file gear is way faster than the cloud
but it's also way more secure as well
and that's because your files live right
here at home
hi I'm Doug founder of file gear I
needed a way to organize all
my files without spending a ton of time
to get it done so I teamed up with some
of the world's greatest coders and
engineers and after two years of
development I'm very proud to introduce
you to file here but we need your help
to prepare expensive tooling and place
volume orders for production so be one
of the first to own this groundbreaking
device and finally get a hold of your
digital life so great price incredible
speeds total security and no monthly
fees I'm sold where do I sign up
filed here don't go in the Attic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
