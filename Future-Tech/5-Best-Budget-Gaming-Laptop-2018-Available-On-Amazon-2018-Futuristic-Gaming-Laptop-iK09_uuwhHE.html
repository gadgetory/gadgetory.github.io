light notebook that makes no compromises
and it does so at an incredibly
affordable price the inspiration for the
Indian War 13 really came from this void
that we left in the market after we
introduced the m11 X of new years ago we
knew that we had to bring a solution
that was small that was highly mobile
that had exceptional battery life so we
spent a lot of time going through
different form factors what's the right
screen size and really we've decided on
13 it's the smallest size that a gamer
is willing to accept for a gaming
notebook the Alienware 13 is a really
special notebook I'm a materials
perspective we actually have several
surfaces that are made out of an
aerospace inspired carbon fiber
composite material inside the graphics
card is protected with copper heatsink
it keeps everything cool but maintains a
system in a full-throttle performance
mode the end of our 13 is approximately
40% thinner than the Alienware 14 so we
want thinner but we actually maintain
the performance level we've known that
gamers the first decision they make is
do they want the performance in the
upgradability
of a desktop or they want the mobility
that they usually experience with a
notebook the idea were 13 notebook with
the combination of the ne or graphics
amplifier is one-of-a-kind it's the
first of its kind I'm sure that they'll
leave many imitations of it in the
future
graphics amplifier allows you to include
desktop graphics when you get home with
a single cable you could connect your
notebook to the graphics amplifier that
will feed as many displays as the
graphics card in sight good support
beyond that the graphics amplifier has a
4 port USB 3 hub you could connect all
your peripherals a keyboard a mouse an
external hard drive a webcam or a
joystick
like having a whole desktop the new Amie
our command center has some pretty cool
features as well with inhaling adrenalin
there's a module that allows you to use
the graphics amplifier it'll give you
status on whether or not you're
connected whether it's synced properly
that's really cool when I hold the
Alienware 13 I know that it's a very
sophisticated piece of gaming equipment
I know that I'm handling quality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
