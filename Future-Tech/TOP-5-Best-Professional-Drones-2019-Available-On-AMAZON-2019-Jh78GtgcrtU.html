never miss another of it whether you
create content for a living or just have
a passion for visual storytelling
finding the right tool to express your
vision is crucial when it comes to
capturing aerial content the right tool
must combine the precision of high
resolution imaging and the power of a
solid stable aircraft as a creative
professional you need to capture aerial
imagery in captivating detail with the
precision of the typhoon h + 1 inch high
aperture c-23 camera you can confidently
deliver 4k Ultra high-definition video
and stunning 20 megapixel still images
to exceed your clients expectations you
can depend on the power stability and
safety of the typhoon h + 6 rotor hex
airframe get the job done right every
time even in the windiest of conditions
fly with peace of mind that in case of
emergency your unique hexacopter can
safely return to home on only five
rotors intelligent flight modes like
journey and orbit make it easy to
capture dynamic shots with ease a quick
tap of the button and you can create
advanced cinematic shots efficiently and
reliably provide your clients
professional quality aerial imagery with
the typhoon h + 6 rotor platform you've
just located the ideal vantage point now
it's time to get airborne and capture
the beauty of this place don't let any
obstacles get in your way
the typhoon h plus with intel realsense
technology automatically navigates
obstacles allowing you to focus on
capturing the forest without hitting the
trees looking to add that action shot to
best tell your story
Follow Me mode combined with intel
realsense technology provides a safe way
to capture your subject in action
with its high-precision all-new one-inch
sensor camera an unmatched flight
stability the typhoon h+ is a powerful
tool for today's creative professional
at its lunch the inspire one was a
revolution it turned tens of thousands
of people into aerial filmmakers and now
appears on professional film sets around
the world the inspire tube builds on
this foundation empowering filmmakers to
be more creative than ever
weather flying as a team or operating as
a single pilot a dedicated to axis
stabilized fpv camera with independently
adjustable pitch gives the pilot a
personal live feed bring the camera up
to move any way they need to to get the
shot top speed is boosted to 58 miles
per hour 94 km/h an ascent and descent
is also accelerating this speed doesn't
come without protection
DJI is unmatched flight autonomy system
comes to inspire to bringing with it an
extended range of close to 100 feet
meaning faster flight with protection
from what it conceived it also adds an
infrared sensing system placed on top
the inspire extending obstacle avoidance
to obstructions overhead
the new dual battery design increases
flight time hitting a maximum of 27
minutes when using the x 4's camera and
also provides battery redundancy self
heating systems mean the inspire 2 can
be flown in extreme cold the zenmuse x5
s Micro Four Thirds camera now has a
twenty point eight megapixel sensor with
better pixel performance it is capable
of capturing 5.2 K at 30 frames per
second as well as 4k at 60 frames per
second it also supports cinema DNG and
pro res recording you just kind of look
at you go like that's really small but
how can this little small thing give
these big results normally I wouldn't
think of it using a drone for normal
shots but kind of made this really
simple shot easily you know and look
great and I'm really I'm just I'm
telling you I'm really picky the inspire
2 is DJ focus compatible for precision
focus control a broad range of Micro
Four Thirds lenses are also supported
including zooms from 9 millimeter to 45
millimeter the 45 is pretty beautiful on
this camera we use that a lot for
close-ups and has a great depth of field
and this makes me feel like you know
that's kind of cinematic for me the
inspire 2 image processor known as cynic
or 2.0 offers cinema DNG pro res h.264
and h.265 recording onto a detachable
PCIe SSD drive with a maximum read and
write speed of 6 gigabits per second or
a micro SD card Perez is a widely used
delivery method for post-production
offering flexibility for editing while
not compromising image quality
but to get the absolute most out of what
you shoot be inspired to also captures
wrong acquiring content on raw just
gives you more information to work with
in your post process the raw native
cinema DNG format gives you the most
dynamic range possible of that camera
basically takes full advantage of the
sensor and everything that it can see
there isn't one shot that we compromised
for detail for color purity for
separation of images for black for
low-light detail a highlight detail but
I never could have told you that this
particular footage came from a drum it's
just too good new intelligent modes
including spotlight Pro and profile make
cinematic shots easier for production
teams and even for single operators
spotlight probe keeps the camera locked
on the subject rotating beyond 360
degrees to fix a target in frame as in
spire flies while profile mode turns a
camera to capture the subjects profile
as the inspire flies forward by
maintaining Ford flight obstacle sensing
systems are able to protect the aircraft
the onboard fpv camera separates the
flight view from the main camera view
effectively giving the inspire to a
dedicated tap flight camera just tap on
the screen to fly in that direction and
focus on camera control during return to
home the primary camera with a maximum
sensing range 200 meters is used to
effectively avoid obstructions live TV
broadcasting has also been enabled
natively through an optimized broadcast
mode the strings smooth video at the
1080i50 and 720p 60 live broadcast
standard the inspire 2 brings better
quality images more power and more
intelligence to professional aerial
filmmaking setting the stage for more
filmmakers to take to the sky
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it easy a DJI we
created the flying camera as you know it
and there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small so you can dream big we created
your first personal drone but we're
still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoids obstacles and comes packed with a
4k stabilized camera 27 minute flight
time and a whole lot more this is the
DJI Matic pro and this is the DJI Mavic
pro unfolded to make it this small we
have to rip out a ton of cool stuff
right now
it's got 24 high-performance computing
cores dual satellite connectivity an
all-new transmission system with a 4.3
mile range for vision sensors and more
sound complicated it's not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is captured when you take off
the MAV accuses 2 vision sensors and
connects with up to 20 satellites also
it can remember your location this means
the Mavic knows where home is
so it can return by itself precision
landing technology means it can land
almost exactly where you took off at the
touch of a button as you fly satellite
systems keep track of you working in
harmony with all four vision sensors
telling it what's below and what's in
front
whether you are flying beside a cliff in
a forest or even indoors
just like you Maddox sees and thinks
that means it can avoid the things in
its path from trees to walls any good
flying camera needs stabilization the
Maddox expertly miniaturized gimble
teach the entire camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization you use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and trace or
use tap flight to tap and flock
Terrain follow mode keeps the Mavic at a
height you define as the ground Rises so
you can focus on your shot not your
height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad sized controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel a
neat hole if you don't want to bother
with the controller fly using virtual
joysticks right from your phone over
Wi-Fi whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
track modes are ready to make you shoot
like a pro want to be on camera not
behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture
then there's the new DJI goggle strap
these on to really feel like you're
flying combine them with sport mode to
get your pulse pumping while you fly at
an incredible forty miles per hour once
you've got your shots edit everything
together in DJI go and share or even
stream your flight live to Facebook or
YouTube inspiration can strike from the
smallest thing a sketch a feeling and
experience the Mavic has been designed
for you to take it anywhere ready at a
moment's notice whenever inspiration
strikes you to create something truly
great
DJI Mavic wherever you go what do you
need for incredible aerial imaging a
brilliant camera an aircraft you can
trust and the intelligence to make every
shot cinematic the new phantom 4 Pro has
all this and much more
The Phantom 4 pro camera has an F 2.8
apertures mechanical shutter and large
one-inch sensor coming together to make
brighter more detailed imagery record
cinematic 4k video and higher bit rates
with more advanced compression and a
wider dynamic range 4k 60 frames per
second recording gives you stunning
detailed slow-motion aerial video the
phantom 4 pro is as adept at Stills as
it is with video capturing every detail
at 20 megapixels its mechanical shutter
eliminates rolling shutter bending grab
the perfect moment using burst mode
all of this makes the phantom4 Pro the
most advanced aerial camera ever found
in the Phantom series The Phantom 4 pro
is now a huge step forward I'm taking
photos of the lava when it's darker out
and the glow of the lavas coming off of
it the image sensor that's in this
camera now is one inch sensor 20
megapixels that extra dynamic range
allows me to really get everything into
one shot in a landscape that's extremely
important see your shot clearly even in
direct sunlight with the new ultra
bright 5.5 inch monitor that's more than
twice as bright as most tablets inside
is DJI light bridge technology it
automatically detects interference and
switches from two point four to five
point eight gigahertz transmission and
take off cutting through the noise for
more reliability the built-in monitor on
the Phantom 4 Pro is so bright I'm
actually able to see in direct sunlight
and that's really allowing me to compose
my shot and get what I really want to
capture active Trek has now been
expanded with three new intelligent
flight modes profile tracks your subject
horizontally from any side spotlight
locks the camera on a subject while you
fly in almost any direction circle
swings 360 degrees around the subject
Tapp fly has also been improved adding
reverse tap fly making it perfect for
aerial selfies flying the phantom fourth
row is even more worryfree a set of rear
visual sensors has been added to
existing forward and downward sensors
combined with new infrared obstacle
sensors on its sides the phantom 4 pro
has five directions of sensing if image
signal is lost it returns home while
dynamically avoiding obstacles and even
flies back along its original flight
path until signal is regained every
minute in the air counts the new
high-capacity battery flight time has
been increased to 30 minutes when it
comes to speed the phantom 4 pro is 10
miles per hour faster with full support
of its obstacle sensing systems
with it's stunning camera 1 inch sensor
ultra bright monitor obstacle sensing
and intelligence the phantom 4 pro
brings professional quality aerial
imaging and flight capabilities to more
pilots around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
