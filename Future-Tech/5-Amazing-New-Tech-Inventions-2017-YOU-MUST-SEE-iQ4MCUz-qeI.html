about us just becoming obsessed with
understanding where time tracking and
recording fits within the overall space
of someone's workday what we wanted to
do with tiller was make time tracking
much more accessible and immediate to
make time tracking a better experience
than all of the software based products
before it we really sat down and said oh
if we were going to start this from
scratch and really look at this problem
from first principles would you come up
with an app or a plugin to solve this or
is this something else that will make
this actually a better experience
available so our idea was what if we
combined more tactile Hardware solution
with software tiller is a small USB
powered device it recognizes and
something's touching it and inside it is
a bearing that turns allowing you to
turn the dial and switch between tasks
or clients it has a light in the center
of it which indicates to you whether
you're tracking or not tracking the
times we found that the fact that it's a
physical object means that when you're
engaging with it it brings a sort of a
mindfulness and a deliberateness to the
work you're doing a lot of our process
involves users getting to test the
prototype or use the prototype versions
that we have and that feeds into the
process of design and development a lot
of our early work was fast prototyping
versions of the software and hardware to
get everything right and where it is
today we're really getting into the
nitty-gritty of interaction design when
you touch this thing how does the
interface appear on the computer when
you turn it what happens that is it as
fast as it need to be and is it too
intrusive or is it to hear them and
these are really small things that we've
had to tweak over and over again even
though till is designed to work as a
standalone product people are already
using lots of different time tracking
solutions in their businesses so tiller
integrates directly with a lot of the
tools that freelancers and small
businesses are accustomed to using
things like harvest and zero technology
when it's done right should allow you to
do more of the
that you care about and interested in
and spend less time on the things that
don't really excite you that much and
we've developed this thing for the last
couple of years and be really pleasing
to see you know this thing roll out to
teams and individuals and really
possibly in fact their work we're just
really excited to share tiller with the
whole community
how bacterial full are we how about our
surroundings any allergies common cold
or skin problems sometimes what we can't
see scares us more why tolerate these
bacteria and germs around you any longer
introducing clean teeth kill bacteria
germs and contaminants in seconds with
the stroke of life in our version 120
was recognized and loved as the first
portable led sterilizer with beautiful
industrial design and functionality
combined today we reintroduce the clean
T world to you with clean T version to a
better faster and more affordable clean
T clean T is upgraded with a new UVC led
to increase the sterilizing
effectiveness by 200% and a longer
battery life so you can take it on the
go and continue to sterilize your
surroundings all day long transform any
unfamiliar destination into a safe
environment just click and clean anytime
anywhere plenty will keep you safe
wherever life takes you with a built-in
timer you can click it and leave the
scene it will automatically shut off
when the surroundings and your
belongings are bacteria free click it
throw it and forget it help back us
today create your clean T world
what if there was a video game
controller that could replace all the
video game controllers in your
collection right now controllers like
this and this one that one of course
this that this and even one of these ok
maybe not that but how about these two
well we've made something that can do
everything these controls can do and a
little bit more and what would we call a
controller that can replace all the
controllers in your collection well you
would call it the all controller for the
past two years we've been designing this
controller by creating a bunch of
different models coming up with
different internal components and
external pieces to really get the best
features we could possibly fit in a tiny
package right out of the box our
controller has a bunch of different
drivers built into it so that you can
connect to virtually any operating
system on any computer you own and not
only that you'll be able to play any
video game ever made and when we say any
video game we literally mean that if the
game didn't have controller support
initially you'll be able to control your
mouse and keyboard directly from the
controller itself the all controller can
connect to Windows Mac and Linux and it
also has the ability to connect to iOS
and Android just use the built-in screen
on the controller to select the device
you want to connect to and then connect
it's just that easy and that built-in
screen isn't just for connecting to
different devices you're also able to
customize the controller and a bunch of
different ways remap every single button
every single joystick invert them adjust
their dead zones adjust their
sensitivity and adjust the trigger
sensitivity whatever you want to do
you're capable of doing it with our
built-in operating system within the
controller itself if you want you can
even set up the entire controller to
just do macros or setup macros on the
fly whatever game you're playing however
you want to play it this controller will
give you more options than any other
controller ever made we're adding new
support for devices all the time through
software updates for our controller and
those software updates are totally free
once you've gotten the controller we'll
be adding new features as time goes on
alongside the all controller we'll also
be releasing the dongle that allows you
to connect to the Xbox 360 Xbox one
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 and all
of the features you've seen all the
customizability also
on those systems as well everything
you've seen in this video is based off
of a real controller that already works
but what we need your help to do is
raise enough money so that we can
produce these things on a larger scale
and start sending them out to people so
if you want to help us check out our
Kickstarter page below and thank you so
