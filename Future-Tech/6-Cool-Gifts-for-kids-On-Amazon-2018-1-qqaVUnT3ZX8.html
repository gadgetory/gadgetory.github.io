hi there it's Sarah here's the link play
specialist and today we're going to be
taking the mystery out of one of our
most popular activity kids design your
own superhero cake
so let's crack this open and see what's
inside the first thing we have is what
will be the blank canvas for your unique
project the blue superhero cake but
before they get started on the cave
they're going to want to sketch out some
ideas so for that we have our design
sheet and a bunch of color pencils so
after they're done with their really
cool design we're going to want to get
started on the project the first thing
we have here is some pre-cut stars but
also blank sheets of both felt and foam
so you can help them cut out any shape
that they want for their cake next we
have our tools to add those pieces to
occasions so we have craft glue and a
brush all of our kits come with all of
the tools that you need to put together
your activity then next we have a bunch
of different colors of glitter glue to
add a colorful pop of sparkle to the
cave and lastly we have some
instructions with some tips for design
but do remember that there's no correct
way to put this game together at
seedling we believe that your child's
ideas are much better than ours so all
of our kits are created to inspire the
creativity of your little one and
inspire open-ended play now let me show
