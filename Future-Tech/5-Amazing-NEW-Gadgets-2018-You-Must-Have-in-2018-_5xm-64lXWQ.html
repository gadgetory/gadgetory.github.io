important parts of our daily lives we
use it for personal communication
finishing tasks for work checking social
media posts or even playing your
favorite game during lunch break it
almost feels like an extension of
ourselves with traditional charging
options we can't satisfy the battery
needs for heavy usage of our smartphones
making us frustrated every time when the
phone pops up and low battery
notification hi Kickstarter my name is
Tomas and I'm here to say that the
traditional ways of charging mobile
phones are inconvenient today we need a
better simpler and more convenient way
to charge our phones we have researched
and tested many different ways of
charging including wireless solutions
and we decided to use magnetic adapters
for our charging packs as a proper
solution with corresponding magnetic
adapters you can charge any kind of
smartphone the charging pack is only 15
grams weight which is extremely portable
for everyday carry in 30 minutes this
tiny little pack can give an iPhone 8 a
25 percent battery boost so that with
four of these places in total your phone
will maintain fully charged for charging
packs can provide an iPhone eight about
nine hours of battery usage also the
charging station is a portable battery
with 5000 milli amperes this is our
magnetic charging cable which supports
fast charging due to maximum 2 amp
currents now let's see how finger pal
can help
pal will help bring back convenience to
our lives and furthermore help us to
utilize our smartphones in a better way
we look forward to having your support
thank you very much

raised over $100,000 but more
importantly we got people just like you

my name is Bradley Devine and I do
travel and lifestyle photography and
videography my name is Jessica janae and
I'm an international wedding and fashion
photographer I'm in DRL and I am a
destination wedding photographer my name
is Erin Brimhall and I am an outdoor
lifestyle / automotive photographer well
I love about the universal lens count is
I love how it grabs onto the lens and
the only way it's gonna come off is if I
pull it off and I love that it does
fully pertain to protect what's most
important about my lens and the glass
and I feel like it's something that
should have existed a long time ago my
favorite thing about the universal ones
cap is when I have the lens cap on I'm
shooting something a wedding I bump
again something doesn't just fall off so
I like that these really grip your lens
it's super hard and so no matter what
happens it doesn't fall off which is
glorious and nothing kick it in it I
feel like even if I'm shooting in sand
and dirt and dust and nothing can get in
there into the cracks water anything
it's very protected I love that it's
Universal because I can put it on both
ends of every single one of my lenses
and it's so much nicer for travel so I
don't have to like pack every single
little type of lens cap for each
specific lens
I keep way better track of them and it
keeps my lenses protected throwing them
in and out of bags and stuff like that
well I like about this the most is you
mean you can put it in your pocket you
know whenever you need to it's not like
in there as like a big old bulge like
how it's stretchy so it can fit on any
like
any type of wounds you have you know if
it's on the 7250 all my wives on this
even like my Sigma's that have the
design I'm already you just stretch them
over it's nice and then if it's on the
back so you don't have a cap anymore I
feel like it's something that should
have existed a long time ago and the
lenses have existed like this is
something that's definitely going to
protect what's most important to Cameron
that's the glass and lens so I really
like a music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
