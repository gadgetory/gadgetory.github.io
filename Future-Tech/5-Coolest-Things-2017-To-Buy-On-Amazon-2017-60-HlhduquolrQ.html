pebble and use it every day my pebble
launched the Kickstarter for the new
pebble time I really wanted one and
backed it right away
I spent a lot of my time in my machine
shop and wearing the pebble watch is not
the best way to keep it out of harm's
way since I'm always looking for new
things to help organize I wanted a
dedicated place for my new pebble time
that would not only keep it protected
but keep it charged as well I started
thinking about how to build an intuitive
charging stand for my new pebble I want
the watch to still be usable and display
visible while on the dark the watch can
be docked to charge and display
information while you're at the office
at home and the nightstand as you sleep
as the file design materialized several
friends asked if they could also have
one made and I realized that more people
like you would be interested thanks for
checking us out I hope you like the time
dog for pebble as much as I do

never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and a battery with enough power to
charge an iPhone 6 up to 12 times you
can charge the silver bank via USB then
when you're out and about the solar
panel keeps the power topped up the
solar bank also has built-in Bluetooth
speakers so you have great sounding
audio with you when you're on the go
life back has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the zipper shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is that you can actually
lock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
the zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable can
not be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock works is a bottle opens

separate section for your laptop iPad

a key hook business cards pens there's
also a section for loose papers and a

pocket for your sunglasses there's room

stuff because you don't want your undies

compartments on this bag on your
shoulder straps are two pockets these
are big enough for credit cards travel

headphones pressed up to your back or

big enough for an iPhone six-plus and on
one side there's a USB plug that
connects to the solar mass so you can
