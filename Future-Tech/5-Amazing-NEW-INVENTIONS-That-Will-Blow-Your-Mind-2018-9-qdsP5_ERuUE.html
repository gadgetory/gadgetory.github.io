send and receive messages browse through
news feeds Trek Fitness stats and much
more all directly on my wrist all on
itself here's a pocket screen much like
the mouse a keyboard or a monitor this
pocket screen is simply an interface for
my hub it's not very smart it doesn't
need to be if I need a bigger screen I
can grab a tab screen or I can plug it
into this keyboard if I want to be more
productive I can even use this dongle to
turn any existing TV and to another
screen for my wrist now that I'm always
using the same computing hub I can start
an application on one screen and
seamlessly continue it on another if I
lose a screen no worries it has none of
my personal stuff and because these
screens are inexpensive and can be
everywhere all I ever need to carry is
my hub
the Pens that many of you been waiting
for the Edie seeing pins now made from
incredible titanium never be caught
without a pen again the Edie seeing pens
are ultra compact rugged and designed to
always be with you I really love the
reaction I get every time I show off the
seamless joint where the cap meets the
barrel of the pen it really is fun to
see their amazement two years ago here
on Kickstarter I launched the original
IDI seeing pens made from stainless
steel and have sold thousands of them
unfortunately they've been out of stock
for some time since I've been busy with
my last project the pocket bolt pens so
I can't wait to get production of these
new pens underway if you're not familiar
with titanium
it's an incredible metal due to its
lightweight strength and toughness it's
used to build spaceships and the most
advanced fighter jets titanium also has
another very unique property when it's
heated to very high temperatures the
material surface transforms into
incredibly vibrant and beautiful colors
all of these unique characteristics
makes it the perfect material for an
everyday carry pen the titanium EDC pens
come in two sizes the t1 is the smallest
most compact version and is perfect for
jotting down a quick note or capturing a
quick idea the t2 is a little longer and
is better if you have larger hands or
plan to do more writing or sketching
both sizes use the same standard d1
refill this standard refill is made by
most of the major pen manufacturers and
is easy to find your pen will ship with
the auto black ink refill installed and
ready to use these are really great and
smooth writing refills since this will
be my third pen project here on
Kickstarter I've learned the process and
now I have the infrastructure in place
to move quickly from the manufacturing
and finishing of all the parts to the
assembly and laser engraving and finally
the packaging and shipping all parts of
your pen will be made by me here in Los
Angeles California ensuring the highest
level of quality my workshop is set up
and
already prototype the titanium versions
of the EDC fans using my CNC lathe this
ensures that I can make them in titanium
to my exacting specifications so now I
hope you'll join me on this cool new
project and help to make it happen as
you can see from the comments on my
previous two pen projects here on
Kickstarter I work hard for you to make
sure I deliver what I promised my goal
is that you enjoy the entire experience
I'll share photos and videos of each
step in the process of making your pens
your pen will also come beautifully
packaged so they're really great to give
a super high quality gifts now that I
have everything in place I really need
your help to purchase all of the
titanium and production tooling with
your pledge I will be able to bulk
purchase all of the material and pass
the savings on to you now is your chance
to have a super high quality go
everywhere pen made it from a real
space-age material that you can enjoy
and use every day I really love the
community here on Kickstarter and I look
forward to working with you again to
make this project happen your support
really means a lot so please send me a
message if you have any questions
according to government research under
inflated tire is three times more likely
to cause a crash so let's do some damage
thirty-eight psi a good tire deflating
into twenty seven twenty five percent
lower now it's three times more
dangerous now this one and this one
okay owners come here I wait a guess
which front tire is under inflated this
one looks a little different they all
look the same
yes they do and this is the real danger
you can't tell by just looking that's
how we developed a device to help keep
you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitor the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go choose the next
generation and safety technology zoo
smart tire safety monitor Binondo
today's technology for yesterday's call
back us now on IndieGoGo
that stinks really bad that's amazing
three actually cleans your workout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
