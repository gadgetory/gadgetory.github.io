psychologists call it the flow state
it's that feeling of being completely
absorbed in your task work feels
effortless time passes quickly nothing
can stop you but in a world where we're
more distracted than ever getting in the
zone can feel impossible introducing
mindset the world's first headphones
specifically designed to maximize your
productivity
it has wireless audio ultra soft ear
cuffs and crisp resonant sound we put
them on they create the perfect work
environment mindset actively cancels out
external noise unless you temporarily
mute incoming notifications but while
other headphones stop here
mindset goes one step further while you
work EEG sensors embedded in the hip and
read your brain activity in real time
using its brain computer interface
mindset recognizes when you're in a
state of concentration whenever you
become distracted mindset sends you a
gentle audio cue
to bring you back to focus research
shows it takes 15 to 20 minutes to
refocus after becoming distracted with
mindset we've reduced this to seconds
studies also show that were
significantly less productive once our
brain becomes fatigued mindset sensors
can detect these dips in attention and
will suggest the exact amount of rest
time your brain needs for optimum
recovery after just a few sessions
mindset can identify your peak working
hours use them to get in the zone for
your most critical work while maximizing
your downtime with simpler tasks these
and other actionable insights help make
your day as efficient as possible best
of all mindsets effects last even after
you've taken them off each time you use
it you're learning to better recognize
and ignore distractions over time you
can experience deeper concentration and
enter the flow state at will with or
without mindset so you can have your
best day every day we've been blown away
by the incredible potential for medical
EEG right now it's being used to treat
attention deficit disorder Olympic
figure skaters are using it to improve
creativity and it's part of NASA's
astronaut training program it's
widespread but not accessible to you and
me we want to change this we have
backgrounds in biomedical engineering
and neuroscience research we're working
with the community of neuro tech experts
to bring this technology to life
we're building a development platform
you'll get full access to the data so
that you can integrate mindset to your
own applications and experiments we
spent the last four months in Shenzhen
China working closely with manufacturers
on dozens of prototypes we're partnering
with Onkyo pioneers in high-end audio
technology to ensure that mindset sounds
incredible all the processes are in
place to ship a quality product on time
now we just require capital for tooling
and scaled production a recent study
shows that over the course of our career
we waste 20,000 hours distracted Malcolm
Gladwell says that's enough to become a
master in anything twice and mine said
our mission is to give you those hours
back join us and let's make distractions
a thing of the past life is about human
connection our strongest bonds are with
family but you can't always be there
with them and calling doesn't give you
that same feeling there are a lot of
things you enjoy doing together that you
can't do through a call so we made Omni
the robot that makes these things
possible even if you live miles away
Omni isn't like a phone call or ordinary
video chat they're there in the robot
you have the control to move and look
around and this frees up the other side
from having to stop and answer a call
you can just join in no matter what
they're doing no more phone tag or
scheduling a call like a meeting our
testers are using Omni to do awesome
stuff like cook together hang out for a
barbecue or even watch a whole movie
together it's the stuff they'd never do
with skype or facetime
because it's just way too cumbersome and
the coolest part is that none of this
was planned ahead of time as soon as
they got the bot these experiences just
happened naturally we want to make a
home robot that's not just a toy but
something built to last to be truly
useful week after week our design
philosophy has two main parts and the
first is to maximize the human
connection
so Omni is made to be human height to
give you that most natural view of the
world people on the other side can look
straight at you and talk to you just
like normal we really wanted to enhance
presence of feeling that someone's there
with you so we designed Omni with a
moving neck and a seamless control
interface we call motion map the neck
may seem subtle but we thought it really
makes the experience a lot more engaging
a lot more human so the second part of
our design philosophy is to minimize all
hassle because nothing should get in the
way of the Omni experience setup is
simple unfold connect to Wi-Fi and call
in with just one click and there's no
software to install
we also made Omni super quiet so you can
hang out for a long time without bugging
anyone and if you need to move it around
it's light you can take it upstairs move
it out on the patio or pull it up into
your car you know if they're worried
about keeping it charged when you're
finished
press one button to auto dock Omni is
different right down to its materials
and how we make it
we source sustainable bamboo and we use
satin anodized aluminum another cool
thing is that we use additive
manufacturing to build omni in a
scalable and efficient way we're doing
it all in-house to keep it lean and that
means less risk
you've already been shipping omni to
test users around the world for over a
year
we're also backers like you tired of
campaigns over-promising and
under-delivering so that's why we waited
to launch our campaign until now after
two years and nine generations of
prototypes we're super passionate about
bringing families closer and with your
support we can bring the omni experience
to everyone join our campaign and enjoy
Omni with your own family
EcoPlus river is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy outputs of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you get power to iPhones to iPads
to Mac books a mini-fridge a lantern a
drone battery a mobile Wi-Fi unit and
stereo speakers all at the same time
without limiting the output on any port
with the storage capacity of 416 watt
hours Ruby gives you more power than
almost any battery of its time you can
jam on your electric guitar for 20 hours
straight or you can watch a 10 hour
marathon of your favorite TV show by
campfire Rivers battery can be recharged
in three different ways a standard
outlet or a car charger can replenish
the battery to full capacity in just
eight hours with eco flows portable
solar panels River can be recharged with
absolutely zero carbon emissions in just
12 hours the real time display allows
you to monitor the battery's current
output power remaining capacity and
charge time
being a documentary filmmaker a lot of
my shoots happen outside a lot of times
our locations are way out in the middle
of nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station a battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights you never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
River has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
