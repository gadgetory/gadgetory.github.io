no antennas no waiting and no hassles we
developed the Luna because we knew there
was a better solution than relying on
software to turn an iPad into a second
display software apps literally hack
your graphics card delivering a glitchy
and unreliable picture they trick your
Mac into thinking and displays attached
when effect they get no benefit of
graphics acceleration or metal GPU
support
so unlike software apps Luna harnesses
the raw power of your graphics card
giving you the full benefit of its
graphics acceleration delivering stunt
second monitor that's 100 percent wire
free in addition to acting as a second
display Luna also acts as a complete
extension to your Mac allowing you to

all and adore has it for you you have a
gym membership and you go once a month

weigh how much of your body is water and
how much of your body's fat but how

on how to improve it yeah but doors like
my personal trainer although it doesn't
sweat its knowledgeable it's caring and
available 24/7 adore smart scale was
developed by marathon runners and
doctors meet these healthy brainiacs as
a runner I like to track my progress
nothing in the market was really giving
me a complete information about how well
I'm doing
as such we decided to come up with a
tour smart body composition scale the
whole concept behind the design was
truly help people we really want people
to be able to learn and achieve their
goals in a very simple and efficient way
the artificial intelligence software
along with our social networking is a
big part of our solution
ador along with our powerful app now is

active individuals the team has an
extensive experience in high-tech some
of the brightest people in Silicon
Valley they understand what people need
to improve their conditions step on the
scale
put in your basic info and then connect
it with your phone via bluetooth and
that's it enjoy your personalized health
tips anytime you want
I love the design I'm probably gonna
marry this you're smarter than my
smartphone help us bring a door to the
market and let us have everyone look
great oh yeah
does this situation look familiar you're
flipping your pillow at night
desperately trying to fall asleep Munna
is a unique device that understands your
sleeping pattern and regulates your head
temperature to help you get the best
possible sleep Munna will help you to
start your day feeling fully recovered
and energetic sleep well live well hi
I'm David and this is Colleen and we're
the founders of Munna for years it took
me hours every night to fall asleep so
we decided to do something about it
together we developed a product that not
only gets you to sleep faster but also
helps you get the best sleep until it's
time for you to wake up so how do we do
that with temperature
temperature is the key to good sleep to
fall asleep our body needs to cool down
and lower temperatures help us get a
better sleep quality when we wake up it
is the opposite our body needs to warm
up and our head plays a critical role in
this temperature regulation that's why
munna improves your sleep by regulating
your pillow temperature simply place the
device on your bedside table insert the
pad into your pillowcase and use the app
to set the wakeup time the temperature
of the pad is regulated through a water
circulation system which cools down as
you lay in bed to help you fall asleep
faster sleep and environment sensors
combined with machine learning help
understand your perfect sleeping pattern
and regulate the temperature accordingly
when it's time we now will gently warm
up and we can actually with the app you
will get key insights on your sleep and
how to improve it further we believe
that is not about how long you sleep but
how well you sleep so by improving your
night will not also improve your day
body temperature is very important for
sleep quality
so munna is one of the best sleep
technology to improve sleep we've done
more than 200 user tests and have an
ongoing clinical study we have spent the
last four months in Shenzhen China
working closely with manufacturers to
make sure we have a great design and can
ship a quality product on time to our
backers we've been working on this
project for nearly two years now and
we're finally ready for production we
want to bring you better sleep now all
we need is your support thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
