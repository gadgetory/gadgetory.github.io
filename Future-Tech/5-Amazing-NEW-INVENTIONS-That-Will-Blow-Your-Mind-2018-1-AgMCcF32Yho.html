well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago we asked
our engineers at steadicam headquarters
in Burbank to create the best electronic
handheld stabilizer with no limitations
we took our Steadicam technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled it with Steve wagon is
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create the Steadicam vault
the best electronic handheld stabilizer
with no limitations the study can volt
like all its predecessors is a expanded
system with the center of gravity right
at a gimbal it accepts any phone any
case that allows you to walk around
precisely frame the things that you want
to see and move the camera in the way
that we're used to seeing on a feature
film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study can for smartphones that weighs
one pound with the inertia and the feel
of a big forty pound rig
three axis gimbal they're not terrific
at following action one two three one
two three little lag there the study
Campbell gives you stability and agility
and that's the key the Volt effectively
puts Steadicam technology in the palm of
your hand our mission has always been to
help people create the world's greatest
images
