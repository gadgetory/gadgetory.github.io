I don't think so
introducing the new hyperdrive USBC hub
that has a built-in cable connect USB
flash drives SD and micro SD memory
cards 4k HDMI monitor Gigabit Ethernet
even more USB hard drive and charge your
computer at the same time oh and did we
mention it can also charge your iPhone
as well wirelessly it also works as a
wireless charging stand for the iPhone
that doesn't interfere with your
gestures with adjustable viewing angles
you don't even need to use it with your
computer just connect it to any USB C
power here the five reasons why the
hyperdrives is the best iphone wireless
charger and USB seva one it supports the
new faster of 7.5 watt wireless charging
standard
developed by Apple for the iPhone
traditional so-called 5 10 or 15 watt
wireless chargers that were previously
created for the Android will either not
work or charge the iPhone much slower at
5 watts or less to traditional wireless
chargers generate a lot of heat which
causes the iPhone to reduce or stop
wireless charging completely hyperdrive
is designed to be a power efficient
low-temperature device what little heat
is generated is isolated from the iPhone
by an air gap layer and insulator stand
tray three traditional wireless chargers
are made with low cost materials that
have fluctuating electromagnetic
frequencies that may interfere with the
iPhone functions like touch and face
ideal hyperdrive uses a fixed frequency
designated by Apple and is guaranteed to
work perfectly with the iPhone
for because hyperdrive uses USBC input
instead of DC input it is the only
iPhone wireless charger in the market
that is firmware upgradeable to support
higher wireless charging power in the
future last but not least hyperdrive is
built on USBC hub capabilities that
helped raise over 3.1 million dollars on
Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and with
thousands of positive reviews it has an
average four star rating on Amazon for
Best Buy despite incorporating a USBC
hub hyper drive is no bigger than the
ordinary wireless charger sold at the
theater school and is actually thinner
than the most popular Android wireless
charger on the market and these don't
come with the USB
a single hyperdrive replaces an ordinary
wireless charger and countless other SPC
adapters this pile of USBC adapters and
wireless charger will cost you over 250
dollars at the Apple store but you can
get that high per truck per special
price only if you pledge right now get
more from hype imagine that your desktop
3d printer can print not only plain sex
but of supports lean or clay lets you
experiment with automatic the position
of soldiering paste veins or even food
what does all of this now this is a
ceramics 3d printing here is a printhead
and pump or the precisely position of
highly viscous paste and clay with yours
desktop 3d printer prints from wet clay
or porcelain can be burned into useful
ceramics their strong durable heat
resistant and food safe this can be a
perfect gift a souvenir just a hobby or
even a new opportunity for your business
the ceramics 3d printing kit in here
immense several creative engineering
solutions the compact lightweight
printhead can be installed in different
orientations it is compared always
TV preachers it provides sleep pools
inaccurate
the extruder eliminates air bubbles from
clay made by hand you can legally
assemble and disassemble the extruder
for cleaning to provide you with
different nozzles to reach the optimal
speed and quality of printing the
syringe pump precisely dispenses even
see play our CD print circuit is not
limited to clay you can experiment as
many different materials and
applications for the 3d printing
technology stone flower graphic
technology for perfect it's always good
to party but that's lame battery dead

Lee go further get funner breathing it's
great it feels so good if you're
watching this video you're probably
breathing right now you know it's not
great congestion not breathing properly
hurts look at this guy holding his eyes
he's trying to tell you that he's
congested and aches all over
we even had in circles behind him to
emphasize his paint
good job circles if you suffer from
congestion you have two options stop
breathing which is not really an option
or uses steam device yes those blender
looking things
they're big too big to carry everywhere
and maintain a constant treatment meet a
via a steam device with two main
advantages it uses nanoparticles for the
most effective sinus allergy and
congestion treatment and it's portable
what's nano steam it's steamed downsized
to the smallest particles possible while
a typical steam inhaler produces thick
particles of steam that cannot penetrate
through the walls of the nose into the
sinuses obvious nanoparticles are less
than 5 microns these micro particles can
easily penetrate beyond the nasal walls
and into the sinus cavities clearing
everything that stops you from getting
your best breathing in just 10 minutes
you'll be breathing clearly all you need
to do is add saline at just the
temperature and then place the nozzle
under your nose here's the guy from
before after he used often now he's
showing you that he's breathing great
nose circles around him now
thanks to obvious adjustable temperature
controls if you feel your steam needs to
be warmer than just adjusted and since
obvious small enough to fit any bag and
it's also chargeable you can take it and
use it anywhere breathe clearly in the
office and the park breathe as you bike
yeah you can go back to doing sports
because a via is light enough to carry
anywhere besides clearing congestion a
via can be used orally to humidify the
vocal cords dampen a dry throat or just
improve breathing in general oh look a
surfer guy he doesn't have any
congestion just wants to breathe better
davia is created by aura medical a
long-standing company the field of
respiratory devices in its essence a via
is patent-pending tech created with the
components of an already working system
but measured down to a portable
easy-to-use all-around perfect device so
if you to feel that better breathing can
improve your life get a via</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
