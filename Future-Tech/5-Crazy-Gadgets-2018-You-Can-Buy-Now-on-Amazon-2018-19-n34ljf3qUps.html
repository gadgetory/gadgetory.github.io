Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people have you
tried to plug in it for 30 seconds yes
we unplugged it these machines work just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast and
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi little is
smart enough to know things like what
devices you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it and
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid 2g level websites
monitor make sure he's not up to any
shenanigans I can even set time limits
or pause the internet like during dinner
time yay awesome here I'll plug this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was ladies and gentlemen
flight 14 27 to New York is now boarding
at gate 3
please hurry so you can find a place to
stow your carry-on luggage assuming you
were even able to carry it on and the
airline didn't make you check it because
you pack too much hopefully you all have
a blue smart the world's first smart
carry-on suitcase introducing blue smart
the first carry-on that connects to your
smartphone with revolutionary features
including a digital lock proximity
sensors location tracking trip tracking
information a built in digital scale and
if that wasn't enough a built in battery
that can charge your phone six times
over designed for today's sophisticated
traveler and even guys like this
back
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through
forget about keys or combinations
control the lock from the app and if for
any reason you need to part ways with
your blue smart or not it will
automatically lock itself life's too
short to fight for an outlet blue smart
will recharge your electronic devices
with our super powerful built-in battery
so relax blue smart will alert you if
you ever leave it behind or if it finds
a new friend and if it's ever lost
you'll be able to track its location you
will breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with blue smart anyone can
travel smart
even this guy wait a minute is this even
possible who invented this
developing the technology behind smart
was a really fun challenge we have to
create new devices combining sensors the
two mechanical devices and everything
connected to a microcomputer
we needed to come with the software to
control form your phone beyond the
physical carry on we're super excited
about the features we're building into
that imagine blue smart singing to your
calendar and to travel services that you
use so that you know when and what to
pack imagine also being able to track
all your trips and see trends about your
travel habits all in one place the
suitcase becomes your personal travel
assistant and we think that's pretty
cool if you think about it
suitcases haven't seen much innovation
for several decades so we set out to
reimagine how a suitcase for this
century should be blue smart is a
quantum leap for today's travel we
created a product that is beautiful and
powerful and yet remarkably simple to
use I am personally super excited about
blue smart because it's a product that I
would love to have myself I travelled in
the past and because of problems with my
luggage my troops got ruined and I know
that we do smart I'm going to be able to
travel with peace of mind so I'm super
excited on top of that my phone is never
gonna run out of battery anymore and
that's pretty cool thank you for
watching and thank you for a support the
sound of life isn't a single track it's
a mix a combination of what you choose
to play and what's around you
it's awareness mixed with attitude
countryside mixed with connection
perseverance mixed with presence
