let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world
you can plug the device in any outlet
worldwide with all the plugs
conveniently stored inside charges saves
you space and the trouble of forgetting
or losing your Chargers the height of
the pins is adjustable to fit any mobile
case or protector now you can charge
your smart phones and tablets at the
same time using the two integrated pins
without carrying any additional Chargers
charges supports micro USB lightning and
USB C standards covering the full range
of mobile devices and smart gadgets
great now we can charge my iPhone and
your Samsung at the same time it also
works with other devices sharing the
same charging standards
charges also has three additional USB
ports to make it the most convenient
Universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we beta tested our ideas and pack them
into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
printed and tested some more this led to
the final working prototype that we sent
out to ten people to test for two weeks
we got their feedback and now we are
ready to go into mass production I love
to travel the world but I always find
difficulties in the outlet standards of
each new country - I visit yeah I found
charges and solve that problem forever I
mean it is so compact and handy I take
it everywhere with me my wife and I used
to argue over who is going to use the
phone charger every night
yeah but chargers solve that problem
with its dual charging station and we
don't argue anymore forget the old
chargers go char just back us now on
IndieGoGo hi Kickstarter my name is Eric
and I'm the founder of dubs Labs in 2011
we introduced our first product bed
phones headphones specifically designed
for sleep and it was a big success
enter bed phone headphones so you can
play music or any masking sounds we've
spent over six years refining the design
of bed phones to create the most
comfortable and adjustable headphones in
the world based on our patented bed
phones design we're here to introduce
versa fit incredibly thin lightweight
infinitely adjustable
sweat-proof Wireless on ear headphones
that allow you to both hear your music
and hear the world around you versa fit
headphones are incredibly thin less than
a quarter inch thick this allows you to
listen to your music under practically
any helmet perfect for your days out on
the trails or the slope
so why would anyone want headphones that
allow them to hear their surroundings
they're safer and they're more social if
you are a runner or a cyclist out on the
streets versus if it allows you to hear
oncoming traffic such as that car that's
coming up behind you
skier or snowboarder versa fit allows
you to hear others on the slopes to
avoid collision working out in the gym
versa fit allows you to talk to your
workout buddies without having to turn
off your music or take out an earpiece
playing with friends and don't want to
stop your music to talk to them versa
fit allows you to do that we're
combining the best design aspects of bed
bones with silicone ear pads sweat
proofing and Bluetooth connectivity for
a Wire free workout versa fit headphones
can last up to 10 and a half hours on a
single charge enough for an entire
week's worth of workouts our custom 23
millimeter drivers have been retuned by
one of the best acoustical engineers in
the world to offer deep bass clear
treble and no sacrifice in sound quality
covered in silicone rubber Bursa fits
