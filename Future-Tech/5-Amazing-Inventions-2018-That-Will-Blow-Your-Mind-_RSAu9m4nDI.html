your health no place is more important
without knowing it we surround ourselves
with a lot of harmful synthetic
chemicals our skin however is not an
impenetrable barrier it's our largest
organ and it absorbs an incredible
amount of everything we touch synthetic
dyes and textiles a lot of breeding of
pathogens like bacteria dust mites and
fungi which scientists linked to
allergies and skin problems today one in
four people suffer from skin disease and
the cost of treatments are skyrocketing
let's do something about this I'm
Michael Cole fond of izalith wedding
inspired by an almost forgotten Japanese
art we are going to create the
healthiest sleeping experience using
only three ingredients natural indigo
cotton and water what is I so mad
it's a Japanese art of dying textiles
with natural indigo we Japanese have
known about indigo skin healing and
bacteria repelling effects for centuries
it looks beautiful and feels great and
makes a yarn extremely durable
what's the aizome secret inspired by
Japanese tradition we use zero synthetic
chemicals in the entire process and to
reach a high fade resistant see even
after 100 wash cycles we use a
cutting-edge sound wave technology that
enhances the dye on a molecular level
and you know what's cool we use two
hundred times less water and
conventional dyeing and always can
return in two biodegradable natural
fertilizer here in Tokyo we've gathered
a fantastic group of people with
backgrounds and dermatology textiles and
quality management
with carefully selected our partners and
production is all ready to start the
only thing we need now is your support
they call campaign and get your own eyes
of every item Abedin
is kind to your skin and kind to the
environment
hi I'm James from choose water we all
know that plastic is strangling our
oceans and you've had enough and quite
frankly serve we that's why we developed
a new bottle this one it's made from
recycled paper Pope
there's kindly donated by local
businesses we clean it we do ink it and
we turn it into our heart casing on the
inside there's a very clever waterproof
liner that's made from all-natural
sustainable materials that's all very
nice but the best thing about this
bottle is no matter where it ends up
whether it's in the ocean or in landfill
it's gone in a couple of weeks can it
get any better it can't we've committed
donate 100% of our profits to water for
after our charity partner they Rock
which comes in to go goes for help we
need new cutting-edge machinery we need
distribution lines we need automated
filling lines and in return you get cool
perks like this snazzy t-shirt we have
tote bags we have badges we have social
media shoutouts there's even a trip to
Gambia all of this will allow us to get
our bottles onto a shelf in a shop near
you and end dependency or plastic thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
