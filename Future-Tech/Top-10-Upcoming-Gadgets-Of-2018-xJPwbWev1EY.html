programmer any engineer any designer
will tell you that if you want to do
your job productively if you want to do
it well you need at least two monitors
you need one to write the code and you
need another to check the graphical user
interface changes that are made back in
the old days we had desktops to do this
which were great but you needed to add
an extra graphic card to add another
monitor to it but for us luckily laptops
came along soon after and made
everything a lot more convenient laptops
are great they allow you the flexibility
to work from home hotels restaurants and
friends houses so all of a sudden with
laptops everything got a lot easier and
more convenient for everybody but for
people like us who still need more than
one monitor it wasn't that simple you
can't take a monitor into a coffee shop
a it'd be weird be it totally defeats
the purpose of the ease and convenience
of a laptop so what we do we came up
with expand de expand expands your
laptop's display real estate expander is
a secondary monitor for laptops that
slips on and doubles as protection it
runs efficiently through only your USB
port that's right no extra power cables
to deal with it keeps you portable while
greatly increasing your productivity
Expando only needs one USB port for both
video and power it offsets the very low
consumption of the LED panel with
photovoltaic solar panels on its
backside these panels provide a trickle
that will continue charging your laptop
even when it's not in use on the macbook
model expander we'll add two extra USB
ports allowing for charging and other
peripherals while you're using expander
essentially we've given you the best of
both worlds you get all the portability
and convenience of a laptop plus double
the working space so you can truly work
how you want where you want and when you
want now we've been pretty extensive in
our prototype phase we've designed our
board and have a working prototype the
last 18 months have been spent talking
with vendors both hall
abroad to figure out how to bring you a
really special product and we have
everything in line except for one thing
figuring out our mass production
pipeline and that's where you come in we
need funding to pay for expensive
manufacturing tools we need capital to
buy components at a volume discount and
by contributing to our campaign today
you guarantee yourself a lower price and
bypassing any wait lists when the X
Vanda hits the market thank you so much
for partnering with us as we bring you
guys a really special product that we
believe in
you
wireless technology is the future of
music introducing error by crazy baby
the world's first true wily stereo
headphones crafted with carbon nanotube
technology are a passion for perfection
led us to create an ergonomic design
that makes films and sells at Tattler
hair uses the latest csr chip to deliver
high-performance stereo audio and
provide the most reliable ones
connection in the industry by utilizing
a state-of-the-art
998 carbon nanotube diaphragm error is
able to deliver a tremendously wide

wireless music experience awaits
fizzy's air 1 2 3 4 Siri open camera
huh listen I gotta go
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and and you hook on a fish
and you're reeling that sucker and you
have all that action throughout that
process but then when you catch the fish
you know you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
to all your friends saying look at this
cat so we want to make it so that you
can share the actual action go fish
Cayman corporative is developed by me
and my brother and then we developed it
to be a technology for what we found to
be an underserved market there are
camera technologies or fish finders in
the market but what we found was they're
not capturing where the action was and
by seeing which baits are attracting
fish and how a fish might strike just
having the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that is
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it's it's it's on the line and it
works with your fishing line so it's not
going to obstruct how you fish or your
fishing style and top of that we have
infrared and green lighting around the
camera room so that you can fish during
nighttime or in darker lighting and then
we also have the depth of it so that can
go up to 150 meters underwater as well
as the ability to last for four hours so
we really put in a lot of work into
making sure that when they go fish that
they're good news go fish camp when we
started the project with Go Fish we
broke down the process into multiple
steps we started initially with a
conceptual design looking at the product
from a both a visual as well as a future
benefit standpoint it was important to
us that we had a premium product that
had feature benefits that just weren't
available on the market currently in
terms of looking forward to production
the three-dimensional CAD and mechanical
drawings are all completed the coding
for the app is completed at this point
we're really just using Kickstarter to
get ourselves into production and get
this product out into the marketplace
this is a new product that a lot of
people are excited about and by their
support and their backing of
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the world as well it's an
awesome technology that allow you to
capture kind of action-packed footage
and share it with your friends and
family and definitely bring a lot of the
excitement to the industry
hi everyone we're back since our first
campaign we've shipped thousands of
units to people in places around the
world we've heard your feedback we've
created something three times more
powerful than the original
if you could take the wall outlet to go
what would you power share this campaign
with all your family and friends and
let's live life off the grid let's take
the wall outlet anywhere
what kind of snorer
are you
introducing the silent partner the
world's first smart mask to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the silent partner creates a
silent zone around the person wearing it
giving you and those around you a better
night's sleep how does it work
silent partner uses patented active
noise cancellation that detects the
unwanted snoring sound and generates a
counter sound which suppresses it the
result well it's as simple as a plus and
minus they cancel each other out many of
us have probably been there being around
or creating a symphony of snoring noises
that create frustrating nights for us
and our partners most snoring products
today don't fully solve the snoring
problem
they are often intrusive and disrupt the
quality of sleep so instead of tackling
the snoring we decided to simply find a
solution for the noise using vast
experience with a and C technology and
sleeping experts the silent partner was
designed and developed to be effective
from as close as 20 centimeters away
simply wear the smart mask the way you
would wear a traditional sleep mask and
enjoy a quiet night
be one of the first to experience silent
partner and finally give you and those
around you a real silent night nothing
is worse than walking into a room
flipping the switch only to find that
it's connected to the wrong outlet when
you move into a new place or rearrange
your room that outlet always seems to be
in the wrong spot
this is switch with the easiest way to
flip your switch controlled outlets it's
as easy as plugging in a transmitter to
your switched outlet and a paired
receiver into any other outlet you want
to activate then use the wall switch to
turn on your lights fans and other
devices if you want to control more than
one light just add additional receivers
to switch on as many as you want
pairing additional receivers is easy
just plug the receiver into the
transmitter and it's automatically
paired in this room this switch controls
that outlet but my bed's over here and I
want this switch to control that outlet
so I'm going to use switch flip to flip
my switches to be the way that I wanted
I want to turn on all of my Christmas
lights at the same time so I use switch
flip to turn them all on with the switch
switch flip is the simple and smart way
to control your lights and power outlets
each switch flip includes one
transmitter one receiver has a range of
up to 100 feet requires no wiring no
installation and there's absolutely no
app to download simple is smart be smart

your help get switch flip now only on
