we're out here at Kualoa Park filming
with the new typhoon 8 with intel
realsense technology
I've been filming professionally with
drones since early 2013 and since then
watching the progression with this
technology I'm really excited to show
you what this can do
the amazing thing about the typhoon h
with intel realsense technology is that
it doesn't just fall short of avoiding
an object but it will intelligently
reroute itself around it and continue on
its path
the incredible thing about this new
technology is that it gets smarter and
smarter as you fly it and while you're
flying it it creates a 3d mapping of its
surrounding and it will remember it it's
so easy to use obstacle avoidance just
simply flip the switch into the on
position obstacle avoidance works in
both smart and angle mode if you're in
angle mode you have full control of the
typhoon H but if real sense is activated
it will stop you from moving forward
into an object that it senses but you
can go up down left and right around the
object just not forward into it in smart
mode you can really see how realsense
technology works by selecting follow me
and turning on real sense the typhoon
edge will avoid all obstacles while
tracking your position and keeping you
in the shot
hey guys johnathan here and I know
Philips hue is addicting you got to
taste that light game but you want more

first the simplest way is more light
bulbs on top of dishing out that oh so
pretty lighting they're smart they're
energy efficient and come in a handful
of shapes and sizes to perfectly suit
your home next our accent lights and
whether it's a Philips you go or the
light strip Plus this allows you to
integrate complementary light into your
furniture and our cabinets and results
in this really awesome indirect ambient
lighting that really rounds out your
system now once you set up your lighting
game you can then add in controls and
accessories which really allows you to
customize how you control your lights
whether it's a huge app the hue dimmer
switch or the humo ssin sensor these

moves without ever having to touch your
phone or tablet lastly you can also
extend your system with Philips hue
beyond on top to being plug-and-play
what's awesome with hue beyond is there
are two independent light sources an up
light and a down light so with this
you're able to combine functional white
light with a splash of color or you can
go all-out with endless color
