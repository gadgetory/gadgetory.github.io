to come tom is really really thoughtful
like this one time don't worry babe I
got a spare tire just have to find a gas
station and fill it up he's just not
great at planning ahead
I think we're locked out relax babe I
have a spare key just have to get a cut
to fit the lock sometimes I think there
might be something legitimately wrong
with his brain oh cool oh cool oh my
phone's about to die chill babe I got
this spare battery should I even ask
yeah no it's not charged it's not
charged I love him
but he's a bit slow hey actually know
what yeah that's true that's why we
bought the slim chirp row we had other
power banks but we were always
forgetting to keep them charged when we
decided to upgrade to the slim drip row
we bought a whole pile of them you can
charge them just by stacking them
magnetically it's so convenient Tom
never forgets the Slim's our pro is
smaller than the original slender and
with even more power the LED display
shows how much battery is left it also
comes with either an MFI lightning or
micro USB connection and it has a
flashlight which is really handy at
night or for looking in someone's ear oh
that's so creative he's creative and
just like the original slim Jerry it's
small enough to fit into your pocket or
wallet it's great I wouldn't say it
saved our marriage or anything and it
did
as a designer I don't remember quite
when I solved the first problem or
invented the first thing I don't even
remember realizing that it was a skill
it was just who I was I travel a lot and
I just purchased a new smartphone and I
wanted to watch a movie on it on the
airplane I tried setting up the
smartphone on a tray table and it just
kept falling backwards frustrated I got
and I think I can make this better
the eyes'll is a little adjustable stand
for smartphones and ear eaters a design
the eyes'll to unfold and fit into a
pocket or into a bag you hear a lot
about sustainable design these days
another way of approaching
sustainability is designing something
that never has to be thrown away
smartphones changed dramatically over
the last seven years and the eyes'll is
designed to accommodate all of those
screen sizes and device thicknesses in
industrial design ergonomics is so
important when they sit at their desk
not everybody is the same size so in the
eyes we'll we built a little adjustable
stand in the back we've got six
different adjustment settings for the
angle of the display the portrait in the
landscape
a great deal of consideration went into
not only the shape and the function of
the ISIL but the materials that we're
using we use a very expensive elastomer
that provides that rugged long duration
of use as well as the grip eNOS if you
will all throughout my life I've had
people around me they've taught me how
to problem-solve I've worked for some of
the world's biggest brands design has to
be beautiful function is beautiful it
has to solve a problem Philips Norelco
beard trimmer 9100 it is laser guided if
you take your finger and push down right
here on this little gold thing and it
gives you a laser this is how you get
the straight sides to the charger
through the phenomenon cars the
different lengths there's a little dial
right here that you turn and it
increases or increases the length it
tells you where you're at so right now
I'm at seven millimeter you just snap
off one of the guards turn it on power
but here
you can see the three lights light up
like flashing my name is Charlie

anything so just comes off my drop for

it for all go your trimmer 9100 yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
