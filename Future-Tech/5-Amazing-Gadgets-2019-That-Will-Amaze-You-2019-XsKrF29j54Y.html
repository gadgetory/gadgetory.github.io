standing desks you see them everywhere
they're messy they're absurdly expensive
and they overtake your entire desk a
desk view we decided it was time for a
fresh perspective desk use a flawless
mix of form and function the 25 by 15
inch working surface is designed to
accommodate a laptop papers drinks and
anything else you might need while you
work best view is an affordable standing
desks option that transforms any
workspace in less than 10 seconds simply

press down on the levers and just like
that you have the best view in the
office the secret to desk view is simple
we use the strongest industrial grade
suction cups on the market giving our
desks unparalleled hold strength all
without damaging your wall or window hi
I'm Jason Carr hausky met Mike Poulos
were the creators of desk II the windows
the highlight of any office he had a
majority of office desks facing the wall
that's not exactly an inspiring view so
we said I was to rethink the problem we
created is the first window mount an
adjustable standing desk we launched our
initial design in 2015 and people loved
the ease strength and versatility of
desk view but we wanted to take it to
the next level so we partnered with
award-winning product development firm
minimal we wanted to make desk view
strong and easy to install so anyone
could do it we embarked on this long
campaign for months and months we were
working and reworking the brackets for
desk view and finally we came up with
the design that we go with today we over
engineered every piece of the products
from the suction cups to the levers to
the working surface to the edges
god we've been through so many further
tips that thing the window is such an
underutilized portion of an office or a
home anywhere and so when people realize
that you could take what was an empty
space that no one could use and turn
that into a desk or a functional space
they loved it and what we created is an
elegant sleek versatile design best view
features high-grade lightweight aluminum
brackets for strength durable rubber
suction cup components for a safe secure
suction force and a securing lever
that's designed to fit any hand and
firmly secured sq with one fluid motion
so join us today and free yourself from
the shackles of traditional desks
okay ready Jake sometimes I wonder if
I'm doing it right you know keeping a
family together here we go
the dreams the downfalls and successes
but I guess there are no magic tricks
everything okay
it's about memories really okay let's
try again
keeping the good memories alive and
letting the bad ones go away it's about
creating new memories every day that's
what my mom always used to say when I
was a little kid guess I never really
understood what she meant until now
you take care of the video the
Sennheiser memory mic takes care of the
sound
what's the first thing you do when you
buy shampoo you smell it right and if it
smells good
you buy it the problem is when you get
it home it doesn't perform the way it
says it will and it's not just shampoo
its conditioner its gel its body lotion
the list goes on and on that's why we
all have 10 to 20 products in our
bathroom that we never use stop the
insanity we have the solution to this
problem the modak app by Moda Fino
allows you to pick your fragrance
separately and change your fragrance by
simply changing the cap on the bottle
this means the cap to one bottle of
shampoo can easily be switched out with
all of your favorite fragrances this is
our prototype this is the motor cap the
shampoo gets pumped up into the
mechanism and the fragrance gets pumped
down inside and it gets mixed one pump
at a time help us make the motor cap a
reality and get it into your shower
