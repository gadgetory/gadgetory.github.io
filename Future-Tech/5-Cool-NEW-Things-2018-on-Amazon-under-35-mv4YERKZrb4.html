light nano grid the opportunity to get
outside during the winter is truly an
amazing experience while out on the
trail caring for your water filters is
crucial for drinking safely filtered
water during the colder months you can
use our survivor filter pro and survivor
filter from any freshwater source even
in below freezing temperatures place the
ultra filter pre-filter of the pro into
the water and pump normally
this will produce crisp and delicious
tasting water
you can also fill up one of our
collapsible canteens and use our
survivor filter squeeze system to get
clean drinkable water
after you have finished using the
survivor filter or survivor filter Pro
in freezing temperatures
we have several recommendations take
each filter element and shake out all
the excess water then place the filter
components in a plastic baggie place the
baggie inside your jacket so your body
heat prevents the filter elements from
freezing repeat this process for your
survivor filter make sure to remove as
much water as possible from the filters
before placing in the plastic bag
the water inside your collapsible
canteen can also freeze solid to prevent
this from happening place your water
inside your pack as close to your back
as possible your body heat will help
keep the water liquid when going to
sleep make sure to store the filters in
a warm space like inside your sleeping
bag following these tips will help you
have an enjoyable winter adventure just
because there is snow on the ground it
doesn't mean you can't get outside and
explore

creator of the lever gear tool card i
founded lever gear to design products
that solve real problems look great and
will last forever we all have little
projects that pop up in life and they
don't always happen when our tools are
handy it's annoying to have to spend
time chasing down tools for a job that
should take 10 seconds if you're like me
it usually ends up getting added to your
to-do list that's why we created the
lever gear tool card it's a multi-tool
the size of a credit card that has 40
different tools it's always with you so
you can get things done I like to be
prepared to handle any task but I also
hate the idea of carrying around a lot
of extra stuff a credit card size tool
that could disappear in my wallet seemed
like the perfect solution we developed
the tool card with a simple premise the
real estate in your pocket is precious
so you should own stuff that's actually
worth carrying we began our design
process by brainstorming all of the
functions we could pack into a credit
card sized multi-tool we also tested
every card that existed on the market we
fought a lot about the design and layout
of the tool cart by nesting the tools we
were able to add tools and reduce weight
without sacrificing strength we kept the
edges smooth so it feels great in your
hand when you're using the tools we
chose not to have an exposed blade so
the tool card is TSA compliant and it
won't damage your wallet instead we
added a blade protected by the can
opener so you can cut cords but not your
fingers the tool card weighs only one
ounce and slips easily into your wallet
so you won't notice it until you need
or ditch the wallet altogether the
innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease
no extra tools required no fasteners to
lose so you can quickly switch from
wallet card to money clip tool card is
made in America from blade quality 420
stainless steel which is then heat
treated for excellent strength and
hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics the tool card
makes an awesome gift that will last a
lifetime and it's scheduled to ship
before Father's Day and graduation we've
put in a lot of time to make this tool
as good as it can be please help us by
supporting our campaign and sharing it
with your friends thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
