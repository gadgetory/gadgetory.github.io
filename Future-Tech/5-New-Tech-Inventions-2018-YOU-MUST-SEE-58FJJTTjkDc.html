projector you already have into an
interactive whiteboard so you can share
your brilliant ideas learn a new
language and use your computer like
never before work more quickly as a
group whether you're all in the same
room or thousands of miles away
connected by the internet and of course
you can keep and share what you create
setup is easy download the app in pair
go touch with your smartphone or Windows
PC connected to your TV or projector and
start creating our team has been working
on guitars for more than a year it's
already working properly and offices and
schools across Korea but we want to
bring photos to the rest of the world to
do that we need your help to scale of
our production we all know what it can
make in our small office please support
us on Kickstarter and you can make any
TV or projector interactive recording
life is like shooting a movie and for
the one who is chasing perfection like
you the intent shake of handheld
photography is really maddening as the
director of life idea fly will be the
most valuable handheld PA n photographic
stabilizer for now with the original
telescopic arm technology it takes only
one second to complete the installation
and counterweight of the mobile phone
after a key start the idea fly by axial
330 degrees without dead angle-a-tron to
control rotation function not only can
guarantee the shooting without leaving
dead angle but also lets you easily
achieve stable shooting shooting jitter
will no longer become a trouble idea fly
uses a reliable Bluetooth technology to
tune in with 98% of its an sense
you can click on the capture button to
start shooting in order to eliminate as
much of the shake while mobile shooting
is possible idea flies team spent 200
days addressing a problem
compensation for jitter in shots a bit
more precise and sensitive eventually we
have achieved four halves the most
sensitive FOC algorithm in the world now
follow the shooting no matter when
you're running climbing or anything else
even if you deliberately shake the idea
fly in the shoot they can still give you
a very smooth picture stability is not
our only pursuit you can easily adjust
the tilt angle of your mobile phone by
using the control button of the handle
and you can also easily achieve any
angle you want to shoot from besides the
stable film mode idea fly can also be a
key into a lock shooting mode when you
need to lock a particular vantage point
in the shooting but your body had to
move at the same time the lock mode is
your best helper of course idea fly can
also switch the horizontal portrait mode
with single pressing the button
it's highly intensive body design
weighing less than 300 grams but it
allows it to easily carry anything under
six inches and simplify and become
strong excluding fragile and
non-essential 3-axis structures and the
garish but ill-equipped with most of the
equipment's app as well as the price of
these fancy concepts the fast sensitive
and powerful idea fly will record your
life in a smooth picture just like a
movie we've all seen this and the
magnetic charging cable that promises to
change your life we've all bought one
only to find out that it fails to do
what it promises and most certainly
never lives up to its own hype but
that's until we created Matt Moore the
perfectly engineered charging cable that
chose the game for your MacBook and
other devices madbull is the future and
unlike other charging cables that uses a
unique l-shaped connector which takes
course directly away from the connection
point ensuring your cable gets
disconnected safely and that your
devices are safe from trip hazards and
other accidents the l-shaped connector
also ensures that your cable doesn't get
in your way
when you are busy using your phone and
charge it at the same time mag bowl mix
charging simple quick and easy with a
perfectly balanced high-powered magnet
keeping your hands-free and allowing the
focus on the things that matter most we
even have a mag Beaulieu SVC power cable
a high-speed 2 meter charging cable that
guarantees your MacBooks safety as well
as your piece of
our three and one cable is compatible
with all devices lightning Android and
even USBC meaning one cable for
everything we wanted magpul's to be the
most durable cable on the market which
is why we enforced it with Kevlar you
know that stuff they put in bulletproof
vests and even in the armor of military
vehicles meaning that when you aren't
charging your device's well you can use
it to pull a car mad boy
the only magnetic charging cable you
should be where are you puppy what are
you looking for
did you see puppy puppy I just saw him
right there and it just disappear
yeah who are you
just call me black cat thank you so you
found him yeah hey everyone I'm black
