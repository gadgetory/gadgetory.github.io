never miss another update this is picked
our pro it makes your phone function and
feel like a DSLR see every time a new
smartphone comes out it's always about
one thing the camera they've gotten
amazing every small detail the camera is
always examined the size of the sensor
the amount of light that goes in a new
special tech for pixels and mountains of
software and algorithms as they call it
today
ai when you look closely at the efforts
they're made of two different things one
is to make a camera and the other is to
make everyone's experience or that a
good one that second part basically
means that you and a man who lives in a
cave will have the same outcome point
tap and that's it nothing to think about
or configure so many unbelievable
technological achievements in these
cameras that are even more amazing when
you can control them and they're buried
under mountains of menus some of them
can't even be controlled at all picked
our pro enables photographers to use all
the smartphone cameras incredible
features while maintaining a great user
experience here's how it works
I downloaded the pict our app then I
just slide picked our on now let's say I
want to take a picture of our camera guy
I use this wheel here that controls
exposure then I slowly move the zoom to
the desired spot then a short shutter
press for focus and they're a perfect
professional picture the three P's of
photography I just invented that that's
not even a real thing picked our feels
and looks just like a classic camera it
has a brass body with a satin chrome
finish just like like our Minox
besides looking beautiful that metal
gives picked our the firm grip and
weight of a camera for better stability
just like a camera picture has four
external buttons and wheels for precise
control over the phone's camera and for
unleashing its full potential to really
complete the camera feel and help take
pictures when the Sun glares on the
phone
there's the viewfinder it makes me feel
like Annie Leibovitz
or Robert Capa might be a better choice
being a man and all
let's look at the features picked our
comes with an app that detects all your
phone's abilities and in most phones
even adds capabilities that other phones
have it also has advanced video features
just like a real camera every one of
those features is accessible through the
wheels and buttons of picked our take
for example the continuous zoom an
important tool when shooting a video
with picked are I just use the rocker
switch through the app I can even
control the speed of the zoom simple
enough even for the caveman then there's
the shutter release button that easily
takes pictures when fully pressed and
that locks focus and exposure when half
pressed there's the exposure
compensation deal for better lighting
control it also allows for a quick flip
between front and back cameras you know
quick selfie between shots this button
here is called the smart wheel it allows
the user to easily scroll between eight
preset modes including full manual
shutter priority ISO and a video mode
offering advanced video features such as
white balance shutter speed and frame
rate the picked our app offers so many
professional photo and video options
just choose I'll go with macro I'm gonna
focus on this fight
we couldn't get a real spider press the
button and that's it a macro shot of a
fake spider I can also use the manual
focus on whatever part I choose because
it's a camera on the top of picked our
pro there is a cold shoe connector for
LED devices or a shotgun light and on
the bottom you can connect a tripod
another feature I like is that picked R
has a built-in battery and it wirelessly
charges your phone when it's in so your
shoots don't end up roughly with a dead
battery picked our pro works with really
almost any phone as long as it has a
phone shape and with most phone cases
also its future proof meaning that
whatever new OS or new Android candy
name will come out picked our pro
upgrades to fit it and there's no setup
or pairing process picked ours app and
buttons work through an ultrasonic
wireless system that takes very little
energy with instant engagement just plug
and play this is the second and more
advanced version of a star the team
behind it has successfully crowdfunded
and shipped the first picked are as well
as three other photography gear
campaigns this is their best product yet
so if you want to take professional
pictures like pictures are meant to be
taken support picked our and make the
most of your smartphone camera
this is the weed snatcher the amazing
new tool that quickly and easily removes
weeds from cracks and crevices get rid
of those unsightly weeds from sidewalks
driveways patios and wood decking in
minutes without using toxic chemicals
that are harmful to the environment
you'll spend much less time doing yard
work and more time relaxing at the push
of a button the adjustable handle
extends in length from 3 feet to 6 feet
making it easy and comfortable for both
adults and children with no bending over
the weed snatcher also comes with
interchangeable heads James from the
larger tip for sidewalks and driveways
to the smaller tip for patios and decks
and it's so easy to use a quick pass
with the weed snatcher followed by
another with a broom and
are done you simply have to try to
believe it
reserve your weed snatcher today when
you're trying to go as fast as light as
possible obviously weight is a huge
factor but days like that also demand
that you stay fully hydrated so that you
can consistently be performing at your
best those two things really conflict
because water adds a ton of weight
we designed the trail shop micro filter
to help you save weight essentially it
gives you a full day's water supply at a
mere five ounces and fits in your pocket
when I trail run I like to carry two
small water bottles when those are empty
I can use the trail shop filter to drink
directly and instantly from a stream
along the trail then I can quickly fill
in my bottles with clean water and get
going again or if I'm wearing a
hydration pack I can connect it straight
to my hose and fill up my reservoir the
trail shaft filter is so tiny it fits in
a stash pocket alongside my bars and
it's quick to deploy you just drop the
pre-filter in the water and start
filtering it treats a liter of water in
60 seconds the trail shop filter uses
hollow fiber technology that meets the
highest standards for removing protozoa
like Giardia and Cryptosporidium and
bacteria like e.coli and Salmonella so
you have reliable water all along your
journey the filter cartridge has a 2000
litre lifespan depending on water
conditions which for me is seasons of
water at MSR our goal is to design
products for simplicity and
functionality giving you everything you
need and nothing you don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
