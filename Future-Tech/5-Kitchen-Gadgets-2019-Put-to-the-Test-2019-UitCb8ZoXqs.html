Darren the CrossFit enthusiast Wiley has
the energy to do five hundred squat
thrusts wearing a lead vest he somehow
lacks the energy to rinse out his
smoothie cups this is Cheryl from book
club she prefers her novel Stevie and
her Merlot from a box and as her
wineglass will surely a test
this is sweet little Georgie he likes to
drink and burp up formula from his
favorite bottle here they're all
wonderful folks but they leave a trail
of hard to clean cuts glasses and
bottles it's why we created the first
wave glass rinser the solution to the
age-old problem of dried on gunk just
press downward and high-pressure water
jets upward powering away remnants
before they have a chance to dry the
glass Ritzer is also ideal for washing
narrow items like bottles and champagne
flutes in a home bar you can use it to
pre rinse clean pipe glasses or bugs it

I understand how frustrating it is to
struggle through food prep with a dull
knife there has to be a better way to
always have a sharp knife in my kitchen
unfortunately all knives get dull even
ours new edge knives offers the world's
first and only kitchen knife with a
disposable blade dull blades can be
recycled or put in the trash the knife
you're going to reach for in your
kitchen is the sharpest one you've got
so when a blade gets dull just push the
release button and remove the blade
insert a new ultra sharp blade and you
are immediately ready to continue
slicing and dicing new edge knives come
with either three or six factory sharp
blades it's like having three knives and
one that's enough cutting power to keep
your kitchen going for months or even a
year new edge knives are dishwasher safe
stain resistant and come with the
one-year warranty new edge knives are
always the sharpest knife in your
kitchen
let's face water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more that Chuck hey
though we decided to put some fun into
drinking water with the right Cup it's
the world's first-ever fruit flavored
cup designed to get people drinking more
water and we believe it's going to be a
real game-changer so how does it work
well for starters our brain identifies
flavor using two main senses taste and
smell that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved
fruit scent and flavor directly into the
right Cup so when you drink water from
it your nose picks up the fruity aroma
your tongue senses the hint of a sweet
taste when in fact you're only drinking
natural water but does it work well we
asked ourselves that very same question
so we put the right cup to the test with
our orange flavored prototypes it's not
just water tastes like something else
just water
it's crazy brilliant just brilliant
the right Cup is great for anyone who
wants to cut down on sugary drinks and
drink more water which is basically
