refrain the beep ring is basically about
freedom and unity we like to scream you
like this nation white as well the city
how can you do that with music
we began the design process two years
ago I took the test of the streets
people are crazy about the VP
you
the betrayer is a cleaner potable Spiga
backpack it's made of an impact
resistant outer shell an aluminium of
stainless steel hardware and then only
weighs six kilograms
as for the sound performance we've got
two woofers
dome tweeters and a blasting level
volume above 110 decibels beep ring and
uses bluetooth for wireless streaming
from your phone other devices
it simply all connects
and it sounds like this repeat bringer
is very easy to use we've got the signal
not the battery indicator and the master
volume battery time is about 15 hours it
can be placed and recharged anywhere at
any time if you fainted the beep ring
please support us we're a couple of
young engineers who like to party and
move around with music on our backs why
not bring it all together the beat
ringer is made with love from all of us
to all of you who's crazy enough to
bring it
presenting a stir the world's safest
commute backpack be visible from the
sides and from a distance the rear light
makes sure you're visible from up to a
distance of 250 meters a feature never
seen before profile lights provide
better definition to your shape making
it easier for motorists to judge your
relative speed you can warn those behind
you when you stop with automatic brake
lights that are triggered instantly let
everyone know which way you'll go
indicate using a convenient handlebar
unit that syncs your actions with the
bags lights be seen in the rearview
mirror with a stirs front lights having
front lights on the back straps apart
from helping you avoid getting door
allow you to be seen by vehicles of all
Heights they also help you get noticed
by motorists coming towards you without
blinding them our mobile app allows you
to configure your bags light settings to
match brightness and safety regulations
around the globe you can also set up a
theft alarm with a geo lock system on
the app that's not all astir is also the
ultimate commute back pack and here's
why a discreet yet stylish bag for the
workplace Astra has a 100% polyurethane
coated surface and zippers giving you
complete weather resistance it has a
sleek exterior and comes with easy
access compartments for your gadgets and

the bag when not in use another unique
safety feature is the emergency
information slot which can be accessed
in times of need all these features make
Astor the perfect bag for any commuter
as a commuter cyclist myself I decided
to take control of my own safety at
Lumos we spent months on research and
prototyping and are now production-ready
we have used world-class materials and
we have partnered with quality conscious
manufacturers to bring out the first set
of bags as a company we've been
developing variable Tec for cyclists for
the last two years and now bring to you
another fantastic product we need your
support to bring asta to life join us by
supporting our campaign thank you
hi my name is Heather and I'm a
professional slackliner from the US when
I'm on the High Line I tried to be fully
in each moment in each step and nowhere
else so when I'm using my slacklining
gear I don't have to constantly be
thinking about if I'm safe because I
know that I trust the gear I trust it's
rating it's the same thing with other
products in life you know you don't want
to have to a pack that's digging into
your shoulders or hurting your back the
way that it's sitting and positioned
it's distracting you from what your
purpose is so finding a backpack that is
comfortable looks nice and can be in
pretty much any situation it's really
amazing we get it you carry around a lot
from laptops to water bottles but the
conventional backpack just doesn't cut
it we've noticed most everyday backpacks
are made to save money at our backs
expense they may look great or seem
smart they do little to protect and
sometimes even harm our backs that is
why we spared no expense creating a
beautiful backpack that's well balanced
and perfectly tailored to your body a
backpack that gives your body a break
meet Joey whether you take your bike for
a ride
a rushing to work we're on your way to
the gym
Joey's got your back every day
everywhere in fact we listen not willing
to Heather but to you the travelers who
love exploring foreign cultures to
thrill-seekers looking for that next
adventure
and those who just want to enjoy a
stunning sunrise Joey is different from
a conventional everyday backpack we took
high-end technology from travel gear and
brought it to your everyday life Joey is
on point well balanced and perfectly
tailored to your body need a more space
Joey expands in a very unique way
retaining balance even when doubled in
size looking for accessibility Joey has
a pair of easily accessible pockets you
can take out your cell phone wallet or
keys on the go and store them safely so
you can have your hands-free again now
we can even mention the countless ways
to stow things like your laptop charger
power bank umbrella or Passport koala
stands for uncompromising quality and
visionary design Joey is our masterpiece
we only use waterproof fabrics and
zippers and place great importance on
durability
Joey is comfortable
versatile
sleeeeep
organized
sophisticated
and yet simple we're a group of people
who try to see the world from a slightly
different angle together we founded
koala to challenge the way backpacks
were used
the best thing about our campaign is
that we are ready for production but we
need your support to make it happen on
behalf of koala thank you for bringing
Joey to life
backpacks are part of our life as
mundane as air and water we throw things
we can't live without in them and told
them about everywhere we go every day we
never even bothered us stop and think
about what they can and should do so
what if backpacks can charge your
devices what if we turn them into our
alternative persona meet backpacks a
beautifully designed urban backpack
perfect for a connected on-the-go
lifestyle of today backpacks is fully
weatherproof it is constructed entirely
using material made from recycled
bottles the bag houses 30 liters worth
of your everyday items like a 15-inch
laptop one 10 inch tablet and a number
of other needed gadgets and gears
backpacks features a side access for
your laptop a u-lock hook belt a yoga
mat loop and a shoe pocket backpacks is
the sleek all-around backpack for
today's urban commuters I'm a frequent
traveler and it always bothers me how my
backpacks can't keep up with Maine it
can't charge my dead cell phone and they
all look pretty embarrassing in the
office I need a bag that's going to keep
up with my day to day lifestyle I need a
bag with unlimited possibilities and I'm
just not going to be satisfied until I
get one we need a solution for the
problems we've had and for the problems
we will have a smart docking system is
that answer but we need your support the
bag now has a finished design and a
prototype but we need your support in
order to make the smart badge system
we really appreciate the wus and whoa is
on Facebook and Instagram and so please
pledge today and let's build a better
bag for tomorrow we're proud to
introduce the ample smart backpack
the world's most advanced portable
charging solution integrated directly
into the fabric of a bag I think that it
should be easier to charge your phone in
your laptop wherever you are without
needing to find a power outlet my life
is lived on the go I can't keep my
laptop charged past noon my phone needs
to be plugged in before 3:00 p.m. I must
have tried every portable charging
system portable battery most of them
just don't get it done what I really
need is a serious charging solution that
can power anything anytime anywhere but
the portable charging solution that I
needed didn't exist and I wanted to
build it and when I explained what I
wanted to do to some engineering friends
of mine they wanted to help because they
needed it to we're proud to introduce
the ample smart backpack the portable
charging solution that we needed and we
think you might need to and we're proud
to have been named a 2015 CES Innovation
Awards honoree in two categories a
testament to the engineering rigor that
was put into the development of this
product so I've been designing bags for
over a decade and the challenge here was
that the bag wasn't just holding your
devices but you are also plugging your
devices into the bag for them to be
charged I started to create illustration
drawings where I would then send them to
Tomoko and she would start engineering
the housings around those pieces and
then she would send them back and I
would tailor the bag design around her
CAD day our goal was to create a design
that was truly intuitive for the user
and we wanted the electronics to almost
disappear into the fabrics of the bag
the ample smart backpack can charge all
of your devices is overnight wore
throughout the day we integrated a
powerful custom-built battery that can
recharge a smartphone two to three times
there's a USB port in every pocket and
you can add three expansion batteries
for days that you need more power the
modular batteries charge rapidly when
walked into the bag but can also be
removed and used separately you can
stick in your coat pocket or your purse
and take it to dinner with you and you
don't have to carry the bag with you to
have that backup power when we first
thought about putting electronics into a
backpack we immediately worried what
happens if you drop it so we added shock
absorbers and an extra layer foam all
the way around and we applied a
water-resistant coating to all of the
exterior fabrics to help keep the rain
out if you ever forgotten your backpack
at a coffee shop the ample smart
backpack can alert you if you do and we
built a mobile app that will monitor
battery levels connected devices and
smart sensors in the bag or you can use
the OLED display and touch sensor to
monitor the vitals inside of the bag
without ever opening a zipper ample is a
talented team of designers and engineers
with decades of experience launching new
products more importantly though we're
commuters travelers coffee shop dwellers
and on-the-go doers and we needed a more
ample bag we have a plan to get into
production by early summer but we need
help to get there we're hoping to raise
at least 125 thousand dollars to cover
the cost of tooling and raw materials
and as a thank you to our early backers
we're offering a 25 percent discount on
the bag and all of the accessory modules
please support us in bringing the ample
smart backpack to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
