I started my career at Philips in 2007 I
decided to pursue my own dream and start
my first company alfonzo it's currently
the fastest growing art a company in
Europe but I started with absolutely
nothing back home in the living room
aqua computers was raised with the same
spirit as Avanza it's a new concept a
new venture a team with a vision about
why and how to do things different
everything we do at Arco is inspired by
what I think is the definition of
radical innovation we have created the
product with a unique form factor and
new functionality being able to present
the OCO serious a to you today is what
made me hand in my contract nine years I
think this product is disruptive and you
will get a great device to support us
and perhaps even more important is that
you will contribute to a company that
has a lot more ideas about doing things
differently if you two are passionate
about true innovation just like aku then
