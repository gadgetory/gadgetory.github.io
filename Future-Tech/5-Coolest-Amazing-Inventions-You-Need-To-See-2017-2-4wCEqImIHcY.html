introducing Hashmi the world's first
mask for mobile mouths hush me is a
personal acoustic device that protects
speech privacy in open space
environments by using exclusive passive
voice suppression and active voice
masking technology
a stylish economic design for a
long-term where
how could you be his father if your last
name is Vader and his last name is
Skywalker oh hi this is no go ahead
mount display with image quality that
doesn't suck like other head mount
displays moco turns your phone into a
big screen but unlike other head mount
displays
Mogo doesn't lose pixels the magic of
bogo is in the lenses they were created
by this guy Arthur Sze the lenses of
other head mount displays can only see
half the screen so the devices cut the
size of the original screen in half then
puts an even smaller image side by side
that allows you to watch 3d movies but
also creates pixelation so even if you
have a 2k phone you'll only see 1/5 of
the pixels and that's less than HD
with mojo Arthur created these special
lenses each covers the whole screen thus
maintaining the full quality if you've
used other head mount devices you might
have noticed that your Isaac you can get
dizzy and sometimes even nauseous that's
because their lenses need to be
perfectly aligned and adjusted to the
distance between your eyes
logos lenses don't need any adjusting so
you can watch a full length movie
without any side effects man I feel so

Mogo has a lot of other advantages
unlike other devices logo allows you to
see your peripheral environment so you
don't look like an idiot to use Mogo
just put your phone in that's it and
Danny phone fit and there's also a
foldable version
logo fits perfectly even with glasses
and if you want to pause or rewind just
use your finger
that's good rewinding oh and ask for
drones you know when you use them to
shoot fancy high-resolution video
wouldn't you want to see the full
resolution of what you're shooting yeah
GameChanger look at that whale that's a
man drowning we should call for help
Mogo also has an app that shows your
actual drill location on your phone
screen even when the drone is out of
sight now that's at a site so if you too
want to watch content in the best
quality or phone offers get Mogo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
