the new easy roll wheel system allows
you to expertly finish all types of
outside corner bead up to two times
faster than finishing by hand easy roll
wheels provide a rotating shoulder to
guide the finishing box along the corner
bead without aftermarket attachments or
damage to the axle
they are the professional way to finish
all types of outside corner bead
including metal paper-based vinyl and
bullnose the shoulder of the easy roll
wheels is more than three times wider
than aftermarket products making it
easier to place and keep the finishing
box on the corner bead and easy roll
wheels are perfectly aligned with the
finishing blade eliminating the need to
change the way you've run your finishing
boxes for years some aftermarket
products actually tell you to tilt the
finishing box in order to make their
product work but the tape tech design
lets you run the tool the way it was
designed to run straight down the corner
easy roll wheels are included on all
tape tech finishing boxes and they don't
change the way the finishing box runs on
standard flat joints don't spend $50 or
more on bolt on aftermarket parts buy
tape tech finishing boxes with easy roll
wheels and finish your outside corners
in half the time we've got the hundred
mill traditional bow stuff been around
for a lot of years used for cutting
blocks bricks and everything else when
cutting a block you can only cut part of
the block and also there's a danger bit
coming off a striking point and hitting
your thumb or your finger what they did
they tried to get over that problem
bring it in the mushroom to protect your
hand when cutting it but a lot of
bricklayers don't like using them
because when you cut the block and
follow that through this bit of plastic
comes down and hits you on the back of
the hand the blockbuster bowel stop
we've got a 230 mil blade which is the
depth of your block striking point on
the top
just as important is the handle on the
side so your striking point these on the
top of the bolster and your hand is over
well out the way we've also introduced
hundred mill lines offer your bolster up
to your mark spin the bolster round cut
the block eliminates the use of a tape
also used on your Gables you cut ups on
your Gables your angled cuts straight
through the block bus is not only good
for cutting blocks with you can also cut
bricks of it there you go nice straight
cut the block buster bolster a lot
quicker a lot more accurate and a lot
safer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
