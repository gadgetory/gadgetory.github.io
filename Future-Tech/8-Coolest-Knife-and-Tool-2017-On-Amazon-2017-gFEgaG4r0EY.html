the Leon mAh designed Eaton tool this is
one of our very most popular products of
all time and with good reason basically
it is a glorified spork a spork on
steroids if you will you've got your
spoon there as well as your fork times
right there you got a bottle opener that
works very nicely right here we have a
cutout for your hand so you can grip it
nicely and the thing about that is it's
going to cut down on the weight
significantly this tool only weighs 1.5
ounces so if you're looking for
something for backpacking or just
something light for your kit for your
car kit or camping this is a great
little tool you've got a little flathead
screwdriver there kind of a chisel point
on the end right there and then you've
got three metric wrenches you've got a
ten millimeter and eight millimeter and
a six millimeter comes with a carabiner
so you can clip it to your backpack clip
it to your pants or gear that sort of
thing now I love this tool I have a
black one myself I take it camping all
the time and highly enjoy it comes in
black as well as your orange I believe
we call that tangerine is the official
color name on that one
fuchsia which is to say pink and we have
a yellow one as well the colorful ones
have a little bit more high visibility
so you're less likely to lose it in camp
so keep that in mind when you're
selecting your color anyway it is a very
cool tool designed by Leon MA and
available all over the place thanks for
watching if you have any questions be
sure to visit our website and thank you
for buying using and eating off of CRKT
tools thanks and have a great day the

along each of the four edges it also
includes an aggressive spike to
effectively cut and puncture tough
materials the Chokin has three cutting
edges and a blunt hammer head

a look at the Allen folds designed spew
spew standing for small pocket everyday
worn cliff very cool little neck knife
or just a little utility knife for your
belt the overall length on this one is
six and a quarter inches the blade
length is three inches you can see it's
got a bead blast finish on it it's also
hallow ground
warn cliff blade style on it these
handle scales are really great they're
g10 and they're contoured so they fit
nicely in the hand they've kind of got a
brownish black color to them one thing I
like about this is it's got the fob here
on the bottom of it so when you're
holding it in your hand it is a little
small but that fob adds a little bit of
real estate to the handle comes with
this injection molded sheath slips right
in there very nicely comes with the
paracord you need to carry it in the
neck carry position and as well all of
the hardware for this belt loop is
included so you just attach it you've
got your nuts and bolts there different
fasteners so you can carry it this way
tip up tip down I mean there's a lot of
options with this sheath to hook that
belt loop on there so if you're carrying
it on your belt a lot of different
things you can do with it I want to show
you here compared to my house key it is
a fairly small knife kind of a
minimalistic blade only available from
CRKT thank you for watching if you have
any questions visit our website and
thank you for carrying crkt knives hi
i'm ryan johnson president of rmj
tactical and i designed for CRKT
next in the lineup we have the new
Shogun it's a drop forged classic
traditional tomahawk
this is drop forged 10:55 its
differentially heat treated so that the
forward edge is hardened the rest of the
body is tough and springy
it has an american-made Tennessee made
Hickory handle it's made in San Joaquin
Valley Tennessee there's a one and a
half degree taper on the top of the head
and of the handle and then also in the
internal eye so that the head is always
tightening as you use it which is the
same way they were doing talks 250 years
ago this is a nice beefy hawk good for
going out into the woods kicking around
it's a good wood chopper it also throws
away another drop for chalk we have this
year is the Kenji would talk the Kenji
would talk is a spike version of the
other hawk as a little bit wider blade
same nice wood chopping profile it's an
excellent thrower
and it has this nice nice long spike you
can throw with the spike you can also do
breaching with the spike breaks break
locks etc i'm ryan johnson i designed
with CRKT because they believe in
quality designs and quality product you
look at the innovative snap lock knife
first released in 2004 designer ed van
hoy shook up the industry with this
original design this ended up collecting
quite a few accolades over the years
including most innovative knife at the
blade show let me show you how it works
the snap lock mechanism is simpler than
it appears simply push down on the top
of the cam and use your thumb to swing
the blade open 180 degrees you'll feel
the blade click into place and the blade
is securely locked up now to close the
knife push on the cam stud here this
will disengage a blade and swing the
blade to the closed position once it's
closed the perfect fit ensures that no
part of the sharpened edge is exposed
let me show you that one more time push
down on the top of the cam and use your
thumb to swing the blade open 180
degrees to close the knife push on the
cam stud here this will disengage the
blade then swing the blade to the closed
position
pretty cool mechanism overall an
incredible award-winning innovation
that would be a great conversation piece
at any knife party the snap-loc is also
ambidextrous so if you take the clip off
of this side you can simply reattach it
to the other side and use the knife
left-handed overall when the knife is
open it's about six and a quarter inches
long and the blade is around 2.5 inches
the overall weight is 2.5 ounces which
equals about 71 grams which is very
lightweight the blade shape is a subtle
drop point or close to a modified
warrant lift style and it has this
attractive bead blast finish the handles
are completely stainless steel with a
lanyard hole feature the whole package
comes with a quick-release paracord
lanyard that you can clip on to the back
of the knife here there are two options
available a plain edged blade that's
model number five one zero two N and
there's displayed with triple point
serrations which is model 5 1 1 2 n
