almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth
sort tilde floss but who likes flossing
anyone that's what I thought and I don't
blame you it's awkward it's
time-consuming and here's the real
kicker it's not even the most effective
way to clean between your teeth
according to a recent Associated Press
report there has to be a better way
until now water flossers have been one
of the only players in the game their
tedious messy and more often than not
end up stuffed under a cabinet somewhere
tooth shower is next level water
flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to all care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which hits the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush is handled it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the
shower you'll never run out of water and
you won't have to sacrifice any precious
counterspace and let's not forget about
the revolutionary government offer deer
gaining and stimulating blood flow in
your gums this is a huge part of gum
disease prevention and in less than 10
seconds you can flush out everything
between all your teeth while massaging
your go
for the first time ever you'll actually
enjoy cleaning with each attachment you
can adjust the water pressure and
temperature to your comfort level and
use with your choice of water mouthwash
or tooth whitening when you're ready to
switch attachments just remove and swamp
worried about getting water everywhere
well you're in the shower so it doesn't
matter and with multiple attachments the
whole family can use to each other which
means better oral hygiene for everyone
that means a lot fewer expensive and
painful dental procedures and fewer
instances of gum disease you probably
won't be surprised to learn it was
created by a dental hygienist Lisa's
been deep in the tooth world for over 25
years and she realized there wasn't a
single easy convenient way for her
patients to effectively clean them to
you so she decided to design on herself
no power source no mess and because it's
in the shower to shower is easy to
integrate into your routine becoming as
second nature as washing your hair face
Lisa and her team have been hard at work
perfecting 2 showers design and
prototyping
now they just need your help getting to
shower to the masses with the funds
raised here they'll be able to place a
bulk first order to get these made and
bring to shower to market for a whole
new approach to rural hygiene tooth
shower the future of oral hygiene is in
the shower back our campaign today
euro clip was originally a crowdfunded
concept the product is simple intuitive
and incredibly versatile is a 3m one
clip swivel
and hook with a rubber tip that allows
you to store cold carry organized and
easily accessed gear of any sort at any
adventure or a daily life an extra ham

with the idea for Hero clip I was a very
active parent of two small kids training
to summit Mount Rainier and juggling a
hundred other things
I love getting outside and exploring and
I wanted to have a tool that I could use
for all the different things I do not
just one or the other so we created a
tool that does it all a tool that makes
it easier to do all the things you want
to do every day
