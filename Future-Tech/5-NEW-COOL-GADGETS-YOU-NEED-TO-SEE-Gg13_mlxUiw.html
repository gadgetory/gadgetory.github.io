never miss another update it's virtually
impossible for modern writers to stay
focused using traditional computers and
that's why we created traveller the
portable distraction free writing tool
the travel enables you to finish your
novel finish your blog post
finish your paper finish your screenplay
whatever you're working out whatever
your writing and enables you to get that
done faster and more creatively
traveller is our brand-new distraction
free writing tool that we've taken all
of the feedback and all the comments
about our original free right smart
typewriter and put it into a brand new
ultra portable small compact folding
product that's also available at a lower
cost so the way the traveller works is
it really is as simple as turning it on
and you can start writing you sit down
you start writing it's all saved locally
on the device and as soon as you're
connected to a network it seamlessly
backs up to the cloud I think laptops
rightfully so have got a very bad name
for their keyboard designs as we've kind
of gone for slimmer and slimmer of
keyboards we've lost sort of this typing
experience and so for us when we were
designing traveller it was really
important for us to think about how can
this be the best keyboard for this board
their writings really can make one of
the things that was really important to
us when we designed a traveller was the
battery life we knew that writers loved
to travel they loved to be inspired by
the environments they're in the traveler
has about 30 hours of battery life of
continuous use so this is the device you
really can't take with you unlike a
traditional LCD that's found in your
laptop or your phone we used eh ink is a
unique type of technology that allows
actual ink particles to come to the
surface of the display the best thing
about e ink is that you can use it
outside and it works in every
environment with the long battery life
and the e-ink screen it is the ultimate
we've shipped the original three right
smart typewriter to customers in over 50
countries all around the world and what
we've heard consistently from them is
that it's helping them actually double
their hourly work count so whereas
before some of writers may have written
four to 500 words now they're writing
800 to a thousand words per hour and
that dramatically increased their
productivity and is able to actually
help them get their writing done for me
one of the things that has continuously
inspired me and continuously kind of has
enabled me to put like my whole heart
into it is that the people that are
using free rights and the people that
will be using travellers or making
amazing thing
making work smart they're literally
pursuing their dreams with our product
and I think that is just the most
inspiring thing the traveller is in
prototype form and working great it's
based off of the freeride platform and
so we have a clear path to production
but we still need your help to be able
to deliver the product to you in the
spring of next year join us and be part
of our mission to help writers
everywhere break free from distraction
join our campaign and let's
revolutionize how the world writes
almost 30% of people forget whether or
not they locked their door they end up
wasting precious time to return home and
check the door or risking potential
burglary meet sure key it's the world's
first add-on for your keys that gives
you the peace of mind that your house is
safe with sure key you don't need to go
back and check the door you just need to
look at the shirt key to get to know if
your door is locked
it's easy affordable and much safer than
smart locks
Shirky notifies you if the key is left
in the lock whether it's on the inside
or the outside of the door are you sure
you lock the door with jerky you are so
you're planning a trip overseas and
you've spent hours upon hours searching
heaps of websites looking for the most
affordable data plan we know that
searching for a data connection can be a
tremendous headache not to mention
expensive that's why we've developed
turn-turn is a travel size device meant
to solve all your communication woes
before you go select the country you're
visiting then turn will provide a list
of options simply compare and pick the
best plan for you finally prior to
departure one-click activate your plan
to enjoy a data connection upon arrival
to your destination
all that remains is to connect the turns
Wi-Fi and you are set no more switching
SIM cards no more hassle this is the new
opening V cam h7 it's a hackable
expandable computer vision module that
fits in the palm of your hand our goal
if the open MP cam project was to create
a super simple but flexible computer
vision platform that can instantly power
on in seconds for applications in the
real world what I like about open MV is
first of all it's a single contained
package that tests the camera the
processor and the micro Python
environment and what I really like is
the idea in the development environment
which is Python which is easy to use
it's interactive so you get to see the
results in real time and it's otherwise
I mean just plug and play and that's you
know huge advantage just getting right
down to the computer vision folks have
been begging us to release the open MV
cam h7 and it's finally here the open MV
km/h 7 is a much improved version of the
open MV cam m7 we have all the same
features like color tracking and Apryl
tags and face detection but now we've
doubled the processing performance we
now have a removable camera module
system which lets you easily replace the
current camera module for things like
global shutter imaging to capture fast
action and eliminate motion blur by
combining the open mV km/h 7 with a FLIR
lepton you can now create a thermal
imaging camera that can run off battery
power so it's like having a superpower
of you know two different kinds of
patient you can see the world the way a
human sees it or see the world the way
an insect sees it and by combining the
two you can see the world better than
both the additional processing power
finally allows you to run neural
networks on images in the wild the
exciting new feature that's coming out
with this is the deal to do deep
learning convolutional neural networks
being able to kind of run inference
layers since we introduced our original
open MV camera we've shipped over 10,000
units and seen amazing applications
utilizing our hardware we've seen
students build autonomous cars capable
of following the line
we've seen drones capable of
automatically landing using computer
vision and everything else in between
since our original campaign we've now
got five shields for you to add to your
open mV camera we've got a proto shield
a several controller shield a motor
shield a Wi-Fi shield and finally an LCD
shield let's say you want to build an
autonomous remote controller card with
the open MV camera you can literally put
all the brains right in one module at
the top and run some several controller
wires down to our scene controller down
here and ESC for motor controller like
any great video game it's easy to pick
up but hard to master
I think openmp is easy to pick up but
then there's this extraordinary amount
of depth still they are waiting for you
to master our mission is to connect
makers with a small affordable and
expandable computer vision module and
since we've shipped over 10,000 units
they've gotten the kinks out and know
what we're doing we need your help to
fund the production run of the new open
Envy km/h 7 we hope you'll join us these
are cross strips patent pending fitness
gear created with one purpose in mind
and that purpose is you so that no
matter what no matter where you can be
fit most of us know that Fitness is
important but we need equipment that's
better at meeting our needs the crowded
gyms the bulky equipment and the cost of
it all make it hard to access equipment
that will keep us fit that's why we
created cross grips here at J flex we
invented the world's first multi gym
fitness handles these two grips allow
you to do pull-ups push-ups and are an
anchor for other fitness gear
accessories to make the ultimate gear we
talked to hundreds of
people who care about fitness and found
that needed to be three things compact
versatile and quality cross cribs are
compact they transform from pull-ups to
push-ups to the size of a book making
cross grips mighty small it's the upper
body workout you can take wherever you
go try burying the alternative not gonna
happen so whether you're at home at work
or halfway around the world we've got
you covered
cross grips are versatile as to
individual handles they allow you to do
multiple variations of pull-ups and
push-ups for a complete upper body
workout need help with situps
cross grips has your back and feet
crossed ribs also serves as the perfect
anchor for ab straps extension straps
and resistant bands so you can tray that
room full of equipment in your home or
gym for this finally cross grips are
quality our patent-pending design allows
cross grips to lock on to almost any
doorframe because you should be able to
bring your workout with you no matter
where you go you can set them up in less
than 15 seconds and an internal spring
allows it to securely clamp on to your
door so you can exercise with full
confidence that means more of this and
less of that we also know that your
equipment needs to be as strong as you
are
no problem cross rips hold up to 300
pounds in weight if you have felt the
pain of trying to stay fit and balance
life at the same time cross grips are
for you after almost a year of research
and development and now with
glass manufacturers standing by we can't
wait to put a cross grips into your
hands by backing this Kickstarter
campaign you'll be one of the first
people in the world to have the gym that
fits anywhere so you can be fitting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
