the average American worker spends six
hours a day at their desk the average
gamer spends an additional seven hours a
week in the desk the average under desk
temperature that's only 32 degrees
Fahrenheit yep this is what we do with
our feet during the hours and hours we
spend at our desk we could continue
doing this but there's a better way to
sit at your desk
we call it the foot hammock the most
comfortable way city
I'm a college student and a gamer so I
spend more than my fair share of time
sitting at my desk really more hours
than I spend sleeping and I was I was
sitting at my desk I realized my feet
were getting cold my legs were really
supported I wasn't really as comfortable
as I wanted to be as I started looking
for better solutions I tried a bunch of
different things I tried a cardboard box
that wasn't very comfortable I tried my
printer I need a breaking that so I got
together with my roommate Brent and we
began developing the foot hammock the
two main problems we're going to solve
for how to support your feet and keep
them warm we wanted a product that would
be comfortable machine washable easy to
take off and put back on and most
importantly we wanted to work on every
desk after going through the design
process we went through 50 different
types of fabrics over 20 different ways
to attach it to your desk using velcro
suction cups double-sided tapes and we
finally came up with a product that we
have for you today the foot hammock
seamlessly sticks to the bottom of any
desk using a powerful patented adhesive
technology that can hold up to a hundred
pounds it's easy to put on it's easy to
take off and it works under every desk
the foot habit can be adjusted to any
position desired whether you want it
close to the ground or up and out of the
way we've created a product that is
really amazing and comfortable to use so
let's take a look at our rewards we've
created three versions of this product
the first version is the original it's
made of mesh which allows you to use a
product with your shoes on you can also
use the product with your shoes off and
the breathable material lets your feet
keep cool the second version is our
fleece version this can be used with
your shoes but it was really made to be
used barefoot it's really comfortable
and allows you to keep your feet cozy
and very warm
finally we have a heated version of the
fleece blanket this allows you to adjust
the heat to your desired level keeping
your feet out of 10 out of 10 on the
warmness scale now is a stretch goal we
had $100,000 for all fleece Packers will
provide a free fleece blanket attachment
that envelops the heat and keeps your
feet extra warm with your help acting
and sharing this project I know that we
can hit this goal you spend a lot of
money making sure your sleeping
experience is as comfortable as possible
you spent just about as much time at a
desk as you do sleeping so we think you
should invest in your comfort here too
and that's why I invented the foot
hammock we appreciate all your support
and thanks for backing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
