hi my name is Brian min and for those of
us who truly enjoy the tactile act of
typing I want to show you a project that
is guaranteed to bring back a bit of fun
and excitement back to your desktop
computing experience you know as a game
developer I spent a lot of time on my
computer typing a lot so I thought I
want more out of this device that I use
every day to connect with everyone
that's important in my life now I've
been fascinated with vintage typewriters
for some time and I gotta say they're
just beautiful on the other hand I've
been completely obsessed with modern
mechanical keyboards mechanical
keyboards feature individual switches
and will give you the kind of tactile
feedback that will make you smile so I
thought if I could somehow merge the two
now that will be fun and beautiful it
all started with an old discarded
keyboard in my garage all the way to
modding a very popular off-the-shelf
gaming keyboard eventually I built an
entirely conceptual keyboard combining
elements from a real typewriter for the
modern mechanical keyboard
finally that prototype resulted in a
brand new hybrid mechanical keyboard
that is both fun to type on and
beautiful to look at so now I present to
you the quirky writer the porky rider is
an 84 key USB typewriter inspired
mechanical keyboard it's fun to type on
and beautiful to look at
it's even got a place to stand your
favorite tablet the return bar is
cosmetic but I plan on enabling
additional functionalities depending
upon the success of our crowdfunding
including Bluetooth and wireless
capabilities so this is where I'm in the
project I need to raise enough funds for
a final iteration and engineering pass
on the production prototype tooling
costs for keycaps in the frame and the
final assembly this is where you the
backers come in we can partner together
to see this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
