it all started with the idea of making a
physical version of pong one of the
first video games ever created early on
we realized the magnitude of the
challenge and that's how the table pong
project was born as the project evolved
we wanted it to be more than a table
with a game we started adding functions
like charging your cell phone listening
to music through Bluetooth then
displaying the time when you're using it
as a table for the past three years
we've been perfecting the design we
tried magnets different surfaces motors
etc to build the prototype we have today
some months ago we decided to share the
project on social media to see what
people thought about it and it had a
wonderful reception this motivated us to
continue developing this project which
is where we're at right now the
simplicity of pong is what makes it
possible to play with kids and adults
it's fun for all ages
I believe that the table can be in homes
but also could be in offices in bars
after all of these events we're very
committed to move forward and we want to
bring the table pong project to every
part of the world and for that we need
your support
