never miss another update this is a
smart safe mother we're going out of
town for a few days before we're just
having guests over we like to keep our
valuables hidden unsecure smart safes
our line of products designed to look
like everyday household objects but are
actually hidden compartments we tried
other safes and they were either way too
big and bulky or they just took way too
long to get into which can be a problem
when storing objects you need daily
access to like jewelry or prescription
medication the vent fits between two
studs which makes it easy for anyone to
install
smart safes use your phone to open up
and they give you a variety of ways to
access your safe different open options
allow me to customize my level of
security oh and if you don't have a
smartphone or you just don't want to use
one you can always use your RFID card to
open up the app keeps track every time
we're smart safes used now you know who
opens your safe and when the shelves
come in a variety of colors and styles
which makes it easy to find the one that
matches your home now your valuables are
locked and secured well conveniently
accessible hidden in plain sight
hi Kickstarter I'm hunter the founder
and creative director of Prague Hill the
design studio based in Brooklyn New York
we developed a manufacturer variety
distinct and thoughtful objects inspired
by experimentation and our sense of
curiosity some of our most popular
products include the Wilson gearing's
the ripple opener the jack puzzle and
now introducing our newest product the
venn puzzle Ben puzzles comprised three
identical pieces diecast and stainless
steel and weighing in at almost G pounds
the Assembly of the puzzle initially
seems pretty simple but once you get it
in your hands you realize it requires a
high level of dexterity and precision
all the pieces have to align the
simultaneously and then the unexpected
success of some of our more conceptual
products has given us the confidence to
produce the vent puzzle we've been lucky
enough to find an audience for many of
the strange sometimes functional objects
that we love to make and we're hoping to
continue expanding that community
through this Kickstarter campaign we've
been working on the design of the vent
puzzle for the better part of two years
fine-tuning the geometry finding the
right manufacturing partner and refining
the finishing process and now we're
finally ready to go into production
we've got our tooling made the first
production samples are in hand and we're
eager to bring the vent level to life
the finished product feels smooth cool
and surprisingly heavy
it's an oddly satisfying and meditative
distraction
we're still trying to figure out then
one can assemble with one handy puzzle
comes with a small metal display stand
is packaged in a sturdy chipboard tube
for our Kickstarter backers we're
offering the venn puzzle at a
significantly discounted pre-sale price
and the first 500 puzzles will shipped
by November 15th we're passionate about
experimenting with industrial
manufacturing and making products that
inspire curiosity and hopefully make
your day a little more enjoyable with
your help we're excited to bring this
puzzle into the world thanks
this is the perfect cut the all-in-one
utility knife for cutting complex shapes
when you're decorating your home when
you're making toys for your kids models
or props perfect cut makes you finish
the job easier quicker and precise with
a specialty design cutter we created
four modules the very angle module
controls the angle of cutting at a 5
degree interval lets you precisely cut
every single edge and pile up a tower
like a 3d printer we changed the way of
holding the cutter to let you cut with
less effort it's about efficiency we
control the depth and angle of cutting
circle cutting is essential put one hand
on perfect cut the other on the material
and rotate when you're framing up your
photos perfect cut keeps the edge of 45
degree and works on cardboard foam and
ham
we're biolite and today we're out to
redesign a classic outdoor wearable and
see it in a whole new light
introducing the bio light headlamp an
ultra-thin 330 lumen USB rechargeable
headlamp featuring 3d slim fit
construction that makes your hands-free
light wildly capable and so comfortable
you'll forget you're wearing it
the 3d slim fit construction is based on
three dimensions of a perfect fit
a flush front better balance and smart
fabrics seamlessly integrated housing
merges the electronics directly into the
band creating an ultra-thin front that
sits flush on your forehead with no
bouncing by reorienting the battery to
the back we keep the weight off the
front of your face reducing slippage and
creating a more natural fit and the
entire headlamp features moisture
wicking fabric that keeps you cool and
dry during activity clocking in at only
69 grams the headlamp features four
modes and the ability to control your
light through easy dim ability
one-handed articulation enables your
light to move with you without any
disruption with easy recharging via
microUSB and run times of up to 40 hours
you can ditch the battery swaps and
power up with the bio light energy
ecosystem we're thrilled to be back on
Kickstarter and this time we're doing
things a little differently
not only will all headlamp backers
receive a free Lantern stuff sack you'll
also get your headlamp by Holiday 2018
one more time free lantern stuff sack
that transforms your headlamp into an
overhead light and delivery by this
holiday season a design in the making
for over three years this is a true
passion project for the bio light team
and we're here to ask for your support
in making it a success the headlamp
world is crowded and controlled by some
big names we all know and with your help
we can shine a light on fresh designs
and new solutions and introduce a
wearable that's actually wearable and as
always a violate a portion of every
project we launched gets reinvested in
our work in East Africa bringing safe
affordable lighting to families living
off-grid
meet a headlamp that feels great stays
put and gets the job done
where ever you may be back us today and
get it by holiday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
