and this is the videomic me
it's the latest addition to our video
mic range of microphones and it's
designed to help you get better audio in
the videos that you shoot every single
day on your smartphone
now the videomic me is a directional
microphone that's designed to help you
get better audio directly with any video
shot on your iOS or Android device it's
a directional microphone and it actually
cancels out sound that comes in from the
rear of the microphone and only picks up
the sound in the direction that you want
to record so whether you're mounting the
phone and recording directly in front of
you and cancelling out any sense from
behind you or whether you're mounting it
in selfie mode and wanting to cancel out
any of the sounds in front of you like
crowd noise or traffic noise and the
videomic me is a perfect mic to get rid
of those sounds that you don't like now
in the back of the mic is a headset
output jack so that you can actually
listen to the audio as you record it and
make sure that you're getting exactly
what you want
now often what happens when you're
recording outdoors in a windy
environment you'll often hear the wind
reacting with a microphone making it
really rumbly and very hard to hear so
to combat that we're actually supplying
it with a windsock which goes straight
onto the end of the microphone and it
means that you can record even in very
windy environments outside and get
totally clean audio the video mic me is
designed to fit a wide range of
different devices including both iOS and
Android devices
as long as the headset input on the
device is on the opposite side to the
actual camera itself purely so that you
don't see the microphone when you're
filming straight ahead now it comes with
a little adjustment on the back so that
it can be mounted on a wide range of
different devices regardless of whether
you have a case on or not that mount can
be simply adjusted by just twisting it
off and then squeezing it on against the
body of the device itself to get it to
the perfect thickness and keep it there
nice and secure so there you have it

time to all get much better audio with

single day this is an overview of our
