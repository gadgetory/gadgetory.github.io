imagine your belongings could talk to
you and tell you the very moment you are
forgetting or losing them imagine you
never needed to worry about them again
introducing the Oh a smart accessory
that helps you to forget less lose less
and worry less your own personal
assistant attach the 02 each of the
belongings you care about and it creates
a virtual leash to our mobile app
through bluetooth whenever you are
leaving something behind and a belonging
gets too far away our Apple let you know
immediately I'm rose I'm Christian and
we're the founders of the oh we have
seen so many friends suffer from
forgetting belongings that kind of
annoyance that can ruin your day a
vacation or even put a strain on
relationship
we want to create an app and you never
need told that just works when you're
leaving your house yet automatically
recognizes what items you have on you
and prevents you from losing them by
alerting you when they get too far away
yet also alerts you to de leave the
house without something essential such
as you wallet keys or laptop charger if
you want yo can also use information
from your calendar for other sources to
help you for example it can remind you
about your umbrella on rainy days the
only time you will hear yo is when
you're about to lose or forget something
you will never get a reminder if you
already have everything you need I have
a background in fashion and jewelry
design and we chose to hire an
industrial designer who was originally
from the Swiss watch industry we wanted
to achieve a natural organic feel like a
pebble on a riverbed the 0 hat to be
versatile and a pleasure to integrate
into your life
it's incredibly small and thin so you
don't notice it in your wallet we made
it waterproof and gave it flying groups
so it could be sewn onto fabrics holding
like a little cuckoo and we made it feel
precious with the 0 key chain accessory
it can be used as a charm for keys and
bags
we've been prototyping testing rebind
you're here to make the grave but from
now on we allow your support to make
this happen to please pack this campaign
and tell all your friends that benefit
from you fans who raised will be used to
resupply the large quantities and set up
