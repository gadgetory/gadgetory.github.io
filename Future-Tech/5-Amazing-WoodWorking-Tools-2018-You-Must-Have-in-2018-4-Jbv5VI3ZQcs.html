the Kreg multi mark is an incredibly
handy multi-purpose measuring tool
perfect for a wide variety of
applications in your home or on the
jobsite trim work setting reveals laying
out mitered corners transferring
measurements gauging blade Heights
alignment control and much more loads of
functionality packed into one compact
handy little tool the key to the multi
mark is it's sliding metric and imperial
marked scale that can be positioned in
three different configurations standard
90 degrees and 45 degrees each position
can be locked in anywhere along the
scale to provide accuracy and repetition
for a wide variety of project solutions
the base of the multi mark is an exact
six inches so set in the standard
position the multi mark can be used
cumulatively by extending the scale to
grab measurements up to ten and a half
inches perfect for repetitive marks are
transferring measurements finding the
correct measurements for mitered corners
on door and window trim while setting
the proper reveal can be difficult and
time-consuming the multi market limits
this guesswork by setting the industry
standard 3/16 inch reveal for you with a
built in reveal edge molded right on its
body simply let the multi mark up into
the top of the door jamb and Mark the
reveal
this gives you the accurate reference
point of layout and measurement for
confidently cutting your trim to length
the built-in reveal also lets you
reference your trim at the perfect 3/16
inch reveal along the entire run of the
piece while nailing in place no need to
measure and align the trim to marks just
position the multi mark against the door
jamb and align the trim to the edge and
nail into place set in the standard or
ninety degree position the multi mark
serves as a precise transferrable depth
gauge excellent for capturing profile
depths and transferring that depth to
router bits and saw blades also set in
the standard position the multi mark is
perfect for capturing measurements and
transferring them to your saw or layout
without the need to take an actual
measurement take tile for example simply
pick up the distance needed between the
wall and the last tile and then transfer
that distance to the tile for shorter
distances you can easily scribe the mark
directly across the tile no measuring no
guessing no hassle
the Kreg multi mark makes repetitive
work a snap installing Hardware on
cabinet doors can require the use of a
pre-made jig or making separate
measurements on each door with the multi
mark scale on the 90 degree position at
the desired depth and height quickly
marked the hardware location by
referencing the bottom and side of each
cabinet door this guarantees exact
location of every piece of hardware in
your kitchen and cuts your time in half
these are just some of the examples of
what you can use your multi mark for the
options are limitless and you'll find
hundreds of ways to use this multi
functioning tool from scribing lines
making marks for lay out basic
measurement general squaring leveling
pictures and more this is one tool that
does it all
when it's time to make sure a drawer
assembly is square or to transfer to
mentions from one workpiece to another
many of us turn to the trusty tape
measure but sometimes clamps can get in
the way where we start measuring at one
inch and forget to subtract the one inch
from the final measurement well you can
put those problems in the past and make
marking simpler and more accurate with
rocklers 3 and 1 bar gauge the bar gauge
comes with two durable aluminum bodies
and three sets of interchangeable tips
that triple its versatility letting it
serve as a squaring stick a story stick
and a trammel scribe the gauge bodies
are designed to work with easy to get
3/8 inch diameter wooden dowels or metal
rods and because you supply them you can
customize the gauges range to fit the
job at hand the rods or dowels secure
into the gauge bodies with set screws
using an included hex wrench the length
of the gauge adjusts by moving the gauge
bodies closer together or farther apart
large knurled knobs on top that you
easily lock in the settings all three
sets of tips fit onto the 3/8 inch rods
or doubles and secure by tightening set
screws with another included hex wrench
the angle tips are perfect for fitting
inside the corners of box assemblies to
check for square if you're building a
drawer they're also narrow enough to fit
in the grooves of the bottom so you can
size your panel precisely the flat tips
allow you to transfer dimensions
directly from one part of your project
to another no measuring means no time or
material lost because of mistakes with a
tape measure and the flat tip sit flush
with the bottom of the gauge bodies so
they won't tip over while you're working
with the trammel tips you're no longer
restricted by the limited capacity of
your compass you can draw arcs and
circles of practically any size you need
and the tips fit standard sized pencils
so if you want greater accuracy in a
variety of applications without the
trouble of double and triple-checking
your measurements
