for a wide variety of project solutions
the base of the multi mark is an exact
six inches so set in the standard
position the multi mark can be used
cumulatively by extending the scale to
grab measurements up to ten and a half
inches perfect for repetitive marks are
transferring measurements finding the
correct measurements for mitered corners
on door and window trim while setting
the proper reveal can be difficult and
time-consuming the multi market limits

when it's time to make sure a drawer
assembly is square or to transfer to
mentions from one workpiece to another
many of us turn to the trusty tape
measure but sometimes clamps can get in
the way where we start measuring at one
inch and forget to subtract the one inch
from the final measurement well you can
put those problems in the past and make
marking simpler and more accurate with
rocklers 3 and 1 bar gauge the bar gauge
comes with two durable aluminum bodies
and three sets of interchangeable tips
that triple its versatility letting it
serve as a squaring stick a story stick
and a trammel scribe the gauge bodies
are designed to work with easy to get
3/8 inch diameter wooden dowels or metal
rods and because you supply them you can
customize the gauges range to fit the
job at hand the rods or dowels secure
into the gauge bodies with set screws
using an included hex wrench the length
of the gauge adjusts by moving the gauge
bodies closer together or farther apart
large knurled knobs on top that you
easily lock in the settings all three
sets of tips fit onto the 3/8 inch rods
or doubles and secure by tightening set
screws with another included hex wrench
the angle tips are perfect for fitting
inside the corners of box assemblies to
check for square if you're building a
drawer they're also narrow enough to fit
in the grooves of the bottom so you can
size your panel precisely the flat tips
allow you to transfer dimensions
directly from one part of your project
to another no measuring means no time or
material lost because of mistakes with a
tape measure and the flat tip sit flush
with the bottom of the gauge bodies so
they won't tip over while you're working
with the trammel tips you're no longer
restricted by the limited capacity of
your compass you can draw arcs and
