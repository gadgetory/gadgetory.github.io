in my life so about a year ago I decided
to involve friends and experts from the
field to create instalike from scratch
in stomach is a very small microphone
with the ability of own ball recording
it's waterproof and he has a lot of
mountains that's why i think is marked
the instant mike is time and it's been
challenging to design such a great
quality microphone in this form factor
using the latest in ultra low power
digital signal processing and MEMS
microphone technology we've been able to
do just that we're even building in
wireless connectivity so it'll be as
easy as possible for you to use as a
video maker I imagine how much easier it
would be to just put it on my subject
and be free to focus on the video I
think everybody will find their own way
to use it journalists bloggers sound
designers everybody who works with audio
or simply wants to capture the sound of
the world we keep pushing to make the
best product so you can make yours now

bring the shared experience to success I
think insta mike is freedom and
creativity video is how we look but
