architect and my story began with my
grandfather he was a blacksmith nature
was his primary obsession and
inspiration the after national
self-antigens father's feeling be one
with nature in his daily routine of work
as I felt back when all the nights when
my grandfather crafted the plates for
his kitchen knives and again to create a
handle to match one that isn't like the
many of this mitchellville ferrets but
his natural wood what began as a sketch
turned into a passion because sometimes
nations require perfect conditions and
timing
I found my true passion in design to
finally I've created a complete knife
across skid skid combines the
traditional and the modern skid is
environmentally sound stylistically pure
and elegant dapped it for the needs and
challenges of modern users grip forms
and adjusts to the hands economically
the wood is hardened and tempered but
isn't inferior to the natural wood
surface high carbon content coupled with
exceptional allowing leaves the blade
sharpen long-lasting body of the annals
more organic than typical synthetic
handles makes a tannic acid produced for
hardwood which has antibacterial
properties my grandfather taught me that
all organic raw materials were a gift no
matter how far society progresses
creating scared took me back into the
past but also a giant step towards the
future

don't want is no net
to get people back in the kitchen we
wanted to create cookware that you
genuinely enjoy using and what's the one
item in your kitchen that you need to
make virtually every dish whether it's
for the finishing touches on a small
meal or cracking into a big snack your
chef's knife is at the core of every
cooking experience we created the bullet
chef's knife in order to bring you a
beautiful premium knife for less than
half of what you would pay from other
brands hi I'm Alex the founder of hula I
love to cook but about a year ago I
found myself immensely frustrated while
shopping for a new chef knife your
choices are either disposable piece of
junk from a big box store are
ridiculously overpriced blade from a
premier retailer leaving you without
many options in the middle the world of
chef knives is out of date the bigger
companies are operating on ancient sales
margins that force you to pay inflated
price for a premium knife by avoiding
all the traditional retail sales
channels and meeting you directly online
were able to create an incredible knife
for a fraction of the price the steel is
the heart of the blade and from the very
beginning we wanted something they're
both performed well but was also
beautiful the folded pattern of the
steel sometimes referred to as Damascus
or pattern welded steel as origins that
stretch back in history steel makers
from southern India were once known for
exporting the finest steel in the world
this steel found its way to Damascus
where I became famous it was widely
traded with the various empires that
interacted with Damascus including those
of Eastern Europe where it would become
known as bullet steal our name bulan is
a nod to the deep history of this deal
we are evolving the art of knives by
taking the inspiration from French
German and Japanese knife making
creating one blade that truly embraces
the history of all of these knife makers
once we had a shape we liked we brought
that into the computer and created a 3d
prototype and CAD but seeing something
in 3d on the computer and holding in
your hands are very different
experiences 3d printing gave us the
incredible ability to print out and
iterate on the design in a way we could
never have imagined only a few years ago
our goal was to create a blade that
cater to all types of cutting chopping
and slicing techniques
ultimately a large gentle belly and
dropped tip gave us the feel we wanted
on the cutting board then it was time to
bring the blade to life we've
established relationships with some of
the most experienced knife manufacturers
and steel suppliers in the world our
steel is made into K foo a region of
Japan famous for blade make even the
sharpest knives aren't magic but a blade
made with a quality steel will sharpen
better and hold its edge much longer our
blade begins with the cutting core made
of vg10 this innovative steel combines
the incredible cutting edge of
high-carbon steel with the practicality
of stainless steel beyond just being
extremely sharp and I've should also be
a pleasure to use we've put a lot of
thought into how people hold their knife
and after many revisions we've designed
a blade that's balanced and comfortable
to use regardless of the size of your
hands a thumb groove in the bolster
guides your fingers into a pinch grip to
technique commonly used by professional
cooks my name is Daniel Holloway I am
the co-founder of urban acorn I I have
different types of knives for different
types of jobs so this knife I found that
it was kind of like um you wanna you
want a great knife one great knife in
your set this would be the knife We
strongly believe that you should love
your kitchenware as much as you love
your cooking you want a knife that stays
sharp feels great in your hand and looks
beautiful become a backer and help us
build a knife that you'll love to cook
with for years to come
have you ever tried to cut bread with
your all-purpose chef's knife and you
ruin the bread picking the right knife
can be frustrating and create a huge
mess in your kitchen what if we created
one knife made of a chef and serrated
knife introducing doppia double-sided
kitchen knife one side it has a serrated
edge and the other the straight edge
giving you the most versatile kitchen
knife you've ever owned expert
craftsmanship combined with
exceptionally high quality materials
make this double-edged knife one you'll
be proud to own we designed apio with an
8-inch blade made of fine Japanese steel
and centered the circular bolster handle
is designed with intention for
comfortable grip on the blade top view
allows you to slice peel and dice
without changing blades
you no longer need two knives for two
jobs now you can just use one and flip
it over the serrated side helps you
easily cut through food items that are
harder on the outside and soft on the
inside flip the straight side or evenly
slicing the right food items
a well-designed rounded tip even makes
chopping easier on harder vegetables
while serrated side cuts softer
vegetables like butter without wasting
it and even your morning Baker this
double-edged blade not only addresses
the convenience of having both a
serrated and straight edge blade and one
night but is high quality and details
throughout we designed the center of
gravity at the center of the night so it
would be well-balanced to give more
comfortable feel to it
any chef will tell you that both
serrated and straight edge knives are
essential dophia will earn its own place
in your kitchen and will be your go-to
knife for everything

your home please support and share our
campaign
