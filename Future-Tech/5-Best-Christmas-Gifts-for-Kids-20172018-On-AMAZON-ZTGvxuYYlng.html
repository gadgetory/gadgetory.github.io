program smart robots and share them with
your friends
follow the G move apps cooled 3d
instructions to build tank bot his
treads allow for greater mobility if you
control him
you program and code his movements in
the G mu app with an infrared sensor
take bot can detect objects to avoid
them or pick them up get smarter as you
code create your own G mu world smart
robots
little bits are electronic building
blocks that snap together using magnets
and what's really cool is they're real
simple to use this code kit is packed
with everything you will need in order
to engage your young people in game
based coding and engineering there's a
detailed bit index that includes
everything you need to know about your
bits this is the code bit and it is the
brains of the whole operation the LED
matrix for creating cool animations and
messages new and improved speaker for
adding awesome sound effects to your
games and a whole bunch more the little
bit skirt kit was made with educators
for educators we've created tons of
helpful support materials like videos
customizable lessons and student
invention tools the little bits code kit
also comes with a brand new free app for
your classroom computers to guide your
students through the coding experience
the app comes fully loaded with 12 code
tutorials instructions for 4 inventions
and so much more and this is a
rechargeable battery game-changer
because there are already inventions
they're pre programs in the app you're
really able to get started right away
dota 2 this is one of the very few kits
that I've found that these students can
create something have a final product
code it and then immediately see the
results of that so to make this animated
you put do forever block and then here
we put three images so only when the
button is pushed
does it completely circuit and so we
thought to mix the colors and we thought
that is really awesome
this kit is designed to make sure anyone
even if you have no computer science
experience whatsoever can teach coding
right out of the box so geek out
game on
then complain my erasers are those Hot
Wheels cars bring it on
I've been racing Hot Wheels cars since I
was your age maybe but not like this
challenge accepted
my best three out of five
yes I'm a champion
