got my daughter little Jay hi you're not
nervous talking to all those people no
you sure yes I get nervous
today's video is sponsored by Kano a
company we are very familiar with around
here we've done a few videos in the past
they build your own computer yeah they
build the pixel LED light panel and
program and learn how to code and play
games on that but today we're gonna be
taking a look at a new product we are
gonna be building and playing with our
very own tablet awesome you ready to
build it yep
why shouldn't need me
okay so that was your third or fourth
time building a Kano product was a hard
I mean what were your thoughts on
building it it was cool and kind of easy
kind of easy I mean everything's pretty
plug-and-play anyone can basically
install this stuff but this is a real
computer that you built it's got tons of
apps on here so I mean where we see here
story mode projects here these are
various things that you've worked on
throughout the Kino world make pong so
I'm assuming that's a nap where you can
code a pong game make snake files
obviously file explorer look at song
maker
it's got internet access motion kit
pixel kits so this would integrate with
your pixel yes you've got already that's
cool
secrets I've no idea you to bap all you
need is more devices to watch YouTube on
I like that
okay so your level one and the way to
get higher is you've got to go through
here and do different tutorials you got
different coding projects and as you
progress then your level goes up so
let's start with story mode entering the
computer you're gonna go in the computer
ya know that so this is literally like
an RPG that you level through different
coding so you do quests and stuff that
teach you how to code so it's basically
an RPG game that's just powered by
learning how to code pong pong pong I
love palm oh you so you can choose play
pong make pong or maybe later I think
you should do make funk okay get a point
get a pointer you're out of the family
just a click the ball block and drag it
in set the ball size by
clicking and typing so 15 is what it was
before once you make it like 30 and make
the speed like 50 so super fast okay so
maybe that was a little too fast so
basically what this is teaching you now
is each one of these blocks contain a
different aspect of the game so that's
the background this is the ball the next
one's gonna be right more attributes for
the ball there's probably the block and
stuff so see what else there is to offer
here ya type background view right here
yeah yeah in a new line type color
yellow well I guess that's syntax error
on the bottom so it's actually giving
you real-time feedback on it the code
works or not
finally we draw the Sun in a new line
type circle 150 150
try making it like 125 so you can see
how it changes hey all right now it's
finding all four kids what about
practical youth so I want to see how
well it can actually play a YouTube
video cuz you know practical use right
so I'm gonna see how well it can play
one of the best channels ever on all of
YouTube Linus tech tip so I'm ski we're
gonna go to JC fest grace yeah well I
can play yet all right can I do 1080p
playback buffering 1080p 30fps playback
Wow well that was actually a pretty
solid experience given like the hardware
we're dealing with here you know I mean
now the build quality is outstanding
Kano goes through a very very
well-thought-out assembly process
everything fits perfectly there's no
having to jerry-rig anything the
instructions are very easy to follow
full-color illustrations that anyone can
understand whether you're a kid or an
adult you know problems understanding
these right I had no problem I mean
you've done this before but it's it's
it's a very good learning experience for
assembling this and it all worked on the
first try the build quality of the
screen is what surprised us to be honest
it the touch screen is very very
accurate it feels smooth it's responsive
the color is uniform the brightness is
very good
telling you this is a full functioning
computer it's got files at Google Drive
it's got Gmail whatsapp YouTube of
course that's obviously playing I mean
there are tons of apps and of course
there is an entire app store available
on kano that you can download even more
to this so this makes a perfect device
whether or not you are aid an adult or a
child that just wants to learn how to
code you can do it quickly and easily by
checking out the kano touch computer now
kano has a whole portfolio of products
we've taken a look at some in the past
look in the description down below and
you guys can find links to the previous
videos we've done as well as a link to
go and check out for the kano touch
computer and with the holidays coming up
this makes the perfect gift for the tech
head in your family whether you are
young or an adult so anything you want
to say before we go like was your
favorite part
my favorite part was playing story
building story oh what's this which i
think is neat because if you're a kid
you kind of just don't know where to
start it will guide you through the
right things to do in the right orders
and levels up as you go so as your level
goes up the complexity of the coding
that you learn goes up and it does it in
a very streamlined and organized fashion
and if that's not your thing you can
also go right into the apps that you
want to learn like the make pong make
snake and all those other apps and the
art apps and you can just pretty much
start wherever you want but story mode
is a good way to start and kind of get
your feet wet and learn what Kano has to
offer so guys check out the description
below like I said you'll find links to
our other videos we've done more
information on the Kano touch computer
and Kay knows other products thanks for
watching and as always
who will see you guys in the next one
