uncomfortable close-up
hey guys what's up J here and you know
what today I figured we'll go ahead and
start project skunk works now rather
than do how I did project read missus is
really hard to to do here we're going to
go ahead and do this a little bit vlog
II style now yeah I'm actually holding
out a DSLR camera on a tripod sort of
thing right now so that I can do this
but I wanted so the audio is going to
suck and but I wanted to get you guys
involved in this build now why I call it
project skunk works pretty much because
the case which I'm using as you can see
behind me right there is the case labs
SMA a in their gunmetal color it was
their very first gunmetal SMA 8 that
they built and it looks an awful lot
like the color like the stealth fighter
if you take a look at it it's very it's
very grayish but it's not really primer
color and it's not gray it's not black
it looks very stealth fish and skunk
works was actually the name of the
project for the Raptor f-22 project so
that's why I thought of project skunk
works so anyway this will be very vlog
II style build and probably a few videos
it's not going to be as extravagant as
red mist unfortunately my own builds
never get to be as good as the builds I
build for other people I just can't be
down without the computer as long as you
know people who I'm building for can
because they don't have the computer to
begin with my computers have bring me or
bring you guys these videos now this is
what we're replacing the 900 D we've got
a 480 in the bottom a 480 on the top and
the only parts that are getting reused
from this are the 7 80s right there the
V 1200 power supply not convinced I'm
going to use the corsair ram yet but we
also are going to be reusing obviously
all of my cables and pretty much the
radiator fans on the bottom and the top
there everything else oh and the SSD is
going to be reused i guess pretty much a
lot of the computer's going to be reused
but we're also going to be making room
for all this stuff to make its way in
there as well radiator we're going to be
using the 560 obviously by alpha cool
unfortunately this guy got damaged in
transit it's got a dent on it but it's
purely cosmetic
the yeah we're not going to waste this
radiator I mean well I'll show you guys
the damage in a little bit but it's just
cosmetic it's finally going to show in
the build so I'm going to go ahead and
use it the EVGA z97 classified
motherboard I've decided on this bad boy
we've got our x3 ek res x3 s right there
250 millimeter res I've got the optional
pump top or a pump tops get the optional
ek tops right there so I have more
options on fittings an entire box of
alcohol fittings because lots of things
you need when you're doing this I've got
a few boxes of these I just put one out
these are the Primo chill acrylic
hardline tubing flexible tubing for
behind the build a whole bunch of mod
might toys
fan splitters on there 2 terabyte
Toshiba Drive that I'm adding to the
build so I have more storage for the
YouTube videos had to get myself some AF
120 fans because we are going to be
doing airflow in this build and then we
have also got another F 140 because I
needed for 140 s for this guy and I only
had three now obviously that's not
everything for the build I mean this is
not going to be like I said a complete
built log but it's me more of a build
that makes sense so the very first thing
I'm going to do right now is you may see
I've got all of those fan rings back
there I've got to paint all of those to
match this build I'm not going with the
same color paint I did in this guy
because it's a different color yellow
that I'm using for this build rather
than the pasty pastel yellow that my z77
OC formula board had and since there's
no yellow on this motherboard I can make
the yellow match the cables that are in
there rather than having to go with that
pastel color so I'm going to have a
brighter yellow in this build I hope it
turns out well with the gunmo the
gunmetal I guess we're just gonna see so
let's go ahead and paint these fan rings
shall we and for that I am using rust o
because I get asked so much how do you
paint your rings we just grabbed paintin
shh-shh it dries and you have a yellow
ring it's not that hard but I'm using
the rest Oleum gloss protective enamel
takes about two to four hours to dry it
to the touch yeah with that guys let's
go ahead and paint these rings okay so
there we go I've got my cardboard set up
here just on some trash cans and I've
got an old piece of wood hutch that's
going in the trash to wait it all down
so the wind is
flip it over that would make me have a
very bad day I've got 16 fans going in
this build yep 16 fans because I'm doing
push-pull on the 480 rad so yeah we got
more fans for that so it's going to get
all these rings painted yellow so it
looks nice and sexy and then we'll move
on to the motherboard and the CPU block
I think blows hard man pushes these
rings out of the way holy crap this is
going to take a couple of coats alright
there's code number one here's that dent
I told you about and it's not alpha
Cole's fault what happens is some of
these boxes get dropped by the shipper
and the weight of the radiator actually
damages the tank so they're currently
looking at redoing all the packaging for
these radiators that way this doesn't
happen again because the 560 rad I mean
it's pretty massive and it's all copper
so it's actually got some weight to it
now this is all cosmetic there's no
damage to the fittings or anything so
it's not going to show just kind of
sucks that that dent is there but you
know like I said purely cosmetic and
still going to perform just as good but
in the meantime yeah they're redoing the
packaging to try and absorb the drops a
little bit better you can see in the box
right here the box is not damaged in any
way but what happens is the weight of
the radiator moving in that box if the
Box gets dropped and just kind of jerks
like that it yeah that's what happens
but as you can see you can't even really
see it when you look at it from the
right angle anyway so now no complaints
here it's kind of a downer but okay what
are you gonna do while we're waiting for
all the Rings to dry we can't do
anything with the fans or the radiators
yet so we're going to go ahead and get
the motherboard
PU and waterblock insulting my arm looks
freaky like that with that wide angle
lens holy crap haha
all right so now we al I just hit my
elbow okay so now we've got the
motherboard installed on the motherboard
tray the backplate taken off let's go
ahead and get the 4790k in there and the
ek acetal nickel supreme supremacy clean
and csq a waterblock on there I think it
looks sweet I love that water block look
at it in all its glory it's so plain
it's awesome I think I called it the
nickel version but I remember now I got
the copper version because I always get
copper where it doesn't show it's just
better cooling capacity usually in just
a little letting a small amount nothing
major but it doesn't get seen so it
doesn't matter if it's nickel or copper
I'd rather have copper where things
don't show but let all the hardware I
mean you get a lot of hardware with this
it's trying to brightness town
AMD brackets comes automatically you
know with the eight or Intel on there
you pull here my kid yelling in the
background oh my goodness it even comes
with the Gilad thermal compound so good
stuff let's go ahead and get this bad
boy over here where it belongs all right
time to install the 4790k so you can do
this one-handed without jack and
something up man
first i've actually inspected the pins
on this let's make sure the pins all
look good pins look fantastic let's go
ahead and line this up and
but and it's installed I love the way
this thing's just pop off mmm it's kind
of funny primo chill tries to pack
everything nice but this is the wicked
arrives anyway everything just flopping
around the box unfortunately fortunately
some of the fittings getting like a I
see it some of the fittings get mixed on
them see that right there because of the
way they flop around in the box if you
ask me
pretty much ill should really reconsider
the way they pack these that's just the
way it opened up but anyway that's going
to get two of these bad boys installed
over here pure sexiness these are the
Primo chill revolver hardline fittings
for a you know the acrylic tubing that
I'm going to be using the tubing look at
that love the way these look so I'm a
dork I put everything together and I got
it all on the motherboard tray and the
block and everything on its he has a
block over there and I was like oh crap
I forgot to bench test this motherboard
to make sure it works so as you can see
it works how much show you something
really cool what I love about this
motherboard this motherboard has right
there you can see it right there it's
got a bio speaker built-in and I love
bio speakers yeah they sound like 1995
but I love the sound they make when they
turn on listen just sounds cool dude
through of it I mean come on that's just
awesome right come on xenon seven guys
bad boom yes so now we'll just go ahead
and you know put everything back the way
it was remember kids bench test your
stuff before you start installing it or
you waste time like I did you think I'd
know better by now it is time for the
ceremonial return of the motherboard
tray I'm hearing like the halo music
playing in my head right now
Oh oh that is gonna look so sweet
does it look like so awesome
all right we're thoroughly making a mess
in this place now let's go check on the
fan rings I apologize about the noise
the neighbors air conditioner is running
right there Oh see get in there
got to coach on this already
looking too bad
go ahead and take one of these and stick
it in there and see how the yellow looks
against the gunmetal shall we it's not
sure you were quick what I mean about
the color difference of the Rings you
can see those are more of a gold color
and these are much brighter yellow it's
kind of hard to see I guess but yeah
it's a brighter yellow which more
matches my cables in there all right
let's go and see what we got
now I'm a fan of yellow I know a lot of
people don't like the yellow but I have
always loved yellow but not in cars
ironically I've just never been a yellow
car fan much dad in there come on yeah
it's hard to do with one hand huh that's
what she said all right so there we go a
nice yellow fan ring it looks cool whoo
and let's see how it looks in there yeah
I think that's gonna look pretty badass
I'm just gonna say that now I think that
is going to look bad s all right so
we've got all the yellow rings here on
the airflow fans and these are going to
be going in the front right here now so
the last thing we're going to do in this
vlog and we'll be done for today is to
get these guys installed in the front
and then I'm not sure what we're going
to do next
later on this week maybe tomorrow not
sure we'll see I want this built
together and I want it done fast so
let's go and get these fans installed
all right there we go all the front fans
are in there painted I've got to deal
with the wires going to see that - good
Kenny I've got to deal with the wires
later and my next one motherboards
installed water blocks installed rear
fans installed all the rings are painted
be able to do push pull on the top
didn't do anything yet in the bottom I
got all the 140s painted so yeah I guess
we'll just go ahead and we'll snap the
front cover back on here and then we'll
wrap up the first version of Jays vloggy
build we're gonna call them Jays Bloggie
building right front covers back on I
love the way the rings show up through
there because it's a dark color all
right there you go guys that's part one
here of my personal rig update
I'll start tearing some parts out of the
900 d when I get closer to that I don't
want that
compared to be down any longer than it
has to be I'm waiting on a Plextor SSD
to arrive sum of two SSDs and two
mechanical drives in this bill it's the
part I'm still torn on is how I want to
do the reservoirs I don't know if I'm
going to do anything custom with those
at all so I guess we'll wait and see
best in part 1 here project skunk works
hope you guys like the blog style of
this let me know what you guys think I
put a few pictures up on Instagram as I
was doing this so follow on Instagram
and Twitter if you're not Jays - sense
is the handle for both those and as
always guys I hope to see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
