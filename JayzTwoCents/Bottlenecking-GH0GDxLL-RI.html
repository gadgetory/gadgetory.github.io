just spent all day testing all these
graphics cards from the 10:15 on TI all
the way up through the new Titan X
Pascal hitting pretty much every GPU in
the stack to find out whether or not
bottlenecking is still a thing in 2017
JC sense is sponsored by precision
camera and video Texas largest
photographer and video retailer located
in Austin for over 40 years
they're giant 20,000 square foot
showroom floor local workshops and
worldwide shipping are just a few
reasons why you should head right now to
precision - camera comm the reason why
we're even talking about this is because
any time I do a video about lower end
CPUs the conversation of bottlenecking
always comes up and that's something
that we haven't heard as much I don't
think as we moved forward in the in
technology since my last video which was
2013 where I should use my 3770k for
that one if you talk about timing on
that anyway I don't think it's become as
commonplace of a discussion because CPU
technology seemed to move forward at a
slower pace than GPU technology which
means that in my mind actually we could
have probably seen more likelihood of
bottlenecking as the CPUs slowly
progressed and GPUs got balls to the
walls fast compared to anything
available back in 2013 like even the
1050 which you get for your money out of
1050 is way more today than what you
would get for a hundred bucks or 120
bucks whatever it is back in 2013 now if
you're new to pcs and you have no idea
what bottlenecking is it's basically
what it sounds like it's when your time
trying to take something really big and
cram it through something really small
I'll let your imagination fill in the
gaps when you have a lot of performance
potential in your graphics card speaking
to your CPU but the CPU can't handle the
information as fast as it needs to to be
able to render all of those frames on
your monitor so what you never ibly get
is a GPU that's sitting around waiting
for the CPU to process the data that's
being sent to it and then you start to
get dips and Peaks and and stutters and
slowdowns in your gaming experience now
in a nutshell that's what bottlenecking
is but it can be much more detailed and
much more complicated than that
depending on where your bottlenecking
why your bottlenecking
it comes all the way down to what CPU
you're running obviously the GPUs and
more
Courtley the titles that you're playing
because no matter how I did this test
someone's going to complain that I did
it wrong because there's no way to test
for every single permeation possible
when it comes to hardware and software
integration of the way that they work
with each other it might not look like
it's bottlenecking much on one title
then you put in another title and it's
just an entirely different result so for
the sake of simplicity today I just used
superposition we're using the 1080p
medium because the idea is by not
cranking the settings we're offloading
as much of the stress onto the CPU as
possible because the GPU is just running
away with performance and it's the CPUs
job to handle it so that's how we're
trying to introduce bottlenecking
and our tests here but like I said I
tested with the 1050 1050 TI 1060 1070
1080 1080 Ti and the new Titan X Pascal
the the newer new one because there's a
couple of them it's the newest one
that's all the matters but I did it with
the G 45 60 Pentium CPU which is like an
$80.00 CPU and then I also did it with
my I 5 7600 on a z2 70 motherboard the
Pentium was using the h1 10m like we
used in the budget build so we've got
two completely different systems there
in terms of spec what the same exact GPU
is being used on both systems to try and
determine where the bottlenecking
actually starts now before we talk about
the results I'm gonna go ahead and show
you those right now I'll be the first to
admit that my predictions were actually
inaccurate I I thought we were gonna
start seeing bottlenecking sooner
somewhere around the gtx 1070 where the
1070 would be the last GPU that we saw
performance matching and then the 1080
was where we start to see some deviation
in performance but I was wrong the 1080
on the G 45 60 gave us the exact same
score an exact same fps as the i5 7600 K
it was wasn't until we went to the 1080
Ti that we saw things start to run away
now that's actually a good thing because
that shows us that even a modern low-end
like entry-level CPU is able to handle
all the way up to something like a GTX
1080 which is the tenth if we compare
the performance Delta between the 1080
today and what was the 80 series in 2013
which was what the 680 my transitioning
to the 780 there's so much more
performance today to where that means
that you could build a pretty good
system out of something like the Pentium
chip as long as the title
again you're playing are not extremely
CPU dependent because what's gonna
happen in real titles and not synthetic
benchmarks is you're gonna see a lot of
things happening where the CPU is having
to load textures and it's having to load
maps and other players and game data and
then you'll start to see your
performance change quite a bit obviously
depending on what the CB is having to do
besides just the FPS the GPU is running
at it so that's why I say that there's
no test I could have done today that
would have been you know appeased all of
the crowd but what I will do today as I
will do this I've actually got the i-5
7600 K right now set to two cores
it's a two core CPU there's no hyper
threading on the i-5 right so it's a two
core CPU that means there's two less
threads then we saw with the Pentium
chip and I'm gonna go ahead and run
superposition now and we still have the
Titan XP installed right here and we're
gonna see what kind of a performance
difference we get when we take two whole
cores out of the equation so technically
now we have two less threads in the
Pentium chip so I'm gonna let this run
and we'll compare the score to see how
much it actually affected something like
the i-5
now the test is get ready to finish
right here you're gonna notice quite a
bit of up and down in terms of GPU usage
when we look at MSI Afterburner but the
score is undoubtedly going to be
different I mean we introduced
bottleneck so we got a twenty thousand
three hundred fifty five when previously
we got twenty 1993 so we drop sixteen
hundred points and our max if our
average FPS
went from one hundred and sixty-four 0.5
FPS to one hundred fifty two point two
five but that's still super impressive
to me because it shows what the IP sees
four instructions per clock are actually
able to achieve on modern CPUs back in
the day if I if I did this test with an
i5 from 2013 and disabled half of it I'm
not even sure the test would have run I
mean it's possible wouldn't even run now
something else I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna show you why even though I'm
synthetics you know it you can see the
variance here why in games it's more
than just about how much of
bottlenecking your GPU it's about how
much you're just vital locking the
entire processable processable
processing capability of your system
because of the fact that you have to
account for more than just your GPU
right the CPU still has to run the game
it still has to handle everything
happening in the game on top of the
visual process that the GPU is adding to
the experience so if we go into like
rise of the Tomb Raider here and even on
DX 12 which Det API is designed
specifically to try and alleviate some
of the overhead with asynchronous
compute on when it comes to games and
allow lower SPECT Hardware to be able to
have a better gaming experience I mean
we Vic's we've really stretched out the
capabilities of DX 12 here right two
cores no hyper threading and it's
heightened XP I really hope nobody's
running this config out there but what
you're gonna see right now the reason
I'm still talking as I'm buying time to
show you what the load is like because
we're still running a Samsung 850 Evo
SSD so read/write is not our bottleneck
here either cuz that's another possible
bottleneck right hard drive versus SSD
read/write makes your computer feel slow
because the CPU is waiting for your hard
drive to send the information it's the
same thing just a different perspective
where the CPU would be normally waiting
for your GPU
but when we were still loading we're
still loading right now this is crazy so
now if I say start benchmark check this
out in fact I might even just have to
stop watch this or something do a jump
cut because it's gonna take a while now
to get through this test it's gonna take
us a bit so it just started okay and the
FPS is actually not that bad but look at
the GPU usage 62% 65 64 that is a
bottleneck because now that the CPUs
have in hand handle other things besides
just the GPU like in the synthetic
benchmark you can see here that the GPU
is not being fully utilized the busiest
way to determine whether or not your
bottlenecking your GPU is to load a free
program like msi afterburner put on the
OSD or the on screen display and then
you can actually monitor what's
happening here in this number
specifically is our GPU and now that
we're loading screens here this is the
part that takes a little while so I'm
gonna go ahead and start my stopwatch so
that was fifteen point six seconds plus
the roughly the ten seconds before I got
this going so about 25 seconds between
scenes as the kid goes by but this
keyboard is that loud here yeah there's
new mic again you Mike it's good but bad
it's good because it sounds great it's
bad because it picks up at every your
CPU is more important than just how much
Fe FPS you're losing from your graphics
card because of bottlenecking idle
necking is a big picture thing and
that's why I really hate that the way
that the bottlenecking terminology is
thrown around specifically and you're
gonna bottlenecking that GPU with that
sheep you it's like you're gonna be
really just bottlenecking your entire
experience where many times I could say
bottleneck e in this video before people
lose their I hate that term I hate
bottlenecking
come on come on a few moments later oh
there we go
so it just started and it's like two
minutes in like 49 seconds or 50 seconds
it took me a couple seconds topic but
almost three minutes to load that
transition the crazy part is all the
sound already played and now the video
is going without the sound they're like
completely unsynched itself unsynched
and it's a in sync that was a terrible
band in the 90s
our group won't calm a band any play
instruments all right so our overall
score was a hundred and six point eight
two fps
so what I'm gonna do now guys I'm gonna
go into the BIOS I'm gonna turn that
those two cores back on and run the test
again so one hundred and six point eight
two can you remember that
all right so active cores are now set to
all and now we can get moving in do you
see the difference in FPS though if you
look at the other way it was that like
70 FPS a FPS look at the F it if you
guys were wondering how strong that
Titan XP is this not even overclocked
200 as a stupid it's stupid but more
importantly they look at the GPU usage
now that we're sitting up at what 98%
99% and that's wrist where it's gonna
stay
it's just where our are supposed to
see that I mean how fast it loads but
this is an issue that we were probably
below the specs required by this game I
believe a quad core is recommended and
required for this game it's like I mean
two two cores it's just it's cool and
all it still did well once the scene
loaded and stuff but yeah I mean you see
how much faster that went before that
that's the one that took two almost
three minutes to load it was like what
ten seconds all right we go so one
hundred and eighty four point nine one
FPS versus the previous test which was a
one hundred and six point eight two as I
believe it was so there was your
real-world scenario tests with
bottlenecking again I know folks will be
like lads synthetic it's not it's on a
rail but it's still using the game
engine whatever
so they'd the real takeaway from today's
video though is that modern CPU is even
the budget CPUs are still pretty
impressive on how far we could actually
get down the stack before we introduced
any real slow down and bottlenecking the
1080 TI was where it was so somewhere
really between the 1080 and 1080 TI like
if there was a gap even but like a card
in between there that's probably the
cusp of where we were starting to see
the problem but yeah I mean I don't
think anyone's gonna run a pentium CPU
with a Titan X or a Titan 1080i anyway
even a 1080 no it's not gonna happen I
think something like a ten sixty maybe a
ten seventy so if you're gonna be if
you're worried about bottlenecking just
don't go completely mismatched on your
hardware and you'll be perfectly fine
same goes for like the AMD stuff maybe
not so much the Athlon though but again
that's a that's from a core back in that
2012 2013 era which is why we saw some
of those problems but anyway guys I'm
gonna go thanks for watching today's
video these topics are always fun and
remember they're requested by you guys
so go and check it out also to remember
you can buy merch not this merch III
this isn't my store right this is this
is Kyle's I wear this shirt even though
it's too big for me it's like a tuck I'm
wearing a blanket because he hates that
with a shirt he tells me to burn it
every time he sees me wear it
he's still awesomesauce as far as I'm
concerned he you know bit wit your
awesome sauce thanks for watching guys
and I'll see you in the next one
