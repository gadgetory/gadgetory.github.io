might be wondering why I'm wearing this
ridiculous wristband is because it is
very hot in my studio right now we came
in this morning and the a/c wasn't
working we had a massive heat wave come
through California the other day I saw a
max of 126 degrees freedom units which
is like 52 see right now in my studio
it's cooled off a bit since the weekend
but it's still 86 degrees freedom units
which actually works out to exactly 30
degrees Celsius so we've changed our
video today specifically to see how much
water cooling actually helps in a hot
environment we've already shown how
water cooling in a very controlled
environment is very close to air cooling
when the air cooler is actually built to
a proper standard but what happens now
when you live in a hot climate and you
don't have a/c we're gonna see exactly
what that Delta is now between air and
water spoiler alert the water is gonna
be cool but just how much with its
adjustable pmw 3367 16,000 dpi optical
sensor for RGB zones 9 customizable
buttons and offering both wired and
wireless operation are only a few
reasons why the corsair dark or RGB
should be on your shortlist for your
next mouths purchase check out its full
list of features by clicking the link in
the description below so here's how this
test is going to work I'm actually using
a 1080 TI Poseidon from Asus which is
actually an air-cooled
I take the lid off which is actually an
air-cooled and a water-cooled GPU you
can just leave it as is and run the air
cooler or you can actually just plumb it
upto tubing like I have here and the
water block is built into it now
admittedly the Poseidon is not a hundred
percent efficient or best at either air
or water cooling but it's good enough to
get us a controlled result if we took
two different cards one on air and one
on water even if they're identical cards
the founders Edition cards there is
variance between cards Silicon Lottery
and all that various mumbo-jumbo and
junk so at least here we are using the
same core the same everything not being
touched and the way we're gonna run this
test is I'm going to have the fans on
the
to recurve and then we're gonna run the
like a heaven benchmark and just loop
because it's again it's a controlled
benchmark we're gonna see what our max
temperature is then we're gonna ramp the
fans up to a hundred percent and compare
what our max temperature is and that
tells us what our max cooling capability
would be in our current 30 C environment
and the cooler maxed out then we're
gonna turn the fans off and we're gonna
turn on the water cooling pump and see
how far it comes down that is the way
we're gonna be doing our test so without
further ado I've got to fill this loop
and then we are going to office lis put
up our monitor and all that stuff so I
know maybe Phil can just do a quick
little Philly montage filling Phil a
filling Mont now let's talk about what
we already expect to happen we expect it
to hit its target temperature which in
this case is 84 C that's factory once we
hit 84 see the way GPU boost works is
it's going the closer it gets to that
temperature the more it's gonna start
slowing down the core and the way it
keeps itself from exceeding that target
temperature is it will slow down the
core and the bring down the voltage to
try and keep it from going above that we
should not see above 84 C unless we had
this like outdoors in the Sun in a
hundred plus degrees then you might see
it exceed that and then actually thermal
shutdown so what we're gonna be looking
here for here so we're gonna be looking
for today is how much core speed are we
losing with air cooling in this hot
ambient environment which we are then
going to compare with our water cooling
so without further ado we're gonna run
heav'n benchmark now I know this is a
synthetic benchmark I am well aware of
the fact that games are probably a bit
more stressful the problem is it's very
difficult to run an actual game and get
a very consistent result because of the
fact that you are free roaming and
moving around the world and it's very
hard to get consistency between tests
alright so here we are in the 4k test in
heaven benchmark we are just chugging
along in the 30s on fps we just hit 40
because with that 8x msaa and 4k that's
a bit ridiculous but we are now working
this GPU for every
it's got point out though it is running
at 2,000 mega Hertz 100 percent load 55c
0% fan speed you can see they're not
turning because we are in the factory
fan curve which has that up there they
go which has that cool and quiet mode
where it won't turn on the fans until it
exceeds a certain temperature at 58 is
where it kicks on and then this will
speed up based on the factory curve but
where you're gonna notice is that's
going to start dropping over time so you
see it fluctuating from 2000 now the
higher this gets towards 84 the lower
this numbers gonna be so what we're
looking for here is how much speed do we
lose in this 30 C ambient temperature
versus water so we're gonna go ahead and
just let this roll until we find out
where our level work levels out then
we're gonna run the fans at 100% level
it out and then switch to water I know I
explained that twice but you know
sometimes you just gotta so about 15
minutes has gone by and we actually have
an interesting discovery here so we
decided to turn on the power limit
indicator so we can see when we're
hitting power limit which is why you've
seen it bounce on and off because every
time we hit power limit it will pop up
on here and say power limit because what
we realized is we're not hitting 84c we
had expected to hit 84c we're not
hitting it and yeah I know it's really
annoying watching it bounce around our
boost clock still came down from 2000
quite a bit but we are still
significantly overclocked on the self
boost GPU boost 3.0 100% CPU 76% fan 79
C on the temperature so we decide we're
gonna go ahead and do the rest is test
is we are going to max out the power
limit because it's set at its default
100 but these cards especially the
Poseidon's are designed for overclocking
so we are going to go ahead and bump
that to 100% so that we can see now I
guess our differential between air and
water now obviously we know water is
going to be lower than this but and we
obviously had to think about this
decision because we don't want to
manipulate the test in any way but I
don't think that that's gonna cause us
any problems here so all we're gonna do
right here is we're gonna go ahead and
take the power limit and the temp limit
which are linked these are typically
linked together which our new
temperature limit now is 9 DC and 120
percent or 20 percent above factory TDP
is where we are setting our temperature
and our power limit that's what our
limitation was before it was temperature
even in this hot environment
and before it was even like core clock
or any of that stuff
well obviously core clocks related to
temperature because it's a sliding scale
we actually just hit thermal limit or we
actually just hit power limit before
thermo Steven became a problem so what
we're gonna see now is this will
probably go up to 85 ish but now we have
to let it run for a little while longer
here and see what happens in fact it
might not even go any higher because
we're surprised at just how beefy this
air cooler is and how good of a job it's
doing in this hot environment with the
factory curve we didn't touch the fan
curve at all okay we're not getting any
hotter we're pretty much locked at a DC
1949 megahertz ever since we raised the
power limit this has not changed this
one up a couple of degrees in fact it it
bounces between 80 and 79 now doesn't go
any higher
fans seems to capped out about 79
percent so what we're gonna do now is we
are just going to bump this fan to a
hundred I don't expect the results to be
that much different simply because of
the fact that aunt Clinton because of
the let me do it because we're only
getting about an extra twenty one
percent fan speed so I don't think it's
gonna make a major difference so we're
just gonna let it go for a couple of
minutes we did go up one degree
fahrenheit in here though so it's gonna
be like thirty and a half C now
something like that we're gonna keep an
eye on the temperature as best we can as
we as I said the AC in here is not
working so I can't not control the
environment as much so as it heats up
throughout the day it's gonna get hotter
in here that's how we're trying to get
this test done quickly so we've settled
at 72 C it's not changing we only came
up one step on our boost clock you guys
remember it moves in steps of 13 so we
went from 1949 to 1962
fans are still at 100% this is actually
pretty good considering the fact that we
were almost 31 C inside of here inside
this room that's a I expected it to be
much harder than that obviously I
thought with a 1080i 250 watt TV P more
than that one overclocked obviously I
thought it would be higher but I wanna I
want to show you guys something here so
obviously the system is filled with
water it's not running the pump is not
running the fans as you can see right
here have not been running and I'm not
gonna turn these fans on right now but I
want to show you something here if I
flip on this pump and just with the fact
that the block and the heat sink are
somewhat connected the amount of passive
cooling in a loop like
as long as there is water flow is pretty
insane so even with those fans on and
these fans off watch what happens to the
temperature the moment I click on this
pump look how fast this will drop so the
pump is on it is now moving look at that
with that temp right there
I don't even turn on the radiator yet
folks so we're gonna do now is we're
gonna go in here we are going to zero
out the fan keep our test running with
the fans off the radiator off and just
the pump going and passive cooling just
passive cooling through this radiator in
this 31c environment it's already down
to 52 C and holding back up to 2,000
mega Hertz now it's pretty obvious once
I plug in the radiator and get it
flowing air that that's going to come
down significantly we'll test how far
that is and we'll talk about why that is
and this is kind of my rebuttal to some
of the folks that were upset that I said
that air cooling of water cooling are
closely matched in my last video
obviously there's limitations to that
and that's exactly what we're talking
about today so stick around for the
conclusion now that my fan is running
and there's a lot of heat in that loop
holy crap there's a lot of heat coming
through that radiator already that's how
much it had just soaked just touching
the system okay so we're pretty much
heat soaked we're seeing 50 C we were
seeing 51 it came down to 50 and there's
51 again but we came all the way back up
to 2012 megahertz that is the max core
clock that this graphics card will
actually allow based on its P States and
its boost clock and all that
0% fan speed you know Phil was right so
I put it back to Ottawa to go off
because it's below that that speed thing
so again feel smarter than me on that
one but we are 30 C about 31 C lower
than where we were on the fans on the
factory curve an approximately 21 C
lower than where we were with the air
cooling on at a hundred percent now we
are using a 240 millimeter radiator and
there was a lot of heat coming out of
here the the fluid temperature on this
is definitely soaked so we are fortunate
that we are in a big enough space to
where this is not affecting the overall
temperature of the space if you were in
a small 8 foot by 8 foot bedroom or
something this would indeed get hotter
over time you might even see that get
all the way up to 60 C if you're in a
small
but the reason why you're seeing the
results come down like this even though
we are in such a hot environment versus
the previous test where we had a
controlled 72 or 71 degrees Fahrenheit
in this space is because of the
efficiency and the efficacy of how water
is able to pull air out or pull
temperature out of already heat
saturated air versus the efficiency of
air cooling now air cooling is obviously
gonna get the job done you saw this
cooler had no problem getting it done in
fact the water cooling loop here might
put more heat into your room making you
less comfortable because of the fact
that you are more efficiently pulling
the heat directly from the die to this
heat exchanger to the environment aka
your gaming space but I just want to
kind of show here with this really up
this hot room as our AC broke to kind of
make lemonade out of Satan's ball sweat
basically to show you guys where water
cooling really does indeed benefit you
and we're going to do now is we're going
to set the fans to 100% with the
radiators on and the water cooling going
to see if this number comes down below
50 I don't really anticipate that it
will if it does it might only go one or
two degrees but that's it guys
thanks for watching today's video hit
this like button if you appreciate the
fact that instead of walking in and just
going home which I legitimately consider
doing and texting Phil and me like hey
paid day off it's hot I bet you wish I
did that huh Phil yeah yeah just a
little bit anyway guys thanks for
watching if you want to know more about
the site in cooler I do have a review on
this and we compare it to the Founders
card and all that stuff I'll put a link
in the description below you guys can go
and check out that review on this cooler
and as always guys we will see you in
the next one hey 48c so obviously when
they work in conjunction there is
benefits to be had even in this
temperature spoiler alert though we
actually tested that when we did the
card review and I already knew that I
forgot something downstairs woman Barry
Beck I can't go any lower no you're not
supposed to tilt the camera if you want
