insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys welcome to 2014 with Jays two cents
I am of course your host Jay and if
you're new to my channel welcome before
we get things started here talking about
what I'm gonna be bring into CES and
kind of obviously this guy and I know
you guys wanna know more about this guy
if you like that intro and you liked
what you heard do me a huge favor
go and check out deadpool he plays on
twitch he's the guy who did the intro
for me he's a voice actor he's the lead
vocal artists for the repopulation
MMORPG coming out in 2014
amazing amazing talent and he was
willing to do that for me at no cost and
I just had to plug his channel he does
the live stream it's very entertaining
he dresses up he dresses up like
Deadpool you know from Marvel and does
live streaming and stuff an amazing
talent if you guys thought that I did a
good Arnold impression oh my god his is
just well Arnold himself would probably
be impressed but yeah I just I had to
plug that channel please go and check it
out if you like what he does give that
guy a follow on twitch he's definitely
worth this up now here we go
2014 and the way we start off the year
here at JS $0.02 is by going to the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas
oh yeah now last year I went to CES but
but when I was there I didn't even have
1,500 subs I think I had like 1250 subs
and I had 200,000 views on the channel
and I was just walking around aimlessly
I had no meeting set up I was a literal
nobody nobody had a clue who I was in
fact some of these companies when I
would tell them hey I do a YouTube tech
review stuff they're like really YouTube
I didn't know people do that on YouTube
so it really wasn't out but the last 12
months so much has changed in the
industry where these companies have
realized that YouTube is where it's at
people when it comes to advertising and
this year's growth has gotten me to the
point to where now for 2014 CES I am
overbooked
in fact I'm gonna be checking out some
of you guys's favorite companies
obviously we're gonna be checking out
coolermaster and the CM storm line we're
checking out a data Roccat fractal
design a soos MSI gigabyte Intel AMD I'm
investing in the showroom floor guys
those are just private events so we're
gonna be checking out some companies
that are really freaking cool and
they're gonna be showing some new stuff
that they've come up with since Computex
back in June so I'm really excited to
bring you that coverage trust me
but CES can definitely be very stressful
so last year if you guys remember I had
some really shitty coverage I mean it
was bad
you're watching Jays two cents and we're
over here at the 2013 Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas and we're
gonna go ahead and get lost with some of
the latest technology gadgets that the
world has to offer right and follow us
out through the show and we'll see what
we can find being a one-man crew having
to do the camerawork and then the
microphone and the microphone I used was
that little four dollar mic I did back
in my microphone review video oh my god
it was so bad in fact it was downright
embarrassing so obviously things have
changed this year quite a bit and I have
to get a huge shout out to everybody who
donated in IndieGoGo campaign because
what you see right here is pretty much
the fruits of that labor in order to
bring you really good field coverage you
have to have really good feel to pivot
so we'll talk about this here in a
moment now the microphone I used last
year like I mentioned there was a $4 mic
and it was so bad well this year
Sennheiser I bought a Sennheiser mic and
after buying that it one thing led to
another they contacted me and said hey
we'd like to provide you some equipment
for your channel so that's what they did
so as you can see right here I have
obviously an XLR
on here which is now a backup system
because Sennheiser provided me this
wireless module that hooks on to my
microphone so we're going to talk about
the mic first because obviously the
quality of this is is where it's at and
I'll let you guys hear this mic in a
moment I'll do a little a little bit of
a mic test
in fact when I'm doing the review of the
camera I'll do it on this mic so you
guys can hear that now this is the e
w100 GP g3 XLR wireless adapter for XLR
cameras it's an on phantom power because
this is a dynamic mic amazing piece of
equipment it's like 300 bucks for this
one little piece but it's amazing my
microphone is a sennheiser e35 it's
actually a leap vocal mic for like
singing but it's great in these
environments because it's cardioid and
it's a directional pickup and so it
drowns out a lot of the the background
sound the mic flag I don't actually
remember the brand my mom got it for me
for Christmas is from B&amp;amp;H photo but the
flags that you see on here as you can
see they are glossy I made these myself
they are just a sticker paper and I use
the high quality printer to print these
and you can see we've got the YouTube
logo of course aqua tuning who is my
sponsor and help sponsor this trip and
then of course my Jays $0.02 logo then
we have a little bit of a windscreen up
here so and then I as you can see I
wrapped it in leather that way it's got
a nice sticky hole grip that way you
don't drop it I think this whole setup
is like 500 bucks with everything said
and done so trust me the last thing you
want to do is drop this thing because
it's the phone of a using my iPhone 5
will be a lot of tweets coming out of
this and I am using the the OtterBox
preserver case which is really rough
because I don't want anything to happen
that I think it's been hold on wall so
anyway a nice tough case on there
because it's really really rough now as
a backup device in my wireless access
point I'm going to be using my galaxy s3
pretty much as a 4G hotspot the entire
time because I am planning on doing a
live stream from the event last year I
did a live stream inside the CES
convention center which was kind of cool
we'll probably that again so here's my
galaxy to keep everything powered I have
two of the tylt powerplant five thousand
milliamp batteries that have a USB port
and also have a little pull out here for
micro USB one of them that I have has an
iPhone 5 adapter and then I've got my
red 14 thousand milliamp battery here
this is gonna keep me charged the entire
time in fact all of our devices because
there's four of us going the only thing
left to really talk about is this guy
right here so unfortunately I can't film
the camera with my camera so I'm gonna
switch to just a handheld the holy a
cell phone my iPhone or something we'll
talk about what's on this guy right here
okay so here we go here's the camera
Regan can I try to make it as not shaky
as possible cuz I am one hand holding my
iPhone five while I'm recording this so
here we are right now I am talking on
that guy which is being picked up by the
Sennheiser II W 100 g3 Wireless unit
feeding into my zoom h4n that is feeding
into my Canon t2i camcorder or DSLR now
is know some people looking at that
going really a teach you I I mean that
thing's old
yeah well it's old and gets the job done
everything you've watched has been
recorded on this camera alone now I do
plan on upgrading this camera sometime
this year to an actual 1080p
professional camcorder so I don't have
to keep dealing with the limitations of
DSLR so here's the shoulder rig itself
the IndieGoGo account or the campaign
funded most of this here and it was
pretty much pieced together through
Amazon and eBay and I didn't go
extremely overkill on this because I
didn't I mean already the rig cost twice
as much as the camera itself the rig is
about 1,200 bucks and the camera you
could get now for like 400 but like I
said the camera is gonna be getting
replaced so that's not too big of a deal
let's go ahead and work our way around
this is ApS productions shoulder rig
cost about two hundred and thirty bucks
or so off eBay comes with the rear
shoulder mount on the shoulder pad 15
millimeter rails and the Z offset
comes with you know the baseplate for
the camera the follow focus and it's a
decent follow focus it's really not so
bad considering the cost I
leather-wrapped it that way it's got it
but you got better grip when turning the
focus it does have your heart stops on
there and it's got your little white
boards that you can set your focus
points and there is the gear mechanism
for the lens so there you go the lens is
a Canon ultrasonic it's a USM 28 to 135
millimeter it's not great for close
quarters shooting like this I do like I
do in this room because the t2i is a
crop body or crop sensor so it ends up
being more like 45 millimetres instead
of 28 so it's hard to get far enough
away from things sometime
so the matte box it is a true matte box
with filters and such available for it
it does have punch flag and barn doors
which I have taken off right now but it
is a pro lame NB 600 cost about 200
bucks it's really not too bad it's 15
millimeter mounting on there it does a
really good job of keeping some players
and blum and another lighting off of the
lens when we're doing outdoor shooting I
don't have the barn doors on so we're
gonna be doing pretty much all indoor
shooting now you can see we have the
offset handles that are adjustable for
the cameraman so that he can hook it up
however he wants get nice and
comfortable and then we have our camera
11 inch articulating arm which now has
my Nexus 7 tablet mounted on there as a
field cam as you can see or the
cameraman if he chooses can use the eye
cup and get in there and use the eye cup
viewfinder for better focus it is
magnetic mount but because the magnetic
on this is not as strong as I'd like I
just use a rubber band on there to hold
it on to make sure it doesn't come off
works great with a little ghetto but I
don't really care
oh well the tripod is a Davis and
Sanford it's that pro beast gr grounder
tripod doesn't have a sandbag hook but
it gets the job done and it's capable of
holding almost thirty pounds so it's
definitely robust he's got the fluid
head on there the FM 18 fluid head which
does a really good job of giving those
nice pans that you
see on some of the product footage that
I do and then we've got of course my
zoom h4n which is doing all of the audio
capture from the Sennheiser and the
wireless mic right into the camera
itself now for audio monitoring my
cameraman is going to be wearing the
Sennheiser HD 280 s there are nothing
high-end or special but they're perfect
for listening the monitoring sound while
recording so he has a nice long cable on
that which comes off the h4 n split as
well so there's no issues there now if
you've ever held camera rig you know
that they can be extremely front heavy
especially when the pivot point is on
your shoulder right there and you have
all that weight in front so I have a
four pound counterweight right here that
hooks onto the back and it keeps things
nice and level so that cameraman doesn't
get fatigued for holding that for long
periods of time so there you go that's
the rig guy so in the back
the h4n is mounted with a seven-inch
articulating arm which means I can move
it and adjust it in any way that I want
to make it nice and comfortable and
gives us even more rear weights if I
want to move it farther back or
articulate it so everything is is kosher
there so that is the camera rig right
there that's what can be doing all of
our recording I am gonna be doing my
mobile rendering here on the Mini ITX
build that I did oh and then for
lighting here is 160 LED light on there
which amounts to the articulating arm as
well the rendering rig I've gotten a lot
of negative feedback on but you know
what guys the bottom line with this is
it's only gonna be rendering short
videos you know three minutes four
minutes sort of thing and it does have
OpenCL support using the r9 it's not as
good as CUDA but it's gonna get the job
done and it's just a temporary build I'm
only keeping this together long enough
for CES and it sure as hell beats a
laptop that I had in the meantime so
I'll be using the the 120 Hertz monitor
there in the K 70 keyboard and my CM
storm Zorn it Mouse we need to do a
review on that still so that's gonna get
the job done for us oh and of course we
have my business cards in fact let me me
a second here it was out oh this
unprepared video
bring you guys nice amateur footage so
there is my business card then we'll be
handing out while I'm there can't be
taken serious if you don't have a
business card so okay you know there you
go alright guys so this has been
oh and my backpack here is obviously my
nice comfortable targis bag I'm really
happy with this guy so as well be
carrying all of my my lutes in so there
you go guys JC since this is the camera
equipment that's going with me to CES
