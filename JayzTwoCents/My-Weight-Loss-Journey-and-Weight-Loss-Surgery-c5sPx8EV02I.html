actually there click it alright let's
watch the video what's up guys Jase
$0.02 coming at you here with another
video on my personal channel slash vlog
channel moving the weight loss stuff
over here want to just kind of get it
out on my main channel and let some of
you guys get exposed to me and see
whether or not you like me and now I'm
going to draw you in to my new channel
so if you can't tell by the title of
this video the topic I want to talk
about today is that of weight loss
surgery gastric bypass gastric sleeve
the Lap Band all that stuff and whether
or not it's right for you and I'm just
gonna go ahead and come right out and
say it I've been dreading this I've been
dreading it for the last three years I
had gastric bypass I had a full ruined
white May 25th mm I'm sorry May 26th
2009 I had my ruined Y surgery and I had
it for a couple of reasons
in the very first reason I want to go
ahead and show you why I had this weight
loss surgery is this
these were my jeans I kept these jeans
for this exact reason do this here this
this is why I had gastric bypass surgery
I was 27 and a half years old now I was
turning 28 I hear people running by my
office keep it yeah Willie I'm trying to
recording here yeah yeah
boogie that was really bad I'm sorry I'm
looking at the mic like you're in the
mic hey boogie is in here in case you
guys didn't know this is where he lives
right there anyway these size 62 I've
kept these and I will keep those pants
for as long as I'm around I wish I had
kept a shirt I didn't keep a shirt but
you know I had to do something and all
of you are saying oh you had gastric
bypass it's easy to lose the way all you
got to do is get in there get a little
nip and tuck and guess what weight loss
just falls off of you and you're right
someone for the first six months weight
will just come off of you because for
that first six months you're relearning
how to eat you've had your intestines
rearranged you've had your large
intestines bypassed you've had your
stomach you know about 80% of it cut
snipped and stapled shut and when you're
healing you go through a whole regiment
of you know relearning to eat you go
through a liquid diet you go through a
pureed diet and you go through a soft
tender cut meat diet and it takes almost
six months before you can start eating
some of the regular foods again like
steak
you know meats and stuff I still have to
make sure I eat tender cuts I've got to
cut it small but a lot of people will
look at gastric bypass as being this
cop-out and here's what I have to tell
you about that I had to go through a
program for a year my insurance company
would not pay for gastric bypass unless
I went through a year's worth of
psychiatric evaluations dietary dietary
you know
how to eat properly learning how to
exercise and learning how to basically
overcome the issues that have put you
where you are that got you as big as you
are and whereas there's a lot of things
that there there are just so many things
that a person could look at to say oh
this is why I'm fat this is one in 500
pounds oh I had a horrible childhood or
I had you know a divorce or whatever it
may be there's plenty of reasons and
those reasons are deep but sometimes you
need help to get where you are so that
you can live longer to work out those
problems you know I was 100% against
gastric bypass my mother's had it my
sister's had it my father's had it I've
met several friends while going to these
support groups who have all had this the
surgery and people have come to me for
advice on whether or not they should get
it and I hate telling people I've had
gastric bypass because I don't want to
be judged I don't want someone to tell
me you know you're lazy and you're still
lazy because I'm not if you've watched
my other video I spent 13 months after
losing the weight to put on the muscle
that I lost while losing weight and just
like so many people who are watching
this vlog right now I've lost weight
naturally I had to lose a lot of weight
to get to the point where I could have
the surgery because believe it or not I
was too fat for gastric bypass and what
does that mean how do you get too fat
for a weight loss surgery and what it is
is I have the laparoscopic version and
that's where they don't cut you open
they use surgical tools and like kind of
like little robot arms and they go in
there and they do it that way but I was
too big I was too big around for those
tools to reach through the fat to get to
the you know the organs that it needs to
okay you get the point all I ask is that
watch this series don't make judgments
because gastric bypass is not easy it is
not a magic wand
it is a tool and it is a tool if you
don't use properly and you abuse you can
gain the weight back
do yourself a favor before you judge me
go to google.com and then search gastric
bypass weight gain and
hence thanks ok that was really weird
oh my face dude you're milking making
this video the point I just really
wanted to get across here is that
gastric bypass is not a cop-out it is
not easy it is probably one of the
hardest things I've done in my life for
the simple fact that you take an
addiction and overnight you have to quit
and not only do you have to quit
mentally but physically you're forced to
quit it's like taking a smoker and
somebody who smokes
you know three packs a day and putting a
cigarette just out of reach of them and
just watching them watching that
cigarette and going through the
withdrawals and going through the
cravings and going through the mental
anguish and the addiction that your body
is just denied but it's everywhere
around you food is everywhere in America
it's I don't I mean I can't speak for
Europe but food in America is the
culture being fat being overweight is
just the norm here and when you can't
eat that cheeseburger you can't eat that
pizza or you want that candy bar and you
can't have it and you're forced to live
the healthy life but you've never lived
in your entire life because let's face
it if you had you wouldn't be 500 pounds
or whatever you are follow this series
don't make judgments and if you want to
know more about gastric bypass by all
means please ask I'll do more videos if
it's popular and people want to know
more about my life three years post-op
if you just want to know about the
workout you don't know about the gym you
want to about building lean muscle and
and and how to get control of your body
back physically I can do that too I just
hope that you guys will follow this
series hope that you will do what it is
and make a life change whether that be
surgery or whether that be you know
really dieting hard and losing the
weight then by all means do what it is
that's best for you for me I was on the
edge of time hmm what am i 12 again I
was close to dying my heart couldn't
take much more my liver was swollen and
engorged my kidneys were not healthy if
I hadn't done that who knows whether or
not it even be here today because my
physical age I was well beyond that of a
senior citizen and the
affection and damage I was doing to my
body and I challenge any one of you to a
fitness contest if you'd like to tell me
I took a cop-out or I took the easy way
out because I'm venturing the guest if
you're the kind of person that's going
to come on here and put me down over a
decision that I made to better my life
chances are you've got bigger problems
going on in your end than I do
think about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
