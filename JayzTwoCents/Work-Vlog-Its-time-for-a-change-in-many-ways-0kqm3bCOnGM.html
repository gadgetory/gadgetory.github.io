alone in the studio today so I figured I
would kind of double up sort of a work
vlog kind of a thing I've known one of
these in a while and yeah some stuff
really needs to be done around here
because about a month ago I went to Las
Vegas and filmed a man vs. build with
Kyle and fractal Josh and the team for
that particular production and my team
was left behind and I basically said
guys since we have a whole week of non
video production I want you guys
straighten up the studio for me so
that's why you guys see things a little
bit more organized on the shelves things
well things are kind of a mess back
there but that's why you also see all
the water cooling stuffs been moved over
here instead of having to walk across
the studio to find it it looks great
except for I'm a I said made a make a
pile of stuff you think should go to
storage and basically all they did was
just take every single case that was
over there and stuck it over here just
sort of relocating the mess so now I'm
gonna I'm gonna kind of tackle this by
myself

now you guys might end up hearing a
bunch of screeching sounds they're doing
construction outside out there so
they're using a buzz saw
right now cutting wood and stuff so it's
very loud so I apologize if you hear
that but this area over here has always
been a point of contention for me
because I never really knew how to
utilize this space the studio if you
can't tell is extremely narrow it's very
long but very narrow so depth of
recording this way you know facing like
this
has always been hard I mean if we were
to kind of take the set and move it this
way this is what it would sort of look
like now I'm pretty much standing
against the wall as you can see right
here so there's not a lot of there's not
a love you know place for me to move so
it's always been a little bit
frustrating because I just don't I don't
know how to utilize this space when I
first moved in it was a conference table
with a rug and chairs and I had this
idea that vendors would be coming to see
us and stuff which happens very rarely
so that space became poorly utilized
then Nick and I painted this big grey
wall there's a squeal and talk about
then Nick and I painted this big grey
wall because we hope we're gonna turn it
into a set which worked for a little
while because if you remember I kind of
had it kind of oriented like this and
then we had house plants we had lamps
and it looked like kind of like a home
office setting but that that ended up
not really working out again because we
don't have a lot of room between the
staircase and that space right there and
minimum focus distance and wanting that
nice blurry background and stuff just
wasn't happening here somebody thought
okay we could shoot at an angle then the
kitchens right there then we decided we
were gonna build a fake wall and that
ended up getting squashed pretty quickly
now as you can see it's just turned into
a catch-all in fact when you first walk
in this is what you're greeted with and
not exactly the look and feel that I'm
after so yeah we got a lot of we got a
lot of stuff to do and this right here
this whole area this is well that's the
 right there but this is like our
intake area stuff that's come in and
waiting to be reviewed and stuff that
we're behind on under the table it's
just man it's never-ending my first rule
problems I know but still when this is
you know your whole livelihood is
dependent on getting stuff out in a
timely manner then as you can see we are
definitely behind they didn't have
anything under these shelves and nothing
up here which i think is a total waste
of space now this is mostly cases and
monitors big boxes and stuff so I'm
gonna be taking like that's an empty box
right there that's the box that my
workstation is in you can actually see
it right up there the lights are on this
is another empty box that's Phil's
workstation he's using the the H 500 P
mesh
then we have a bunch of other cases and
stuff here that we don't need to keep
here like I'm probably gonna get the
panzer max case to Nick he really likes
that case and then we've got just a
bunch of stuff just a whole bunch of
stuff so let's see what we can do to
clear up some of this space anyway this
is what Phil and Nick we're trying to
avoid they were trying to avoid this but
we can't avoid that we have to use this
space we can't have all this dead space
here so as long as it's stacked properly
and isn't you know in danger of falling
down then we should be fine we've got
cases down here too plus these shelves
are very heavy-duty they're very sturdy
they're steel as you can see so that's
not gonna be a problem but I'm gonna be
getting rid of some stuff too like
obviously like the Box has already
mentioned that we don't need I don't
need the cougar box anymore because
that's a thread ripper and that was a
flat packed case that's obviously not
going to be getting flat packed again
but I'm giving away stuff to to the
local friends and family a lot of people
ask me all the time what I do with this
stuff I don't sell it
I do sponsor some giveaways and stuff
but cases are too expensive to ship
personally so that's why I like locally
I'll be giving stuff away like the
Panzer Maxx this case right here Nick
fell in love with that case I'll
probably giving that to him the H 500 P
the original one which had the terrible
air flow issues giving that away someone
can find that you know cut that open or
do a mod kind of like gamers Nexus did
and then like this inter max case right
here up I'd be giving that one away
don't have any need for that and then
like this old machine right here
remember my friend's computer that I
built him a new one and and upgraded it
as a sort of a surprise my veteran
friend well that's his original machine
old axel Athlon x3 doesn't work very
good it's complete garbage that's the
one where the loop was completely
clogged up and then obviously our leaf
blower still over there from when we did
that video so I might as well get a
little bit of work done while I'm
getting work done get some more games to
download here this is a laptop I'm
currently testing this is the MSI gs5
thin yeah it's pretty damn thin I've got
gold accents and stuff and then one
thing I really like is the hinge
flat that's not something you see a lot
of these days especially in PC so I kind
of like that I'm gonna get some Lamaze
oh let this thing do some downloading
and updates while I'm waiting
that way Lee something's being done well
I think we're making a little bit of
headway I mean it looks precarious but
it's it's not gonna tip over I don't
think anyway I've got these ultra wide
panels down here face sideways which is
kind of taking up a lot of room down
there I think I'm gonna go look upstairs
in the loft and see if there's any room
up there yep this area is kind of a
shitstorm in and of itself Oh
as you can see we've already started
using the cubby there we saw our rugs
and stuff this whole area here never
gets used for like anything we never
used this so this is definitely a very
poor use of space so I'm gonna figure
out what I want to do with this and then
here's a view from the top of the stairs
you can see we're definitely made some
headway over here in this part of the
studio really the mess just kind of
stacked up there but all this might be a
moot point let me tell you why
the reason why I say this may end up
just being a moot point entirely is
because I'm really heavily considering
moving my family and my business out of
California you guys saw in that video
where I talked about how expensive it is
for me to run this channel a lot of that
has to do with particularly the state
that I'm in and the way it treats
corporations here and the taxes and the
payroll taxes the income tax and all
that stuff it's just incredibly insane
so it's something that I've been
considering now for a while and I had
said that after my dad died I kind of
wanted to leave and just start over but
I didn't really want to leave the state
as long as my mom was still here but at
the same time my mom is is and her help
has kind of sucked I mean sheeps falling
and breaking herself like she has had a
complete shoulder replacement but she's
living with my sister and her family so
she's she's obviously close to family so
it wouldn't be by herself but that's one
thing reasons why I'm kind of in here
and rearranging today and and I'm just
sort of like trying to figure out what I
want the future to be for this channel I
so I severely want to downsize I want to
limit the amount of outgoing expense
that I have to run the business and the
the percentage of my expenses which are
just taxes and fees alone specific to
this state is a bit insane so yeah I
don't know how much is all this is gonna
matter because if end up moving then
this is going to be a bitch to move and
I want to do that but I mean I might not
have a choice so just a little bit of
real inserted into this video because
but I try to be that well as you can see
we've definitely made some headway here
and this is where I'm gonna go ahead and
stop because I've got other things I
gotta do today but I walked in today
this was bugging me at least now we can
walk by this is pretty much a trash pile
right here except for the box in the
bottom that's an intake box not keeping
this system that has pretty much no
value this right here this that is just
boxes empty boxes nothing in there so
we're gonna be taking that to storage
and then this right here is cases I've
been spoken for I'm giving these to
friends and then this over here these
items are also spoken for that was a
system giveaway and then that's the
fractal our six case wrapped that that
giveaway winner still has to be
confirmed so and then we'll be making it
now that the announcement on that but
the kitchen obviously needs to be
tackled and like I said up there so yeah
I might actually a place to put some
camera gear for once so anyway that's
just my little bit of a work log here in
the studio thanks for watching guys
oh yeah and then you know a whole bunch
of games installed on this guy over here
so we're ready to do that review so that
is all I've got for you guys today

little bonus video on just kind of doing
some work around the shop that
desperately desperately need to be done
as always guys subscribe if you're new
