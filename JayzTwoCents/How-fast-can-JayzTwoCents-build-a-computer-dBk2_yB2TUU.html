I've got a computer to build in my last
video I showed you guys I got this X 370
Mini ITX motherboard in and I wanted to
build a mini ITX 1800 X Rison system
showing how you can get a massive amount
of power in a small package ladies
that's cringy I know but I had to anyway
the new DG 7 series case is from EVGA
off a PC enthusiast more of what they
love like tempered glass side panels
vertical GPU mount integrated RGB
control board DG tuner and an awesome
three year warranty to learn more about
the DG seven series of cases from EVGA
head to the link in the description
below
so I figured what better opportunity on
a day where I don't have a lot of time
to time myself and do a speed build and
see how quickly I can do this and I'm
gonna make it a little bit challenging
on myself by going with a hollow one
water cooling loop as well as custom
cable sleeve kit blah blah blah and see
what we can cram inside of this lovely
NZXT h200 i it's not a very big case
trust me in fact I had to be very
specific on the graphics card I use to
make sure it would fit but parts wise
NZXT h200 i case in the black and red
celcius s 24 all-in-one water cooler and
we'll be putting in here using this one
specifically because i only have to run
one power cable to make it work and that
trust me when i say that's gonna be a
huge time-saver EVGA gtx 1080 TI
superclocked specifically because it is
a dual slot card
most of the 1080p is with custom coolers
have two and a half slots um or even
three slot this is one of very few
graphics cards on the market that are a
2 slot in the 1080 Ti well J why don't
you just use a Founders card I would
love to except for that green LED will
clash with our red and black scheme
making this look more like a Christmas
build so that's why I'm going with this
guy here the ROG Strix ex 370 I gaming
motherboard this is the mini ITX Verizon
board of course we've got an 850 Evo 250
gig SATA SSD just to make more
connections and make it a little bit
more a pain in the ass for myself I
could go in and vme SSD but I'm going
with that because it already has an OS
on it honestly some try to zg skill ddr4
memory we've got 16 gigs to 8 gig sticks
and then of course our corsair RM a 50x
with premium custom sleeve cables to go
with it so here's what we're gonna do we
are going to I'm gonna get set up here
we're gonna have Nick start the
stopwatch and we're gonna go from start
to boot and have to be sitting in the
BIOS and or the desktop now I'm gonna go
at BIOS because the desktop has to
reinitialize all of its stuff okay so
I've got everything pretty much set up
here nothing is really pre unboxed
except for the graphics card so I'm
gonna have to deal with all of that mess
and then the case is out of the box a
little bit of a slight advantage there
side cutters zip ties and my
screwdrivers all I've got so we're gonna
start the stopwatch and then we are
going to go
an old raisin in its first boot one hour
six minutes 19 seconds I'd like to point
out I spent at least 10 minutes screwing
around with that stupid nvme SSD drive I
know I said I wasn't gonna do an nvme
then I decided I wanted to because I
wanna be able to salt and stuff and test
this so I ended up doing it twice
because I thought I lost a little stand
off he uses an extra tall stand off for
this board thought I'd lost it finally
found it then screwed was trying to
reinstall that little screw while it was
already in the case and still managed
one hour six minutes 19 seconds and I'd
like to point out yeah I'm proud of this
guy's I can't help it I cannot do a
build that's not cable managed and the
cable management in this tiny case I
still managed to do all that it's a
little bunched up right here but I can
still feel the air coming through wow I
can still feel really decent of air
coming through the front of this case
even though it's fairly closed off and
has a filter on it and it's running slow
speed I tell you what though an hour and
six minutes really isn't bad you let the
mess isn't as bad as they get sometimes
huh I mean I've got the cooler box on
the floor over there it's a bit messy
and then the tables got all the zip tie
clippings and if we put all this back in
here to the tool kit away that you've
seen me build before and you've seen
builds it or not even like I wasn't
going for speed where the whole place is
just trashed I mean you've seen that so
because I didn't put the timber glass
side panel on though we'll add a 15
second penalty so we'll call it let's
just call it 107 we'll call it one hour
seven minutes I still think I could have
done it under an hour if I hadn't had to
screw with the nvme SSD twice but hey
you know what this the point of this
though was obviously this could have
probably been built a lot faster if I
wasn't doing cable management but this
was this was a challenge to see how fast
I can do it my way unlike the video we
did with Jerry the challenge accepted
series we've got another contestant
coming up soon I I didn't cut no corners
I did this exactly the way I would do it
normally but as fast as I could
was I moving faster in this one that I
was that video I think I was a lot more
I think I underestimated Jerry
but then again we helped him a lot and
so did you and so did I
we all kind of just gave me pointers but
anyway that's that's fine friendly
competition so there it is guys right
there if you want to have a look at some
of these parts I'll put links in the
description below so the main components
that were used here some Amazon stuff
there it helps the channel and you guys
can see prices and all that stuff but
I'm gonna go we are gonna do some more
content with this build right here mini
ITX 1800 X system that's 8 core 16
threads 16 gigabytes of ddr4 a 1080 Ti a
water-cooled CPU all in this tiny little
footprint so I think it looks fantastic
guys we're gonna go thanks for watching
as always I'll see you in the next one
oh by the way if you guys think you can
do it faster film your builds upload it
send it to me and maybe I'll share it I
don't know can you it faster try it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
