it's been a long time since I've done
any sort of experimental video regarding
water cooling we tried water cooling
with milk Powerade I don't even know
what else Oh orange juice that was a fun
little series we haven't done about that
in a while but ever since the post
Malone series started all the way back
to his first video the number one
comment has been water cool his system
with beer so that's exactly what we're
gonna do today we're gonna use Bud Light
that's his favorite beer I figured it's
the most water like yeah we're not gonna
actually water cool his with beer but I
figure we at least see what happens when
we try it with mine what are you doing
shopping for a case from when you build
what are you looking for I want
something designed for water cooling
fractal design define s all the way
check it out plenty of airflow plenty of
open interior for water cooling radiator
support it even has mounts for your
reservoirs I don't have enough room for
my hard drives okay
fractal design r5 look at all those hard
drive cages and you can fit your
radiators and water cooling in here no I
got a lot of hard drives but I also have
an e ATX motherboard okay I'm gonna try
something here okay bear with me you
might wanna stand clear never actually
tried this before
yeah actually it works
fractal design to find r6 you could fit
all your radiators a crap-ton of hard
drives and if it's a ATX did this is
perfect
nailed it and before we get started with
today's video I want to remind you that
I am doing a giveaway right now in
collaboration with fractal design and
exotic PC we were giving away a four
thousand dollar custom rigid tube bent
water-cooled PC so if you guys missed
that look at the description below and
you guys to find a link to that giveaway
but moving forward this is actually the
leftover beer we had from the last post
Malone video so obviously we need a
baseline we need to know kind of what
the normal conditions would be so we
have OCC tea running right here on
medium data sets because a large data
set doesn't do enough Heat small data
set basically hammers our 8700 K and
puts it up into the 80s and 90s even a
stock speeds we are running all course
synced and we are running like I said
the medium data set so these are what
our temperatures look like right now the
test has been running for around two
minutes but before that we did a lot of
testing so the heat it's already put
into the loop and this is roughly where
we're sitting but it is a 4.7 gigahertz
all core technically in overclock so
this is where we are we are sitting in
the mid 60's to the upper 50s our max
temps as you can see will momentarily
hit into the 70s and even 82 C on one
core proof that the 8700 K is definitely
a hot CPU there's no doubt about that we
know that but what happens when we put
it on beer plot twist the PC just gets
it drunk this is why it is so important
to have drain valves in your system our
bodies have drain valves for a reason
you know your butt your pee-pee I find
it as measurement just as mesmerizing to
watch a system empty itself as I do
filling them so we need to make sure we
flush out all of this glycol-based
coolant though so we've got the entire
system bled of any of the glycol-based
coolant that was in here went through a
ton of distilled water it's all it was
all nice and clear so it's cleaned out
as much as it can be I didn't want to
mix the beer with that I don't want to
make an explosion right now I know it's
not gonna happen but still but we
noticed this when we took the cap off
this system has been together forever
it's gone through a couple of changes in
the last two or three years but check
out the top of this this is
this is corrosion I don't know what this
camp is made out of this was actually
the original Alpha cool cap that came
with the top of this combo but we
actually noticed the top the underside
of the cap was also green too from where
this was so this is corrosion this isn't
actually algae this is why it's really
important guys when you're shopping for
like the eBay specials and the cheap
China knockoffs you don't know what it's
made out of I mean they may advertise it
being made out of certain things and I
know alpha cool has changed a lot of
their manufacturing process since this
was made so hopefully this isn't problem
I sketch
so hopefully this isn't a problem that
will continue but I just wanted to point
this out there's no corrosion or the
growth anywhere in this loop it's not in
the blocks it's not in the radiator just
on the cap so that that's strange just
thought I should show that but it's
possible now it could have ended up in
other places in the loop so eventually
we need to do a full teardown to
investigate that I thought I would show
that I also have propped up the system
here at kind of an angle because we what
I want to avoid here is getting a big
mess of foam I think this is going to
turn into a big foamy mess the moment
that we actually start putting this to
just nothing like this water
I think the moment I turn this on it's
just gonna it's gonna turn up a big
foamy mess the hard part's gonna be
getting it in there it's it's just
kidding an it's gonna be the hard part
yeah we should oh wait wait a funnel I
mean this is not how you pour beer
there's also another reason why I'm
doing this guys it's not just for the
entertainment factor of like what
happens if your water cool with beer I
want to see the color of Bud Light I
want to see what it looks like because
I'm gonna try and recreate it for Austin
or post Malone's build Nick do you know
of any way to get head to go down faster
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I'm gonna turn it on with all that foam
right now and see what happens what do
you think just not follow me the more I
hope get some paper towels ready
now this is what it does in your stomach
that's why you get the beer burps this
is what this is what happens we
should've done what stuck the to the
drain tube at the bottom of there and
then fill up them there that we won't
get the key inside the reservoir then
fill them we write hot water here we get
a tube I mean you know more about beer
than I do I mean shoot I don't drink
very often
okay that's not a go
raaah it's just like beer aroma just
everywhere right now well we're getting
movement no it's not helping it at all
this is the worst idea ever as long as
we get movement that's what matters
we got a movement we have beer flowing
through the system the question is
whether or not we'll ever get the foam
to actually go down I don't think we're
going to I this is just gonna keep and
he's just gonna keep foaming forever no
not the carbonation as much it's like
the yeast and the hop all the hop yeah
oh this is why we can nice things every
bit of liquid we pour in there every bit
of bubbles we get out of there it's not
nearly as golden as I thought it was
gonna be so this might not be that hard
of a mix to make for Austin specie to
look like beer it's just a slight bit of
yellow dye and maybe I'd like a drop of
orange like a tiny drop of orange idea
where's our pumper like a pump out the
phone oh crap
obviously you would never be able to run
back in my leg is wet and so that
happens when I do PC stuff you could
never run beer in a system like this it
will rot it's got to be kept cold hurts
gonna get nasty so this is just for
science okay if we can call this science
it's quite one of the most unscientific
tests ever we don't have a hypothesis we
don't have a prediction there ain't
gonna be no conclusion this is just like
shit we have science project due
tomorrow what do we do I don't know if
we're here in the computer to do
huppin's it's just a foamy mess like I
said oh it's still going up if I turn it
off let it sit
ah but there is more just a nice classy
drink I know right this is this actually
looks a little tasty like whether you
like beard or butt light or not just
imagine this is your favorite beer okay
it's your favorite mine happens to be
Hefeweizen deal with it but I'm looking
at what's going through here there's
more fluid going through here now then
foam like if you look at the tubes over
here so I think we're about to be in a
place where we can actually start it up
the beer isn't I mean the brain doesn't
need to be hydrated face it does look
pretty
bellows I'm a lightweight guys I'm sorry
I've been drinking the beer in between
the shots so I guess the rest of this
video
who cares all right all right we got to
see what actually happens here so I
can't help it I'm light we went drinking
with post Malone the other night I gotta
throw him back we had a point to this
somewhere so one of the biggest
takeaways is that this is a lot more
clear than expected it to be yes for all
you beer guys and your IPAs and crap I
know they get darker
he likes Bud Light that's why we did
that it's a it's slightly gold in there
but what happens in systems like this
with reservoirs is the reservoir always
looks darker than the tubes because
there's a higher concentration and depth
of the fluid so it looks a little more
golden here that doesn't the tubes the
tubes almost look clear what do you
think they almost look clear don't they
yeah I think one because this came out
of the refrigerator and it's still
really cold I think the initial temps
are gonna be great look at that when it
turns on look at this
it just looks tasty I mean it's like any
other fluid the how much and how well it
cools it's definitely colder but that's
because it's chilled right it's a cold
fluid right now so our media and data
set lets you happen to the temps - as we
pop it up know that they are initially
colder than the water but they should be
like I said they were taken out of the
refrigerator where the other stuff was
so he's got let us go for a while now
I'm thing away 15 minutes 15 minutes
should be enough to let the loop kind of
equalize to see what happens 15 more
minutes of me drinking beer so NIC had
the bright idea to open the lid the cap
while it was going and our temperature
is like which are sitting pretty good
right now it's only been running for six
minutes
they're in the 50s and 60s you see how
it shut up here into the 70s and 80s
Nick open the cap he was like I don't
want to let some of the pressure out was
like no I think it's fine because all
the bubbles and stuff were like gone and
basically it was turning flat which is
what happens to beer when it aerates and
turns warm it was flat so he cracks the
top it goes whoosh into foam and like
comes up real quick and he like capped
it off before it overflowed the second
he did that it turned in a big hairy
mess and then the temps were like being
like spiked so why not try it again
there oh it's still going up okay yeah
but see now that you pull air in the
system it's really not that bad though
it's actually cooling really really well
you can see where he opened the cap
right there I think this is more what I
expected to happen when you let it just
sit under pressure it's not that bad but
Nick's afraid it's gonna pop off a hose
because we had an experience here that
we didn't really talk about a while back
or we actually created a geyser no crap
so I I have this bright idea of just
leaving the cap open so that it could
just keep expanding oh man I just don't
want getting on there we have a running
system right here so we've been running
out for 14 minutes close enough to our
15 our temperatures are sitting in the
mid to upper 60s couple cores in the 50s
every now and then except max this was
when we kept playing around the foam so
that number is kind of what can you take
away from today's video one apparently
we've run out of ideas too you can cool
a computer with beer for a little while
until it rots ferments and turns into a
disgusting algae filled rotted mess so
the other takeaway from this video is
guys it was just a pure piece of
entertainment okay questions gonna be
what happens when we try and clean it
out definite smells like when you walk
into a bar bathroom right now it's the
best way to put it so I'm just gonna be
running distilled water through here
probably a couple gallons of it just to
make sure
that we get it all out and we've got our
jumper on there so that's just draining
I just kind of keep topping it off and
it will keep circulating through the
system until this comes out perfectly
clear I don't think this is gonna be a
problem to clean honestly guys I think
it's gonna become clean pretty quickly
so while I keep doing this why don't you
guys do this why'd you guys go and check
out the links in the description below
one to the giveaway two to the other
video we did where we tested like I said
milk orange juice Powerade we have
another video we tested thermal
compounds with things like peanut butter
some Burt's Bees cream and Oreo cookies
or ro cookie filling so you guys can
give this video a like if you
appreciated us putting our our
components through this torture just to
see what happens anyway guys thanks for
watching give us some more suggestions
obviously enough people suggested try
cooling a system with beer and we did it
so we don't give any peer pressure at
all this was our idea you didn't make us
do this alright maybe you did whatever
okay see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
