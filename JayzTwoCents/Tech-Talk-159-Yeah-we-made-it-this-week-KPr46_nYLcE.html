gonna work or not I don't really care I
mean you guys are lucky we even getting
a live stream today man I'm dealing with
so much shit today wait I do have an
intro set up on this yes I do have an
intro I actually thought about that oh
yeah welcome to Jeff talk 159 where
there's gonna be lots of leg and audio
issues and buffering and shifting and
you okay he's not he's not watching this
dream he's not he's not even a mod for
us he's down he's downstairs dealing
with that paint crisis what a dick man
no no coconut monkey is like the nicest
guy which is probably one of his faults
way too nice for you anyways yeah so
what's this what's his paint crisis that
you're talking about here okay so I
guess we're gonna jump right in the car
talk right guys for small it out of the
way guys you're gonna see audio and
video late sync issues with this stream
OBS is not playing nice on skunkworks
right now and I don't have time to fix
it obviously I'm not at the studio I'm
at home in our guest room which is where
skunk works slash my gaming rig lives
and that bad that bed that bed makes a
very good doghouse bed actually I've
never slept in this bed so there's that
dude it's hard as a rock but for some
reason that's comfortable it's not that
hard anymore enough people have stayed
over now like for the weekend and stuff
that it's actually pretty broken in now
oh good good no oh okay yeah you like to
bitch and complain that you know I'm not
a good friend
I bought this fucking bed for you you're
a Good Man Charlie Brown this exists
because when you were coming over the
the last time I was like I don't want
Jerry to have to sleep on the couch or
in in little J's pink bed again so I I
literally pulled out I literally pulled
out the guest PC murder leads me to pcs
in here when this was my stream of that
yep I yanked all that out so that I
could put a bed in here for you you're a
good man Jay you're a good man okay so
if you guys saw in my zeal one video I
put up yesterday in the beginning I
talked about the fact that I am one of
the featured cars at Camaro con taking
place intimate
kela well a good friend of mine who is
also a service member in the United
States Air Force has a 5th gen 2 SS full
bolt on Camaro and he basically was
planning on coming out here and and you
know his wife's family lives out here in
Southern California so he was coming out
here he's me one of the featured cars -
in the fast tech booth with me and he
decided in February he was gonna get the
car repainted and it was it's repainted
with with Auto dip it's not that
plastidip it's like a higher-end
plastidip I guess I don't know I'm not
personally a fan of peel coat but anyway
I just like paint it the right way or
don't do it at all it's kind of the way
I am and the base coat and everything
looked phenomenal it was like a matte
kind of a gunmetal II black color with
red flake in it it looked amazing
because it's because his car is like
kind of based after Deadpool like he's
it's a red and black car and he was like
he just called the Deadpool right well
now it looks like Deadpool because they
fucked up the paint so bad it literally
looks like Deadpool skin so we have been
downstairs all day paint correcting and
sanding and buffing and it doesn't look
good at all like it it's not ever going
to look right because there are fish
eyes and there are runs and the paint
and everything and and we're already
dealing with like some places we're
burning through the clear coat before we
even get it smooth and even Don top so
if you know anything about paint
correction then you know I am fighting
an uphill battle that is that we were
going to lose it's just we're trying to
get the car somewhat presentable but
yeah it's it's not going well so and
then here's that here's the other thing
you ready for this he he installed his
long tube headers yesterday drove it
from Eric from Tucson Arizona to here in
Southern California
straight through today so of like six
and a half hour seven-hour drive ok he
gets here to my house I meet him here
before he pulls up I'm waiting in that
in the outdoor furniture area like where
our little it our courtyard air atrium
thing is with the outdoor like patio
furniture I'm sitting there waiting for
him he pulls up into the driveway and
the first thing I smell is oil I'm like
dude I smell oil from under your car
he's like really I was like yeah I I'm
sensitive to that I smell oil is like
I'm sick of my nose like in the cowl at
the back of his hood like smelling like
oh my god yeah I totally smell oil he's
like huh interesting so
I back my car the zl1 out of my garage
and we pull his 2 SS in and where he had
stopped like there was all kinds of oil
on my driveway as like dude look you
were pissing oil everywhere we jack up
his car we look underneath the entire
bottom of his car from front to rear is
covered in oil the bottom of the bottom
of the engine the suspension the
transmission the exhaust covered in oil
and so what he what we figured out he
did was when he did his long tube
headers and he put his dipstick back on
he totally missed like where the
dipstick goes into the pan so it was
just shit it was just shitting oil that
whole trip all out of that hole all over
the bottom of this car so the pressure
and the crankcase was just blowing it
out of the hole yeah but he drove seven
hours like that how much was left in the
crankcase did you I don't know I I so it
measured empty but the thing was when he
measured it it wasn't even going into
the pan so I was like dude so here he
fixed it and he put it in and he's like
off the bottom of the low side but his
oil pressure and temperature stayed okay
it's just I told him I was like dude you
know you don't even know how lucky you
are if you've got any problems they
might not show up until later you need
on your next oil change you need to look
for sparkle and your oil but so yeah
what is like turned into the paint
crisis I was trying to fix the mummy
pulls up I'm like dude you're pissin oil
all over my driveway and I'm like this
is just like the neverending nightmare
of car stuff today he is so lucky that
he made that long of a drive yeah yeah I
know cleaning that oh my god we're just
I mean just a vacuum tube just driving
down the road and have an air flowing
over the hole you think it'd just be
cooked pulling a constant stream out of
there like quarts 3-hour he had the
dipstick tube like in the hole but it
was misaligned so it wasn't like the
whole quarter inch hole or whatever it
is was just wide open it was like God
mostly blocked it's just it was enough
for while he was driving at freeway
speeds to just have it do the pressure
underneath the car just carrying it to
the back of the car well I hope he
doesn't later on find out that he's got
a knock in the engine from that eleda
but but I mean it sounds to me as long
as he wasn't like hammering on it and
shit and he's probably gonna be alright
yeah that's crazy though had enough and
had 49 al says lol his next oil change
should be right now yeah that's where he
and coconut monkey are right now
they went to get oil they came by they
they gave me my Starbucks
he gave me Starbucks for you know that's
all he's paying me to help him with his
paint and stuff his Starbucks which I
didn't even ask for but he he went he
got this what he went to get his new oil
so we could do his oil change wise here
but then he got the wrong oil so so how
are you gonna correct the paint where
you gonna just say it where usually just
sand it down and like reapply the paint
that he had and then try to clear it
again I mean he already did a wet sand
himself which was not a very good job
but here's the thing his paint is so
uneven I told him I said look I'm it was
really cloudy to like the picture I
should have prepared pictures to show it
it's so bad but I showed you pictures
didn't I you did you showed me one
picture where I mean it literally looked
like it was Ryan aligned yeah look like
Grindr later yeah I so I've got like a
three-stage paint correction because I
have all the proper paint correction
equipment I said I know how people know
this in college I did Auto Body and so I
know how to correct paint but it's one
of those things I keep telling them like
dude first of all this is not like
regular paint this is this is dip I have
no idea this stuff's gonna react it's
super thick and here's the thing on top
of this is it's got flake in it
so what looks like fish eye and a bunch
of dimples is actually the flake making
it like the flake is supposed to be like
point zero to five millimeter which is
huge freakin huge for metal flake in
paint got mirrors in it it's so bad yeah
I mean we're just at this point now
where we're just trying to get the car
to shine a little bit but either way I
told him was like it's gonna get called
your car Deadpool because that's about
the theme you got here I'm not trying to
be an ass it's just we're just trying to
minimize the no other cars should have
survived that trip like honestly I don't
leave my Subarus pretty hardcore and I
think if I left the dipstick out it
would just all the oil would find its
way out of that hole from Tucson to
almost LA County that is a long that's a
long way to go with oil just flowing out
of your pan good good thing it's a
Camaro and it has like 85,000 quarts of
oil in it if it wasn't the Exide Exxon
Valdez it probably wouldn't made it to
your house yeah I don't know I don't
know what the ls3 s had but
I know my lt4 has 11 quarts of oil
that's insane yes guess how many quarts
my little soupy male 2 point 5 out of 5
5 you don't have to put the 5 in you
know when you drain it usually have
about half a quart stuck in 90 little
little holes you know up inside of the
block and it never comes out because
it's horizontally opposed right so you
never have a part where the oil can
completely drain into the pan yeah so
your oh you always have puddles in the
cylinders the only way to actually get a
full oil change on a Subaru is the rock
the son of a bitch yeah techno scope
says 50 coats of clear
yeah they basically did 50 coats of
clear just all in the one coat it's so
thick in some areas it's not even so
there's bubbles in it so whoever hooked
up the gun like didn't check the
pressure enough it just kicked it on
it's not bubbles it's um the base so the
way this goes is it lay down a base coat
right the base coats black like a matte
black actually all paint when it goes
down is pretty much matte right until
you get clear on it wait here we go J
most reviewers came in to for the GTX
1080 let alone a $70,000 drag car get
back to computer stuff already shut the
fuck up shader aid no one gives a shit
what you think and first of all it's not
a drag car it's a road race car and what
my viewers can and can't afford it's not
something I can do anything about so
basically you can take your pansy on ask
somewhere else
I don't even the fuck what you think
about my car second of all great second
of second of all when it comes to the to
the paint process they laid down this
black now the black almost looks like a
gunmetal first of all like the back the
black doesn't look black until it's
clear on it then it gets really deep
right okay so he's all the scratches and
stuff they sent me pictures of what it
looked like when the base coat was put
down and it looked amazing then they
laid they mix up the flake in the next
layer of paint right and then they spray
the the flake layer like if you ever
seen the way that like lowriders are
painted like oh yeah they look like
disco balls but there's so many layers
of paint on that yeah but the thing is
they do it in such thin layers like lay
layer it and layer and layer it the
problem is this guy just did like heavy
ass coats and so every single coat like
that
was pretty much so thick and the the the
micron size of the flake was so big that
they could never get the layer smooth
and then they just put like four times
the thickness of a standard clear coat
on top of all that which just sealed in
all of that uneven surface now what's
gonna happen if you have like if you
have an uneven surface underneath all
right here's a perfect example when
you're looking in the water right of the
ocean you know some water looks lighter
blue some looks darker blue that's cuz
the depths underneath the surface are
different depths the surface is the same
level but you have these different
depths underneath that so that's what
your hey we're getting with his clear
coat is it doesn't look even because the
depth of paint underneath is not level
and that's why I'm trying to explain
them no matter how much we wet sand no
matter how much we polished how much we
we cut it and clear it or polish it it's
not gonna look right because the base
coat underneath is so jacked up oh my
god Jimmie's is no tech dog is in the
word it's pink TechTalk it's it's in the
fucking description what does it say
warning it's the tech you might get
publicly ridiculed it's right there in
your face and you still ask
speaking of tech guys I heard there was
a little bit of a Bitcoin rebound and
then it like went away as fast as it
rebounded yeah bitcoins not it's not
really following its trend of of
dropping in half and coming right back
to double its it's floundering a little
there there might be some hope here for
Bitcoin starting to starting to stagnate
a little it's actually something I
wanted you to talk about junior audio is
distorted is my audio sound of stories
like it's uh crackling I mean you cut
out every once in a while like ever so
slightly but it's like you hardly even
noticeable I'm gonna turn down the mic
gain the mic itself you know I bet you
Windows is like turning up my mic yeah
you're running Windows 8.1 on that
machine right I I am that's a garbage OS
that is garbage oh I see what's happened
here okay yeah it cranked the microphone
audio and I want the Yeti to give me my
my audio levels so let's do that maybe
that'll be a little bit better you'll
get a little bit more bass in your voice
right there
okay here's what here's what I want to
do I want you to talk about this
so-called ASIC minor for aetherium do
you know anything about it is this the
new I am red
anything about it yet I know it has
exist I was hoping you would talk about
it good because well I keep well because
we we had heard that it was a theorem
was like designed not to work with a six
and that's why GPU because of the memory
speed and all that is why GPUs are
utilized but it looks like and you guys
ready for this the Best Buy in Montclair
you guys know where Montclair California
is the best buy in Montclair we went in
there the other day they had both a 1080
and a 1080 TI in stock at MSRP I was
like shocked so hopefully that's a sign
of things to come hoping alright well
let's see here so right now I'm just
trying to identify who I'm guessing it's
probably gonna be aunt minor because
they're always they always seem to be
the ones that make the Asics first let
me go check the if you guys know in chat
who makes the actual
etherium minor I want to go look at it
because remember I did talk about this
on a previous show that the only thing
preventing them from making an ASIC
minor is that it would have to be hybrid
because it needs really fast memory it
would need like ddr4 ddr5 memory and
that didn't seem like that was that hard
of a problem to solve
yeah let's see here the Panda minor b3 +
aetherium z cache Manero minor ok that's
not gonna be an ASIC 1,900 bucks
no that's that's just a computer uh see
do they have any theory 'm I'm looking
here I don't see any aetherium miners on
here uh let's see your oh it was right
after they announced bit main then oh
bit mean okay let me check while you're
looking that up a shadow saber he said
yo I started making my own racing sim
was wondering what games you've been
playing so far I've got assetto corsa
and so far it's been really fun project
cars 2 is infinitely better than project
cars one in terms of tracks available
the vehicles available there's grid
Autosport as i think it is it's more
arcadey but it's still good eye erasing
is gonna give you the most realistic
exceeding the experience but the problem
with AI racing is subscription-based and
with the exception bandy with the
exception of the base tracks and cars
they give you everything is like either
12 or 14 bucks that's expensive
damn I keep burping it's like expensive
I have easily spent $1,500 on eye racing
since you introduced me to it three
years ago so it adds up a lot
all right so I think I found it it's the
ant miner III yeah I just I just found
it hold on how are they actually are for
sale right now - yeah man it really
makes me what this is this is me hoping
that this this is going to bring things
back to normal so let's see right now so
it looks like batch 1 so they did the
brand new right these are brand new the
units are actually fairly big - so I'm
thinking they might not actually be a
six they might actually just be fully
integrated miners let me check here I
want to see what the notes on the unit
are because this does this doesn't look
like a conventional ASIC it's it's it's
too damn big someone says what about
Forza Motorsport 7 yes you can play it
obviously through you know Microsoft on
the on the desktop the problem is it's
very Arkady if you're looking for a very
realistic driving experience Forza is
really designed for controllers and it's
just not that realistic so I mean but
yeah I mean it's it's another it's for
is this a fun game to just like build
cars and go in thrash him you know I
mean yeah all they are saying it's an
e-cig minor ok so I've got some
information here ok take it away so so
so it looks like right now okay so it's
800 watt power consumption that's
actually a pretty steep power
consumption it generates 180 mega hash a
second which is pretty respectable as a
matter of fact I think 180 is just
slightly less than what I get off to
Titans so that's pretty pretty
respectable for something that's pulling
800 watts on the standalone yeah let's
see so it is uh let's see 180 mega hash
the second it they do classified as an
ASIC though they say it's the world's
first eath hash ASIC miner ordering
limit of number of miners available in
China you can mine aetherium through
cloud mining contract with hash Flair or
Genesis mining if you want to buy any
one of these mining metrics based on two
hundred and thirty-eight thousand Giga
hash a second they don't give any specs
on it which is weird because they're
calling it an ASIC but they're not
they're not giving any details they
don't even talk about the memory that's
inside a thing but then again you know
it might be one of those things where
they're just trying to keep it a closely
guarded secret and somebody needs to get
ahold one and crack it open can you
explain something to me yeah no it comes
as no surprise that I'm pretty stupid
now I don't really know what the
difference between an ASIC miner is and
and the computer doing it or GPU right
yeah yeah okay I mean I know it's a sick
quality is so of course I'm always
confused by like what's the difference
of an ASIC miner and I'm thinking of
ASIC quality so and I know what Asics
are so explain to me what an ASIC miner
is okay so the ASIC miner is literally a
piece of hardware that is designed just
to do the one hashing algorithm and
nothing else there's no overhead there's
no additional instructions it doesn't
have programmable chips on it so it's
not having to go through any kind of a
logic chain to figure it out it's like
if you had a calculator that was
Hardware basically the only did one
mathematical function over and over
again it would be way faster than having
something that had to have software
logic built into it to do it yeah so the
idea what the ASIC is you basically have
a piece of hardware where you feed at a
number or feed at a set of numbers or a
set of data and it processes it through
a chain that only processes the data in
a very mechanical way it's digital but
it's doing in a mechanical way is it
only handles the data in one possible
way so it moves really fast and can
cycle way faster than a conventional
chip like like like an x86 or x64 chip
that has you know a ton of instructions
and has to go through you know 30 or 40
different cycles on the CPU to do some
very simple operation the ecig just does
it all in one operation hmm
so so it can do it incredibly fast it's
it's pretty much the most efficient way
that you can do any kind of mathematical
computation now that was great for for
doing Bitcoin mining because Bitcoin
mining just required you to literally
guess a number it would give you
something called a seed and you would
use that seed in this very specific
algorithm to generate numbers and the
per first person to generate a number
with so many leading zeros randomly
basically won the coin so it was all it
was all just basically the lottery
aetherium works a little differently
because aetherium generates these tables
in real time like huge look-up tables of
these numbers and it requires a shitload
of memory to do that and the more memory
it has the faster the operation is so
now what the ASIC has to do is the ASIC
has to get its data and process it out
of these tables that are dynamically
generated and the GP was really quick at
doing that because of how fast the
memory was it really didn't matter how
fast the GPU was it was more about the
memory on it so then how come in the
beginning everyone was saying you can't
mine a theory and when an ASIC because
it's designed not to and now suddenly
they're doing it because everybody was
making the incorrect assumption that the
thing would have to be 100% an ASIC this
is not 100% in ASIC obviously
it has memory somewhere inside of this
ASIC build is some kind of chip in
really fast memory that's capable of
building the tables and all the ASIC is
doing is the math yeah so so it's a
hybrid solution any way you look at it
but it's 800 bucks which is gonna be way
cheaper than any GPU that's gonna be
able to mind at 180 mega hash a second
so that's good for the GPU industry like
people are probably buying these up by
the thousands right now I didn't see who
said it the comment was by a minute ago
that the etherium ASIC is like it's too
late for it to make a difference I mean
why would that oh no way no no no way at
all like even people are still buying
new generation Bitcoin miners today yeah
even though Bitcoin mining is like
pretty much under the bus as far as
people buying them for a whole new Slyke
setting up your own minds and everything
I don't see a bunch of people throwing
away their GPUs and going and running
and buying these things but if you're
running a crypto mine somewhere like in
China oh I'm sure they're already
stocking these things on the shelves and
grow and everything else away that's
what that's what brings the market back
to normal is right just have to stop
buying the GPUs as a tool because if
there's a better tool right yeah right I
mean I guess the question is which which
has the better ROI right you can't see a
price on these ASIC miners it's $800 for
this one that does 180 mega hash a
second but but the what the past has
shown us is that all cryptocurrency
mining equipment isn't priced based on
the technology in the Rd it's priced
based on its profit probability in the
given time so like tomorrow if aetherium
doubles in price this is now a $1600
miner they will adjust the price
literally daily on this thing depending
on the the profitability of aetherium so
where does that place it in terms of its
efficiency of you know what it's hash
rate is versus what GPUs can do well it
says right now okay so the price tag
$800 III minor is about as expensive is
one pair of rx 580 graphics cards or
three gtx 1060 s you aren't getting
anywhere near the same sort of hash rate
for that sort of money with consumer
graphics cards so that tells us right
now that because 180 like i said my two
titans is having a hard time doing the
other says sounds really high he says
it's a really high hash rate so
basically you'd need three GTX 1060 s
and then some to hit that mark so the
800 ollar price point is actually quite
cheap as a Scott Knight says all
the first batch was 800 so it's probably
already inflated probably let's go here
let's go see back and go tube it means
website because they sell direct as a
matter of fact a lot of my mining
equipment that I had for for Bitcoin was
from these guys Hughie's diver in chat
says who's making these bitcoin cards
they're not Bitcoin cards or ASIC miners
by bit main right yep
yeah they're of the ant minor and minor
let's see here ant minor let me find the
eath met they've only got one right now
oh Jesus okay so just give you an idea
of how much the inflation was batch one
was eight hundred dollars okay batch two
is twenty one hundred and fifty yeah
okay for the exact same hatchery so just
like I told you eight hundred was when
they first came out so now the etherium
is rebounding and going up rapidly again
and it's not a rock bottom now they're
they're three times as much Wonka Willie
says it's equivalent to six rx5 80s or
610 70s bit Maine released them three
hundred risking aetherium for get their
new who said not forking bit Maine
raised price huh wait six ten 70s what
he said
no shit well fuck I was way off than if
that's the case even moving that even at
$2,100
base what it cost to buy six of those
graphics cards you're still safe anybody
getting this thing true 2150 I'll be
using a lot less power yeah and the
thing is as people bring these online
because the hash rate is so incredibly
high and they can just run 24/7
maintenance free and they don't have all
the problems that come along with having
an entire like you know operating system
and shit you're gonna find that China's
gonna start bringing these things online
and like oh I guarantee you as fast as
bit man is making these things they're
selling them is it is it then is it
unfeasible to think that people might
just go well the etherium you know ASIC
miners are just too expensive I'm going
back to GPU only if the ASIC miners
become more expensive than GPU and
that'll never happen cuz bit-bit main
knows they will never be able to sell
them if they don't undercut the GPU
market the whole reason for the thing
that exists is to undercut the GPU
market right more hash rate for less
money and that's what they're trying to
do so so if GPU start going down in cost
tomorrow they will have to start
artificially deflating the cost of their
unit regardless is and they're gonna
make money on I guarantee these Asics
that they're building don't cost them a
hundred dollars to build these things if
that probably cost them like 30 40 bucks
to build these things Chris unless
there's a shitload of member
in there that's ddr4 ddr5 then it's
probably significantly more but they
don't say Chris Kasper Zek Casper's acts
as Vegas I get 50 mega hash per second
that means you need more than three of
them technically to match that rate
hundred eighty right yeah this is 180
and you're doing it with 800 watts I
don't know what the power consumption
would be on those GPUs once you factor
in the system that you need around it to
support there would be a lot more than a
hundred watts to run three Vega cards
even if they're Vegas right sixes right
empower efficiency is kind of like the
reserves there like unjoin under load
the vega cards actually pull more than
250 watts each yeah actually whoa so so
the so the fartist said 310 ATT is is
only pulling 162 mega hash yeah so so
even at 2150 these things are a steal
like if you were looking to buy
something to mind a theory him you would
not be looking at a GPU now you'd be
looking at an ant miner III okay let's
let's change the topic here to CPUs so
junaid cosas host whatever I'm sorry I
messed up renamed it said so you like
the new Verizon - for editing rendering
or other work as compared with i7 8th
gen 8700 K and other high-end Intel CPUs
I think what he's asking me as if I
think rise into is a better work
workstation slash rendering CPU than an
8th gen 8700 K in terms of these for
poor people in terms of heavily
multi-threaded workloads the 2700 X is
indeed going to hand the 8700 K it's ass
as far as I'm concerned but the 8700 K
is gonna have better single-threaded
performance the thing is that's such an
argument that doesn't doesn't hold up
any more this look that was that was a
good argument ten years ago when dual
cores had only been out for a few years
and then people were still coding for
the single threaded optimization and I
think Jerry you would agree that things
are so much more heavily optimized
towards multi-core multi-core
enhancement now our multi-core threading
that the argument of yeah but Intel's
better at single core performance just
doesn't hold up anymore where if you can
get a 2,700 X which is cheaper than an
8700 K to give you perspective here 8700
K is 6 core 12 threads mainstream CPU
it's about 4.5 to 4.7 gigahertz and it
runs really freakin hot because it's
like it's like the it's like the Haswell
Edition all over again where they just
did a very poor job at putting the
thermal paste on or they use bad you're
wrong thermal paste that's got longer
life it gives you terrible temperature
in between they'll run upper 80s to low
90s under load and so you can get an 8
core 16 thread so you've got four
additional work threads with 2700 X
that's cheaper it's cooler and uses less
energy so if you're doing very heavily
multitec multi-threaded workloads or
running multiple programs at a time I
would rather take the more cores more
thread and maybe a 5 percent reduction
in single threaded performance to have
more cores would you or would you would
you not do that the only I agree with
you by and large like if you look at
somebody's average workflow but there's
still a lot of edge cases that are very
dependent on single threaded performance
like for instance many of the codecs
like the h.264 codec or is it 2 6-4
yeah the 2 6 for the 2 6 5 is way better
but the 2 6 for codec is still heavily
single-threaded so you're getting you're
gonna benefit hugely from having more
megahertz versus more coarse however the
flipside of that is is most of the stuff
with games and most of the gaming
engines that are being built today and
most of the newer software like DaVinci
Resolve for instance in the video
editing world it's all more heavily
multi-threaded so you're gonna benefit
way more from the multi-threading than
you would from the single threaded a
performance but I do agree that it's
like 5 10 percent I mean 10 percent
would be like astronomically the tops
you're not gonna see that much of a gap
anymore it's hugely diminishing returns
like even if one if you're running on
the one CPU and the CP is 20% faster on
the single thread versus having two
threads that aren't quite as fast I
don't think you're gonna notice like any
huge significant difference in most of
the stuff that you're gonna do here's
here's where we are when I first started
YouTube in 2012 August 26 2012 I had an
FX 81 20 at the time 8 horas 4 cores
8 threads technically actually it was
more like anyway won't even willing to
get into the to the bulldozer argument
of whether or not it's truly a
an eight-core fork or whatever right
they were more of course than
hyper-threading yeah but the thing was
the cores were sharing l2 cache so it
was yeah so anyway two cores per per l2
level two cache and it was they were
shared between the two it was okay but
it wasn't great it did not compete very
well with Ivy Bridge Ivy Bridge 30 3770k
was just destroying it in terms of IPC
single-threaded performance you name it
it was handy has has to it back then you
could physically notice a difference of
taking an ad that's let's say an 81 an
81 50 or even an 80 let's say in 83 50
right when it matured a little bit maybe
took an 83 50 and like it has well 4770k
you could indeed throughout your day to
day use notice the snappier performance
of Intel right 20 18 you fast forward
five years six years I don't feel that
anymore
I can go we have all sorts of systems
that are that are up and running in the
studio we've got we've got 2700 X we've
got some low-end systems we got Pentium
systems we've got X 299 16 and 18 core
systems we've got thread Ripper running
right now as one of our editing rigs and
you know when I move between them I
can't notice a difference the only time
I notice a difference is when I hit
render on something the time is
different between them but even though
even the lowest end like current rise
and Gen stuff versus the highest and
tenth highest and Intel stuff right now
it's like day to day usage gaming moving
around programs browsing the internet I
don't feel a difference which i think is
amazing because that gap being narrowed
the way it has has really made the
consumer win we're no longer do you feel
like if you don't get the highest end
CPU that you're leaving a lot of
performance on the table because
granted I think a lot of people are
aspiring streamers aspiring youtubers
and stuff but very few people are
actually making a living off rendering
videos like right not like I am right so
I noticed those difference in terms of
render time but when it comes to
something like a $200
you know 1600 X which is a six core 12
thread CPU I cannot tell you a
difference between the 1600
or the 59 30k I used to have and that
wasn't and that was an extreme extreme
platform CPU it was it was the next 99
CPU that is to me this is like the best
time to be a PC enthusiast it just kind
of sucks the GP prices are the way they
are but hopefully hopefully that'll come
down though I mean I'd honestly an ASIC
being created is exactly what brought GP
prices down when Bitcoin was robbing all
the AMD GPUs yeah so I could totally see
that doing the same thing here went
quick so the one who knocks said the
3770k was better than the FX 90 317 IPC
by a pretty wide margin look the 9370
was nothing more than a extremely
factory overclocked
8350 that was running almost 5 gigahertz
the problem is you increase the clock
speed that doesn't in Creede the I
increase the IPC it's it's that's more
so you're talking about instructions per
clock and then increasing the clock
speed increasing clock speed does not
give you more instructions per clock
does that make sense
no okay maybe the Mach speed is
inherently how fast it processes the
instructions per clock right see I
usually miss near I used to think that
as well but it was explained to me by
quite a few people that that is not the
way that it works then you tell me
because I'd like to know okay so Jesus
I'm trying to think of an analogy here I
had the tiger if you have 4000 clocks
yeah and each clock can give you a
certain level of performance adding more
of those clocks does not give you more
clock performance per let's say mega
hurt okay you're able you're able to
complete more tasks in that amount of
time but you haven't actually increased
the actual instructions per clock if
that makes sense it's like the amount of
instructions that that one mega hurt can
do does not increase you just increase
it how many increased how many mega
Hertz you're doing in the same amount of
time so that shows the level of
performance but the IPC's themselves
have not changed okay so let me show you
where I'm a little confused is that the
CPUs megahertz is how fast the CBO's
clock is is cycling right each time the
CPU is cycling is
it's instructions it's the same reverse
direction instructions yes same yeah
each clock the same number of
instructions right so if the CPU is
running at a hundred megahertz and now
it's running at one hundred and one
megahertz you technically would be
processing ten more cycles per second or
millisecond or whatever the fuck it is
right so you increase you increase the
cycles but not the actual clock recycle
this is confusing
I believe I agree and this is this is
very confusing this is where when I made
I made the assumption one day in a video
that overclocking was increasing my IPC
like the internet lost their shit that
it wasn't true interesting interesting
so I'm in just one those things it's not
a matter of right or wrong I just I
don't understand it right now but I know
that it's incredibly complex because I
know that the way a CPU cycles also is
inherently tied to its instruction set
right like for instance the old RISC
processors remember they were literally
reduced instruction set that's that's
what risk was see like Joe Oh Grimm says
CPUs are superscalar they supersu
superscalar whatever they can do
multiple instructions per cycle okay
yeah because they have multiple
instructions I'm good each time the CPU
cycles you're literally jumping in
between the time slices on the CPU and
you're changing the values in the
instructions literally there is a clock
there's an interrupt that happens
between each cycle of the CPU where
everything says quick get your shit into
the registers and then the next cycle
goes through and processes everything in
the registers and then all those values
get changed through the register
instructions that were called them put
into different registers and then the
CPU repeats and repeats and repeats and
preached load instructions load
information process and it's just doing
that you know literally millions of
times a second oh there's such a good
discussion taking place in chat now like
now now there are kind of arguing with
each other jeido black says clock and
cycle of the same thing no such thing as
clocks per cycle it's instructions per
clock is what we're talking about but
what I'm saying is Inc so it's supposed
to be like oh I see what he's saying you
do this okay no no okay now that makes
sense relat relat made sense okay up
here Rhett was it Reville Reville Pathan
said you do more with less time but you
still do the same amounts per cycle you
just do more cycles per second so that's
that makes sense you're not changing how
much work the CPU can do purse
you're just changing how fast in cycles
right that's and I guess that's what I
was trying to say is like the actual
clock can only do so much and you
increase the overclock you're doing more
clocks or cycles got a second which is
getting you more data but the IPC or the
instructions per clock didn't change is
what the losses show this makes sense
okay that's where I was getting really
confused okay so yeah the instructions
per cycle are never gonna change because
the CPU even you're speeding up how fast
it's going through but each cycle it's
still only doing the same workload right
because that cycle is literally just
process and that's and that's why the
internet lost their shit when I had said
that I overclocked for a better IPC and
everyone's like you didn't change the
IPC and they like they literally like
took to Reddit that makes sense because
you're not looking at how much work the
CPU is doing within a given time you're
looking how much work it's doing within
a given cycle right and I'm not gonna
change the CPU can only do whatever its
instructions that whatever the
architecture dictates it can do per
cycle that's all I can do right and this
is why I question ever is why I could
never be a CPU engineer cuz I don't even
think my brain is capable of ever
learning like the deep engineering level
of how a CPU works now I think there was
like a was a homologation between Intel
and AMD where they both basically have
the same instruction sets from now like
like didn't AMD get all the MMX stuff
and then until got all the SSE stuff but
there's still a gap there or something
that one has the other doesn't well what
I'm saying is purely IPC is like if we
take the IPC performance of rise into
versus you know the latest okay whatever
KB leak no no they weren't capable you
remember what they're calling a shit
anymore it's too many lakes so if you
take the 8700 K in its IPC and the rise
in to in its IPC they're still a
different gaps between them but it's
like okay it's like five between
anywhere between five and seven percent
I think it was because the interesting
thing is if it can do more per cycle
like in an optimal scenario right it's
not able to do it with everything right
there has to be a pretty much you have
to be utilizing whatever that thing is
that that chip can do on that cycle that
the other chip would have to do two or
three cycles to accomplish hey here we
go if not Huck just put it in a
perfectly understandable way IPC is the
track size that doesn't change your
speed around the track can change ok
well that's that's a fair analogy
because the way I'm looking at is if if
you can do
more per cycle then technically you
could do more work with less cycles
there basically could have a slower
clock speed and do more work under an
optimal situation if you're utilizing it
to a hundred percent of its capability
right but of course in an engineering
level you know about 12 years ago we
they took the path of let's just add
more workloads and just will build the
CPU sideways rather than increasing what
the actual core can do but I mean that's
why look at how year-on-year
how much faster CPUs got how much
megahertz they increase increasing let's
go back to 2000 it was it was nineteen
like it was like 1999 when we talked
about seeing the first 1 gigahertz CPU
right single core 1 gigahertz and I was
actually working at Circuit City as a
computer salesman when we had like an
800 megahertz sony vaio thing right sony
desktop who remembers the sony desktops
but anyway I do and then I remember when
we had the first 1 gigahertz
it was just like amazing and then it was
just like next we know like three weeks
later like here's an 1100 here's a 12 oh
yeah sure picked up quick I remember
that but but what happened when we hit
before gigahertz and above that shit
just hit a wall quickly what Intel sent
out a statement saying that 5 gigahertz
was the theoretical limit at which
copper was it like copper traces or
something through silica could could
transmit like that was literally what
they were calling the ceiling we've even
kind of blown that out of the water with
more electricity and more heat
dissipation yeah but we can't go any
further there is a limit to how fast you
can cycle I mean literally the laws of
like thermal dynamics stop you from
going any faster well I mean I think ln2
overclockers would challenge that what's
that what's the highest speed nil into
overclockers ever gotten on an ex act
like an x64 problem I don't know what
the highest is but I know we've seen 7.9
gigahertz Jesus Christ
yeah but the CPU isn't gonna survive for
any period of time at that speed right
mmm
I mean a lot of times we're doing it on
single core cuz they can't carry that
frequency across all cores although I do
think I do think thread gripper got like
a 6 something gigahertz all core mm-hmm
but it was theoretical on error then
because I I distinctly remember when I
was working to Microsoft the Intel sent
out some notice about the
when they started doing massively more
multiple core stuff yeah like like they
were explaining that the reason they
were doing that is cuz they literally
could not go any for like 5 gigahertz
was like the limit where they could go
on maybe air would just air cooling but
they were like we have to start going
out and that's when they started
announcing that they were gonna do
everything up to a thirty thirty-two
core processor I learned that was like
seven years ago I learned quite a bit
when I had kingpin come to Vince kingpin
come to my studio and we did the L into
overclocking with the his video card yep
I learned an awful lot about how how the
various temperature range actually
affects the the actual CPU like we he
was he broke it down really well for me
he's like we can go and he was really
good to the sensor he was like a look at
this temperature we can probably hit a
theoretical max of this and he would be
within 25 megahertz of where we would
crash at the certain speed he's like
okay let's drop it down now to he's like
let's go negative you know 60 C and then
and then we would drop it maybe I go
keep that negative 60 C we could
probably hit this speed and we went low
all the way down to about a negative
where to go like negative 90 C negative
hundred see something like that and it
was pretty it was pretty awesome and he
was explaining to me what actually
happens to different electrodes and
different you know the actual core of
the GPU under certain temperatures which
is why we also had a heat gun pointed at
the the output so a lot of people asked
like what's the heat gun for because
here we are pouring liquid nitrogen into
the pot and we're controlling the
condensation we're controlling the
temperature based on how much liquid
nitrogen off versus when we pour it back
in because there was it wasn't just fill
the pot fill the pot fill the pot if you
do that you're gonna over cool it and it
gets too cold then it doesn't work
anymore
yeah a lot of people that's Travis jang
dong Intel CPU at PAX a couple of years
ago yeah and yeah I watched that where
he has to heat it up with the torch
while he's putting the liquid nitrogen
in it the balance the temperature no the
torch isn't for liquid isn't for
balancing the temperature it's for
creating crystals on the actual inside
of the pot which great creates more
surface area oh that's what it's for so
it's actually getting it colder it's
getting it colder and the thing is if
you pour just a liquid nitrogen inside
of a copper pot then it just boils and
the
temperature here's the thing so I had
the 18 core CPU the Intel CPU so you
know 30 36 threads 18 cores that I had
the ln2 pot on pour the ln2 in and then
it only got down to like 35 C under load
I mean you can hit 35 CL water right are
you following me and you know okay so we
had we had the 18 core 30 36 thread CPU
and and the the ln2 pot on it so it's
just a tower of liquid nitrogen right
yeah just the copper it's copper right
yeah it's copper and then it's insulated
on the outside and then we pour it in
the liquid nitrogen and under load it
would still hit like 30 C 35 see and I
was like really surprised I told my said
why I thought this stuff supposed to go
negative he's like well we didn't
actually flash it yet and like what you
mean flash it like this thing got a BIOS
I was joking around right and he's like
well no he's like now we got to hit with
the torch so what he would do is we
would pour the liquid nitrogen in let
start to boil off and then we hit the
inside of the pot with the torch you can
actually see this in my video where I'm
sticking the torch inside the pot yeah
it's not Travis doing the same thing I
was wearing he was like trying to pull
like add heat to it go in do cool no so
if you look the inside then turns very
crystallized and turns white inside then
which he does you just created basically
like all of these just different jagged
layers of surface that is now increased
the surface area of the actual like pot
itself and he created a better bond
between the actual pot and the
atmosphere so now when you pour in the
liquid nitrogen it actually it actually
absorbs the heat out of the pot better
so then we went Sub Zero once we did
that so that's what we basically used
the liquid nitrogen to build like a heat
sink like a secondary like a bond
between the copper right and the liquid
nitrogen Wow right it was pretty awesome
but the heat gun we had to point a heat
gun at the actual display side of the
video video card like where the display
port was yeah because that section is
extremely sensitive to the the
temperatures so if it got too cold you'd
get no display like your graphics card
might be working fine but the actual
display because the control of the
display would not work so we kept a heat
gun pointed at the at the actual you
know output side of the graphics card to
keep it more closer to room temp so
there's so much actually goes in into L
into overclocking it was it was really
enlightening well I watched Travis
grenade about seven CPUs to get the
world record hmm so when we're at PAX
and his world records already been
beaten again but you know it was with
whatever the current generation of Intel
chip was that just came out at that time
I want to say that it was probably I
think his has well or maybe it might
even been Sandy Bridge it's a long time
ago yeah but but yeah he'd put a CPU and
he'd run it and then like if he if you
let it get too cold it would try it like
and it was done he couldn't use anymore
- wouldn't post we pop it out and stick
another one in there and try again but
ya know watching people do that it's
like it's a lot more people you know
some people think that it's just like oh
pour the liquid nitrogen and fire it up
and go run your benchmark they know
between the torches and babysitting it
and making sure that you're putting in
liquid nitrogen so it never runs out or
ever and then preheating it's not only
the preheating thing yeah but it's not
about pouring and so it never runs out
it's about pouring it in at just the
right speed to keep it at a certain
temperature you pour it in too fast it
gets too cold you don't pour it in fast
enough it heats up too quick and
remember it's very sensitive to the
temperature range at the certain
frequency that it's at so that's why
when I broke the world record at my
studio he was like yeah I set it up he's
like but you vary he's like you
controlled the situation which broke the
record so he was like I told mother yeah
right you technically broke this record
you held my hand he's like no you
controlled the liquid nitrogen he's like
you you earned that record as far as I'm
concerned and then basically he wrote me
an email like like I think was like
three or four weeks later and and Jacob
over at EVGA was like hey Vince says
he's sorry but he has to break your
record cuz because I guess um I guess it
was a gal ax was going after the world
record so Vince was like sorry I got a
break your record now and he did he
broke my record and then well you gotta
hold it for a little time and then the
volta card came out and then just he's
the only person right now that's really
truly like customized volta to be able
to break record and overclock ln2 on the
titan Volta Wow
so a Titan be well somebody say in the
world record was 8.8 gigahertz on the
knee md bulldozer for ellen to guinness
world record yeah yeah i know that
somebody somebody got pretty damn close
to eight or hit eight or something but
see that's one of those things where
it's like it's not about how much
performance you get out of that speed
it's just reaching the speed that
becomes the game you know yeah
well the biggest problem now is CPUs
just aren't that important like we've
had this conversation before about GP
GPUs are literally
thousands of very slow cores that are
very efficient at doing things yeah and
that's what's future generations the
CPAs are gonna be hell even Windows 10
was designed from the ground up to run
on an ARM processor basically to run on
a cell phone right and that's why
Windows 10 runs so good is if you ever
noticed Windows 10 front loads a lot of
stuff it does a lot of look-ahead
caching it does a lot of things to make
sure that you're not waiting on
operations unless they're pure i/o
operations where you're opening
something for the first time that's
never been opened before
everything's been optimized even if
you've opened a file before and you
reboot your computer and boot it back up
you will open that same file again
quicker because what it'll do is it'll
index and page out the memory when
you're shutting down into the page file
so that it knows exactly where to
recover it back into memory into the
cache while you're booting the computer
back up again so Windows has got nightly
clever
I kind of hate that sometimes cuz
there's there's times where like my my
workstation at the at the studio will
start acting really kind of funky yet I
want to do like it just a complete
shutdown and restart the system and the
reboots and brings everything back up
exactly where it was I'm like no I want
you to kind of not do that what you just
dump everything and start over
you used to be able to hold down I
haven't tried in a long time it used to
be I think you hold down the shift-key
if you hold down Shift key while the
computers booting it bypasses all of the
startup options and run key in the H key
local machine run and startup well you
see Jerry that would make too much sense
because even Microsoft turn took off the
safe boot or the say yo you can't even
boot into safe mode in Windows 10
without like a key now no no the way you
booted the safe hood is really stupid
you literally just boot the computer up
and then while it's booting just control
bolete and then it'll try to boot again
hit control it again a half halfway
while it's booting and then after it
fails two times it'll present you with
the menu where you can do it but there's
no way to go into the menu just with f8
anymore they they they stopped that shit
because they didn't want people like
accidentally getting in there
accidentally getting in there which
makes troubleshooting a pain in the ass
it's so stupid I've had to do it on this
computer like three times where I boot
up the computer and I basically have to
fail the startup on purpose just so
it'll let me into the damn options menu
Hobbs will top says if I reboot using
the command line it won't do that
talking about oh so you like shutdown
minus or minus t0 and the command line
yeah J doesn't like the command line cuz
he types really slow you know so he I
type as slow as you drive dude damn good
bird that was a pretty good deal hey
it's no fair
if we both got to drive our own cars on
the track that isn't fair okay like a
blind person could get around the
Nurburgring faster in your car than I
could in mind come on seriously I would
take my I would I would race your STI
and my Z actually that'd be a fit that
would be a fair match I'd take that
action although my car understeers or
under steers like a bitch so I don't
know if I'd want to do that I'm scared
my car you got to commit like a bitch on
a track and I'm kind of scared is enough
doubt it's there's nothing you can tell
me that will make me feel bad for you
because not only do we have the Nissan
challenge we also have the Subaru
challenge all in the same group so we've
got we've got all kinds of Subarus out
there doing grip with us and I see the
way they drive if you're just a pussy
I just gotta set mine up have you ever
been in my car when I tried to go around
a corner pretty fast stuff we do a
straight-line speed no you did some
freeway ramps and in the moist but yeah
it doesn't it just I need to get better
tires on it in the and it's not it's
setup for rally it's not set up for
Street so the thing does want to
understeer really bad on the pavement
and the only way to correct that is to
use the brakes to get the weight to the
front and then get the ass and all kinds
of slippery all over the place and with
the short wheelbase that's really scary
and so when I when I had the zl1 at
Buttonwillow that was the second time I
take it into the track I did four
sessions at chuckwalla just destroyed my
best time I could do in my Z just
absolutely like seven seconds faster
right oh my god on a two minute track so
and that's after you've been out in the
Z's several times on the same track
right yes I had already had like 20
sessions in the Z at that track because
I know what it's like to get used to a
new car and you didn't have a lot of
time to even really get used to that mix
without with me Nick went out with me in
the first session on the zl1 I didn't go
out there and warm up I just went out
there and was like Leroy Jenkins I mean
yeah so anyway took that took the car
with a Buttonwillow
and I drove the first two sessions solo
my driving instructor was Steven Doherty
was was coaching someone else and so I
was like shit that's gonna be
interesting going out learning that
learning the the lines in this car on
this track in this direction that had
never driven before and with by myself
so I brought him out did that and then I
did like really shitty I did like a 209
and then like a two
six right then he I gave him the keys to
the car and for session three and I'm
sorry session three he coached me and
when you have a coach it's like you're
faster but you're still spend a lot of
time kind of waiting for the instruction
like you want their feedback and so you
kind of drive inherently slower because
you're kind of absorbing information and
then the next session you really just go
and apply it just like dervish right and
so I let him drive the fourth session
because I wanted to see what the car was
capable of and of course he did like a
158 with traffic has he never driven one
before was that the first time so so we
did it we did a 25-minute session and it
was really eye-opening as I watched him
just like each lap like kind of analyze
what the car was doing and what he wants
it to do and he's kind of learning a car
he had never been in before and then
watched him Jake just flip a switch in
his brain and literally I was sitting
there like practically shitting my pants
with the way he drives but here's the
best thing I the session before that he
coached me then I watched him apply what
he was coaching me and then the fourth
session I'm sorry the fifth session the
bonus session I just went out and
dropped like another four seconds off my
time down to a 201 so I'm from a 209 go
to one in the same day and a track had
never driven in a car I'd only been on
track in a different track with so it's
impressive but what I want at the point
of this story is the car that I was
battling the entire time was a fully
built Hawkeye STI oh wow literally it
was a Hawkeye STI that he and I were at
the 204 205 second range we're just
literally up each other's ass right I'd
point him by because I'm like okay I
know I don't want to hold you back
then as soon as I point him by suddenly
it's like my intensity goes up then I'm
riding up his ass and he points me by
because he's like dude get off my ass so
we're just like leapfrogging around the
track every few every few laps were past
like a built time attack car that's got
like diffuser on the back giant wing no
not not to that lawyers it's actually he
actually does all surface it's like all
surface racing calm or something like
that and so he does this car set up for
multiple things like they'll set up
they'll set up for grip the point is at
the 204 205 range he and I were battling
like crazy after seeing after after
going out with Doherty and then just
sending it
like yeah there wasn't even a
competition anymore because I dropped
like another four seconds off my time
and then but my point is I have seen
what these Subarus are capable of so
your argument holds no water except for
the fact that you are set up for loo
surface and I weigh 320 pounds so a
passenger with me every session well I
have a passenger with me when I don't
have a passenger with me dude you make
it sound like I'm light I am NOT light
it is a Torquay car though I'll give you
that no come on be my bottle or my money
I am NOT that light I sit in chairs and
they go oh I still I would love I would
love to get out on a track with you one
because I'd pretty much go and do it no
one I was gonna lose cuz I've seen the
way you drive you've got me dead to
rights on pavement you've got me dead to
rights on the simulator um but just
after me spanking you into the dirt I
only think it'd be fair for you to just
completely destroy me on the track
someday yeah so we got we got to make
that happen I guess I'm gonna come down
there we get a car I gotta tell you
offline when I'm going back to their
fish oh you are it's for its it's for a
completely different sanctioning body
but they're working with your fish Oh
interesting yeah interesting well let me
know when you're doing that and I can
put you up here if you want yeah they'd
be fun I think I think I want to get
bullier out there too yeah I'd be happy
just come hang out I don't got to do
shit I just want to come hang out and
watch you do your thing the thing is
it's gonna be the all-wheel drive stuff
which is you know I'm gonna be lost off
so no no you know you're gonna be
surprised on is the BR Z's you had to
carry your speed everywhere
yeah the Subarus no the Subarus you
literally just square turned sideways
out of the corner punch of the floor on
your pin to the seat I mean they get
such good dry night when I told my
instructor that I'm gonna need some I'm
gonna need some instructing to prepare
for this event because it is a bit of a
race yeah he said would you need to
learn as the zero counter method and I
was like zero counter method he's like
yeah basically you get the car rotate
you point the wheel and you just hit the
gas which is exactly what you said where
I used to counter steering and he's like
you don't counter steer with the
all-wheel drive no so nope the trick
with the trick with the Subarus you
literally go to the outside of the
corner you don't aim for the apex you go
to the outside of the corner so that you
come out of it with the longest possible
straightaway you can get yeah and you
get the car sideways and you just slide
sideways majestically until you're
about lined up with where you want to go
and I swear as soon as you hit that gas
pedal that car just sinks down into the
dirt about an inch or two yeah
comes to a complete stop laterally and
just bolt straight especially with the
rally tires they're there they're
designed to bite with light or with the
side of the tire yeah the the grip of
tires even the ones that were on our B
or Z's were pretty grippy but again we
only had rear-wheel drive when you have
the front pulling and the back pushing
and you got all that and you got a brand
new set of tires on there with a really
sharp edges on the grip of tread holy
crap man they hook in the dirt like you
like like a normal car would on undone
good pavement but like shitty pavement
you know you actually do get a decent
amount of traction like way more than
you'd think I guarantee you when you get
it you're gonna be like wow on the
backstretch I could hit almost 90 miles
an hour in the Subaru yeah when we were
out there you know that big long
straight over we're doing the slalom yep
you can hit 90 in the Subaru or the BRZ
we were struggling to hit like 45 50
mm-hmm so it's it's a completely
different game dude you're gonna love it
my Subarus steer great in the dirt like
they oversteer or understeer like shit
on pavement and the dirt they're awesome
Alvaro says are you talking about tech
or what we just spent like 45 minutes
talking about a sick miners and CPUs and
stuff and you're gonna come in here and
bitch read an IPC's Jesus read that read
the chat if you're wondering woods
Jubilo salty you were warned you're
gonna get publicly ridiculed be coming
here and ask for the tech is so take
your thumb out your ass turn off your
device and go to school there anyway
need to do is come up a day early before
the event so that we can get one of the
instructors up there to take you out and
apparently it was Nate that tossed that
told them about me
so okay yeah Nate Nate is a great
instructor names amazing result they
just did it a weekend thing last last
weekend you have something where they
basically did ride along with Mitch and
ride alone with Nate and they had in-car
cameras and stuff holy shit Nate can
drive him oh no I've been I've been on a
hot lap with three of instructors
they're forests of Lucy he's not there
anymore now he's uh now he works on one
of the crazy GRC rally drivers guys crew
although I don't know if you heard but
GRC got cancelled yeah so that that
sucks because a lack of money and
interest but I was in a hot lap with him
I did one with Don Wooten when he was
there and I did one with Nate and I have
to say that out of the three Nate was
the fastest yeah like
he's properly crazy a little bit
impersonal sideways they had in-car
cameras and they were showing Nate's
navigator and and like the level of
focus on Nate's face when the Navigator
is calling I was like he's like just
he's like wide-eyed and just looks like
stone cold you know I mean and he's fast
even in a slow car Nate drives like
these sobs and shit like these old shit
buckets he was driving an old Volvo
hopeful I know why I'm red Run 1 yeah
yeah yeah so so he always buys these
little cheap I swear to God he doesn't
spend $1,000 on the car and then puts
all the gear into it to run but he takes
these things out there and the thing is
just wrapped out off the top end the
entire time like he does not slow down
yeah he just he just drives that thing
like he stole it but no he's eid be a
great one to have like sit down before
you do any kind of race and give you
some tips and plus he's bulletproof like
you put him in the passenger seat like
unless the car is like upside down and
flipping over the top of a river he's
just like sitting over there chill yeah
well it was that did you ever see the
video where I swear I was in the
warehouse and I'm driving the car the
the drone video I did where I'm inside
the warehouse driving the rally car and
I come out and I spin the car yeah
cameraman runs on the cameraman fell
down yeah he was sitting in the
passenger seat he closed his eyes just
to fuck with me no cheese he said he
said because we're gonna ready to take
off whatever he's like I'm just gonna
close my eyes he leans back in the chair
to close his eyes and he didn't open
them so if you watch the video he's like
sitting over there snoozing that's funny
yeah yeah I really want to get back up
there and do the rear wheel drive school
again only because of how much my skills
have improved in terms of just getting
the car sideways on pavement yeah I
would really love to do it again in dirt
I'm sure the suit the Super's do get
squirrely in the back end though they're
not I mean if you get on the gas they
straighten out pretty easily but they
they you can still get those things
sliding around really good yeah and it
much higher speeds that's the other
thing you might appreciate about it is
that the BRZ seemed like they would
slide sideways at ten miles an hour like
like nothing the Subarus you got to put
a lot more into him to get him unsettled
so it's a lot more high adrenaline like
I would have to say that when I went out
there I was expecting to be R Z's to be
a lot more dramatic than they were it's
like you actually had time to think and
the Subarus your your white-knuckled and
a lot of the shit that you're doing out
there yeah it's in and I've seen him run
a BRZ against the Subaru and I mean the
Subaru could lap the damn thing you
might here says this would be different
I'm seeing a bunch of people say I look
disinterested when you're talking
what they don't realize is when I'm
looking off to the side this way I'm
actually looking at Jerry's camera it's
that way so I'm looking at Jerry when
he's talking you dumbasses
anyway oh my god what is it always got
to be mean and try to create drama I
don't get that yeah I don't get that the
entire internet just has been on a kick
lately wanted just if they can't find
drama they created dude the zl1 was so
fun on tracted I was I was those first
two sessions I was basically going into
the garage like with our race group was
like hey who wants a ride-along anyone
want to ride a lot someone needs to come
out and feel this thing because I might
just come back and tell you how good it
is you'll be like no I know it's a
Camaro anyone who went out with me came
back going holy shit what
WTF dude I'm Cup I'm coming down to do
it died no I know I can't do it close to
Mother's Day but the next track that you
do after that let me know right we're
gonna be going on lunch break and lunch
break summer summer break until like
September I think and even then I don't
think I'm gonna go in September because
it's big willow November is the one
you're gonna want to go to that that's
chuckwalla okay although although button
will be a lot more fun because we get a
lot more speed in that card but well
then we do chuckwalla oh just got a nice
long straight chuckwalla has several of
them it also has a lot of elevation
changes it also has blind elevation
changes high-speed s's and oh shit high
speed straight that's we're basically
doing about 130 miles an hour into a non
banked 90-degree left-hand turn with
enough speed to get back up to 130 again
before we take a nice sweeping left-hand
turn into about a hundred mile per hour
right-hander that you slowed down to
about 30 miles an hour so you go from
about a hundred to 30 while trail
braking into what they call off ramp and
then again into a full throttle exit
into what they call cotton corners which
is like a chicane that again has an off
has an off camber elevation change
coming out of it into a into a flat
right-hander so there's a lot of
opportunity for you to just drive off
track Wow yeah is there a lot of run out
or is it a pretty oh yeah you're not
gonna hit nothing in Buttonwillow unless
you get really stupid on the last turn
on clockwise going into the start
finished and there's a wall there yeah
other than that yeah next time you come
up here I'll take out to the ridge you
haven't been out to our tracks we have
to hear we got Pacific raceways and we
got the ridge yeah
they're both they're both within an hour
hour and a half of me and I'll tell you
what the ridge has a corkscrew turned
just like Laguna Seca they actually
modeled it after Laguna second oh cool
so in this so it's I think it's only
it's one of the only other tracks in the
United States has a corner like this and
it's the same blind come over the tip
aim for the trees because you can't see
the track anymore because it falls that
hard yeah
and it's it's a lot of fun but there's
tons run out that's why I like so I'd
even be comfortable let you drive my
Subaru out on that track it's like the
shit off the road you just go out into a
big dirt field that's that's the only
thing you're gonna do shucks wall is a
lot like that too cuz it's in the desert
it's just yeah you just run off into a
lot of fine dirt you know but yeah Chuck
Wallace check all the so my favorite
tracks to momentum track so it's just
about keeping your momentum through the
turns Buttonwillow is a rhythm track so
if you get out of sequence and
Buttonwillow then you really kind of
screw up the next two or three turns
yeah
but I I'll have to show you on my PDR
which is the performance data recorder
so it's the the camera and telemetry
built into my car we're coming out of
the esses and Buttonwillow i curbed a
little bit too hard on the left side so
it upset the car at a hundred and ten
miles per hour you see me do a 30-degree
counter steer at 110 with the back end
of the car coming sideways coming out of
the esses my coach or my instructor he
didn't tell me till later that he
practically shit at brick because he's
like at 110 in the passenger side
feeling the car go come like just
completely come off the ground on the
back end and then it was at that moment
even though he's coached me now for an
entire year and a half it was at that
moment where he finally he said he felt
100% comfortable with getting in the car
with me when I'm really trying to send
it because he realized at that moment
that I'm on top of it because the
counter-steer just came so natural I
didn't even realize it happened until we
looked at the footage that's funny so so
basically he didn't even think you were
gonna be able to catch it no it was he I
asked him that and he basically was like
no it's just us the passenger you had
that split-second of wondering like is
he gonna catch it cuz the thing is we're
over steering at that point towards a
wall that's only about 30 feet away yeah
well I'll tell you what next time you go
to dirt fish ask me why why he lets me
why he lets me drive with one hand
mm-hmm cuz that's that's that's like a
bad rule there yeah it's a derp face
you're always supposed to have your
hands on the wheel you only take your
hand off the wheel to shift and then
back to the wheel right
but I'm driving I'm all like you know
like yes my belt my belly's in the way
right so I'm always like doing the same
well there's more than a couple times
Nate and I were out there where I was
like on the third day doing the
high-speed shit through the woods where
I was getting dangerously close spinning
going into the river and I kept just
magically saving the car because my
instincts are just like this way and I
give this shit back he's just like
whatever just keep doing it like it
seems to work for you whatever it was
pretty funny cuz like from there on out
all the classes that I did there the
instructors were all like no no it's
cool that's a bad habit but you seem you
seem to do a lot better with it so we're
just gonna go ahead and let's keep doing
it yeah no I don't think I'd get away
with that shit on pavement I was a
better way I was scared when I okay so
the first session with the zl1 like full
transparency my car cost seventy three
thousand dollars it is not a cheap car I
make like I make monthly payments on
that I can't afford to just go buy that
car with cash so I'm going okay I got a
car payment insurance isn't gonna cover
that thing if it gets fucked up and yes
of course there is track insurance but
it's like $400 a session or a $400 a
track day I'm like you know quickly that
I'll head up you know it's a little
cheaper than having to pay your pay your
car off yeah I don't get it but anyway
that first session it's just like okay
here we go cuz it's not just me it's not
just what am i able to do with the car
am I gonna hit something am I gonna go
off it's it's time what people gonna
choose is someone gonna hit me
am I gonna slow down for the high speed
braking zone and the guy behind me
sudden he's got no brakes you know what
I mean because that's that's rates
aren't as good as yours right did you
die fucking epic brakes and stinky tires
what if the dude buying just like in a
golf doing a buck 10 with like you know
BC drum brakes but you see anyway what
I'm about to say anyone in chat who does
HP de or time attack won't we'll know is
you don't Jam the brakes you you don't
you don't drive into the braking zone
super hot and then just jam the brakes
because that upsets the car it's it's
it's a it's a squeeze and a slow release
with the brakes so I've been behind
people that suddenly are just jamming on
the brakes and I'm like holy shit why
are you over slowing the car like this
because they they're they get scared
going into that turn they're not
comfortable trail braking or maybe the
car just isn't very good at trail
braking like the Z is terrible at trail
braking and wants to spin when you do it
it's not about how much can you jam on
the brakes in the turns but how
move can you transition from from
acceleration to deceleration into
turning and the zl1 is actually great at
it because it's braking bias is so good
it loves to trail brakes so I can carry
a lot of that speed and bleed a lot of
it off with the turn rather than the
brakes so it's just about transitioning
that momentum forward on the front
wheels to keep them from under steering
squeezing off the brakes slowly as I'm
turning the wheel and then so I've got a
little bit trail braking and I've got
just momentum and the lateral G's
slowing down the car and then easing
onto the throttle coming out of it cuz
the other thing with the zl1 is if you
just even with the tire is heated up you
just mash the gas that you're kind of
fucked the car wants to go around even
right even with the tire is at full temp
in track mode with the trash control set
to race which is the least amount of
intervention possible when you watch my
PDR you see that you see the traction is
stability light coming on constantly
just constantly coming on even have 100
miles per hour in a straight line you'll
see the traction control light come on
because it's trying to spin the tire
it's at 100 miles that's where wheel
driving 700 horsepower there ain't
nothing that's gonna put that power down
unless you're doing 100 miles an hour
yeah well you'll see there's times where
we're doing 100 and or even 130 you'll
see the traction light come on yeah I
know the Dodge Charger Hellcat that I
drove him we were doing 80 on the
freeway and he stopped it to the ground
of the traction control was going Paul
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah look at it was
still breaking the tires loose but I
didn't figure your car would do that
with all the downforce my car doesn't
have that much downforce it just doesn't
make a lot of lift oh really oh for some
reason I thought that the Camaro had
like crazy downforce only 300 it only
300 pounds of rear downforce with that
spoiler at 155 that's not a lot of
that's nothing the thing is not the
thing is the splitter and stuff on the
car are so functional it actually
creates a very little lift
so yeah let's put it this way yeah guys
car talk deal with it so if we are
dealing with a car that it lets a lot of
air under the front of the car right
it's gonna pick up the more air cushion
you have under a car the more it's gonna
push up on the car so let's say you make
500 pounds of downforce but you got 250
pounds of lift you've got affected with
250 5 250 pounds of downforce right the
thing with this car is it makes
practically zero lift at speech all the
downforce is usable
enforce it so what you really notice in
the terms is sort of in terms of
breaking stability in high speed
cornering is the fact that the air cut
cushion under the car is not fighting
you it's super nose but like the zi
disease got functional arrow with the
Nismo but the zi feels like it has a ton
of lift versus the camaro oh wow yeah so
does the camaro have like the full
underbody plating that makes it like
completely flat underneath only the
front half of the car and then the sides
there's there's there's skid not skid
pans but they're flat covers okay on
each side of the of the tunnel where the
drive shaft is and then it stops in
front of the back wheels behind it it's
just a standard diffuser Oh interesting
okay yeah okay so a lot of the modern
cars they're like doing the full
underbody coating area of like drop the
whole pan out but you move the whole
front of the car especially from the
front axles forward is completely skid
pan and Aero pant with splitters and
stuff and the thing is if you look under
the front splitter in front of the front
tires out to show you picture and you
guys you find these I these online
actually if you look at pictures of the
zl1 one alley and underneath the car in
front of the front tires there are
actually channels that curve the air to
the side of the car so the air that cut
makes it underneath the front of the car
never even hits the front of the wheel
it gets scooped out to the side but in
front of the wheel so the air is not
even being upset by the by the rotation
of the tire and that flat surface of the
tire is not hitting the oh I see it's
coming in the one that's going out it's
going out the sides like this exactly
that probably keeps the car pretty
stable at high speeds too right because
that's gonna help keep it centered well
I could say it feels pretty damn stable
and the only way to know is to take them
off and then do the same thing but I
really don't want to all right be honest
what's the fastest you've had the car up
in a straight line come on I don't
really I don't really want to say come
on come on man
III told ya I said I said publicly I got
my car up to 167 okay well I haven't
been that fast in my car because I don't
have any long open roads like you do
here but I will tell you this from one
from getting on the freeway
yeah to the next exit I did 155 and the
next exit and the next exit is like uh
2/3 of a mile so no not even a half mile
so it's just over a quarter mile the car
does 124 that quarter what do you say
your car weight again what's that what's
the kerb weight 3,800 and change so 30
Anders so you're 400 pounds heavier than
me and you've got over twice the
horsepower whoa I'm like I'm like 580
ish crank all right now I'm sorry not
crank wheel I'm that's true because mine
is wheel cuz I did the dyno thing so if
you're 580 wheel and I'm so I'm about
three thirty three horsepower wheel yeah
so so yeah okay so so not not quite
double but still for 400 pounds I mean
your power per ton is massively higher
than mine right and the aerodynamics of
my car improved over yours yeah plus
your your rear wheel drive wow you have
that much drivetrain loss it's about 15%
actually that doesn't sound too bad
Wow just it's just hard to think of that
cuz like it's 700 horsepower you
wouldn't think that you'd be down you
know 150 horsepower well means 15% so
700 times 0.85 right I mean that's 595
G's okay so my goal is my goals with the
car and and that was the biggest
complaint people had in the car the car
video is like you say stage 1 and stage
2 but you don't say what those are and I
don't know this isn't Need for Speed
wave stage it's like they're
legitimately called stages but anyway
stage one is the the there's different
stage ones it depends on the tuner you
go at the state Stage one is basically
simple stuff like an intake B and the
intake makes a huge difference on these
cars because they're extremely baffled
to make the supercharger silent which
affects flow big-time but my particular
stage one is the the rota fab intake the
port at throttle body from mamuh
motorsports which is basically like an
ARP port or a RP
yah-hey or whatever Tony Mamo did the
port and then there was something
there's there was a defect in my car
that kind of followed over from the
previous gens where do you know anything
about route style or to chargers yeah
yeah okay yep
so you know the the blow-off valve
flashed recirc valve is built into the
manifold itself yeah there is a there is
a spring in us in a set screw that are
designed to you know let them open up
under certain pressure so
the pressure overcomes the spring it
opens up it bleeds off whatever excess
psi so my car is supposed to make like
ten pounds of boost I was only seeing
7.5 pounds and I'm like what the hell is
going on here
so I I found a threat on Gen 6 or a
Camaro 6 calm about how the lot of these
set screws were set too far in which was
keeping that that waste or not waste
gate but that recirc valve yeah
slightly open all the time so you're
never hitting your booth I was never
hitting my max boost I went in there
adjusted it backed it off to where it's
supposed to be went out and tested it
immediately saw 10 pounds of boost and
now anytime I hit I go full throttle at
70 miles an hour on the freeway I leave
black patches on the ground because I
spin the tires at 70 miles an hour so
that alone I don't know how much power
it made up for but I could tell that
something wasn't right because my car
always ran ridiculously rich stupid rich
like you could almost see unburned
flu of fuel just spinning out of the
tailpipe when I would rip because it was
accounting for that fuel but though it
was accounting for the air that wasn't
there right so as soon as I adjusted
that my tailpipe start stopped turning
liquidy black and the power went through
the roof so that's awesome just make
sure you don't pull it back it off so
much that you're running lean because
running lean you back it up you back it
off too far then it just the wastegate
opens later and the tune is all jacked
up so all I did was back it off so that
when the the spring is completely like
under its own tension yeah to where the
setscrew is like a papers a paper
thickness off of it which is the way
it's supposed to be you know I'm really
surprised that that thing doesn't have
an electronics Illinois operates
mechanical that's that's interesting I
mean I mean that's that's how they used
to be done but it's like now everybody
uses the boost still annoyed because hmm
kishna says yawn when you kids hit 8 140
to 160 let me know is that as fast as
you can go if so that I'm sorry I'm
sorry that's all you got dude yeah my
car at 167 it's it's done it won't it
doesn't want to go no more
but at 167 my car also turns into a
single-engine Cessna so my car my party
top speed is drag limited at 190 yeah I
guarantee you my car at 167 feels a lot
more scary than
jiae's card 190 whatever like I
guarantee it his car 190 is probably
just like cruising straight as arrow
down the road really connected to the
pavement my Subaru no my Subaru is like
literally feeling like it's doing this
play it's pretty scary yeah well yeah I
think you you were in and when I did
think it did 140 140 or 145 I can't
remember it was 145 and we had the
windows down I thought my rear window
was gonna blow out need the press wes CH
says H&amp;amp;K kishna
HNN kishna not everyone has a car that
can do 140 so stuff sound like a badass
my ultimate did 140 so I mean do my
Corolla did 115 and it was bouncing off
the rev limiter but with the turbo I got
there really fast DME de Metz it says
gear limited as well yeah he's true
that's one of the days right that's one
of the differences with my 6-speed
manual versus the standard Zeile 116
manual is I have a shorter sixth gear so
that it can pull it better cool with the
additional downforce in the shorter
sixth gear is why the standard zl1 is
actually faster in us in the top speed
than my car and the truth is I mean
there's like a handful of tracks in the
world were you Dever achieve that top
speed and actually gain a noticeable
advantage yeah like you're not you're I
mean you got what is chuckwalla like
what's the top speed you've been on that
track me date I logged it to see what
your top speed is out there which track
what's your fastest track faster but
will is the Buttonwillow but we're like
129 130 is as far as week as fast as we
can get in the straight but if you look
at the if you look at the video that
gets not a very long straight see I'd
love to see what you're carding it out
at the ridge cuz the ridges got almost a
mile straight at the bottom oh wow
so in the mile straight my car before I
break to the corner I hit just about 140
in the Subaru so in the in the in the
GTRs we're flying by me like halfway
down the track GTRs are going by me like
I'm standing still yeah so I'd be
surprised cuz your car your car is
faster than GTR stock let's talk GTR
yeah yeah so oh yeah not the dismal
wants stupid expensive anyways anybody
actually buy one of those like yeah what
I've seen them at the track I've seen a
few of em at the track actually aren't
there's no like invisible version like
40 grand more or something it's like
just a little bit more motor than
thousand fucking a man buy that just buy
the stock one and like put put 50 grand
into it
we'll be ten times the car yeah it's oh
my god I don't get it you know the thing
the thing about cars dad and Ike I swear
to God I feel like I'm such a minority
why can't people just be like that cool
car you know why do people always have
to be like book your card rather have a
Yatta Yatta it's like no one really
cares about what you'd rather have I'm
serious
no one cares about what someone else
would rather have see the thing is it's
like PC there are so many different
options out there yeah there's always
gonna be something for you and something
that's not for you it's just it's the
entitled little shits that constantly
feel like they've got to go out there
and tell everyone about how they don't
want this and they don't want that and
they don't like this and you don't like
that no one gives a shit what you don't
like no one gives a shit no one gives a
shit what I don't like no one gives a
shit which you don't like Jerry I sure
as shit don't give a shit what you don't
like and vice-versa
why can't the rest of the world be like
all cars I like all cars even shitty
cars like I have had some of the most
fun in my life driving my old
piece-of-shit 1976 Ford career that
thing couldn't go 55 miles an hour down
the freeway I'll tell you what if you
found a dirt road you could jump that
thing Dukes of Hazzard style and not
give three shit job you jump the frickin
like medium with me in the car when you
pick me up from the airport we were
booking yeah when we clip that thing oh
my god okay if you guys this was short
this was a few years ago like the second
time I'd ever been in a Jerry's house
and this was like right after Jerry had
made the transition from like his
lowered height ride height and stuff and
he raised the car and got it all set up
for dirt because you're getting ready to
do like the the the dirt fish thing
where they were like bring your own car
and go and run right yeah yeah add the
underbody plating and raised up yeah so
he picks me up from the airport and
Jerry is not what you would call a slow
driver he's a lot like me he's like he
drives his car like like it's like he's
having fun yeah right he's not being
like really stupid although this stories
might sound like he's being really
stupid but yeah I'll admit that was a
little much so he's that guy that's like
the first time I ever rode with him was
like okay I'm probably gonna die on this
trip you know but then I got to know no
Jerry is driving like okay Jerry Jerry
is not incompetent behind the wheel so I
started getting little bit more
comfortable and I'm on my phone like
looking at Twitter and stuff we're
leaving Seattle
getting on the freeway and there's a
merging Lane that has to merge left and
there's a bunch of traffic there Jerry
decides he doesn't have to it isn't
wanna wait for traffic so he just
decides to focus full throttle down the
merge lane into the shoulder and I'm
looking at this going we're literally
about to drive off the freeway what the
hell is happening here I look up but I
don't even react I'm just like okay I'm
sure he knows what he's doing there's
like a little berm at the end of the
road right there like where it merged
over it's it's just like the rough soft
shoulder it's like a little berm and
then a ditch underneath it Jerry freakin
launched it off the berm and landed it
on the freeway and cleared the whole
ditch I'm like what the hell did I just
experience I like cutting out yeah we
went into the dirt and just kind of
cross yeah but you jump like you jumped
in first you you cleared like the dip we
didn't even go into the did you didn't
feel the ditch like we were we went
right over it like glass yeah no that
that car that car can handle a beating
and and my and my biggest shock was just
how like smooth it took it yeah you know
the person behind us was like shitting a
brick - oh yeah I'm sure I'm sure it's
like they look like Thelma Louise let's
be on because they were trying to out
accelerate us they did it they could
tell we were trying to get in front of
them so yeah oh yeah well show them or
whatever and I was like ah fuck indeed
I'll take in the dirt I don't care it's
it's it's a dirt car we can do this you
can you can always tell any area do a
high speed run with Jerry cuz he'll
he'll look in the mirror and see there's
anyone behind him go Connie look out
ahead of him and then he'll just stop
talking and then you hear
and then Jerry kind of gets like this
much more intense like look on the wheel
and then he just he did you know you're
gonna go fast cuz jury stops talking to
be got my attention increases by a huge
magnitude when I'm going really fast
like I I don't I I can't just sit there
and do like 140 miles an hour and have a
conversation with you like I'm focused
on beer and shit jumping out in front of
me so the biggest the biggest thing I
just the reason why I'm just like
talking about how why do people is that
the shit on other people's cars and this
now I guess it's because most of these
people mostly people don't even have the
car they would rather have like they're
like oh that car sucks I'd rather have
the audio the point is you probably
don't have anything to brag about anyway
but the that's why I don't like the show
car crowd that's why I don't like a lot
of a lot of these like society is just
like okay I Z will never have a society
sticker stuff like that on there because
these people just do nothing but talk
down others to talk their car up when
you go to the track when you're with the
track crowd nobody talk shit to each
other nobody comes over and is like oh
well I've got that 911 GTS over there so
your Camaro is a big pile of shit no
they'll come over and be like yeah I got
that 911 GTS over there you really shock
the shit out of me what is this you know
what I mean they they don't they don't
just American piece of shit I mean
you've got there you've got the little
racing clubs and they all kind of hang
out but I can't even tell you like how
many gt350r and GT 350 owners had come
over to me and been like dude I've heard
I've seen these but I've never seen one
in person this is badass I'm like yeah
what do you got no I got the 350 R I'm
like dude let's go look at your car and
we'll just sit there and just and talk
and compare and never sit there and just
put each other down that is why I love
the racing crowd that's that's what I'm
more addicted to at the track than the
actual driving is just getting to see so
many of these cars that you only read
about and you only hear about you see on
top gear and and the Grand Tour
and you get to see them in their element
which is why so many people come over to
me with the zl1 and they're like wow
you're actually tracking it that's
awesome because that's what the car was
built for you know and when I was at
that Buttonwillow there was a guy there
that had a blue one and he came over and
was talking to me and we were kind of
comparing like driving style were like
how we found it does this it's better
under this could I ask oh I'm gonna try
that and then we actually improved on
each other's times by just talking to
each other about the car
like what we've experienced you know so
that's different Street people that are
passionate about cars and passionate
about cars and driving yeah like if
you're passionate about driving like
anybody else I'll even racecar drivers
will say it's challenging as fuck to get
like a Mazda mx-5 around a track but
they still want to do it because dude
challenging Jerry I'm kid you not you
can find the comment on my video the zl1
there's a guy that legit was like this
car sucks I'd rather have a 4 5 a to
tell you it's like what the fuck is
wrong with you you just took a car that
it's like five times more expensive and
said you'd rather have that than mine
you sure shit better want that more than
mine if that's what you - you should
reply back to have been like oh I want a
Bugatti what's the new one does oh not
the Veyron the new one by which time out
the Chiron Chiron it just fucking one-up
each other each comment yeah I don't get
people like that but I know I even in
driving matters like when I went out for
my track day at the radio is my first
time ever on a track right in my Subaru
they don't but did anyone make you feel
bad no not at all everybody was like
super super inviting but I had a guy in
a freaking Honda CRX just fucked me up
like mm-hmm
dude I'd lose him on the straightaway
I'm like yeah I got that guy and then
after like three turns he'd be right on
my ass Knight had over let him by so
they wouldn't flag me are you ready for
then I'd catch him on the straightaway
go blow by him and then I would even
make it to turns he'd be back up my ass
dad Letterman from hey hey I'm not I'm
not ashamed to admit this in my zl1 1le
I pointed by a yellow Civic GX or an ATX
but a hatch a civic a yellow civic hatch
that was not boosted guys are just crazy
because raiven to limit right because it
was driver versus driver it wasn't Honda
versus Camaro very true very true anyway
on that note guys it's time to go thanks
for hanging out with us today if you
guys are joining us late it wasn't all
car talk we actually talked a lot about
a sick mining we talked about what's
changing with etherium I even told you
guys we could find a 1080 TI at at MSRP
la ln2 records we talked about that one
- we talked about CPU instructions per
clock versus cycles and bitch megahertz
and megahertz to talk about it many
hours yeah
so there was obviously some tech in this
one but thanks for putting up with this
show today because I am at home
obviously and we were having some
technical difficulties as you can see we
are out of sync and all
but we figured either deal with this or
get no show so I'm glad you decided to
do the show today I'd fun yes fun I also
I'm wondering why we have 2488 people in
here and only 398 likes I mean what is
yeah what the fuck guys I mean it people
you all you do is click a button I mean
what do we have to do to incentivize the
button click crush the like crush the
like crush the like crush the light that
doesn't look like you're crushing the
like it looks like you're loving the
like my posture own objection
testosterone e alright I'm gonna run
that out true and then I'm gonna go I'm
gonna go buff some pain again that's not
a euphemism sounds good I am gonna
Boston pain that as a euphemism the
outros already oh thank you for watching
59 and we did talk about tech if you
guys are wondering and some cars because
their technology to you guys all have a
nice Thursday night I'm gonna go to the
gym is that a no really sale is that a
new restaurant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
