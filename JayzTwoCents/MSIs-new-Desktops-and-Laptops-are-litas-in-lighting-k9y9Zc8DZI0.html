msi and the newsie 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
so msi has actually got two new desktop
systems that are fully built systems
ready to go that we're taking a look at
here at CES now the first one here is
the ages x3 it's pretty unique because
both of the assistant our proprietary
their proprietary motherboard layouts
and the way that they are built is
specifically from the ground up so
that's the first unique thing we're
talking about here they didn't just take
components off the shell put it together
and put their label and their sticker on
a case and call it a day no these are
built from the ground but now the aegis
x3 here it's very small it's a very
small form factor here I don't have the
exact dimensions but trust me when I say
it's not that much bigger than maybe a
box you buy shoes in this is very very
small but it has a pretty unique design
we're taking to chamber design so air
cooling or air flow is very well thought
out on this the power supply is
separated from the motherboard and the
graphics card and it has air flow here
on the top on the rear its i really wish
i can give you guys like a whole
breakdown of this maybe we'll see if we
can do that in the future but heat is
the thing that you have to control in
gaming systems and it's even harder when
you do it in small form factors so this
one's really well thought out but maybe
you want the best that they have some
awful that's going to be BTW i three
right here again you can see we've got
water cooling on this guy here so it's a
little bit bigger than this one
obviously but it's much more narrow than
a standard desktop because you don't
have to account for the height of the
graphics card this one actually has a
graphics card mounted vertical in the
top chamber now this is the three
chamber design here where the graphics
card has its own dedicated cooling area
the motherboard has its own dedicated
cooling area and the power supply is
separate as well so you don't have any
of those temperatures kind of mixing and
contaminating each other you can
specifically control the temperatures
based on the component not only that
this system right here has two gtx 1080s
in there so there's plenty of room for
sli and the air flow on this comes in
through the front through a one
20 millimeter pin you've got to exhaust
fans here bringing all right off the top
you also have these vents here that kind
of direct the air flow backwards instead
the heat coming up in radiating on your
face area long gaming session it's not
comfortable been there done that it's
going to push it towards the back of the
system which is huge and the cool thing
here is all the LED systems that you see
on this are not only controllable via
motherboard for also controllable by
your smartphone so no longer do you have
to deal with like all the RGB is
flashing you can set it up however you
want I mean maybe you need something
smaller than this well that's where
notebooks come in okay now I know what
you're thinking notebooks nobody wants
no pitch that's not true trust me I'm
one of those guys that appreciates a
good powerful notebook especially when
I'm on the go and if it's strong enough
and has a strong enough processor in
there to give you good rendering
capability if you're doing content
creation or pro workflows and it's got a
whole lineup here of Pascal GPUs because
now that we've got some performance low
power low temperature graphics options
the notebook now is better than it's
ever been if you ask me one of the
things that's actually really difficult
about controlling heat in a notebook is
air flow but if we take a look at the
bottom of this guy here you can see the
entire bottom of the notebook is vented
I mean the entire thing is meant it and
because of that the weight is actually
very low you would look at this guy and
you would think that it's heavy but it's
not it's a little bit on the thicker
side but because that it's actually very
very light and travel friendly it is a
17 inch display and it's got everything
that you come to expect it it's got a
GTX 1080 in there it's be are ready it's
got Thunderbolt it's got SD slots the
only day actually doesn't have as an
optical drive which I was kind of
disappointed to see but I think we've
kind of gone the way to where that's a
bit archaic but I will be doing a full
review on this guy as well consider CES
my first view our first official field
test when it comes to notebooks and of
course we playing some games we have to
play some games on it alright guys
that's going to wrap up my msi coverage
here at CES 2017 don't worry the things
we took a look at here we will be doing
some in-depth reviews at hands on
back at the studio after the show
everything I've showed you here so far
though we're looking at a q1 2017 lunch
so as always with CES we get to see the
stuff early got away a little bit to see
what actually comes to market maybe once
again a huge thank you to my supporters
for this trip msi of course is my
official motherboard partner for CES
2017 and big EVGA once again for sending
us here our trust in graphics partner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
