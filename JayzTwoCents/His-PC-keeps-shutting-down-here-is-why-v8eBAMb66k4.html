real computer behind me with a real
problem that we are going to fix right
now for real
with its unique freeform modular system
the new master case maker 5 from
Coolermaster allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description the reason why I put all
those four reels on there is it's hard
to teach you guys how to fix computer
without real problems if I fake a
problem for the sake of making a video I
kind of already know what the problem is
which makes it hard to put myself into
super-sleuth mode and turn on my triage
way of thinking to be able to actually
find the problem without knowing where
to start so that's the point of today's
video I have no idea what's wrong with
the Machine I have some ideas and that's
where I talk about today the machine
behind me is about four and a half-ish
years old I want to say it's got a 2700
i7 in our 2700 k i7 it's got a 860 water
coolers from ddr3 it's also got a z77
sabertooth in there and it's got a GTX
1080 that actually gave him last week so
I've already been inside this system but
the problems have started sense I don't
think the 1080 isn't at fault but that's
okay we'll talk about that now the first
thing you got to do is you have to get
yourself some clues you've got to know
where to start and I've got three major
clues we're going to go by here now the
first two are ones that he provided me
and another one is one I observed myself
while installing the graphics card last
week now he says that he plays a lot of
World of Warcraft Legion and so do I
admittedly but he said as of the last
couple of days anytime he would start up
the game he would get in there start
moving around a little bit and then the
game would completely crash sometimes it
would crash to desktop sometimes it
would completely shut down the system or
restart that's kind of a major clue
right there and where we should begin
looking the other clue actually has two
more clues and they've happened since
I've had the system here one when I
installed the graphics card I noticed
there is a lot and I mean a lot of dirt
buildup in here the computer has
unfortunately not really been regularly
serviced when it comes to blowing out
dust and that could have led to a lot of
the failure of possibly the cooler
because the radiators completely clogged
with dust as you can see the other thing
is he's got a lot of fans making it a
lot of terrible noise again dust can
kill fans they get in there and they
start to destroy the bearings and then
your fans go bad so I think we've got a
couple of things possibly
happening here one I think we could
potentially have like I said a bad CPU
cooler and then I think that we could
also have dust built up and stuff like
the power supply member dust does get
conductive it build up enough so we have
to hope here is that the smaller issue
of dust buildup and heat has not led to
a bigger issue of patate potentially
killing a component like the motherboard
of a CPU that would be a worst-case
scenario now I've got the machine hooked
up right here
one other thing I've got to already
start with troubleshooting was I turned
on the system to experience the issues
myself saw the same issue with the CPU
fan warning come on the machine then
locked up i power cycle it and now when
we push the power button we get nothing
so that's where we kind of have to start
see we got yeah power button completely
dead now it did work so I don't think it
came loose in transit I'm just gonna go
ahead and clean out some of this dust
here
well I'm going to start with a power
supply to make sure that's good because
obviously the system will boot but yeah
this is oh my guess this is this is so
painful so temperatures were clearly
going to be an issue something else I
want to point out too though it's the
fan right here on the radiators what's
plugged into the CPU header not the pump
the pump is on a chassis fan hitter so
hopefully that's good news where it's
just the fan was bad but which would
make sense to why it would actually
start up and not lock up right away
until under load because if that pump
wasn't running the CPU would overheat
like nearly immediately oh and by the
way I got this guy on Amazon bought it
myself
and if you guys want to see a link to it
of course it's down the description
helps the channel this thing has so much
power and it's coarse sorry it has
courted check out how much power this
thing has
okay so I wanna make sure that the power
supply is good so I've got this little
jumper right here you guys can do this
with a paperclip too you can find out
online how to jumpstart a power supply
but I want to make sure that power
supplies even clicking on so we're going
to force that to happen right now
so we're just going to unhook the power
to the motherboard we're going to hook
this on to the jumper we're gonna flip
on the jumper and see if the case fans
will turn on that will tell me if the
power supply is even is even starting
and as you can see they actually are see
the hope you guys can see that the fans
are actually going as you can hear they
don't sound very good though listen to
that yeah
this is the way his fans sound right
there that's not good yes unfortunately
both of his 200 millimeter top fans are
no good you can hear the noises they're
making stop that one that was like oh
this one's barely even turning over here
yeah okay so far all I've done is
actually just clean up the dust I'd
haven't even like dennah
actual scrubbing is the power splice of
the film now he has a dog unfortunately
was a lot of dog haired here too so if
you have pets you really have to take
care of your system because it just is
gonna bring in dog hair cat hair
whatever other hair you might have but
that's a good sign here when I turn the
power supply on you can see the
motherboard light does turn on so I
didn't actually check if we were getting
that before I just went straight to
cleaning mode let me see if this powers
on okay so it actually did just power on
by doing nothing but cleaning out the
dust and there was a ton of dust in the
power supply so what could have also
been potentially happening is there
could have been some arc or some
shorting going on in the power supply
because of the amount of dust that was
built up in there
so what I'm gonna do now is I want this
back over here on the actual test rig
because this is just sitting on my
workbench right now and we're gonna plug
it back in and see if we still get the
CPU fault
etc but that's a radiator is all nice
and cleaned out now as you can see that
it's better than it was but these are
the two fans at top that are actually
going bad so we're going to replace
those fans and I think I might actually
just replace his h-60 here and put in a
another maybe a bigger maybe I'll give
no H 100 or something
we'll see we'll figure out we said to
figure out what our issues are we're not
even sure Ford fixed yet get ahead of
myself I tend to do that a lot like
right now I should probably I try hit
the stop button and going to the next
scene
but right now you guys are like damn it
Jay we just shut up and go already but I
don't wanna because I know I'm because I
know I'm winning when I'm winning I
don't know all right I'm done all right
here we go sue got
powered on that's a good sign see if we
get on the screen Oh
CPU fan error it's still there
if I hit f1 enter setup that's what we
get right there
okay now the rear fan is actually
working the problem is this fan is
plugged in was plugged into CPU optional
and I think what happened is when he was
having problems at the computer he did a
clear CMOS to see what would happen and
that's why he's getting that error on
the screen now because he doesn't have
CPU fan error
turned off so all I do right now is move
it to CPU one and have a feeling it
should boot right into Windows ok so
obviously we're in the system now and
all I did was move the fan for the
cooler to the CPU header instead the CPU
optional header that's one thing you got
to make sure that you do if you guys are
installing water coolers is make sure
you put at least some sort of fan a pump
or something onto the CPU header
otherwise there is a fail-safe from the
BIOS that tells you hey I'm not going to
boot up I'm gonna I'm telling you
there's a problem we're going to
overheat and otherwise unless you go
into the BIOS and turn off that setting
just plug a fan into it it's a good
thing to know
I would always plug in at least the fan
or the pump to it that way you know if
your little cooler has died it has
happened in the past
might as well at least have that
failsafe in there so what I'm doing now
other than showing you guys that my
workspace here is a complete and utter
disaster and they need to clean it up I
downloaded a 264 they do have a trial
version you guys can use if you want to
do a stress test on your CPU to check
things like temperatures and whatnot
it's if you think your power supply
might be at fault which I still need to
rule out right now which is what I'm
doing download some sort of a stress
tool like this OC CT 8 is 64
even prime 95 and put some load on your
system because it's also going to load
up the power supply and that's how
you're going to rule that out that's why
it says trial version all over the place
right here so I'm just going to load up
the CPU right here first and I want to
see what CPU temps and stuff
end up being and we're looking for some
sort of a crash now I'm not gonna run
this test for very long it actually only
ran for a minute if we look at the
temperatures here max CPU temp or
average was 31 point 7 on the on the CPU
socket the cores are averaging in the
mid 40s right now it's not overclocked
it is that's actually pretty good on
temperature
so I'm not worried about that fan up
inside the radiator but one of the other
clues that he provided me was that
Warcraft would almost instantaneously
crash so I'm gonna go ahead and try and
recreate that situation with Warcraft
and see if we get the same result after
blowing out the power supply I still am
not convinced the power supply is bad
but if it was clogged up with dust and
dog hair and whatnot it could have been
causing some bit of conductivity with
the dust which would obviously lead to
some of the issues like you're seeing so
here I am in World of Warcraft Legion
I'm actually on my demon hunter don't
bother looking them up I don't play them
you won't get ahold of me that way but
anyway one thing I want to point out was
when I started loading the game I did
kind of hear a little bit of buzzing
coming from the power supply and not
coil whine type of buzz it was different
it was it was almost like an electrical
crackle which is a weird sound but it's
it slowly gone away it could be the fan
the fan be making noise in there but I
am in the Legion area because it's the
most demanding on the graphics it's
pretty choppy here but I mean this is
this is an older rig you think i7 to be
pretty good on Legion though but it's
not immediately crashing like he was
saying it was what I'm doing now is I'm
just going to turn on the on-screen
display so we can see what's happening
with the temperatures at least to the
CPU I don't think that's gonna be an
issue now that we've cleaned it out but
again I'm now since I can't make the
problem happen I've been playing the
game for a little bit it's not crashing
I still think blowing out all that dust
the power supply and the radiator kind
of fixed our issues I think the CPU
itself might have been overheating
because of just how clogged the radiator
was but now I've got to just kind of
test all of this I mean our temperature
for our CPU now is sitting at 50 C it is
actually overclocked ran out of 4.4 I'm
trying to push it as hard as I can
graphics card doesn't do a whole lot in
World of Warcraft actually graphics card
right now is not under full load so it's
not pulling all of its power out that's
why I didn't think Warcraft would be
causing an issue with the graphics card
but at this point I think I'm going to
go ahead and call this one pretty much
solved by just being dirty dirty dirty
little computer so in this particular
instance my friend was pretty lucky that
his only real issues was how dirty it
was he's also pretty lucky that all the
fail
safes with modern CPUs are in place to
keep it from killing itself it will
thermal throttle and then shut itself
down if it reaches a certain temperature
if that hadn't solved the issue the next
thing I would have honestly done would
had been tried a different power supply
I didn't feel that the CPU was it had
any sort of issues it was running super
cool down into the 30s and low 40s under
load with standard clocking right now
overclocking it was reaching about the
mid 60's to upper 60s under load no
problem whatsoever but I'm not too
worried about it right now because I was
playing Legion with the settings on 10
with no problems whatsoever and although
it was a little bit choppy this 2700 K
does start to see its age a little bit
when it comes to World of Warcraft which
is pretty CPU bound especially in the
new areas everything's doing pretty good
though is no problems there but because
he's going to be doing like a complete
pimp my PC type of thing he wants me to
build him a really over-the-top powerful
PC sort of like red mist I would be
doing that for him so we're not too
concerned about this computer just want
to keep it running and keep it reliable
for like a guest PC and some other games
and stuff so we'll probably change a
power supply in this in the future but
in the meantime he's still good to go
this also shows just how important it is
though to keep your computer as clean as
possible I think a lot of people forget
that even with water coolers it's not
hands off dust builds up and if you
smoke or you have pets it gets even
worse and even nastier I pulled so much
dog clumps of hair out of this system
you really should have some sort of a
monthly ritual at least once a month we
go in there with some canned air or an
electronic vacuum or something and get
the dust out of your system because not
only does it build up a block airflow
and make temperatures go up dust if
built up enough can become conductive
and that's where some of the damage can
occur it's not completely done yet I do
still need to change out the fans on the
top as well but those are 200 millimeter
fans so we're probably put in a couple
140 s or something in there if you have
any questions or if you have any
suggestions on the type of PC repair or
the type of troubleshooting you guys
would like to see hit me up on Twitter
or check out the comments go down there
write your comment and if it gets
uploaded and we see some really good
suggestions maybe I'll look at doing
that sort of troubleshooting guide
because I think we've done a lot of how
to build a Paul
just recently did on what to do after
you build it right a lot of people don't
talk about installing the OS and how to
get all your updates and stuff but I
think not enough people have actually
made videos about how to troubleshoot
your problems because building your
computer is great but that means you
don't have some sort of a big giant
corporate warranty behind you to fix it
if something goes wrong so that's where
we come in let me know what you guys
want to see and I'll do the best I can
to cover it anyway guys thanks for
watching and of course I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
