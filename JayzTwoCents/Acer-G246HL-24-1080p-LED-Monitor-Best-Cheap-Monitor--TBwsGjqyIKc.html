once again if you hear any funky sounds
it sounds like farting I swear it's my
chair mostly
recently on Twitter I put out a tweet
that I bought this inexpensive LED
24-inch monitor from Acer and you guys
really flipped out not in a negative way
that you guys were excited that you want
to know more about the panel because I
got it on sale at Newegg for one hundred
and twenty nine dollars and that sale is
over but there's going to be sales like
that constantly at Newegg when it comes
to this holiday season so right now
we're going to go ahead and unbox it
we're going to hook it up we're gonna
see whether or not $129 panel it's
really worth $129 now I don't want to
spend a lot of time on the unboxing
let's want to open it up and take a look
at the packaging make sure it's the kind
of the kind of packaging that would
survive no mail because this did come to
me obviously it was shipped this is the
way it looks when you first open it
right there stuff starts falling out you
we include a DVI cable there here is
your power because it's is a slim
monitor so here's your power brick you
also have your power cable as well as a
standard VGA cable this show you where
this belongs hey here is your stand
bracket door
manual these boobs die were foam and
foamy and then we have the panel right
here we'll just toss that ha just
kidding
fooled you and then we have got the base
plate right there the panel I can tell
you right now and you can tell the
handle these all the time now I'm going
to do this if you actually pretty funny
videos I broke it up here is the panel
and I have a panel just like it actually
the next step up in 27 inch model show
you that right there so I'm pretty
familiar with what I'm getting and I had
no problems buying this but this is one
step down from the panel that I
currently have so I just wanted to go
ahead and show you guys what you get
with this one now the most noticeable
thing that I want to make very clear to
you guys if your console gamers looking
for a panel to carry around with you
there is no or how was it yeah there
yeah there is no HDMI input its DVI and
VGA only so if you wanted to use this
with your console you're going to have
to get yourself a DVI to HDMI cable it's
a HDMI one end DVI and the other should
work but if it doesn't don't sue me
so these screen as you can see right
here is a matte finish and it does have
a polished bezel around the outside
they're exactly like my 27 inch in fact
the only difference I can find between
this panel on my 27-inch when it comes
to the specs on the contrast ratio and
the refresh rate is the fact that this
one does not have HDMI so that's really
the only difference there also to the
base plate is a little bit different by
27 inch is on an articulating arm so
yeah okay so I've got the base mounted
on there
as you can see it's got this kind of an
X design one other thing I want to point
it out that I do like though that the
even for a lower-end monitor is that it
has visa mounts on here so you can mount
this to an articulating arm design for
computer monitors so that's really neat
makes me want to get my single arm here
out of here and get a dual arm and I
can't decide right now if I want to hook
this up as my second panel and take 120
Hertz monitor my 23 inch Samsung and put
that on the test bench because this I
ordered this this panel for my test bed
that I'm building right now I can't
decide if I want to keep it here with my
other Acer or not
so decisions I kind of wish I bought two
of these now be honest with you maybe
three five I know 10 that would be cool
but what I want to go ahead and show you
is just how stable and steady the
baseplate is I mean look at this if I
wasn't confident that this plate was
doing a hole just monitor or just you
really think I would be doing this right
now yeah I'm probably freaky some of you
have not yet changed to drop his monitor
and break it that's one of the things I
really like about acer is their their
mounts are super sturdy that monitor
doesn't wobble all over the place but it
still has a tilt feature as you can see
we doesn't have a lot kinda hard to see
her there doesn't have a lot of tilt in
it but it does have some and so there
you go let's go ahead and hook this bad
boy up and see if we have any dead
pixels and how it looks so there you
have it guys there's the 24-inch panel
right there from Acer it's got no dead
pixels out of the box and neither did my
27 inch so that makes me really happy
there's no ghosting it's very thin very
light easy to mount easy to place and it
doesn't shake and rock around when
you're moving the desk and stuff so if
you're putting your leaning on the desk
it's not rocking all over the place -
very solid monitor and I'm very
impressed with it for 129 bucks on sale
you can't beat it and I think the
regular price is $1.99 somewhere around
there so if you see this panel go back
on sale at Newegg you definitely want to
go and check it out it'd be nice if they
had HDMI I can live without it because
I'm using a DVI digital right there
hooked up to right now
and it works absolutely flawlessly so
guys I'm gonna get on out of here hope
you liked the overview slash review of
this panel couldn't find anything I
really don't like about it other than
that it doesn't have HDMI the colors
were good and for gaming TN panels are
definitely really awesome and you know
it has all the features you need at a
price that doesn't really hurt too badly
when it comes to the bank so if you need
a cheap panel watch for this and other
Acer monitors they didn't even send this
to me for review I bought this and I
bought my other ones and I just
definitely like the name Acer when it
comes to monitors alright guys thanks
for watching check out my other videos
if you liked the video you know what to
do with it and I'll see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
