guys you're watching tech addiction
episode 8 i'm your host JC cents coming
at you live from the fat man production
studios in Southern California we've got
a lot of really interesting things to
talk about today and guess what none of
it involves Apple hallelujah don't you
go anywhere we're gonna talk about all
sorts of crazy stuff
so I've been kind of covering the
production fiasco going on over at
Foxconn in China and it all started with
the fact that they couldn't keep up with
the production of the iphone 5 and they
came out publicly last week and said
that they could not keep up with
production and member i said if they
might have been outsourcing some of that
stuff to one of their other sister
companies well things have just gotten a
lot thicker you see foxconn's been
dealing with suicides suicide threats
people have literally been jumping off
of the roof of their employers business
I can't say that I've never myself
actually thought of doing that that
would be the understatement of the
century but anyway Foxconn earlier this
year ordered tens of thousands of
assembly robots to replace employees to
bring a higher efficiency and a lower
operating costs to the manufacturing
plant at Foxconn well this month and we
are 15 days into November 10,000 of
these robots have already arrived at one
Foxconn factory and I didn't say which
one it was but they are saying that
10,000 of them are currently being
installed as we speak so there's
potentially 10,000 if not more Foxconn
labor jobs that are getting ready to be
axed because we all know computers are
more efficient they're faster they don't
complain they don't jump off roofs most
of the time you know if you thought
things were getting ugly in China right
now expect things to get worse because
if you're complaining that you can't
keep up with your job and you can't make
ends meet and your stress levels just
too high how much stress is it going to
add to you if your job is replaced by a
circuit board electricity and something
that can go 24 hours a day and doesn't
need a coffee break Foxconn said that
these robots cost anywhere between 20 to
25 thousand dollars to produce Foxconn
did say well hey you know it cost two to
three times the annual salary of the
employee that is replacing to do a 20 to
25 thousand dollar robot so I guess now
we know what China's paying their
employees looks like they're paying
somewhere right around seven thousand
dollars a year in China Wow I pay seven
thousand dollars a year on coffee I have
a feeling this one's going to take a
couple of takes this is not good easy to
say the green 500 list has listed the
Xenon Phi as the world's most
efficient supercomputer the Xenon thighs
code paste the Xenon fuck wow that's
hard to say oh my god signifies unifies
unify Xena truth heart Intel
supercomputer boasting the xenon 5
processors several of them is codenamed
the beacon and it offers two and a half
billion floating points of operation per
watt that's 2.49 gigaflops per watt and
it has a max performance of 112,000
gigaflops well consuming only 44
kilowatts of energy and you know what's
sad is it still can't run battlefield 3
on high settings and it can't even dream
of running minecraft with the add-ons
and ticket and shaders and textures and
all that stuff you need two of those bad
boys actually run minecraft anyway this
bad boy is a beast and green 500 has
listed as the world's most
energy-efficient supercomputer in the
world and mentioned it in other videos
this is the start of the matrix and this
is the start of Skynet and we all might
as well just go ahead and kneel down to
the new mechanical computer race how
long have you been with Xbox Live you
see major nelson just tweeted that he's
confirming that they're giving away free
special edition xbox live xbox 360
consoles to some of their members who've
been around xbox live the longest I
definitely don't have a shot at that
I've only been with xbox live since 2008
if you've been with xbox live since the
beginning you may be getting one of
these if your very own I wonder how much
it would go for an ebay so if you're a
gamer you're already aware that on
Monday at midnight black ops 2 launched
and a lot of people stood out in line
for the midnight releases at various
retailers Walmart best buy gamestop
thrifty s no maybe not thrifty s but
there were thousands of people waiting
in line to get their special edition
copies or just their hard copy of tray
arcs hit game black ops 2 if you happen
to buy that game on PC it comes with
more than one disk well a lot of people
on all these different forums for black
ops both treyarch and
game or reporting the same thing that
when they go to put in disc 2 during the
installation process an installer for
mass effect 2 pops up so one guy put up
a video on YouTube describing this
problem and it shows that the disc 2 is
actually disc one of mass effect 2 and
when hits ok to continue the
installation of black ops 2 it says
entered is too so it appears that
somebody in the assembly line or the
copying line of these discs and i'm
going to say right now i'm not really
going to blame Treyarch on this one you
see a lot of people are blaming treyarch
what people don't realize is treyarch
makes a master copy and then outsources
it to these digital media specialists
who then do mass copying of these discs
you tracked their a designing company
their software developers they are not
digital media well somebody somewhere in
the line really screwed up because they
put the black ops 2 label on the mass
effect two discs and well now they have
a huge problem to fix here because there
are a ton of people who are unable to
install their black ops 2 speaking of
black ops 2 I had the honor and a
privilege of attending the Yash live and
ptfo live 24 hour livestream for the
black ops 2 launch event in Los Angeles
California and I've got to go ahead and
tell you I met some of the coolest
people i could have ever imagined
meeting at this event and a couple of
people I just want to go ahead and get a
shout out because they're a hell of a
lot bigger than I am brought off the bat
I want to go ahead and thank Bix max

together an amazing event really pulled
together some sponsors and gave away
probably one of the best prize
collections I've ever seen in any
giveaway in any genre whatsoever big
snacks awesome shout out to you man you
did a great job couple of other people I
had the opportunity of meeting holiday
doc who gave me my start in to youtube
got to meet and hang out with him for
several days got into some shenanigans
got in a not really too much trouble but
I'm sure if there was more time there's
a lot of trouble that could have been
had midget King an amazing guy stand up
guys serving our country and he found
the time to come out
la and participate in one of the best
live streams I think I've even seen
fearless Envy pro gamer on the call of
duty circuit with the team new breed
taught me a lot when it comes to xbox
360 and getting back in the groove of
things that guy really knows his shit I
also had the opportunity of meeting mr.

on the couch calm and the YouTube yow
channel I also have the privilege of
meeting whack 4863 who's one of the
employees over at yash stand up guy and
make sure you go check out his channel
and I got to meet minnesotaburns with
trollarch and the PTF crew chaos X
silencer caught by night just the list
just was the room was too big for me to
feel like I belonged to be a part of it
but they all accepted me it was great at
a lot of fun we've got to thank full
screen for opening up their studio in
their offices to us allowing us to come
and basically trash the place for a few
days and cap their 100 megabit upload
fiber optic system where the ISP sort of
started to throttle because of how much
data we were sending but of course if
you guys were watching the stream we
couldn't have done it without you
because what's the point of doing it if
nobody is watching and make sure you go
over to yash calm and don't forget to
subscribe to their channel at youtube
com / ouch and it's that time again for
technologies dumbass of the Week and you
see last week was the first week I
actually brought you a dumbass that
didn't have anything to do with crime
and this is going to be the second week
in a row where we talk about a
collective group of people who are just
proving that you give them a voice and a
camera and a network and a new studio
and a lot of money doesn't mean they're
going to bring you the news the way it's
meant to be brought see technology has
given them the voice to reach you and
they decided to go ahead and do a spot
on what they believed to be a UFO
captured on live news but you see it was
a fly it was a freakin fly you see
there's some science behind this where
the weather and the time has to be just
right for a fly to be able to actually
fly because they're so I guess a whole
aerodynamic thing going on with the
Flies body and the wings and this net
but you know
you get a fly flying around in front of
a lens or even off in the distance if
it's a big-ass fly and it looks like a a
speck or a dot flying across the sky
really fast but they brought in experts
to check out you know this video to see
if it was authentic and even experts
were saying that it was authentically an
unidentified flying object well I think
the only thing unidentified when it came
to this flying object was what species
of fly was it because it was going by
too fast but you know maybe there are
UFOs out there maybe there's not you
know maybe you believe in a higher being
or extraterrestrials or time warp or no
my little pony it doesn't matter this is
not a UFO these are flies and have a
really hard time with the fact that you
can have a collective group of experts
all coming to the same conclusion that
it's unidentifiable but guys look at the
video for yourself i'm gonna link it
down below this is just I'm losing my
mind with some of this mainstream media
I mean how can you sit there and do a
story about a fly and call it a UFO
captured on TV I just don't get it so
what collective group of professional
journalism could have brought you a
flying flying called it an unidentified
flying object well that would be none
other than Fox the same network that
brings new family guy I like family I
family guy's awesome american dad
married with children did fuck you know
I mean I'm naming some of the most
awesome shows but when it comes to news
