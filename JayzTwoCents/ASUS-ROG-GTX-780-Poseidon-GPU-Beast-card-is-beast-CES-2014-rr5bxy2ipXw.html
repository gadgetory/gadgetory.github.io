insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strapped in with j's two cents as he
takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys you're watching Jays two
cents and we are continuing our
exclusive insider coverage here of CES
2014 now I am standing in the asus rog
booth with none other than JJ if you
guys know the ROG line you've definitely
seen this guy we've got a couple of
interesting things that we're going to
be talking about today if you watch the
Asus of it yesterday you know they
unveiled a brand new J sync monitor and
ROG monitor 1440p some cool specs we'll
talk about that and we've also got a
really cool graphics card there were me
showing you so the first thing we're
going to go ahead and take a look at
today is the 780 ti Poseidon and the
Poseidon as you know is a very luxury
line graphic card it's got all the bells
and whistles you'd expect from the ROG
gamer line bringing you basically no
compromise gaming so imma go I hand it
over to JJ here and let him talk about
what we're taking a look at and then
well we'll go from there so JJ what are
we looking at here to clarify its
actually a DTX 784 the 780 Ti ok so 90 I
yeah 780 I we do actually have a full
non-reference part that is launching in
about a week and that won't be though
under our standard directcu two lines so
that's still a 100-percent full
non-reference based design but the
Poseidon will be coming out in both a
gtx 770 and a 780 version and this one
right here they were demonstrating is
gonna be the 780 now really what makes
this card special and unique is the fact
that it's a combination type card so
historically either if you want to go
water cooling you're going to go with
either a non reference water block
you're going to put that on the card but
it's only going to work under water
cooling situation now some users
sometimes a little bit tepid they're not
necessarily sure if they want to jump
into water cooling due to that right
maybe the complexity the other concerns
but they know that they want that card
the other concern too is that sometimes
and a non reference design there's not
always going to be non-reference
waterblock designs that available right
we've worked really closely with
companies like EK to make sure that like
when we come out with a dc-to-dc to card
you can get non-reference blocks but
this is kind of like a you
provide solutions so that as an
enthusiast you don't have to think about
it out of the box at a hundred percent
work you're going to get better than
reference base temperatures it's going
to be cool and quiet under operation but
if you're looking for even better
performance you know amping up that GPU
boost clock get better temperatures then
of course you go ahead and switch on and
go ahead and take advantage of the water
cooling that's integrated sign is a
brand new series for us so it's never
been out before so we definitely are
trying to give people more clarity as to
what the advantage is so the first kind
of baseline is that if you're familiar
with our DC to line you know that they
kind of set the bar in terms of the non
reference design quality right
everything from you know the vrm to the
power to apology to the pwm components
all that that's all been transposed on
here so you get that classic stuff that
you'd expect like 10k rated capacitors
right so that's 5x which you would
normally have on a normal graphics card
right now ultra high tolerances for
temperature is ultra low Tong tolerances
for temperature you got the sealed
molded alloy based inductors or what
people refer to as chokes so from a
gamer standpoint you can not have coil
wine but you also get really high power
amperage power delivery so you get
improved stability when you're
overclocking so all that stuff is in
there but really what hallmarks this
card is being as Poseidon is the water
element which is the the integrated
support for water cooling so one cool
thing that you're going to see here
though is that we've given you the same
type of flexibility that we developed on
our Maximus six formula board where
instead of having an integrated type
barb type connection right we give you
open threaded connection so that you can
go ahead and put in whatever you want to
work with and so these are g quarter
threads that's correct so you can go
ahead and just essentially unscrew this
right here and you can go ahead and put
on whatever you want so we maintain that
open it and flexibility that the
enthusiast community appreciates all
right but we've made it simpler for the
user to be able to take advantage of so
that they don't have to strip the whole
thing off worry about maybe making one
part of the PCB cracking the da you know
so that's always a little bit of a
sensitive process when you fully
dismantle whole card you know that here
it's going to be a lot simpler for you
because if you want better performance
than already what the DC to type cooler
is going to be providing you here you
just go ahead and switch and you take
that yeah that's great because I know a
lot of my fans because i'm a very water
oriented channel and they're usually
afraid of taking the cooler off of the
PCB which JJ mentioned so you retain air
cooling here i'm assuming to the V RMS
and the chips and this is not a full
cover water block this is going to cover
just the GPU that's correct
it's just going to be just for the GPU
yes okay yeah so yeah it knows this is
still just a standard double slot card
yeah dual slot 2 slot profiles so that's
an advantage we haven't necessarily
moved away from triple slot you know a
lot of people have hallmark ACS cards in
their high performance category of being
triple slot but you know right now
working on a balance to try to do
different things you know one of the big
things that we implement it on a couple
of the current generation cards like
those larger 10 millimeter heat pipes
that we've had in as well as more
advanced what we refer to as curved heat
pipe design we're actually elongating
the amount of surface area plus the
overall surface mass the actual thinned
area that you can go ahead and dissipate
temperature across is larger in many
situations for our cards you're looking
at some times two two and a half X the
actual surface area of a reference card
design so that all in combination helps
to keep really good low temperatures now
we're about power requirements on this
it's pretty straightforward it's going
to be an 8-pin and a 3-pin base
connection so I mean so it's not even a
duel a bit yeah yeah I mean a lot you
know that's a really always interesting
topic cuz I get that's probably one of
the most common questions I get asked
not only in GPUs but our motherboards
right when I motherboard doesn't have
like dual eight pins they go why doesn't
have that a lot of it is always about
efficiency and designing something right
we're not in the business of putting
marketing specs on a board and trying to
sell that we're more interested in
making sure that when we design a
product that it's a hundred percent
designed to be able to get the best
performance possible and we're not going
to over spec it a key example of that is
like our RG motherboards you know we've
now for years literally years only done
eight phase power designs while you've
seen a lot of other competitors you know
do 2032 and try to amp up all these
different things and that you've
continued to look at the top of the
performance category what we've been
able to do we've shown that eight phase
when designed right and we're picking
the absolute best components get to all
the performance you can possibly get
right so it's all about the correct
design the efficiency in the design
rather than throwing more specs at it
which which he had to say yeah and
definitely it's not to mean that we've
compromised on the quality of the card
because all those elements have
definitely been improved upon right
we're not keeping any reference elements
in there and all those subtle design
touches that were always bringing to the
cards are still present whether it's you
know even little things like the LEDs on
the back of the car to let you know that
you're actually getting signalling power
right or you know the SAP cap capacitors
that are on the back
I'm sure by now you've seen mimicked by
some of other competitors right with
similar type designs or even the dust
proof and design where we actually seal
the internal hub assembly so that dust
doesn't get inside there so that the fan
blade can continue to rotate whereas you
know some other competitors try to you
know do these exhaust and fan techniques
and things like that when really what's
more important than that is going to be
the inside of the hub assembly because
that's what a fixed the rotation you
know right now I can already hear my
fans screaming availability when can we
expect to see this come to market both
GTX 770 and the 780 are going to be
targeting about one week time frame
release so within about a week you'll be
able to you know pop over to you know
amazon newegg or your brick-and-mortar
retailers and be able to pick up the
card well there you go guys by the time
you're watching this video it may
already be out so make sure you check
out the GTX 780 poseidon here from asus
on the Republic of gamers line it's
definitely a tried-and-true product line
that I've used you've used and if you're
in a serious gamer you definitely know
all about the ROG line JJ thank you very
much for showing us that as always guys
make sure you follow us on twitter to
get the most coverage that we're
bringing to you here at CES 2014 and as
always i'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
