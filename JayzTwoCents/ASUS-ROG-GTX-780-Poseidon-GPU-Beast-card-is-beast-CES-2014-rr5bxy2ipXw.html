insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys you're watching Jays two cents and
we are continuing our exclusive insider
coverage here of CES 2014 now I am
standing in the asus rog booth with none
other than JJ if you guys know the rog
lion you've definitely seen this guy
we've got a couple of interesting things
that we're gonna be talking about today
if you watch the Aces of it yesterday
you know they unveiled a brand-new
g-sync monitor and our OD monitor 1440p
some cool specs we'll talk about that
and we've also got a really cool
graphics card there were me showing you
so the first thing we're gonna go ahead
and take a look at today is the 780 Ti
Poseidon and the Poseidon as you know is
a very luxury line graphic card it's got
all the bells and whistles you'd expect
from the rog gamer line bringing you
basically no compromise gaming so I'm
ago I hand it over to JJ here and let
him talk about what we're taking a look
at and then well we'll go from there so
JJ what are we looking at here
to clarify it's actually a dt x 784 the
780 Ti
okay so ninety I yeah 780 I we do
actually have a full non-reference part
that is launching in about a week and
that won't be though under our standard
directs you to lines so that's still a
100% full non-reference based design but
the Poseidon will be coming out in both
at GTX 770 and a 780 version and this
one right here that we're demonstrating
is gonna be the 780 now really what
makes this card special and unique is
the fact that it's a combination type
card so historically either if you want
to go water cooling you're gonna go with
either a non reference water block
you're gonna put that on the card but
it's only gonna work on there a water
cooling situation now some users
sometimes a little bit tepid they're not
necessarily sure if they want to jump in
to water cooling due to that right maybe
the complexity the other concerns but
they know that they want that card
the other concern too is that sometimes
and a non reference design there's not
always going to be non reference water
block designs that available right we've
worked really closely with companies
like ek to make sure that like when we
come out with a DC to DC to card you can
get non reference blocks but this is
kind of like a unified
so that as an enthusiast you don't have
to think about it out of the box at 100%
work you're gonna get better than
reference based temperatures it's gonna
be cool and quiet under operation but if
you're looking for even better
performance you know amping up that GPU
boost clock get better temperatures then
of course you go ahead and switch on and
go ahead and take advantage of the water
cooling that's integrated sine is a
brand new series for us so it's never
been out before so we definitely are
trying to give people more clarity as to
what the advantage is so the first kind
of baseline is that if you're familiar
with our dc2 line you know that they
kind of set the bar in terms of the
non-reference design quality right
everything from you know the VR m to the
power topology to the pwm components all
that that's all been transposed on here
so you get that classic stuff that you'd
expect like 10k rated capacitors right
so that's 5x which you would normally
have on a normal graphics card right no
ultra high tolerances for temperature is
ultra low time tolerances for
temperature you got the sealed molded
alloy based inductors or what people
refer to as chokes so from a gamer
standpoint you can not have coil wine
but you also get really high power
amperage power delivery so you get
improved stability when you're
overclocking so all that stuff is in
there but really what hallmarks this
card is being as Poseidon is the water
element which is the integrated support
for water cooling so one cool thing that
you're gonna see here though is that
we've given you the same type of
flexibility that we developed on our
Maximus 6 formula board where instead of
having an integrated type barb type
connection right
we give you open threaded connections so
that you can go ahead and put in
whatever you want to work with and so
these are G quarter threads that's
correct so you can go ahead and just
essentially unscrew this right here and
you can go ahead and put on whatever you
want so we maintain that OpenID and
flexibility that the enthusiast
community appreciates right but we've
made it simpler for the user to be able
to take advantage of so that they don't
have to strip the whole thing off
worried about maybe nicking one part of
the PCB cracking the die you know so
that's always a little bit of a
sensitive process when you fully
dismantle a whole card you know that
here it's gonna be a lot simpler for you
because if you want better performance
than already what the DC to type cooler
is gonna be providing you here you just
go ahead and switch and you take about
that yeah that's great because I know a
lot of my fans because I'm a very water
oriented channel and they're usually
afraid of taking the cooler off of the
PCB which JJ mentioned so you retain air
cooling here I'm assuming to the VRMs
and the chips and this is not a full
cover water block this is going to cover
just the GPU that's correct
it's just gonna be just for the GPU yes
okay yeah so yeah it knows this is still
just a standard double slot card yeah
dual slot 2 slot profiles so that's an
advantage we haven't necessarily moved
away from triple slot you know a lot of
people have hallmark ace use cards in
their high performance category of being
triple slot but you know we're right now
working on a balance to try to do
different things you know one of the big
things that we implement it on a couple
of the current generation cards like
those larger 10 millimeter heat pipes
that we've had in as well as more
advanced what we refer to as curved heat
pipe design we're actually elongating
the amount of surface area plus the
overall surface mass the actual thinned
area that you can go ahead and dissipate
temperature across is larger in many
situations for our cards you're looking
at sometimes two two and a half x the
actual surface area of a reference card
design so that all in combination helps
us to keep really good low temperatures
now we're about power requirements on
this it's pretty straightforward it's
gonna be an 8 pin and a 3 pin base
connection so I mean so it's not even a
dual 8 pin
yeah yeah I mean a lot you know that's a
really always interesting topic because
I got that's probably one of the most
common questions I get asked not only in
GPUs but on motherboards right when a
motherboard doesn't have like dual 8
pins they go why doesn't have that a lot
of it is always about efficiency and
designing something right we're not in
the business of putting marketing specs
on a board and trying to sell that we're
more interested in making sure that when
we design a product that it's a hundred
percent designed to be able to get the
best performance possible and we're not
going to over spec it a key example of
that is like our our G motherboards you
know we've now for years literally years
only done eight phase power designs
while you've seen a lot of other
competitors you know do 2032 and try to
amp up all these different things and
that you've continued to look at the top
of the performance category but we've
been able to do we've shown that eight
phase when designed right and we're
picking the absolute best components
gets you all the performance you can
possibly get right so it's all about the
correct design the efficiency in the
design rather than throwing more specs
at it which which he had to say yeah and
definitely it's not to mean that we've
compromised on the quality of the card
because all those elements have
definitely been improved upon right
we're not keeping any reference elements
in there and all those subtle design
touches that were always bringing to the
cards are still present whether it's you
know even little things like the LEDs on
the back of the card to let you know
that you're actually getting
signaling power right or you know the
SAP cap capacitors that are on the back
I'm sure by now you've seen mimicked by
some of my other competitors right with
similar type designs or even the dust
proof fan design where we actually seal
the internal hub assembly so that dust
doesn't get in inside there so that the
fan blade can continue to rotate whereas
you know some other competitors try to
you know do these exhaust and fan
techniques and things like that when
really what's more important than that
is going to be the inside of the hub
assembly because that's what affects the
rotation you know right now I can
already hear my fans screaming
availability when can we expect to see
this come to market
both the GTX 770 and the 780 are gonna
be targeting about one week time frame
release so within about a week you'll be
able to you know pop over to you know
Amazon Newegg or your brick-and-mortar
retailers and be able to pick up the
cart well there you go guys by the time
you're watching this video it may
already be out so make sure you check
out the GTX 780 Poseidon here from Asus
on the Republic of gamers line it's
definitely a tried and trued product
line that I've used you've used and if
you're in a serious gamer you definitely
know all about the rog line
JJ thank you very much for showing us
that as always guys make sure you follow
us on Twitter to get the most coverage
that we're bringing to you here at CES
2014 and as always I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
