build with as rocks new z170 gaming i7
click the link down below for more
details
hey what's up guys Jays 2 cents here and
obviously the build is done we put up a
build montage of that and I've got a
nasty habit of a nasty Hobbit not races
against hobbits that's where the skunk
works update is done mostly I may or may
not already be working on changing out a
couple of things and I know I can't go
right I just like building it so much
but in the comments section of the build
montage video there was one comment that
tends to kind of be repeating itself
yeah I read the comments I read most of
the comments I don't know it's like self
inflicting harm to read these comments
sometimes it's a guilty pleasure of mine
I know I should definitely stop doing
that I think they actually make a patch
for that but that one reoccurring
comment that keeps coming up and rearing
its ugly head over and over and over is
Jay it's an overkill system even though
3-way isn't supported why didn't you put
in three Titan X Pascoe's well I am if
you guys been following along if you
know I actually planned on putting three
ten ten eight mo said Titan eighties 10
80s in a kind of same thing 3:10 80s in
there and I decided against it I decide
to do two tight necks Pascal's for a
couple of reasons one reduce power draw
and two reduced heat those were the two
things I really wanted to achieve this
room gets very hot when used to gain on
skunkworks and not only that heat was
part of the reason why I was having
color change issues but I digress that's
another video for another time let's go
ahead and do this say let's see what
happens if I were to put all three 10
80s in there on the test bench what
happens how does it respond I've heard
some rumors at 3 ways actually working
in some games we know it's going to work
in things like fire strike but whatnot
so I'm not concerned with any of that
let's try out some games with 3 10 80s
and let's see what actually happens
transition
the first title I wanted to try here was
battlefield 4 because I know for a fact
3 Way SLI worked in battlefield 4 on
Maxwell and older GPUs but as you can
see right now with the game loaded we
only have two graphics cards the middle
card right now is doing nothing today at
456 megahertz but the other two cards
did indeed boost so as you can see
NVIDIA has made a game that previously
supported 3-way SLI no longer supported
with Pascal graphics cards alright so
why don't we go ahead and try some
Witcher 3 here to see whether or not
these are going to ramp up and do
anything but once again as you can see
in the upper corner there one of the
graphics cards is sitting 100% idle yep
look at this guy think I'm we jumping
around and stuff
yay uh-huh I'm a witch I'm a witch night
guy yay alright so there's that what's
your threes out as being one of the
titles that could potentially support
the 3-way SLI well I wanted to try out
Grand Theft Auto 5 to see if that was
going to work but it continues to not
load and completely locks up my system
with a black screen with the three cards
installed oh wait I have a cursor cursor
that's not moving though yeah this cards
aren't even overclocked right now I'm
just I can't even get the game to load
with three graphics cards installed well
alrighty I guess grand theft auto 5 is
out now witcher 3 and battlefield
obviously did not scale at all that
there was idle usage on the third GPU
the driver was just like ignore that GPU
410 is not even there so what about dx12
let's go ahead and try out some hitman
here I'm curious because member dx12
does have some abilities to actually use
additional cards that don't necessarily
have to be supported by Nvidia or talk
about implicit versus explicit sli so
let's go ahead and see if the developers
have even try to take advantage of these
extra cards at all
okay I can hear the audio again black
it's just black what the hell is going
on here uh okay what's interesting is a
control-alt-delete bra brought up test
manager and then this popped up in the
background um check this out the only
one graphics card is doing anything in
here it's not even using two in hitman
Wow
and dx12 that's interesting yeah okay so
this kind of went the opposite direction
I thought maybe dx12 with the way that
it it doesn't need necessary SLI to use
multiple graphics cards um that's still
the kind of a point of debate lately
believe this only one graphics card is
actually doing anything here okay point
taken
another one going black
and I've already fresh installed this
driver because of what happened with GTA
5 I tried it off camera still wouldn't
load and now Tomb Raider what dx12 mode
is not what we got a cursor
once again locked up it's like the exact
same behavior of what we had with GTA 5
s that tells me it's not a title if you
did the drivers could literally with
multiple graphics cards installed right
now just be going stupid let's remove a
graphics card all together let's take it
out of the system and let's see if these
titles will then work took the middle
card out SLI is now enabled so let's go
and see if I'm gonna try GTA 5 again I
want to see if GTA 5 will launch cuz I I
wasn't expecting I was expecting the
card to sit idle the third card anyway
but I wasn't expecting me know launch
issue likes of some titles that's
strange
alright Grand Theft Auto 5 is trying
take a try oh look at that we've got
this is better than we got last time
last time I just went black screaming
like immediately and nothing happened
and look at that no that wig okay well
we already know that that to way works
there's no point in going any farther
here well that's unfortunate all right
and rise of the Tomb Raider is loading
so as you guys saw having the third
graphics card just in the system just
having it in there what's causing
problems that was unexpected I was
honestly not expecting the third card to
cause as many problems as we were having
here now this might not be a widespread
issue obviously I'm running Windows 10
here and I was trying the latest drivers
and I think it's three seven 7.90 I can
be mistaken they are the latest drivers
I installed them right before I did this
video and yeah so when people ask me why
I went with two Pascal cards and didn't
go with the 310 ATS even though I said I
was going to do 310 ATS and I thought
long and hard about this it was it was a
frustrating internal conflict of myself
because I wanted the system to be as
overkill as possible but having a
development background in software and
having worked in IT in a software
development firm for so long and had to
also provide support for the software
that we wrote when someone says we are
no longer supporting it means our longer
testing for any iteration of said
configuration so I'm kind of glad I
didn't do it now because what if I had
put everything together put it in the
system and saw that just having three
cards occupied with a 3-way SLI a bridge
on there and enabled inside the system
although it does work with fire strike
in heaven I did test those all three
cards ramped up they did their thing
although there was a lit more micro
stutter than I was expecting there to be
which I didn't have previously what if I
tried to load up a game and it wouldn't
run because of the same issue that you
guys just saw so once they said no
longer supported anyone who's got any
sort of a developer background or
software knowledge knows that that means
that they're not testing for any
iteration of bug
in that configuration so I just was not
willing to even take the chance so I'm
kind of glad that I didn't do it
to be honest with you not to mention the
to tighten Pascal's are absolutely
dominating what the three officially
supported tighten exes were able to
achieve we will be doing a full
benchmark on skunk works and this is
actually where I need you guys to chime
in because I'm a little confused on how
I want to do it you guys know I game on
x 34 21 by 9 34 40 by 1440p ultra wide
and I don't know if I want to do
standard 16 by 9 benchmarks because it's
something that you guys can run yourself
and compare or if I should do it on 21
by 9 or maybe I'll just do like 4k and
21 by 9 I don't know so I need you guys
to do me a favor go to the comments of
this video and tell me what resolutions
you think I should benchmark skunk works
at I might even play around with some
like super resolution and go up to like
a K or something I don't know but anyway
put it in the comments because I'm
really torn on what resolution I think
should be benchmarked on skunk works
anyway guys thanks for watching it as
always I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
