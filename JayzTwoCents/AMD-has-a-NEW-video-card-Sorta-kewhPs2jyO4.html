sorta this holiday season spice up your
build with high performance options from
msi like the m EG z 390 god-like which
supports up to forty six hundred
megahertz memory for their wide range of
graphics cards from AMD and NVIDIA msi
also has full product lines including
bare-bones workstations gaming
peripherals monitors and more to see all
that msi has to offer click the link in
the description below so it's no
surprise to anyone that AMD sort of been
struggling in terms of the GPU radeon
division over the last year raja Kaduri
harry say his last name Kotori Kaduri
whatever he was kind of poached by boy
wasn't poached he's not an animal
he was headhunted and what sounds like
his head got cut off he now works her
Intel anyway because Intel's come out
with a graphics card I know if you guys
have heard I think my 20/20 were
supposed to see some mainstream desktop
performance graphics card to try and
compete with Nvidia AMD hasn't really
been competing too well I mean the last
major launch we've seen from AMD was
Vega and unfortunately it was it was a
big flop in terms of making a splash in
the market it didn't disrupt Nvidia
whatsoever it was hot it was overpriced
it was only competing with like the 1070
and 1080 where Nvidia already had a 1080
Ti and a Titan X and all that out and it
was you know six hundred plus dollars it
just was a terrible terrible situation
which means the only mainstream you know
desktop processors or graphics cards
that we had rather for gamers was the rx
480 which this was actually a bit of a
splash to the market because it came in
at around 200 bucks for the 4 gig
version in the 8 gig version was around
200 in 49 or 259 great compute card
which launched the entire GPU shortage
because of cryptocurrency mining this
card this was the one the 480 that
launched all of that yeah that guy right
there then we had a little bit of a node
upgrade to it where it was the same node
dye size but we had a little bit of
improvements to core clock and power
distribution and all that stuff which
led to the RX 580 a very minimal jump
that started
whole AMD's rebranding rebranding stuff
well guys were kind of at it again now
with the RX 590 whoops I know oh okay so
I mean when the 590 was announced I
think a lot of people were really
excited and yes I'm aware that I'm
unboxing the 480 because we're gonna be
taking a look specifically at the Nitro
plus rx 590 from sapphire
I love Sapphire cards they are usually
kind of like the flagship of AMD I just
opened that upside down they usually are
like they've got in my opinion the best
build quality they've got really good
software really good just how the
experience with it is it's good now this
was the limited edition this is the gun
the gun fire the gunmetal version and as
you can see the 590 definitely bring in
the Sapphire back if you will externally
they are like identical in fact even the
backplate is pretty much the same it's
just a different color so as you can see
they have definitely brought the
Sapphire back all the Sapphire color
blue LEDs in there and and all that
stuff in fact these are pretty much like
a direct copy of each other I hope you
guys like blue because that's the only
color you're getting at least with this
one right here with the Nitro+ both of
them are dual BIOS cards which come with
different fan curves and overclocks and
stuff like that speaking of overclocks
this card actually runs 1560 megahertz
or up to 1560 via GPU boost and 20 100
megahertz memory now both these cards
spec wise are nearly identical the
differences the 580 is a 40 nanometer
process the 590 is a 12 nanometer
process but both have 8 gigabytes of
gddr5 256 bit bus the base specs of both
these cards for reference models anyway
have an eight gigabit per second memory
speed not a whole lot different between
these cards which unfortunately is kind
of feeling the whole audience distaste
for the whole rebranding thing we have
seen the rebranding claims from the 200
series and up and yeah so we heard we're
due today we're gonna throw this card
into the system right here we're gonna
load up some battlefield 5 I actually
had already started benchmarking this
card I was going through and compared
like firestrike and in 3d mark will fire
strike three mark times spy Metro last
light the usual gambit and guess what we
found out it's that much faster as to be
expected though considering its a twelve
nanometer process this is a 14 nanometer
it's got a little bit higher core clock
that's one of the major difference is
smaller process faster clock higher TDP
as well 225 watt on the 590 is a 185
watt on the 580 that doesn't mean that
you couldn't necessarily overclock your
580 though to match the speeds or even
exceed that of the 590 if you get a good
overclocking card the problem with these
cards is some of them just with AMD it
is super hit and miss on whether or not
you're actually gonna get a good
overclocking card spoiler alert we were
able to actually overclock this one to
1650 up from 1565 or 1560 1560 but
didn't really make much of a difference
in terms of our scores all it did was
change our stability and increase the
temperature significantly alright so
let's go ahead and go it in the system
here let's load up some battlefield 5
and let's see what some real time gaming
performance is like in 1080p
alright so msi afterburner is showing
our card obviously with our 20 100
megahertz memory our 1560 core clock and
I'm not gonna overclocked this or do a
fan profile or anything for the sake of
this video because we really want to
compare out-of-the-box performance so as
you can see she's already looking at the
FPS going really really that's that's
all you could if I could no I don't
think she's actually staying there she's
like a vCard okay I'm just kidding I kid
I kid
alright options wise of course we're
gonna max this out and 1080p there's no
reason why I wouldn't cheat by bringing
the brightness up a little bit okay
everything's on well of course except
for D our X Y X 12 is on high dynamic
range is on frame limiter 200 and
everything's on ultra and all that stuff
so we should have hopefully a pretty
good gaming experience we're gonna start
here in the campaign cuz like I showed
you guys in my last video the campaign
is actually harder to run then the
actual like multiplayer itself I just
try hardcore
hardcore here we go okay so we're down
to 75 ish okay oh wow so we decided to
instead playing hardcore we put out hard
maybe that was inadvertently a graphic
setting I don't know alright we're good
this time that last one was just a fluke
I guess so here was sitting 64 FPS 63-62
ah what just happened now
DirectX function get device removed
reason failed with DX GI air device hung
GPU driver 18 dot 12.1 okay I'll try
reinstalling the driver real quick so
now we're dealing with an issue where it
keeps minimizing itself something to do
with the latest drivers and Battlefield
I don't know what if you were a new
buyer and you built the system because
you wanted to play battlefield 5 and
this is the GPU got well this might be
the experience you get ok so apparently
the third driver install hahaha it could
be an issue of AMD's driver like the
latest driver
I mean AMD and driver problems who we've
ever heard of that are we somehow
getting better performance in dx11 with
the AMD then you work with DX 12 whoa oh
he got hung up on the polder yeah so
yeah
apparently you can't run DX 12 with the
latest AMD driver and an RX 590 learnt
something but ironically we're getting
better performance in dx11 anyway so I
think we're clearly getting some dx12
optimization problems here could be a
driver bug we'd be reinstalled it three
times so it didn't really seem to matter
this is one of my favorite deals right
here I love tanks I cannot wait until
the tank battles are opened up oh we're
dead so yeah FPS so far I'm more looking
forward to seeing how the aerial battle
goes though I should be really high FPS
so like I set up in the sky is Lunas fps
it's so beautiful the temperature those
74c so it's definitely down clocked
significantly here the FPS the 135 on a
sub 300 ollar card running max settings
okay I'm not gonna play through this
whole beginning campaign thing I think
multiplayer is is where most people are
gonna spend their time right I mean most
people will play through the campaign
once to get the weapons and stuff you
get for completing that and then you go
into multiplayer so can this card give
me 60 FPS Plus is pretty warm actually
in multiplayer I'm pretty sure yes
because of what I just saw here in dx11
not 12 all right let's do this
130 ish FPS already at the start of the
game if I had r-tx I would have seen his
reflection oh it was like that scene
from Saving Private Ryan he's eight
meters away and you're a medic seven six
come on gimme five that's a bad place is
fine would you say that this is playable
Phillip hang out I get revived what
happens if you oh did you see me duck I
knew that shot I saw that it was killed
by a different guy
entirely okay so although we had some
weird issues with the driver in dx12
specifically with battlefield 5 I can
tell you the other tests that we have
run were completely stable we tested it
with time spy fire strike Metro last
light this is a brand new title with a
fairly new card I'm pretty sure that
there's gonna need to be some driver
optimization for dx12 dx11 saw an
improvement in performance which tells
us that we clearly had an issue with
dx12 now battlefield 5 is an Nvidia
title so I don't know if that just means
optimizations are being prioritized
which it could be very well the case but
if you are searching for a card that is
under $300 this one comes in at 279
dollars and 1080p with all settings
maxed on a free sync panel you can see
we had an extremely smooth gameplay
experience clearly had way more FPS in
multiplayer that we are in single player
Phil and I discussed that we think that
that has something
with the fact that in single-player they
can kind of control what's happening
with the environment where in
multiplayer you can't so it becomes more
of a CPU bottleneck and multiplayer we
think in single-player they're just
adding a crap ton more Beautification if
you will to the world which is causing
the FPS to drop significantly so we're
getting almost double the FPS in
multiplayer
since that's where you gonna spend most
your time that's perfectly fine now if
you can get past the blue color
I really wish sapphire hadn't hit this
one gun metal like the 580 because that
was in my opinion the best looking what
turn that down the best looking graphics
card they had made this blue is I mean I
talked about how red it really clashes
with many systems you can see the blue
is clearly only going to appeal to those
who want blue and or an amazing card and
don't care what it looks like so there
you have it it's also weirdness with
dx12 but nonetheless in 1080p ultra all
settings max as high as it would
possibly go in battlefield 5 more than
100 fps and multiplayer which is great I
didn't do a full review of this card by
testing it through a whole suite because
like everyone else is kind of discovered
it is slightly better than a 580 and
slightly ish better way so I didn't do a
full gamut of testing with this card
specifically because that's a gamut and
the gambit is a gambit gamut so I didn't
run the full gamut of testing with this
card because spoiler alert well it's not
really spoiler it's at the end of the
video now it is a fair good amount
better than a 480 and better ish than a
580 but at the expense of being more
power draw and 10 10% are so faster so
didn't read need to run a whole bunch of
benchmarks to tell you guys that but at
the end of the day doesn't really matter
because you can't really buy 4 80s
anymore and if you're getting better
performance for the same price that's
not a bad thing whether it's rebranded
or not I'd love to see something big
come from AMD to really shake the tree
when it comes to GPU market because I
think you guys have seen with Nvidia and
it's inflated pricing and completely out
of control mindset in terms of what
costs what for Nvidia graphics cards we
need
need something to happen now fortunately
is not gonna happen anytime soon I don't
think alright guys thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
