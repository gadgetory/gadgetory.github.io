and I've got two computers I've got a
build because we got PDX land coming up
in November and you guys are going make
sure you guys to come and say hi a
fractal design is sponsoring this trip
we're doing a road trip it's gonna be a
lot of fun heading up there so perhaps
with Josh Nick and myself are gonna be
spending two days in a car each way
that's gonna be crazy but anyway
hi guys I got two systems to build here
and I thought you know what we'd have
some fun with this so those are certain
somebody visiting right now and once you
say hi hi so I had a good idea I said
why don't we have a build off right
because I've got two nearly identical
systems I've gotta build so we were
always talking jumps back and forth
about who's better at this and that and
I figured let's build a computer and see
you can do it faster but then I thought
you know what that's just boring I do it
all the time I'm gonna beat you in speed
yeah they're like six years since I've
built one but then I thought let's do
some bonus factors right so there's a
knee cleanliness yeah neatness of wires
and stuff because anyone can just
shoehorn parts in the case and call it
done does my original plan and beat the
timer so there's the timer factor
whoever gets to BIOS first wins there's
gonna be the neatness factor but then we
thought just like on the cooking shows
we need one bonus item and considering
on the thread Ripper build we learned
that the light the RGB lighting and the
ricer Isle we're calling it at autozone
actually works with these RGB headers on
these motherboards so we each we're
gonna go to autozone right now we're
gonna be picking one lighting item yes
from or or item period to spice up our
system and make it our own from the
lighting section and that's gonna be
what we're calling our flair item our
pieces of flair layer and so yeah I'm
building Josh's computer he's building
NICs I'm bringing stuntwork so these
turn out to be atrocities I don't have
to look at it but yeah so you know we
gotta go now autozone let's go take the
case they just vinyl wrap it and would
that be awesome well let's let's find
the naked there's a chrome naked lady to
be found here you put some chrome fake
vents on the side of it for cooling well
I'm going with the trim lady oh wow it's
so fancy tell me this is the top of the
case flat J is it a cross stop
a fake air intake on the top because
cooling right so because we need to add
extra air cooling to mix build so they
can survive PDX I think it's hot PDX
land so I think we're gonna get a little
bit extra cooling I was gonna grab these
I think this is really gonna perk up
that case because I think I gonna like
that mare yeah America I get work where
did this disengages oh man that's gonna
be functional I really it's alright if
smoke starts I just turned I unplug it
that's not idea what I'm good at making
sure okay good let's thinking like disco
party I'm thinking party like a party in
there not automotive like the Volt
things cool but I just snagged it cuz he
was time out car stuff I was like what
can I like snatch from the whole car
idea and the voltage meter popped up
I like our like one item a flyer turned
and these computers aren't gonna look
even remotely the same now they're gonna
be very individualized we agreed upon
yeah here's what I got Jerry Jerry's got
the back there yep so I can't wait to
see the way your turn I feel like you're
gonna win just because of how yeah
alright so I gotta bolt a volt gage that
was a good call I completely suppose I
did I mean so josh is a car guy so I'm
like I kind of put a voltmeter in there
right and then they I only got two items
the other item I got was a 72 inch fiber
optic lighting string so it's 72 inches
long ones that's like what six feet no
so yes I get six feet yeah and so it
means I could actually wrap that around
the internal several times I'm just
concerned about how bright it's gonna be
but the graphics cars we have also have
our DP lighting on them so it was a good
for me because I'm working on Nick's
computer I wanted to make sure that I
showed performance without actually
having performance since he only has
slow cars that look like they're fast so
I decide to get him a fake hood scoop I
think that's gonna add some horsepower
we also got him some girls here cuz I
don't think I've ever seen Nick with a
girl before so I figured I'd get him his
first little date here
and then we got 36 inches of red LEDs
twins naughty and nice okay so let's run
down the parts here because everything
here is pretty much identical the
exception of the CPU and the memory
we'll talk about that in a sec but 7900
exon Josh's system because you know he's
sponsoring this so he gets the ten core
twenty thread Nick gets a 78 20 X 8 core
16 threads whatever that's fine yes
sorry Nick you down to court I mean it
could have been AMD bro josh is getting
RGB Corsair memory here which is gonna
tie into sort of my lighting theme so
that's why what with RGB on this guy
Nick's actually running the Corsair
torque which is a special edition memory
you'll see that when Jerry does his
build the box is pretty of course we've
got fractal design sponsoring this will
both systems are getting a new Celsius s
24 two different cases here though we're
going with the mesh if I see four
fractal Josh's build and Nick is getting
the focus G EVG I stepped up with some
parts for us here so we've got X 299
micros that we're going to be used in
both of these systems or micro ATX
motherboards that fit in here we've also
got I show you need to open that I can't
open that because that's all part of the
process there see oh it's okay you know
for mine it you probably would need the
help I'll do that - GTX 1080p I SCS so
I'm relieved that in the package but
anyway you'll see that we build to 1080i
so one for each system and then each
system also has EBG a 750 watt power
supplies so you know you know how this
works
right yeah we're gonna get kind of set
up here we're gonna say go and then
whoever gets to buy this first wins the
time element cool but we've also got the
neatness and the flair factor so I'm
going player factor I think it's the
most important thing yeah absolutely
I'll put this back now trust you not to
cheat Nick you were gonna love your
computer bro you're gonna love it you're
ready ready 3 2 1 go haha I'm pretty
confident
this case is this is builds already done
this is a formality that is a
lightweight case I'm impressed
okay as you can see J strategy
supporters to unbox everything first so
also to we're not doing pre-boot testing
on this equipment so we have to hope it
works right
some tells me it mine doesn't boot up
though J's just gonna jump to the
conclusion that I don't know what I'm
doing I fried something taking bets
while the screws are already installed
on the standoffs how fancy is that for
putting together a little quick I'd like
to point out that my CPU is already
installed well we got to stick a residue
they got stuck on here you know a lot of
people have the false assumption that
I'm some kind of a super builder like
I'm fast I've never had that assumption
ever the audience has that but anyone
that's ever built with me will tell you
that I tend to hyper focus on things
that are not important right like the
neatness of my wire isn't right I could
totally see that open to be clear we are
not to boot these computers until they
are in their final form completely put
together especially since we have the
style factor yeah you guys very safe
little boy oil right unlike jad and get
anything stuck in anything cuz I'm a
prop guys hey J what is the M to thermal
path
haha fortunately for you that's not
going to apply to good alright now the
trick with installed CPUs is you just
drop them in the slot until they feel
like they're gonna go in okay and line
up the little thingamajig errs mechanic
yellow oh there we go just can only go
in one way all right okay don't help me
there we go I see the I see the key good
aha so we got memory in here motherboard
is ready to go let me just gonna drop
this now into the case I have lost my
memory
oh there it is I've actually never built
in one of these cases in any of the new
like small form factor well this is the
tempers last one yeah
I gotta be a little bit extra careful
glass or plastic side panel oh yeah this
is glass no it's also really durable
check out these memory sticks deal
torque are awesome it's Dominator Nick
specifically requested those they're
fancy I kind of feel like a case like
this you know it will support standard
ATX like I feel like micro ATX is the
way to go we're good we're good because
I'm moving their exhaust answer them
front so at two intakes and two exhausts
is what I'm doing because cooling is a
bit most importance when you're using
high-end hardware like we've got here
how are you doing over there I'm doing
great yeah my stuff's almost ready to
post are you booting it just about
almost there buddy I love how we take
two completely separate tabs on the
assembly yeah so you can't really gauge
like who's winning because you could be
doing the super simple stuff first and I
could be doing the more complex stuff
first around them in ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
3 4 5 6
I can move okay I could just ignore
these standoffs being in the wrong
position but I'm not gonna because Jay
will tease me later if I screw this up
and Jay and I have an identical set of
tools do well they're nice to go but
they're the same exact tool yeah don't
mind me like nope that was jut you now
would give me a walking we've only got
one C cube power header on this where
that one CPU power plug now although
this might cost me a little bit extra
time I'm doing it the right way so I'm
running to PCI Express power cables
instead of one because we happen to know
through a video which you guys can go
and check out at another time that there
was a slight difference making sure I
put it in the right place Nick all right
so I have now got all my main wiring
system so this is forced me to do things
a little bit weirder than I and I would
traditionally but that's okay because
now not to worry about the plugs cuz
I've got them all in there including my
spares that I need for the lighting
prior to our flare factor are you having
a mechanical issue there yes i yeah you
are in the standoffs that you're trying
to remove no the ones I'm trying to put
in the powder coats on the holes that
didn't have standoffs pre-installed so
I'm having to strip it but this is all
the grip I can get on it unless you got
a socket that'll fit on it okay I
shouldn't be helping you here right up
the case
doctor thinking that you can use I did
not see one where's the case Harbor do
you have one did you dump it all up yeah
that's right are there we got it right
there this guy oh I shouldn't be helping
you but it exists back in my day I'm a
good guy you're a good guy okay well
give will give jr. will give him a
minute for that good guy that want to
see me like five minutes take a jab she
do not even notice that this tool is
dammit it's alright it's okay I feel
good I feel alright I don't have already
sweating bullets from stress because I
can already tell oh god now I just
dropped my first thing this is not good
this is not going well this is not well
everything's going entirely to plan yeah
that's another video coming up and build
off with a nick he swears that he could
build a computer better than me even
Gerry's laughing episode 2 you haven't
built a computer in four I mean my plan
was just to all along make you super
stressed and I'm like I'm over there
just like sweating through everything
I'm like I'm dying here I never tighten
down the actual and off and there's no
that's a stupid mistake I would have
made anyway you see me make some pretty
bad ones but that's his own handicap if
he if it's not a I mean hey hold up your
little IO shield cover thing yeah
nevermind we're good
I have no idea where this I old goes
let's just say I figured out something
that are you crapping me yeah you just
figured it out no what has to be bolted
from underside
this is the first time they've ever done
this that's crap all the ones I've ever
done and this EVGA why what have you
done this yeah it'll be too bad booth
this is this is very very poor indeed
every single person that has ever built
this is gonna encounter this problem I
guarantee it okay yes
no I'm trying not to Thanks second is
the other one on no problem this is
where my big fat hands get anywhere see
my weakness in all of this is the
unboxing part I think everyone kind of
expects that so we have s 24 just
perfect I'm gonna mount this one on the
ceiling you know it would technically
fit in the front
yeah that's the thing I love most about
the Celsius cooler so because it has the
header right there so you plug your fans
into the radiator you don't to worry
about trying to find extra headers or
crab and then you have one pjo header to
install for your fans and your pump so I
just realized that they use the bigger
screws now to hold the motherboard down
not the old screws so I learned this who
didn't realize anything I told you okay
Jay didn't tell me I was like Jay where
all the standoffs tripped up but to my
credit Jake can you please confirm that
yes they did used to used to be the
super tiny like the same ones and SSDs
and using the right screws and Here I am
already worrying about wiring look at
the way I'm winding all of this all
right I mean this is my handicap this is
I can't help myself you are a handicap a
insensitive there's my feelings I
approve one screw light for that the
shake factor Jay have you ever used the
shake technique Phil okay to screw I did
it earlier now here if we didn't have
enough problems I have never used it all
in one cooling system before well I
picked to eat this is look there's this
like the easiest Elias series is
probably like among the easiest to do
because it has that built-in fan header
got it whoo that's fancy yeah what if
this would double is an oil cooler again
oil cooler in your car there we go there
we go
all right so there's only one place this
looks like it can be mounted in the top
okay yes get it here for you put yours
oh boy
no we're fine we got this
no it's where my speed hasn't kick in
Nick was like hey you look cool too the
cucumber comments river now I caught
your potato close enough some might
mistake here your speed as a power drill
everything screws
shit okay just let me walk in the exact
problem not dammit yeah I'm guessing
that same problem you know taking off
that shield you told me that shield has
to stay on oh you're moving in front you
noticed the same thing I just noticed it
I ran there they won't tell Ram so so
what I started to say was I actually had
low profile Ram I could have just gotten
grabbed off the shelf but that would've
been cheating right Nick you're gonna be
proud of this computer you know what
this is only happening like this because
we're in a hurry
yeah yeah okay okay does it remove from
the bottom look on the bottom see those
screws holding the drive KJ like under
the case there is I can take the drive
cage I'll take miss it interferes even
if when it's in look no I take the drive
cage out oh hey just leave it out
yeah we're not using all right we're
good okay so I'm actually having to flip
my fans around because I had them set to
exhaust and once I put them on the front
now they were also still exhaust so we
would have been pulling air out of the
front of the case and I'm doing this
without removing the radiator from the
front cuz although I was like look at me
I'm using all the screws cuz I'm not
cheating enough now like like well
there's eight screws to remove the fans
or there's 4012 sweat well I guess eight
screws from the radio whatever feel like
this is more like how to screw a
screwdriver tutorial okay here we go
again where I'm like that wire sticks
out and I don't like that so I'm gonna
remove these screws this is this is
where I was this is where I've always
told people like look I am NOT a speed
builder I am an ATV builder OCD about
certain things OCD I have a PD is on the
ATV builder here bro so here I am
tucking wires and stuff but there is a
style builds that are an aspect to this
I have one more concern but I think
we're okay what's that oh I'm talking
about the camera
I'm a little bit concerned about the
length of the graphics card now is a
ride in the front for different stops
Judy Joe these are these SC cards are
pretty badass it's like so close
there's ain't no Kyle on a boat
situation I ain't taking the fan out it
actually fits because I thought about
that beforehand when I ordered the parts
sorry Kyle
it's also why you have a motherboard the
fifth tip I want to show all these wires
out of the way so what i'm doing here
i'm gonna taking out my drive cage too
so this is gonna be pure SSD systems for
this LAN party and we don't need actual
hard drive storage how do you get it I
think I have to take the power supply aa
probl it gets stuck Pro builders figure
that out in 40 seconds so I put some
kinks in that so it twists out of the
way so that I can run my little strip
lighting that I bought around the case
without that interfering got new thermal
paste on there because I just had to
break the seal on the factory one so
we're good there and my cooler a second
stall
I feel like this feels like pretty good
just at a table just like myself I don't
know I think he's taking the easy route
I feel like you should have gone for a
little more skill something that takes a
little more time it says I mean to win
this all build us one hour meaning you
ready
we're doing it I have to give that some
I have to get that props this is
actually awesome because I thought at
first this was not gonna be functional
and now it's actually functional so now
I feel a little bit better about putting
this really really good even got here
this is espionage this against all the
rules alright so I'm gonna move I'm
gonna put some exhaust fans on the top
otherwise you guys are all gonna mock me
for years and years I just think it's
good it's good a standard crack no it
isn't thing is I just didn't want agree
with you I agree with you I just didn't
want to agree with you that's a fair
enough
I'm not offended all right you down have
some exhaust fan sir they are talking
this back we're getting all the exhausts
here Nick oh my shakin I've forgotten it
we're on a serious Channel we got we got
behave ourselves balls and and Jake
functional hey sexo hot air at you Joey
won't pull you're in know there's all
hope yeah yeah let's blow the hot air
yes I'm so ready to user I look so now
it's a heater for the user on a cold
night I feel like this is gonna become
like a thing now people gonna go about
buy it like suddenly autozone is gonna
be like we've got a sudden burst of
sales with booth scoops
all right so I've got everything wired
up just like Jay at this point
everything you can see is perfectly
organized on my desk that's where Jays
at right now yeah they're wired up just
like mine Club McLean GP is going in
after I figure out how I'm gonna wire up
all of the I think the gauge is gonna go
like right here the gauge has got its
own little bracket thing that I can just
like two-sided tape in there little boat
gauge oh wait maybe they didn't give me
a little bracket it's shown a bracket on
the blocks look I guess that was a
separate piece shit
no no no I gotta really come up with a
creative way of putting this in there
don't I yeah I know you can't be here
right now he's been thinking I got a gap
right there right
I don't think I can drill into the next
guy it's just and now ladies and
gentlemen top fiber-optic work if you've
ever wondered so it just carries along
the length of the plastic there's not
gonna be too much late so it's almost
feel like a waste I should have gone to
LEDs hey Jerry you wanna you want to
trade funds right yeah
doesn't matter what oh shit they're LEDs
coming from that side
oopsies okay where's that adapter
there's no pins I might have to steal
some pans Oh what don't break it
well that worked directly I would rather
have I'd rather throw the competition
and have you cut some things need to be
cut oh okay I know why this will work
it's gonna show up from another two died
only it's gonna light up anything Oh
y'all think we were right oh yeah I went
by the picture and that was the first
mistake admit I fell for
Shanee picture marketing because this is
not this is not gonna have a little
light at all
stop helping in what is what are you
doing
excuse me excuse me
oh shut up anything just shit this I
should has gone LEDs but before we go to
TV excellent I like I need to redo the
left campus but I just I just looked at
the I just looked with that what the
hell what it was that's good why chose
the route that has way more work yeah
we'll have this one just is about make
it work
yes 5.0 recital that's before we decided
to do mine in anyway
oh shit shit's getting real yeah okay
here we go
oh she is glowing hey let's see if she
posts come on baby come on baby come on
girl come on okay we got some additional
lighting okay come on peace sake oh I
think Jay might got me this might need
some troubleshooting Oh beat beat beat
beat which code keyboard just lit up the
USB just kicked oh do they sometimes
beep even though they'll post that was a
postcode yep
dude I haven't seen a CMOS checksum air
in a long time that's that's old-school
bingo that's a good detail although the
key side isn't still on Jay I mean it
started my goal either like wire up
that's actually gonna be pretty badass I
don't know if we can call that a big
breathe obey some just available oh shut
up this is beautiful we're gonna look
out the fan got me
I still want to get finished though with
them I don't think that that fiber-optic
cables not work very good well drop the
part just over the meter I just want to
see the meter work it's not done it's
not the wire this up I'm gonna be like
an hour behind him at least and I don't
even know where the back part of my
gauge went now the part that cut that
holds on oh here goes okay so he's using
entirely the wrong tools for this you
know all right so you got to use the
right tool for the job but once i
repaint once I paint that and fix I mean
the holes got a little gap right there
whatever I couldn't do it I mean I was
like anything is simple and just make it
move me and I couldn't do it
I'm surprised the LEDs actually worked
as well as they did though I I when I
stuck them in there literally it was
just a Hail Mary like and they're not
they're literally just running the
border of the case side and they look
pretty good but I think I intake well
actually so exhaust we can't call it an
intake we have called an exhaust on top
it's actually really cool it's ghetto
but it's cool i think i think it's PDX
lane ghetto though I think this gonna
work well there technically I still be
fumbling around the motherboard trying
to figure I think the shield on it if
you guys can tell me so fair enough
all right here we go when we truth while
I first boot at least there we go know
the voltmeter is gonna need once I paint
it black can fix it it's really neat
that actually needs to be like a staple
in the future bills okay so here we go
the builds are done Jerry you won the
speed competition you need only alright
but there's three factors to this there
is so there is of course the speed which
you want hands down because I I mean my
wiring look at this I cannot no your OCD
screwed you I cannot not do this and
I've always told Nick this Nick has
always been like oh man you would smoke
being a bit speed bill it's like no I
wouldn't I cannot let go of this kind of
stuff I really like that this case has a
shroud on the bottom though like the
cover stuff that's cool baby how does it
look so much neater yeah okay but the
other factor is the cleanliness the
cleanliness which obviates a I think you
got me hands I don't even think we need
to ask the audience let me know no it's
see you cleanliness is do you yeah Blair
has to go to the audience yes the flirt
we're gonna put a straw poll in here and
you guys vote and I'm very disappointed
because I wanted to use this fiber-optic
light and it's cool and all right you
can even see like some of the light come
through there the problem is it doesn't
it's not intense enough and I did and I
didn't go with LEDs because I didn't
want to go with like the normal route
yeah and already grabbed LEDs already
went for the cheap grab I mean but lucky
I mean the case is lit it's exactly what
you would expect I want to say you kind
of copped out on the special like bonus
feature because you just went with a
couple of stick on items and a plug-in
item one that you were getting ready to
cut and rewire that I stopped you
because I didn't want you to cut up a
perfectly good lighting system that we
could use sort of I mean some of the
LEDs burned out already but I expected
the excuses Jay I fully expect because
you didn't know they plug into the into
the motherboard I didn't technically he
did otherwise he'd still be over the
Turner wired up figure out which
channels red which I do exactly what I
was gonna do but it was unnecessary I
was gonna actually cut them in wire
but it was the only thing I really have
to show for the custom factor other than
the 25 bucks that just went poof because
the the the wiring thing wherever it
went for the lighting also is a male
plug well yep they all the other ones I
bought so far have been female yours
worked right because I told you it would
but I made the voltmeter and yeah I
scratched the case right there but I'm
gonna touch up this paint and I'm gonna
clean this up before land
PDX land so it looks good but you can
see that I have a functional voltmeter
functional bolt leader that is really
cool and unique very unique so where I
let the audience vote who do you guys
think won the style factory cuz that's
what it comes down to yeah I got
cleanest you got speed
I got an exhaust though that's supposed
to be an intake blowing the heat back at
you it is it's I designed this for cold
