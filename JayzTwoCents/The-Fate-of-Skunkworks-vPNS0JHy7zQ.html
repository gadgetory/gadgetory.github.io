it's been a while since I've filmed in
this space this is my home office and
this was where it all began when I went
self-employed with YouTube this isn't
where I started my channel but we spent
a lot of a lot of time in this room
bringing you guys content so I figured
what an appropriate place to bring it
back to to have the conversation about
skunk works and what the fate and future
holds when it comes to this iconic
system at least for my channel skunk
works has always been one of those
builds that as the channel grew I kept
building on it I kept adding to it I
kept upgrading it to really the most
unnecessary most unneeded hardware but
it was kind of a symbol was a
centerpiece to this channel and it was
something I had a lot of fun building up
as time went on so you guys have noticed
over the last eight months that I've
been at the studio that skunk works has
been m.i.a you guys have not really seen
it I haven't touched anything on it in
over a year except for when I did the
fluid swap but I needed to top off my
GPU loop because as the air pull it out
we level drops anyway that's besides the
point the point being the system's here
it's still running but I haven't touched
it and over a year in terms of upgrades
right it's got the 69 50 X in there 10
core 20 thread CPU super overkill for
any gaming system and it's got two tight
necks big peas in there not the little P
it's the middle tight necks right
didn't even update that when the new
Titans came out because I really didn't
feel the need I mean it's got 64 gigs of
Corsairs special edition memory in there
the dominator special edition and it's
just I don't know I'm at a crossroads
with this where I don't know how I want
to proceed I'm kind of been bringing the
channel back old-school like we just
relaunched Tech Talk this last Thursday
if you guys have missed it it's up there
on VOD you could watch it on demand and
that was a good show huge turnout thank
you guys to those of you who came to
watch that podcast but I I'm at this
point where this year this 2017 year has
been so weird when it comes to hardware
with AMD being back on the map again
with Rison on mainstream and thread
Ripper thread over being thread Ripper
right I mean there's the socket fiasco
which I did a video about late like I
was late to the PERT to the show on I
don't watch a lot of other channels guys
so I was unaware of the Foxconn
socket issue but I digress the the
thread were per build that I did at the
studio was awesome but I still don't
even use that because I don't need it so
it's it's on display in the back of the
set and here we are talking about skunk
works now I don't work on this system
anymore in fact this is the first time
well since I moved to the studio anyway
when I moved to the studio was the first
time that my channel has existed that I
didn't have to create the videos on the
same machine that I game on meaning it
wasn't I don't need a dual purpose
system which is what skunk works has
always been as the channel got bigger so
did the system but the problem is as I
have segregated now my home life with my
work life they're not in the same place
anymore that means I also segregated my
systems so I needed a work system
dedicated to the channel and skunk works
became my gaming system which is why I
didn't feel the need to do any upgrades
on it because we are already well into
the future on how long it will stay
relevant and be you know perform
perfectly fine 69 50 X CPU 10 cores 20
threads at C extreme CPU for last
generation so obviously now we have like
the 79 80 X II which is the 18 core 36
thread ridiculous behemoth when it comes
to power draw we've got the new Titan
X's out which I didn't even put in here
this is the the second type next the
first Pascal Titan X but not the newest
one because that's still stupid
confusing 64 gigs of ram and to you know
the 1200 watt power supply more than
enough for what I need overkill overkill
for what I need without did that but
perfect system to do rendering on
streaming on and gaming on but I don't
game I don't stream my games hardly any
more and when I do game it's things like
World of Warcraft or super you know
games that don't require a lot of
horsepower so that's why skunk works is
really good in kind of mi a there's been
a lot of like well why don't you build a
new system for home and take skunkworks
to the studio which was kind of a
perfectly rational thing to suggest but
I like looking at skunk works I like
having it here close to me so I don't
know what to do part of me kind of wants
to build a damn replica of it but I'm
anti replica right so I don't want to
build a replica of my own system you
know I build it's not a replica I guess
whatever I don't know so I don't know
what to do part of me wants to take that
79 80 XE and update
gunk works with that but that's like the
most unilateral or lateral upgrade ever
because I'll never use all those threads
here and I'll actually will diminish
some of my gaming performance and then
it's like well I could take the 8700 K
but that feels like a downgrade to me
compared to what I already have in here
so you guys see my dilemma that's why I
don't know what to do with this system
now there is a new there is some new
stuff coming out from case labs and so
I've been kind of toying around the idea
of using the new case that's coming out
and rebuilding skunkworks from scratch
which would then make at least sense to
use the newer hardware I mean what do
you guys think I should do do you think
I should keep the hardware I have now
and just do a new custom build in
another case with redo the two being
maybe something crazy kind of the thread
Ripper bill turned out amazing a lot of
you guys loved it with the most
unorthodox way of doing the tubing ever
and I really like the way it turned out
so I might do something like that but
with this being such a square case I
don't know if that would work well in
here but that's that's another it's
another conversation so that's why I'm
turning to you guys you know you guys
have helped build this up you guys have
made this system possible through all of
your support so I figured it's at least
it would at least make sense even though
it's my system yes to include you guys
on what you think I should do so that's
why I'm just putting out this quick vlog
here I mean watching Kyle build that
that elite system as he's talking about
the parts you know the fan tech Seeley
it's kind of fun for me because I get to
watch people when they get to do their
stupid overkill builds like that for the
first time and really just like see how
excited they are about it and Kyle's
video to be honest and then watching
Paul redo the arctic Panther which I
sort of helped him with on the first
version of that makes me excited to do
something again for myself so yeah
although you know those guys are redoing
their builds it's not has nothing to do
with that just their builds get me
excited about building something just
like when I do builds it makes you guys
excited about doing something so what do
you think I should do if there was just
no limit to what I could do right now
moving forward what would you what would
you have me do so anyway
put it in the comments down below guys
let me know what you think head over to
Twitter social media whatever because I
seriously don't know how I want to
proceed anyway guys thanks for watching
this quick vlog but I had to put this
out there I had to include you guys
because you guys are the reason why
this exists so thanks for watching I
will be reading the comments on this so
please suggestions good ones and you
might actually see it incorporated in
the build if I decide to build something
that's just how like unsure I am about
this anyway guys thanks for watching and
where you said that a few times but I
mean it I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
