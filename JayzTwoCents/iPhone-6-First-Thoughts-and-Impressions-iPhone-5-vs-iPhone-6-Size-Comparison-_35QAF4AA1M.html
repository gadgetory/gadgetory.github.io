to take a moment to tell you about ebay
for the wind calm if you're like
millions of people myself included
you're probably now looking for a way to
offload a last gen device because we
know the shiny new iPhone 6 and 6 plus
is out there's all sorts of really cool
android devices and you might be finding
yourself with a couple of extra devices
you don't need now right now if you head
on over to ebay for the wind calm you
can get up to four hundred dollars for
your last gen device in fact they are so
convinced that your device will sell for
a limited time if it doesn't sell
they're going to give you a one hundred
dollar coupon so why should the same me
collecting dust in your drawer head on
over to ebay for the wind calm right now
or at the end of this video and if you
do go now please come back to the video
and find out how much your last gen
device is worth so go at the at the end
of this video or if you go now just come
back that'll work too
what is going on guys js2 since you're
bringing you my video about the iphone 6
now it was a little bit unsure about how
i wanted to approach this video I didn't
know if I wanted to do aspects overview
video and unboxing an unboxing would
have been kind of silly for this device
actually there's really not a whole lot
in the Box I mean here's the box there's
some apple earbuds and a charger and
you're done so yeah anyway I went ahead
and picked up the iphone 6 not the six
plus but I'm gonna go ahead and be
honest with you guys I am NOT an apple
fanboy I am NOT the kind of guy who's
like I have to have the latest iPhone
because that's what makes me cool and
accepted amongst the hipsters now one
thing I want to go ahead and say at the
start of this video I know it's not
going to make much difference in the
comments but guys I'm one of those rare
people who carry full time two phones
one for work one for personal and my
personal phone now being the iphone 6 64
gig in white silver but I also carry a
galaxy s3 from Samsung for work so I
have the unique position of being one
those people who use Android and iPhone
on a daily basis so please don't tell me
Android can do this and Android can do
that and Apple can't do this and I know
guys I've got them both right here I've
also got a nexus 7 HD tablet as well as
an apple ipad now what also makes me
qualified to kind of give my opinion
about the way the iphone 6 feels and
first impressions from my opinion is my
company we do software development in
fact we write mobile apps proprietary
mobile apps and we have a hundred and
fifty devices in our company most of
them iphone some of them android and I
know what it's like to support these
devices because i work in ITA so i know
all of the ins and outs of android
probably more intimately than anybody
who would want to give me any sort of
opinion about why I was stupid to get
the iphone 6 but I'm going to tell you
guys why I got the iphone 6 that's the
whole point of this video isn't it
alright so I'm coming from the iphone 5
not the iphone 5s and in fact the iphone
5 was the longest i've ever owned a
device i owned it for the full two years
from launch of the iphone 5 through the
iphone 5s and to the iphone 6 now the
form factor of the iphone 5 i felt was
perfect it's squared edges made it easy
to hold
had a case on it but the squared edges
made it easy to hold it was nice and
thin the form factor was good i could
reach anywhere on the screen with my
thumb and i really enjoyed that now i
was actually a little bit concerned
about the bigger iphone screen yeah one
of the few people who was like I like
the size of the iphone and the bigger
screen is nice but I do find myself now
this is kind of awkward angle huh like a
t-rex the iphone 6 now is one of those
devices that i cannot reach the entire
screen with my thumb that was actually
one of the things I didn't like about
the samsung ya guys I don't like
massively sized screens so that's reason
number one why I did not go with the
iphone 6 plus I don't care for the note
i certainly don't care for the plus it
is far too big so i'm gonna go ahead and
set my android aside over here we're
leave it right here in view maybe people
will be able to see that that's a
samsung and you won't be like hey bro
shoot it out a sham John hey bro you got
an 8 whatever alright so the iphone 6
the size of this is actually quite
impressive though considering how thin
it is i mean what's impressing me
overall when it comes to technology is
not just how thin the iphone is how then
all the devices are i mean we are
getting to the point to where we're
getting massively sized screens super
thin which means once you put a case on
it you're not adding a ton of bulk and
things are just really really starting
to feel nice in the hint now the one
thing i don't like about the iphone 6
it's the same thing I didn't like about
my samsung is the rounded edges I don't
like the way that that feels so slippery
my hand like I'm going to drop it the
squared edges of the iphone gave it a
nice sturdy grip I never felt like I was
going to drop this thing so ever since
the iphone 4 with its great edges it was
much more comfortable to hold than any
android device in my opinion this is my
first time using the fingerprint reader
thing which you guys all know came out
with the iphone 5s but i really like
that what i do find a little bit kind of
taking some time to get used to as the
location of the sleep switch fact for
the first day i had the phone i kept
squeezing the top of my phone with my
body glove case i actually picked up a
body glove case for this it's a
stimulated carbon fiber it's kind of
neat but i found myself squeezing the
hell out of the top of my device going
turn on and I'm forgetting that it's on
the you know so that took a little bit
of getting used to but the overall
design is super sleek it's very very
light but the camera protruding out of
the back was something that I didn't
really I didn't really expect that from
apple and I think I even commented on
that during the keynote for the iphone
launch I even mentioned on twitter in
fact about following on twitter you
should i had a lot of interesting things
to say about the device on there the
Patricia the patrician patru dejun from
the back of the phone I feel like as a
design compromise they made for the
thinness of the phone and it's only
protruding about one maybe one and a
half millimeters now would have been
okay with an extra millimeter thickness
on the phone because you could have
probably even fit a larger battery in
there so I find that to be one of those
design compromises that I was a little
bit confused about think it's one of
those things where Steve Jobs was still
around that may not have ever happened
iOS 8 works as smooth as you would
expect from a company that designed the
hardware and the software they work
together flawlessly I did have some
issues with my Wi-Fi once again I was
pretty vocal on Twitter about the Wi-Fi
issues i was having where i was only
getting point four ish megabits down and
point one megabit up on my Wi-Fi but it
turned it out the issue is you have to
change your dns servers from your
default dms when you set up your router
to something like Open DNS or Google's
DNS which is a techie to date and then
everything starts working I found that
very very strange but whatever i'm sure
there'll be a software fix for that it
was a deal breaker for me until I found
the workaround then I was happy games on
this are absolutely phenomenal if you
guys if you got you guys might find this
a little bit surprising I actually spend
more time doing mobile platform gaming
on my iPhone in my galaxy then I ever do
on computer or console yeah guys I own a
console can you believe it and I'm just
I'm probably just breaking hearts all
over the internet right now aren't I but
the loading speeds on here is super fast
due to the nice upgraded hardware in
this that a 10 processor the extra ram I
mean everything on here just works
beautifully now one of the reasons why I
wanted this phone is because I'm a
Content producer I really liked the idea
of having a higher quality phone camera
both front-facing and rear-facing and
that 120 fps slow motion mode 60 FPS is
nice I've got the
on my by this this thing right here but
120fps I think I can find some creative
ways to start using that in the future
now overall I'm really happy with the
device and I expect this one to last me
at least two years now begs the question
Jay why didn't you get an android
personally guys I like the simplicity of
the UI I don't use widgets I don't care
about widgets I love a very technical
lifestyle I work in software development
I work in support I work in QA i'm doing
the youtube thing I'm constantly looking
at things at a very technical
perspective and when I pick up my phone
I do very simple things on it therefore
I want a very simple device well Jay you
can set up Android to be as simple as
you want therein lies the problem I
don't want to set up anything I'm very
very simple when it comes to my devices
and that's all I want so the simple UI
of iOS the simple integration between
hardware and software just working
flawlessly and like I said because I am
coming from also a android perspective
simultaneously again I don't know many
people who actually carry both phones at
the same time those of you who do know
exactly what I'm talking about and if
you don't it's probably a foreign
concept that you just aren't going to
grasp but I digress now guys I know
there's a lot of things this phone can
do that I didn't cover today but this
was more or less my impressions of the
iphone 6 and why i went with the iphone
6 and some of you right now are probably
completely and utterly disappointed and
heartbroken that I picked up the iphone
like I said don't fret i'm one of those
few people who actually use both here it
is and no i didn't just borrow this
phone from somebody to make a point in
this video it's actually mine i promise
i think one of my favorite games on here
is marshmallows in spaghetti if you guys
know what that game is it's really
addicting if you guys don't know what it
is you should go and download it
marshmallow and spaghetti is a lot of
fun it's a little building up then you
take marshmallows and you stick
spaghetti sticks it you have to build
structures it's really cool all right
guys I might get out of here tell me
what you guys thought about the little
integrated at the beginning of this
video it's actually the first time I've
done that and you may have noticed that
there was no Google Adsense ad on this
video because of that so I'm kind of
playing around with things to see how we
can progress the channel in the future
without getting entirely too invasive
either and keeping things relevant all
at the same time youtube is by far the
most interesting mmm
I have ever played all right guys it's
time to get the heck on out of here what
device are you using go ahead and just
Duke it out in the comments I know you
guys are going to all start fighting
amongst yourself because we're all
fanboys on some level aren't we yep I
went there all right guys follow on
twitter if you have any questions as
always I will see you in the next is
actually a micro-atx course these are
the size of this box very big box you're
doing something that's a double-wide
design so let's go and take a look at
this bad boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
