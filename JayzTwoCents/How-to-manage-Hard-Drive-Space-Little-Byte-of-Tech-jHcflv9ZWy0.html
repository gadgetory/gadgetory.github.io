Jays two cents and a lot of people ask
me all the time about easy ways to
manage their files and keep track of
their disk space on their computers and
that's exactly what we're gonna talk
about on today's little bita tip now
before we get started if you're new to
my channel or you stumbled across this
video somewhere out there on the
interwebs do me a favor and hit that
subscribe button show some support for
Jays two cents bringing any of videos
that empower you on becoming more
educated and more confident in doing
things with your computer so hit that
subscribe button hit that like button
and I hope to see you guys
stick around for more Jays two cents but
let's go ahead and get this thing
started I'd like to use a program here
called tree size you can see it right
here it's absolutely free and it's a
very simple program that basically just
queries your hard drive and shows you
where everything's at how big it is and
you know well if you if you need a
program to tell you how big it is you've
got bigger problems but anyways if you
click the Scan button here and look at
the local disk if you look over here in
my computer you can see I've only got
nineteen point three gigs free right now
on that drive so it's kind of important
to see what's going on and where all of
that information and all of that data
storage is going because you don't want
to run out of disk space especially if
you have a small SSD like I do but you
can see right here the moment we scan
the C Drive
I've got 41 gigabytes that are being
used up in Program Files Program Files
is the biggest file folder in my C Drive
so let's go ahead and take a look at
that and you can see right here it's
nearly double the size of Windows so if
I double click on that it expands it up
go to that origin games thirty five gigs
being used up on origin or we can look
at the percentage and see that Program
Files is used enough thirty eight point
seven percent of my drive and 85 percent
of that thirty eight percent is being
taken up by origin games and what game
is that
Battlefield three as you can imagine
battlefield three I don't like long load
time so I stuck that on the SSD but if I
was to really get tight for space I
would probably want to move that program
over to another Drive and I can know I
could free up thirty five
right then and there but we've got other
things going on in here as well whoops
if you take a look at the program files
you can see we've got nearly two gigs
being used up in common files and one
gig of the that is being used up right
here by Adobe now the cool thing too is
you don't have to expand it if you just
put your mouse over it you get some
information right here you can see that
the folder here is using 35 gigabytes
you can see who's got permission is to
make changes to it you can see the last
date that it was changed with how much
you know space is allocated to it how
many files the locations the full path
all that information is there so all you
got to do is hover over it and you can
see all of that but if we take a look
here at users you can see I've got 17
point two gigs being used up in the
users folder and if I take a look at
that there's my name and you can see
that we've got a lot of app data being
used up we've got one point three gigs
alone in the Documents folder and that's
because Adobe captivate cached projects
that's what I'm doing right now so if I
take a look at my hard drive you'll see
it's probably smaller than before nope
still in 19.3 but anyway so if you want
if you see a file that you know is junk
and you want to get rid of it let's go
ahead and say I want to take a look at
my public I've got four gigs with the
games there I've got 4.7 gigs being used
in cryptic Studios which is Neverwinter
and I know I don't want to play that
game anymore
so I can go ahead and just right-click
on cryptic Studios delete delete the
folder go to the recycling bin delete it
and look at that now we've got 24 gigs
showing right here on my SSD so tree
size is a very good program to use if
you want to identify where you using up
all of your space now I want to just
kind of point out how fast this drives
scanned as you guys saw if you go over
here to scan say my one terabyte drive
it's gonna take
well actually started cached I take that
back but anyways we've got 239 gigabytes
being that it's being used right here on
the drive and a hundred gigs of that
alone is my Steam library and then 54
gigs of that is my YouTube library and
then we've got World of Warcraft on here
I don't even know
I don't play the game anymore but you
can see it makes things a whole lot
easier when it comes to identifying
stuff so we've got you know 14 gigs with
the movies and effects we've got 11 gigs
in Adobe so it's very simple to identify
and if you guys need to know where some
of this information is and where are you
using up all your folder files it I've
found that my SSD a couple weeks back
was just slowly filling up and I logged
in one day and I got the low storage
warning and I was like what the heck
what was using up all the space so I was
able to bring up tree size and right off
the bat I was able to see that my iTunes
under users where is it it was at my
board set Program Files whatever anyway
the iTunes folder program files here we
go
iTunes was way up here on the top and it
was bigger than origin and what was
happening was every time I was plugging
my iPhone into my computer to charge it
was doing an automatic backup and what
it was doing is it was saving each and
every backup it wasnt overriding a
previous backup so I was getting about 7
gigs worth of backup every time I
plugged in the phone and it was just
padding up and adding up so I just came
to the YouTube full of files here I
opened it up and it said backups and I
deleted it and got all that space back
so there you go guys tree size it's
right here absolutely free download it
I'm gonna put a link to it in the
description check it out and as always
