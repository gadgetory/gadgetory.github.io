I moved into my old house it was a
rental and it had it had an 8 like a an
access panel for the networking in the
house because it had plugs and stuff
throughout the house and I did a video
showing how I set all that up how I
wired a switch and everything in there
and since then anytime we move one of
the most common comments we get is hey
Joe you're gonna do another networking
setup video well it's time
welcome to Jay's $0.02 to do networking
featuring cuz if we went cat 5 you'd
never let me hear the end of it
today's video is brought to you by Nord
VPN a VPN service I have been using for
years now like you wouldn't walk around
with a with your precious expensive cell
phone without a case on it would you
okay I guess plenty of you do but I
digress it will put a case around your
internet experience why let the ISPs
slow you down and control your data and
control your packets slowing down your
streaming services YouTube Netflix and
all that sort of stuff with article 13
and me constant up in the air no one
knows what's happening net neutrality
here in the US you can stop people from
spying on your internet connection and
your data and slowing down your internet
by connecting to a secure VPN an order
VPN has more than 5,000 servers in 60
countries using military-grade
encryption meaning nobody can keep an
eye or spy on your data besides you you
can get 75 percent off at 3 your
membership and if you use my offer code
J's 2 cents at checkout you get an extra
month for free so put a case around your
internet stop screwing around and
letting people control your data I'm
serious get an extra month for free and
75 percent off a three year membership
but using J's 2 cents at checkout so
what we're gonna do today is because we
work off of Wi-Fi a lot out here like
with our phones and stuff when we're
doing things like in a pinch for like
crap we got to download this 20 gig game
upload or update and stuff even though
we can get a good solid 600 ish megabits
per second download on Wi-Fi here on
Wi-Fi AC nonetheless which is amazing
that we can get 600 down there router
and their Wireless that they gave us
real
sex so we're gonna try to improve that
situation today by mounting my Nighthawk
out here running wire out of the office
back out to here and having a switch and
all sorts of stuff because not only are
we preparing for obviously having our
shop stuff hooked up to wired Internet
we are also gonna be setting up ingest
stations and all that sort of stuff and
a server and all of that but a server
doesn't serve too good if they don't
have internet to serve through or even a
connection for land so that's what we're
getting on Wi-Fi right now on fast com
this is actually Netflix the server this
isn't bad but I mean we pay for we pay
for a thousand right so we should at
least be getting our eight or nine
hundred am I really complaining about
this yes because because their hardware
sucks because we're dealing with
dropouts and we're dealing with restarts
and I don't know if it's just getting
overworked but if Phil is downloading
big files or something and I'm trying to
do something out here or as I'm a
conference call actually the other day
and it dropped out on me like four times
so obviously we we haven't done anything
with our quote-unquote editing and yet
we got a fan and air compressor in the
white and gold build all right so my
idea here was that I could just shove
this thing backed up through there I had
them I have to make that doesn't make
that hole bigger cuz the end is not
gonna fit through right yeah he did
exactly what I thought you did he just
screwed it into the drywall see just
like yeah oh man they charge a premium
for these installs and then they do this
 I technically could have just gone
up here - oh no no that's not a problem
the problem is that he drilled that hole
go no the honest truth cuz he could've
just hit that wall right and oh my god
it I'm and I'm the idiot and who drills
it straight to the drywall using a
freakin wood screws this is the wrong
kind of box for this there's different
types of boxes you can get for these
sorts of things and what you should be
putting in a drywall box like this are
the ones that when you tighten it up the
arms go whoop and they open up so then
it can't pull out let's go to Home Depot
because now we can get the stripper dead
wire stripper
yeah why not got some ones all right so
we just win and got the correct box so
this is what they use and I mean it just
makes me feel bad that an amateur like
myself can do a better job than somebody
that was paid to do this so this is the
box we would put in something like this
if you're only anchoring it to the
drywall these little tabs go down like
this and then as you tighten up these
screws the tabs come out and then they
will pinch like that so that's how it's
gonna end up being in the wall and then
what I did was I got a blank plate cover
to cover up the ugly hole that the cable
installer did so let's go ahead and get
this set up now I also have this fish
tape I have to get the coaxial or
another coaxial but the cat6 up through
the ceiling and then throw it over the
restroom through the drop ceiling that's
what's called drop ceiling fail don't
step on any of this we're going back to
Home Depot for the third time today No
well that's two ladders in one okay
go ahead right here in the video that's
when you find Sam Jason okay try not to
cut myself on any of the sharp metal up
here I know what's going to be like
going sideways yeah we clearly hit
something there's so much fiberglass for
you hey yeah teamwork after you put the
camera down and you came out here it
worked well so here's the end of the
fish tape coming up through the wall and
now I'm gonna take this coil and I'm
just gonna throw it over the other
there are good we're fine Phil relax
they got a little tag-along
yeah
alright so now I'm just gonna tape this
to our fish tape and then we can pull
this end back here
nito there see what happens when you do
it the right way so I want to talk about
something real quick in this build
series where we worked on our own stuff
there's been a couple of comments of
like Jay what why are you doing this
yourself Jay you can afford a contractor
why why are you why are you wasting your
time you could be making content so the
irony about those comments being made on
a video you're watching saying that
we're not making content while doing the
thing that we were making content while
doing I'm a DIY er if you haven't
noticed by now I DIY everything that I
can so that's why we do this and plus
some people learn some things along the
way and I've had some people comment
that hey this video was really helpful
you actually taught me something I've
always kind of wondered so that's why we
do it
it takes longer but we make content
while we're doing it we save money while
we're doing it it's fun I'll be honest
it's fun alright let's go ahead and pull
up a schematic for cat6 cuz I don't know
it off the top of my head and it's put
some ends and you can see where the
cable comes down this is where I threw
it over and you can see that this is
where they just kind of stapled into the
wall will sort of be doing the same
thing the only cable they had for cat6
was blue I would have gotten white but
they had B so yeah let's do it
so we should just be able to go like
boop boop boop boop hey that's okay
because you need to actually go farther
because we've got feed-through plugs
cat6 two cables for these are going to
the permanent core
so since network cable is twisted-pair
and it's that even whether it be cat 5
or cat 6 the colors are pretty much all
right so it doesn't matter if it's cat 6
or cat 5e they're all twisted-pair so
you've got obviously you've got a color
and then a colored stripe that matches
and so the order of these pairs does
indeed matter now we're gonna be doing
the was it 56b t568b specification it
doesn't really matter I don't believe on
either end at least the way I've always
done these is as long as it's the same
on both ends hell
these strippers are taking all my money
I was just saying it doesn't always done
it in the past is long than the same on
both ends there's different types of
plugins that you can get to and the ones
that are the most difficult in my
opinion to work with are the ones that
you have to cut off like just have a
quarter-inch showing because then you
have to have them all flattened in the
right angle and push it all the way in
hope it's seated all the way and crimp
it down well these are feed through
which means that the wires are gonna
feed right through the connector and
stick out the other end and I can put it
down as far as I need and then when I
crimp it it'll cut off the excess so
that's the way I'm doing it my first
time trying feed through I've always
I've always seen it I never used it
because I it's been a while since I've
had to make any cables we got 100 foot
of cat 6 and it's funny we could have
gotten away with cat 5 just fine because
the difference between cat 6 and cat 5
is signal loss over distance and
both are capable of 10-gigabit in these
distances of which our cable runs are so
we could have got away the cat 5 just
fine I swear to God I only spent more
money to do cat 6 to fend off some of
the comments I guarantee we would get if
we didn't do cat 6 like I swear to God I
caved and I hate myself for it I hate
myself as much as I hate the person out
there that would comment wing here kqs
which one ticks so anyway I guess we
both lose right
supportive July 10th ain't anything I
did it you're not helping felt like I
said in our lecture our electric wiring
video some electricians out there's like
you guys we do this and some network
guys out there just like judge my sleep
alright there's our orange stripe next
with that
these are orange good yet now that
network engineer is commenting yeah we
have to make cat six uphill both ways in
the snow Oh mother easy one try yes I
know I could have gotten the 110 type I
just don't like that one
oh cos J likes this one so much burgers
that's why yeah that's it alright so we
do have a switch that's gonna go in here
the switch will then plug into that
which will go out to the studio the
nighthawk will be out into the studio
and then we'll have to run off the
Nighthawk switch to like probably
another switch in the studio so it's
maybe I switch to switch to switch but
that's okay it'll still work perfectly
fine it's because it's solid you can
like straighten out the strands pretty
easy
easy we have this much more cable that
we can make ends with four cables with
if we need to so let me move my tools
plug in the Nighthawk and see if it
works oh wait we don't have an Internet
light of 505 and yea we don't have
internet why all the connectors
everything is there
well okay fill happen to point out I was
using the coaxial stripper and not the
actual RJ stripper so we think I may
have accidentally cut through a cable or
a wire or two or a pair or something so
we're just gonna redo both ends now
alright so I scan all right well I redid
the ends on both yeah we have Internet
so here we go nice alright let's test it
on the laptop I don't think we need to
deploy Wi-Fi 6 in our environment so we
need to finish now by tacking down the
wire haha alright here's the test do we
get neck tivity light and yes this is a
cat5 cable i know i sell to make the
other ones but i'm not doing that today
i couldnt tired impact100
yeah
all right so we're gonna be shooting a
hundred feet of cable to go from here to
here because I don't have a short cable
yet and I want to make another one yet
because this is all just temporary my
cables too hot man do you know what this
does to my cable management brain the
point of this video is so that we can
make sure everything works that our
cables work that our Wi-Fi works that
our switch works at all that stuff works
before we go and waste any time setting
up our desks and stuff because obviously
we just set up our office here okay
everything's set up with that stupid
hundred foot cable but it all works so
Wireless works the wired works we are
good to go so all it's left to do now is
to go in and reset the SSID and make
sure everything's configured do some
channel searching to make sure
everything is there's no interference
and stuff nearby but we have now got the
foundation for our network setup set
here now I know one of the common
question here's gonna be a bit J what
about your server what about your server
room your server rack you know I'm not
lying it's tech tips I don't have a
server room and I have a server record
I'll have a walnut' server and all that
stuff so we're a small operation we
literally have two people right now that
actually work on videos and 90% of it's
done through Phil and so we will
probably have literally a server machine
kind of probably sitting over there on
the floor I don't know we'll figure that
all out when the time comes worst case
scenario - it'd probably end up being in
the room with Phil in the office hooked
up to that 10 G that 10 gig so out 10
gig all local right there to each other
and then what we'll have over here or
somewhere is just an in gestation so
that we're working on something we have
a new project going you take the card
out let it ingest into the server and
he'll be working off the server
moving forward thanks for watching this
video again these work vlogs are about
getting work done and experiencing doing
it ourself obviously and you guys might
learn something along the way like us
misusing that stripper which was causing
me a problem misuse mistreated that
stripper man that's so bad that's so
terrible Phil I can't I wasn't even
thinking that it was you send your angry
letters to Phil all right I'm gonna go
guys thanks for watching and we will
we'll see in the next time by the time
you see this I'm probably in the Bahamas
Wow humble brag would hey I've never
taken a vacation like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
