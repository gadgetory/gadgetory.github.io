time has finally come
beep post Malone case is in my
possession which means that build can
finally start so I figure we start by
showing you guys the custom case and see
how well our renders and our thoughts
that we did in our last video actually
turned out in fact if you guys haven't
seen that last video go and watch that
one first because you'll see how we went
from concept to final products MSI
brings ultra-thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz of 1080p
panel Nvidia graphics and 8th gen Intel
CPUs make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more and how to preorder by
following the link in the description
below so this is very heavy weight this
is kind of gonna be like a retail
unboxing experience - for those of you
that have purchased the singularity
computer Spectre case because it comes
in a flight case this one weighs almost
a hundred pounds so it's really heavy
and this is it it's in here so we also
need to keep our fingers crossed that
you know FedEx Ground didn't give their
typical ground white glove treatment to
this thing the case does it look very
beat-up though so that's a positive can
you get a sense of just how heavy it is
okay you know what this is a workbench
it's meant to get messed up right so the
reason why singularity computers went
with this flight case is because it
needs to be able to survive the trip I
don't know if they're actually making
these in Australia or the States or what
but they need to be able to survive the
trip so this is the same kind of stuff
you would see like a band or a musician
or whatever when they go on tour you see
tons and tons of these because they can
actually withstand the abuse this is the
first time I've opened this so if
anything is wrong we're gonna find out
together
oh yeah there we go all right that's it
guys gnomes king so we need to take this
out of here obviously I don't want to
damage anything this custom guitar head
idea that I had in the middle of last
video I want to go back to that rear
piece I told you about that I think it's
gonna look really cool I threw this idea
at them and they basically said yeah we
could do that so I'm gonna ask you what
does that shape sort of look like to you
Tennessee okay okay I was thinking head
of a guitar yeah that's cool like it
looks like a guitar neck in the head
so what we're actually thinking about
doing with this is incorporating guitar
strings in that tuner knobs wood trim
and making this look like a Fender so
that's cool is there a particular guitar
brand you like more than other I mean
fender tele is okay can't get much quiet
it looks like the tele it is kind of
interesting because it is I put some
pictures of some teaser pictures up on
Twitter and a lot of folks were mad that
we mutilated a guitar head for this
build it's not a real guitar head so I
guess that means James did a great job
now Daniel a singularity computer also
made me the custom cable set for this
which unfortunately I left at home I
planned on threading it into the case
we'll talk about that in a sec - oh look
- she like milled in barbed wire on the
plexi there all right so one of the
suggestions that I had had was this
guitar head being built in to the case
because all of you guys may just be like
oh he's a rapper blah blah blah
he's also a rock artist he likes rock he
plays guitar and this is that right here
they actually went with true fender
locking keys for the strings that are on
here these are real strings these
actually do
tighten up but this is made out of curly
maple right here and this is actually
the same kind of wood that EK water
blocks is going to be using to match the
custom wood pieces for this build like I
showed you guys at Computex
so yeah this was definitely a spared no
expense
type of deal here this is nuts this goes
in like that and then this grew go see
right there so I need to go ahead and
screw this down once I do that then we
can actually tighten those strings a
little bit so let's go ahead and get
this piece in there like all of this is
put together real like kind of loose let
me go ahead and just get this attached
we'll do some glamorous b-roll montage
you will task fill with that and then
we'll get in here and take a real close
look
so here's where the guitar head looks
like reinstalled and the strings do
indeed work not tuned obviously I have a
tin ear but besides that we used real
fender locking key or nobs keys locking
keys we use curly maple on this you can
see that this looks very much like a
real Gibson guitar head which that's
what the back part screamed to me when I
first saw the prototype was like dude
let's do a guitar head on this and that
would really tie in the whole musical
theme on this but it doubles as the GPU
hold down so there's a bit of structural
rigidity to this as well it has to be
that's what's gonna be holding the GPU
down on to the motherboard but this
curly maple and the way it's stained and
polished and the the grain on this just
look so good so that's why when I saw
the water the wooden water block parts
the ek was showing at Computex I was
like I need that
so I told them what kind of wood it is
they're gonna recreate those parts in
the same kind of wood so this theme will
tie in to some of the water loop as well
I stopped and decided though what I'm
gonna do in terms of rigid tubing I
might even do soft bent tubing on this I
know that seems to go against a lot of
my grain I'm not entirely decided yet on
how I'm gonna do it now I heard a lot of
you guys talking about do beer bong res
do a beer bong res the reservoir if you
guys recall is built into the back
motherboard wall or motherboard
distribution block tray wall whatever
you want to call it on this case the
water cooling is integrated into this
you have a radiator on top radiator on
the front the water pump as you can see
is built into the reservoir on the
motherboard tray it all distributes
throughout this plate and then it has
fittings that pop out in various
locations that they considered to be
pretty typical on where you would route
route your loop and then your power
supply goes down here
but what I want to show here real quick
obviously is the custom Bentley grill
because this was most definitely the
creme de la creme right is that the is
that the word I'm looking for here this
is the star of the show obviously
because remember the album is beer bongs
and Bentley's so we had to have a way to
incorporate Bentley into this theme and
basically we had the idea of like
putting a Bentley grille on the front
but rather than trying to buy a real
Bentley grill which obviously would be
way too
this was custom made from scratch this
was all custom designed by James past
more obviously the singularity computers
it's water jetted this grill was all
made to order the weaving of the metal
absolutely gorgeous they spent a lot of
money designing this piece so we are
obviously hugely grateful for that I'm
have to do a little bit more polishing
on this I think though I think some of
the polishing work could have been
improved so I'll do a little bit more
polishing on this myself fortunately I'm
comfortable with metal work so we will
make this look a little bit better but
as you can see that we've got barbed
wire going around the outside because
post Malone is hugely into barbed wire
it's pretty obvious he has barbed wire
tattoos we've also got his name put
right here on the side post Malone and
then we've got a very coppery steampunky
style for a power button and which has a
very satisfying click when you push it
and one thing that's changed a little
bit since the prototype and this isn't
just for post Malone's I think they're
doing this on all their cases is we now
have integrated cable combs for the
routing for the cables because not only
is this a distribution block for fluid
it's also a route a cable routing
mechanism as well so that's why I said
in the beginning this video that Daniel
made cables for this based on the power
supply I told him I'm going to use so
the links are all perfect so it can make
that radius without kinking or any of
that stuff unfortunately I forgot the
cables at home where I would have put
them in but you guys you guys will just
see that in the build log when this when
the build officially starts getting
parts put into it but I have most of the
parts here and that build will be
starting very very soon but these are
actually made out of aluminum they are
not plastic they're not gonna break on
you they're put in various strategic
locations to allow you to stack cables
on top of each other if needed or for
you to be able to you know route them in
the manner which they're meant to go so
for instance your PCI Express power
cable free GPUs is going to spit out at
the proper spot the 24 pin obviously the
8 pin EPS power you've got you know
basically it's 8 wide so that way if you
want to run dual 8 pin EPS if you're
running like X 299 or X 99 that requires
or even thread Ripper that requires
extra power for your CPU you can run
those side-by-side and I have to worry
about there not being enough room
but this these screws are here on the
corners are also in the Smith
here is how you hold on this back cover
so you take those four screws out this
comes off and then you can access your
cable routing also too you can see we've
got a built-in quick disconnect right
here which also doubles as your drain
valve so you can take the other half of
the quick disconnect plug that in with a
ball valve on the end and then you can
easily drain your loop this is the
lowest point of the loop it will make it
a lot easier to drain your system
because obviously without there being an
actual reservoir like a tube reservoir
you're not gonna have any extra fittings
to be able to tap into to drain the
system so this being here is definitely
a nice added bonus you also have this
plug right here which can be accessed to
aid in filling or draining whichever you
guys you know obviously need to use it
for so guys it's about time and the
reason why I even made this video just
like the Terry Crews build I wanted it
all to be a surprise I decided because
this has been so post pwned because of
all this custom work it was worth
showing off right away not only to stop
all the people wondering what happened
to the build but also just to show why
it took so long because the amount of
custom work that has gone into this is
unlike anything I have ever done on this
channel so you guys know what to do hit
that like button if you guys appreciate
the level of work that is going into
this and trust me when I say the final
product when this is all put together is
going to be worthy of being a
centerpiece representing an extremely
popular album we wanted this to be alive
before the album went out that way this
could be kind of a centerpiece for that
album for him but I think the wait is
definitely going to be worth it so tell
me what you guys think down in the
comments below I can't wait to get
started on this and this is definitely a
primary focus going forward
once I get the wood part to me Kay but
fortunately they are on fast track to
get that done as soon as possible so
guys thanks for watching and as always
we will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
