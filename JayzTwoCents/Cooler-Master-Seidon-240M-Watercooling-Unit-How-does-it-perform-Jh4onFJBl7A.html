and keeping in the tradition of water
cooling month here October is kind of
unofficially become water cooling month
here on Jays two cents I've showed you
the basic water cooling build I've
showed you the advanced water cooling
build and it wouldn't be complete now if
I didn't show you an all-in-one water
cooling unit so today we're going to
take a look at the side in 240m sent to
us by the awesome guys over at cooler
answer
today we are going to take a look at the
Coolermaster site in 240 M this is a 240
M because it is a dual 120 millimeter
fan radiator it's designed to directly
compete with the Corsair units and the
NZXT units and the thermal take units
there's a lot of all-in-one cooling
options now coming out on the market
because water cooling is becoming more
mainstream so on the packaging here you
can see this is still factory sealed
it's got the cellophane on it it's brand
spanking new it says right here on the
front liquid liquid cooling or liquid
CPU cooler and it's maintenance-free and
it's efficient design for overclocking
so they're specifically targeting
overclockers with this unit and that's
obvious by the fact that it is a dual
120 millimeter radiator on the back of
the packaging here nothing special you
just see some dimensions here it is
mentioned that it's a dual radiator the
thickness on this radiator is 27
millimeters thick so it's a little bit
smaller than say a standalone 30ml
radiator if you were to build one of
your own custom loop but it does have
the block and the pump and the coolant
and everything built in to one package
that goes on top of your CPU which is
the way pretty much everybody is doing
it now with all-in-one cooling units now
on the back here we have a tiny little
little bit of English it's just right
here I'll go ahead and read that it says
it's prefilled it's a closed-loop liquid
cooling system it requires zero
maintenance so that's what really
appeals to people who are breaking in to
water cooling but they're not confident
yet to go with their own full custom
loop is it it is maintenance-free you
don't the fill it drain it flush it none
of that stuff it is ultrafine micro
channel cold plate optimizes water flow
and heat dissipation so there's a lot of
technology inside the block to create
the most amount of heat transfer
possible in a small package because
that's kind of these down the downsides
these all-in-one units is you have to
fit a lot of stuff in a tiny little
package
durable and powerful water pump
dissipates heat effectively and
maintains temperatures through stable
water circulation so it's got a pump
that moves water it's a large aluminum
radiator with a wide rpm range pwm fan
creates a superb balance between cooling
and efficient noise so it is an aluminum
radiator not a copper or brass radiator
so that's going to kind of it's going to
do two things one aluminum is a great
dissipater of heat not as good as copper
and brass is still debatable a lot of
people don't like using brass but it's
going to keep the weight down it's not
going to be very heavy in fact this
whole package is not really that heavy
and then it says universal mounting
solution it fits all Intel LGA your 2011
2011 50 1366 1155 1156 775 an hour AMD
sockets FM 2 FM 1 + 3 + 3 + a.m. - so
it's going to fit any CPU you've got
basically with this one box so let's go
ahead and pull out my my trusty my
little knife here let's go ahead and
bust a single nevermind the blood on
this thing it's it's been well used so I
will go ahead and take my little knife
here and we'll bust the sylvain on this
thing because it is brand new
there we go
okay so it is a lot like a lot of boxes
now is a little flip box you flip it
open and then you find some very
high-tech foam awesome stuff I love this
stuff it is taste amazing
okay so anyway full you've got your fans
here individually packaged and they do
come shipping with and as I mentioned I
don't know how to open up ziplock
baggies I never figured that part out
okay the fan then it comes with here is
its there coolermaster it's a high
static pressure fan I don't know the
exact model number of this fan it's got
a really cool kind of a hologram looking
thing there but it's a very high
pressure fan this is what they advertise
on their website and you do get two of
these fans you have your instruction
manual that is I do recommend looking at
this you know most of the time being
being the man that I am I would just
take these and I would you know toss
them over my shoulder but you want to be
sure that you're mounting it properly to
your socket so you definitely want to
hang on to that you have all of your
mounting hardware
it's got your backplate for AMD you've
got all your different brackets here for
Intel it's got it looks like it's got
some splitters in there or get sure that
you can actually hook up all of these
fans oh look at this you have a rubber
gasket this is really cool because this
is designed to break down vibrations
when you mount your radiator to your
case usually it's a solid mount so the
fans vibrate right through the radiator
right through the case and then you get
a kind of an unpleasant sound but this
rubber gasket is designed to eliminate
that so really cool glad to see that as
I mentioned earlier you do have your pwm
splitter so you could put both fans
directly up to your CPU header and I do
recommend using PWM if you have it
available because PWM allows your fans
to ramp up and slow down based on cpu
load not so much temperature so you can
kind of be proactive on the temperature
rather than reactive of having your fans
ramped up after they reach a certain
temperature so it's definitely a benefit
it does come with some Coolermaster
thermal paste it's not pre-applied you
apply it yourself which is both good and
bad if you're a newbie you definitely
want to make sure you're applying it
properly but you've got all your
retaining brackets and screws for all of
your different socket sets you're not
going to pull all these out I don't want
to lose any of it you get your your bag
of silica gel the don't eat that and
then you have the actual unit right here
and I don't believe it anything else in
the box so go into the box aside okay as
I mentioned because this is aluminum
it's very very light there's very little
weight to this but as you can see feel
it carefully some of the fins ours are
you can kind of see that right here some
of the fins are kind of bent a little
bit already
that's normal guys don't freak out over
that I've seen people on forums freak
out saying some of my bins were pens
were bent fins are bent fins were bent
that's what drives it it's no different
than a radiator in your car there's a
very very thin pieces of aluminum
they're gonna get bent just don't smash
your hand against it you're not gonna
have a problem you can take a tiny
screwdriver and kind of straighten those
out if you want it's not a big deal
trust me don't sweat it the block here
has its power cord which is also PWM so
it hopefully if you have two PWM headers
usually on a higher-end motherboard or
even mid end motherboards today have PWM
for CPU one and CPU optional headers I
would set the fan are the pump probably
on CPU two and then put the fans on CPU
one but everything is contained in here
and it's got a nice cover here
protecting the copper block and the pump
is built into that and then you have
obviously here your radiator now it does
have here a warranty void if removed and
a do not tamper with blah blah blah this
is the fill port they used to pre-fill
the system so you don't want to mess
with that you want to take it off and
want to try and drain it or anything
this is completely maintenance-free now
the first thing that comes to mind is
that the tubes are a little bit small
they're really thin but because you're
dealing with such a small package unit
as I mentioned in some other water
cooling bills it doesn't matter how
thick they are they because you're
dealing with such a small unit here
there's going to be more than enough
flow and then you do have you know they
are bendable you know that they do
rotate here on the block so you don't
have to worry about you know but getting
it in just the right position so what
we're going to do now is we are going to
take our NZXT x58 system over here on
the side whether you can or can't see
that and we are going to put this unit
in there we're going to replace inside
this unit it's got a 120 millimeter
all-in-one cooling unit in there now
we're going to do some before
temperatures and then we are going to
replace it with this unit and we're
going to see exactly how it performed
and then after we check out the stock
performance we're going to stick these
jet flow 120 fans in a push-pull
configuration on this radiator just
because these fans are awesome and we
have four of them so why the heck not so
let's go ahead and do that will record
the temperatures before and after and
then we'll come back and bring you guys
the results and give you final
conclusions on this cord okay so this is
our test system before we've actually
installed the site into 40m it's an X 58
with an i7 970 and it's got basically a
generic no brand name posted 120
millimeter with push-pull fans on there
if we take a look at the temperatures on
this thing right now we are currently
doing a stress test here we can see
we're almost reaching 100 degrees on
these cores so we may or may not have a
thermal taste of thermal taste a thermal
paste problem on this system but we are
going to go ahead and we're going to put
in the site 240m and see just exactly
what happens on the system
there we go we got the Sidon 240m now
hooked up to our system our x58 I've got
it mounted outside of the case just
sitting here because this case is only
200 millimeter friendly as you can see
there's no holes for 200 millimeters on
top some might say those are the holes
but nope that's not 240 millimeter
friendly so anyway as you can see the
fans at stock speed even though they are
hooked up to a PWM controller there are
running at full speed and they are
fairly noisy at a hundred percent but I
mean there's so much air commander you
can probably hear it on the camera there
that's okay
you want the air flow because look at
our temperatures they came all the way
down into the 60s and low 70s from the
90s the upper 90s so yeah there you go
having over more tests we want to do
real quick we want to throw for jet flow
120 s on this and let's see just what
happens well there we go
you can hear me over the fans we've got
all four jet flows running at 100% fan
speed and the temperatures are not
really any different to be honest with
you hopefully can hear me over there I
mean they're good they're definitely
good but they're about the same
temperature as they were with the stock
fans that come with this thing so it
just means that the cooler is so
efficient it's doing its job with the
the airflow that comes with the fan so
the jet flows look pretty awesome but
the fans that come with the kit are
surprisingly really good so there you
have it the site in 240 M from
Coolermaster it's a really good
all-in-one cooling unit for less than a
hundred bucks it comes with some things
that I'm very excited about like the
rubber gasket that goes between the fans
and the radiator the fans that come with
it are absolutely great static pressure
fans they're a bit noisy though I
definitely recommend using some sort of
a voltage reducer or fan controller or
hook them up the PWM fan headers
your motherboard so you can control the
speed because again can get very noisy
but then again the static pressure on
these is so great that you can slow them
down and still maintain great cooling as
you saw on the x58
computer that we did the test with and
not to mention because they are standard
bolt patterns you could go with
something extreme like we did here by
putting four of the jet flow 120 s on
there and it just looks really awesome
the only thing I do wish it this came
with though was its own proprietary
software to control the speed of the
fans that way you could set up a profile
so you could have a noise profile so you
can control how loud they are you know
you can ramp them up when you're gaming
or you can turn them down when you just
browsing the web and you control the
fans there's a lot of motherboards that
give you that sort of flexibility but it
would be nice if it was included with
this kit but again for 100 bucks you
can't really go wrong with this so if
you guys like this product here from
Coolermaster the side and 240m
all-in-one water cooling unit check out
their website their information is down
in the description they've got a whole
line of cooling you've definitely know
Coolermaster especially with the
popularity of the hyper 212 and the 212
ebo and the whole line of cooling
products and they've definitely got
something that will meet your needs
we've got more Coolermaster reviews
coming up on the channel we've got a
v700 power supply we've got the N 600
mid tower case and we've got the control
rx so super smooth gaming mouse pad so
you guys don't want to miss that as
always I'll see you in my next video if
you liked the video you know what to do
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
