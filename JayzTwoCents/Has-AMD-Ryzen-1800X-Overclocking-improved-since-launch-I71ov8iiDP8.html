today's video do me a favor and click
this video that's going to pop out right
here if you guys want to win some
amazing PC hardware that I'm giving out
as a celebration for the 1 million
subscribers that I'm about to pass so
with that out of the way make sure you
guys are subscribed and following on
Twitter and you get to entries into
winning that of it hey I'm trying to
shoot a video here you guys have a
chance of winning some amazing stuff so
go do it do it now what's up guys
today's to since you're coming at you
with another rise end video who would
have guessed this was going to be a
little bit more of a vlogging format
because I've well I'm alone today Nick
won't be here till tomorrow so we're
going to play around overclocking on
Verizon has been a couple of BIOS
updates to the crosshair 6 hero
motherboard there's also some micro code
updates as well as some more stability
improvements when it comes to memory all
things I was struggling with when I
first put this system together so I
figured this is kind of a neat video
where we're kind of three weeks forward
from the launch let's see how much has
actually changed in the past three weeks
cooler masters master key Pro series of
keyboards offer sixteen point seven
million color RGB genuine cheery
switches a variety of sizes as well as
surface mounted controls allowing full
customization without the need for
stand-alone software learn more by
following the link down below I've also
got this right here and we trying out
with this this is the new g.skill flare
X memory as you can see it says designed
for AMD rise end platforms what's plenty
is right under that it's just compatible
with Rison she asked me if this was
designed for Rison this should say
compatible with Intel I don't know
especially reminds me a lot of the first
ddr4 memory from g.skill which was the
RIP jaws for that heat spreader looks a
lot like it again more of this whole AMD
compatible ddr4 I would hope so since
it's designed specifically for it at
least according to the package and the
question begs to be asked could I have
made it any harder on myself to get this
memory out of here to that cross type
it's doable just move that woo-hoos
cringing right now Oh cringe cringe
cringe I do feel like the Corsair
Vengeance LP X though is much more
aesthetically pleasing than the flare X
but clearly just
a woman with more than the bare minimum
amount of flair thumbs up if you guys
know that movie right now a little
disclaimer everything that you guys are
about to see is exclusive to the ACE
whose crosshair six hero my 1800 ex that
although it should apply also to 1700
and up and then obviously the g.skill
memory but of course before doing any
sort of overclocking attempts make sure
you have adequate cooling and make sure
you have all the latest bios and such
installed on your your system so at that
said I obviously have all the latest
BIOS and micro code and everything
installed on this system so let's start
overclocking and the only reason I even
have the AMD risin master software on
here is specifically to monitor
temperatures we are all stock right now
eight a baseline at least compare where
we kind of started from but I don't like
this software AMD software has always
been super bug I mean look even just
trying to move the window around it
keeps like sticking why is that sticky
literally like it gets stuck
what's it look Chuck again so yeah I'm
just using it to monitor temperatures
because it's really the only accurate
way look at that we're already idling
and they mid-40s on water yeah that's
just water in there well those other
things too but you get the idea
now I'm also going to be using Cinebench
to just kind of compare our results keep
in mind though that Cinebench by itself
is not a very good way of determining
the stability of your system and it's
nothing more than a benchmark number to
give you comparison comparative results
you need to check it with whatever your
daily workflows are the programs you use
games and all that sort of stuff to
determine its overall reliability with
that out of the way let's go ahead and
do our baseline test once you to
temperatures to here on water stock
bolts and everything it still shoots up
to 61 point 5 C oh it's a warm ship I'm
going to give it that it is it is a warm
ship AMD has stayed true to form on that
one
ok the results are in and we ran a 1560
on our very first base run it's not too
bad and that was at 3.7 gigahertz on all
cores so that's the factory settings
that's what it did all by itself SMT is
on all that crap so let's go into
overclocking something I want you to
keep in mind though as we move forward
is when I built this system the fast
so I could achieve with 4.0 at 2667
memory I was not able to achieve any
faster memory speeds even by relaxing
the timings if I was anywhere near 4.0
gigahertz so I'm going to take any
speeds faster than that today as an
obvious improvement in the optimization
of BIOS maybe the RAM compatibility is
helping here I don't know exactly what
they changed they don't even say on the
package what they change it just as
optimized for Rison whatever that means
so maybe that's going to help moving
forward but I'm kind of curious to see
how far we can actually push this today
most of the reviewers who were doing
overclocking guides and whatnot were not
able to achieve anything faster than
about 3.9 that's one of the reasons why
I held off doing my overclocking video
as I felt it was a little bit premature
to do it out of the gate especially on a
brand new architecture like this so
let's see if there's any improvement
look at that voltage dome Anas that's a
lot of hole right there
I mean I know it can handle it and I
believe one point three seven five is
what AMD said don't go higher than when
you're doing manual clocking somebody
also want to mention here there's a lot
of comments in there as well when I did
my comparison between the 59 60s and
1800 X and rendering all ddr4 runs 21 33
megahertz out of the box unless you
overclock the memory the speed that you
actually see printed on the module is
the XMP profile which is a memory
overclock the base Ram speed on all ddr4
is 21 33 something else I want to
mention is people were saying that the
3000 megahertz ram on the test bench
over there on intel with a was a clear
indication that I was trying to stack it
guys this lpx is also 3000 megahertz but
didn't matter they were both running
2667 yeah was I was I say was I say
fellas does it say 3000 right it says
three thousand three zero zero zero
what's that one say does that one say
3000 I can't I can't tell on how my
glasses so now that we put all that crap
to bed let's go ahead and start playing
around this is actually a few
overclocking profiles already included
with the crosshair motherboards what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to load before
gigahertz OC profile and kind of start
from there and I want to see what
changed here so I put the memory to 2400
megahertz
put the multiplier to 40 or B cloth
stage of the hundred the divider stays
the same custom CPU core ratio says Otto
but anyway but it's a 40 there so let's
go ahead change the memory frequency as
well to 29 33 let's just see if we can
even boot that voltage I don't like the
high voltage number so I'm going to
change that myself I'm gonna try
something lower like a one point three
seven five I'm gonna see if it even
works okay we're looking for the green
light up we had a green light so
therefore that means we're going to boat
we're going to boot switch port there it
is I mean the fact that I'm even posting
is a big deal because I couldn't even
get that far I would just get a nine an
error code 9 on the motherboard before
if I tried to go anywhere over like I
said that 2666 with a four gigs CPU so
the fact of reading Windows now is
already an improvement that's pretty
cool alright we're looking for a couple
of things here one our idle temps as you
can see have already jumped up to well
it's in the mid to upper 50s I saw 61
there but we are running four gigs it
just it didn't save our stock result so
what was it a 1517 I believe that's what
it was all right let's go and run the
CPU see if we even start do we crash and
finish temps have already gone up to 75
76 staying at 4 gigs it's not throttling
at all 100% utilization and our score
went up to a 17 17 that was quick and
easy by just clicking a couple button
you can also hit like if you know the
struggles of just making sure you don't
miss a post you know to get into the
BIOS because then you go wait two
windows to boot and start all over
it's got magic
some like to hold it I'll expand great
so our core voltage did state under 1.4
explained those I put one point three
seven five and you can see it went up to
one point three nine five I just don't
like that it does a different value than
I tell it what's the point of manual
mode if it does what it wants to do
anyway now the cool thing about the four
gigs though is all we did was load the
preset reduce the voltage a little bit
and bump up the memory to 29 33 I don't
want to go any faster on the memory just
yet my next jump is 3,200 I want to see
if we can get 4.1 out of this if there's
the green Wow are we actually going to
boot 4.1 I've never got holy hill the
thing I find kind of surprising about
all of this though is we're still
sitting on much less voltage than it was
actually giving stock I stock I was
seeing it go as high as like one point
four eight stock let's see if it starts
the Senate bench test let's alone
completes it so there we are 4.1 temps
are the same because we haven't really
changed the voltage at all log truck
driving by and let's start it ah let's
pray that Verizon has probably one of
the most dramatic crashes when it comes
to overclocking like Intel what kind of
blue screen or we'll just hard stop or
hard lock AMD is like black screen and
you just kind of lets going mm what
happened okay so what I'm gonna do right
now is instead of pulling the the
megahertz back I'm going to try and bump
up the voltage a little bit well this is
that this is actually nice to see it
detects if you overclock failed and
wants me to run the setup on the
previous BIOS that never did that ever
I'm kind of me you want to do I'm just
with the voltage mode on manual I want
to see where it tries to bring this
puppy oh my god I'm getting too old to
spin the spinning the other way clear a
bad spin going one way nope it just
makes it worse we are 4.1 so I have no
idea what the volts are going to be I
expect this temperature to jump up quite
a bit so let's see if we get the same
crash here at 4.1 oh yeah if there goes
damn new Ryan huh check this out even
though I left it at Auto it didn't give
us any more volts that we had when we
had a manual set so let's go ahead and
manually set that if you like 1.4
five what the hell why not I mean if I
blow it up that's really going to suck I
don't think it's going to blow up I mean
it would suck to replace the CPU I'm
going to say the new voltage took effect
because we've gone up significantly on
our idle temp it went all the way up as
high as like 63 second ago alright come
on baby make it through one just make it
through one test come on baby come on
baby
we're not throttling we're step four
point one eighty three point seven five
C very hot but ah look at that
17:55 I don't think 1800 is going to
happen wonder if I can push more memory
now before I rebooted I did one more
test and it did actually complete 84.5 C
on the socket that is there's a lot
before I increase the memory I'm really
the voltage where it's at I'm gonna try
four point two and unfortunately four
point two is not making it to the
desktop so back down to four point one
we go I'm not up the net voltage anymore
and he'll know okay so we go 3,200
memory and I reduced the multiplier to
41 let's see if that will even post whoa
whoa Oh thirty-two hundred megahertz ram
has just booted show me what you get
okay it's runnin temp sir
as expected of an 80 83 it's going to
try get 84 because I am still running
that massive amounts of V core stuck at
84 or 0.25 84.5 oh wow look at that it
came down I came all way down to 16 85
by speeding up the memory let's run this
again see what happens not seeing any
sort of fluctuation here okay it does
feel like it's going slower though
that's crazy
we got sixteen ninety-one that's crazy
so it's still at 4.1 it's not throttling
so interestingly enough it never
throttled yet we lost approximately 50
points a little bit over 50 points by
simply pumping up the memory so I guess
the next thing to do is put the memory
back down to like the 29 33 or whatever
it was and see if that score comes back
up that's crazy
so I was feeling this score
to be significantly higher we're not
throttling we're set four point one
temperature is at eighty four point five
before we go any higher to probably
start the throttle so I'm gonna pull the
voltage back next but yeah okay so it's
about to finish I'm expecting over 1,700
on this one yeah
17:38 so I slowed the memory down and
got it faster result a better result now
in order to verify these weird results
I've got to go back to 3200 and see if
it slows down again and 3200 check ok
one last time 3200 and there we go
nothing swaddling or good see what the
next score is 1752 so that time it went
up ah we get strange results is
important to double check and redo your
test because obviously something went
weird with that last boot where now I
did see a little bit of a jump in speed
of 1752
now I know 4.2 is not going to boot and
I don't I can't even go any faster on
the memory without playing with the B
clock settings I'm not going to do that
today I think this video has already
been long enough with 4.1 at 1752 is
pretty impressive my whole mission here
today was to see if there was any sort
of improvements when it came to
overclocking on rise and in the last
three weeks especially considering I had
some pretty lackluster results initially
but the recent updates to the microcode
4 horizons processors and the latest
bios especially on the crosshair is
giving better results and I was getting
even 3 weeks ago so that's a good thing
if we're seeing improvements like this
already in just three weeks I can't wait
to see we are in three months and
potentially next year also to this
particular BIOS that I'm using isn't
quite out yet it should be out maybe
next week but it has very very minor
differences between the was at 904
that's already out but you guys can look
for this BIOS here coming out very soon
if you're running on a crosshair board
but go ahead and run the the latest
official BIOS on the website and you'll
get similar results for this so what I
got to do now is I got to fine-tune this
voltage the voltage is way too high 85 C
on water way too hot someone pull the
voltages back I'll probably have to go
back down to 4.0 and that's fine with me
that's more than more than enough 100
megahertz isn't going to make or break
how fast things run but it could also
decrease the stability when I bring out
and that's not okay also make sure you
guys stay tuned next week we're going to
have some fun here because what's more
fun than playing around for the GTX ten
atti playing around with two of them
alright guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
