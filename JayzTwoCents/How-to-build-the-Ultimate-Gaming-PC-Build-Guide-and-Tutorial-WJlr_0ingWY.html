cents and today we're going to learn how
to build a computer using all of this
okay guys so as I mentioned today we're
going to learn how to build a computer
using these components here this build
had one thing in mind and one thing in
mind only besides being as much power as
we could put in a small case but that
one thing being a small case this buyer
has portability as the most important
factor to his build so for that I went
ahead and chose the silverstone ft 0 3
fortress case as you can see here it is
very small it is very light and we are
going to talk a little bit more about
this later when we start the build but
it's quite a bit different than my 900 d
which are used to same for graphics
we're going with the EVGA GTX 780
superclocked graphics card a lot of
people may or may not like team Nvidia
doesn't matter this particular buyer
wanted to go with something as powerful
as they could get for right now - the
Titan didn't want to waste any money for
that we chose the GTX 780 for a power
supply we are using the Silverstone
Strider gold evolution it is AP 80 plus
gold rated power supply and this power
supply unit is a 750 watt with 850 max
output capability we're not going to use
anywhere near that amount of power and
because we're putting it in such a small
case we are using the Silverstone
Strider gold pp0 5 short cable kit this
allows us to take out because this is a
fully modular power supply so it allows
us to get rid of those long cables and
we could have much tidier cable
management in this case by using this
short cable kit specifically for our
power supply to keep everything cool
we're going to toss out those
Silverstone fans and we're going to toss
in some SP 120 Corsair fans these fans
are amazing fans I definitely live by
these fans I've got 12 of them in my
case alone keeping the CPU cool we're
going to go ahead and go with the H ATI
here from Corsair it is an all-in-one
unit there's nothing you have to do
maintenance wise it's just completely
contained no filling no draining just
plug it in and go and it is software
controlled so it'll control the fans
based on its needs for RAM we are going
with the Corsair Vengeance Pro this is a
16 gigabyte kit I do
channel kitt 1866 megahertz but we are
going to be overclocking this ram a
little bit for the cpu we are using the
intel 4770k a lot of people are going to
wonder why i went with the cpu
considering my entire video about why I
went 3770k the bottom line is this is
what makes sense for this buyer this
buyer is not going to be doing an
upgrade very often in fact this computer
needs to last him many years so for that
we went ahead and chose with the 4770k
just so that he can have the newer that
the newest generation you know to start
out his longevity of his computer plus
we're not going with a massive overclock
just a small very very humble overclock
which the 4770k will be more than
capable of housing the processor is
going to be our asus republic of gamers
maximus 6 genie
it is a micro ATX board because it's
going in such a small case we've got to
make sure that it can fit in there and I
chose this motherboard because it's got
all of the onboard features that you'd
come to expect with a high-end
motherboard like something from the
Republic of gamers line it's got an
amazing Ethernet card an amazing sound
card
it's got fan control overclocking on
this is amazing and it's capable of
future upgrades for SLI if he wants to
put another card in here we'll get more
into that later and for our hard drive
space we've got two data drives here
what we're going to be using when you've
got a fast computer like this and you're
going to overclock it you've got a
really fast graphics card and a really
fast processor motherboard really fast
RAM you need to have fast hard drive to
go along with it and for that we are
using the Samsung 840 Evo 750 gigabyte
solid state drive and just in case
that's not enough doesn't want to fill
this up we went ahead and went with a
Toshiba 2 terabyte 7200 rpm 64 megabyte
cache hard drive for all of his pictures
movies maybe some adult pornography who
knows whatever he wants to put on here
you put on whatever he wants not have to
worry about space and last but not least
we have got an 8 gigabyte flash drive
this is going to serve two purposes you
may have noticed we have no optical
drive here we're not putting an optical
driving there so we're going to be
putting the ISO onto here turning this
into one
an installation drive for the operating
system and to this is also going to be
his recovery backup disk in case
something happens and he has to have a
restore point we're going to put an
initial rinse restore point on here and
then he can do all of his backups to
this and have an image of his entire
computer and speaking of operating
systems I know a lot of you immediately
are going to not like this but we are
going with Windows 8 in this machine
like I mentioned he's not going to be
upgrading for a long time he wants to
have as much future proofing as he can
I'm banking that 8.1 for Windows 8 is
going to make a huge difference I've got
some inside sources saying that 8.1 it's
going to fix a lot of things so I'm
going ahead and taking a chance on that
I'm putting my reputation with this PC
build on the line with 8.1 I have
confidence in that if you don't like it
adapt this build to go with Windows 7
everything will work perfectly fine now
just like your grandfather always told
you doing the job what is what did
grandpa used to say oh that's right okay
all right cut now just like your grandpa
used to tell you any job worth doing is
worth doing right and in order to do it
right you've got to have the right tool
I've got a couple of tools here that you
may need at any point and putting
together your computer some of these are
optional really the only tool you need
is going to be a multi-tool screwdriver
here mine just pulls out it's got big
and a lot or big and small Phillips and
flathead screws on there as well as a
nut driver on each end it's got pretty
much your most common sizes that you
would need for a computer you pick this
up at any hardware store usually less
than ten bucks you probably won't need
any tools besides that for keeping your
wires nice and tidy we've got ourselves
some zip ties I've got a razor blade
just in case I find myself needing to
cut something very rarely do I need it
but I never have a blade when I need one
so I always keep one in the tool bag
I've got a pair of cutters here this is
really nothing more than cutting your
zip ties the excess and getting it nice
and clean and you've got a pair of
pliers here chances are you aren't going
to need these but what tool bag wouldn't
be complete without a pair of pliers and
then we've got a small Phillips
screwdriver here which can be used for
popping out pins or tucking wires behind
things really it's just handy to have a
nice small screwdriver in case you need
to get into a really tight place don't
really ever need to use this
as I mentioned this is pretty much the
only tool you will really ever need for
putting together your computer and then
last but not least you have your
hardware here this is going to be
specific to your case each case comes
with its own set of hardware needed for
its components and in this case it's in
this plastic bag usually it comes in a
little cardboard box but this is what
we're going to be using to put together
this case today now one of the first
things you want to do when getting your
computer ready to be built is you want
to get the motherboard situated
everything you need to build your
computer for the motherboard is included
inside the box in this case here we
don't have an anti-static bag rog basis
never sends anything in an anti-static
bag but we do get a tray in there and
then you've got your i/o plate sli
bridge you've got an easy your i/o or
your front panel connectors there and
you get a whole bunch of cables here
alright so for now what we're going to
do is we're going to go ahead and just
set up a ghetto test bench here I don't
have a test bench personally I've never
owned one I probably should get one I've
always just used the ghetto box method
so we're going to get our motherboard
ready here by simply setting our
motherboard on the box it's ghetto and
it works and it's glorious now normally
in getting your PC ready you would want
to set up everything all the basics onto
your motherboard and do a test bench
boot we're not going to do that today
because I have high hopes for these
components here but you may for your
first time build want to set everything
up CPU Ram graphics card and make sure
that you at least get a basic post with
your components one of the first things
you want to do is get your CPU installed
inside of your motherboard get the pins
nice and secure get everything safe so
go ahead and take out your trusty razor
blade here try not to cut your fingers
off like I have a big habit of doing and
go ahead and get your CPU placed inside
of your motherboard
okay when installing your CPU chip
you'll notice that you have a gold
triangle on one of the corners if you
lift up the socket tab right here be
very gentle this is going to expose the
pins you definitely don't want anything
to get in there as that will ruin your
day but you're going to notice that
there's also not only a gold triangle
but there's also two notches on the side
of the CPU and there are two notches
also inside of the socket so you're just
going to simply line those up drop the
CPU in there very gently and we can
leave the plastic cover on because when
you reposition the socket cover on there
and you push this down it pops that
cover right off so you never have to get
involved and get too close with your
socket pins because the cover never
leaves the socket cover until it's ready
and now our CPU is installed and ready
for action ok so now we're using the
silverstone ft0 3 and we are going with
a micro ATX board this is going to be a
little bit unconventional when it comes
to installation on the order that we're
about to do things so if you're using a
standard mid tower full tower or even of
just a super tower case like the 900 II
behind me
you pretty much would just mount your
motherboard in and then you would mount
your cooler to it if you're going with a
standalone water cooling like the H 80
that I have but because we have no
motherboard cut out there's no hole in
the back of this case for the
motherboard we're going to have to do
things in a very interesting order as
you can see by looking inside here we
have no motherboard cut out so that's
going to cause a little bit of a problem
when it comes to the standard way of
installing the motherboard and some
people might be saying well why is there
no motherboard cutout well in this
particular case right behind the
motherboard is where you're going to
find your hot-swap hard drive
installation right here so it wouldn't
do any good to have a motherboard cut
out on this case but if you're doing a
basic installation this is a little bit
more advanced which you'd be dealing
with normally you wouldn't have this
problem to worry about okay so now that
we've got our CPU installed on a
motherboard and before we put the cooler
on the CPU there's some
things I want to do to get this
Silverstone case ready to go as I
mentioned earlier I don't like the fans
that come with this case especially
since they aren't sleeved and sure we
could sleeve them but we want to add a
bit of style to this build so we're
going to put the SP 120 fans in this
case so we're going to go ahead and
remove these fans and add a little bit
of style
okay we're back and I've decided to do a
little bit of a tech tip here for you I
had to do this on my computer as well on
one of my computer builds that I did
actually in the past this is the bracket
that we're going to be using right here
this is set to fit 1150 socket you can
see you have the holes here in the
motherboard you can kind of see them
right they're a little bit dark what
we're going to do is we are going to
flip this upside down here we're going
to take the retaining bracket where you
are going to stick them through the hole
like so and we are going to take a small
piece of electrical tape to simply hold
that on the back as we put it inside of
the case now some people may look at
this and say oh that's a ghetto mod you
know what a lot of custom pcs live
because of ghetto mods well that's going
to do is it's going to it may look a
little bit tacky but you know what
you're never going to see it and it
holds the backplate on the whole time
that you're setting this inside the case
so what this allows us to do now is get
the motherboard inside the case before
we installed the pump because it is
threaded on here and you're able to take
the retaining bracket on the top and
tighten it down without the bracket
moving around it allows us to get the
board safely inside of the case without
having to worry about mounting this pump
outside of it which then increases our
chances of actually causing damage most
cases don't have the standoffs already
installed those are those brass little
they look like little screws another
screw screws into normally you have to
install those inside of your case based
on the type of motherboard you're
installing whether it be micro ATX ATX
XL ATX ITX whatever type of case
motherboard you're installing the
standoffs are built into this one
they're already there lay the case down
so you can kind of see they're already
built in so we don't have to worry about
doing that we can just put the
motherboard right into the case and as I
mentioned earlier the hardware that
we're going to
need to install them to the motherboard
is included with the hardware that came
with the case the first thing you want
to do when installing your motherboard
in your case is you want to take your
i/o plate and get that installed into
your case normally this would be in the
back in this case it's on the top but in
order to know which way to orient it
whether this way or this way you're
going to have to take a look at your
motherboard and see exactly how it's
going to be oriented in this case the
motherboard installs this direction so
take a look at the audio import inputs
here you can see that this is the
orientation that we are going to install
the i/o plate okay so we've got the
motherboard installed in the case now
I've installed a red LED light right
here that you can kind of sort of see
because you want to give some cool
little blinky aspects to this case to
kind of accent the red that's in here
what we're going to do now is we're
going to go ahead before we put the
cooler in here and the RAM in here we're
going to do the front panel installation
the front plant panel plugs the
motherboard in this case is oriented
sideways so normally what would be at
the bottom is now on the side and I'm
usually not a fan of using the little IO
connectors that come in this particular
Asus is really good about giving you
these these adapters here that you can
use for plugging in your reset switch
your power switch and you all of that
stuff but because we're dealing in such
a small case I'm going to go ahead and
use these just to keep things as simple
as possible we also have one here for a
additional USB if we need it okay so
we've gone ahead and installed the front
panel connectors and because this is
such a tight case and tight fit I went
ahead and made sure they're h80 fits and
as you can see the way it installs here
is you have a push-pull fan
configuration so we have the radiator
and the fan and the screws sandwiching
it together on the top of the case now
just to make sure that there was no
fitment issues I went ahead and
installed that and as you can see here
we can get our CPU block curves around
and it will fit just like this
it's definitely a tight fit but it's
definitely worth it and then we're going
to have our second fan installed on the
bottom of the radiator just like this so
we have nice push-pull configuration for
high static pressure and maximum cooling
especially for such a small form-factor
so what I'm going to do now before I
install the second fan I'm going to go
ahead and get the CPU block mounted
Corsair does come with high quality
thermal paste already installed so don't
feel the need to clean that off go ahead
and use that and you just saw that I cut
a zip tie on that I like to put a zip
tie around these plastic covers when I'm
moving them around to make sure that I
don't accidentally scrape that so I just
put a zip tie around that to keep this
cover from falling off but now that
we're ready to go ahead and move forward
with the installation just cut it off
and off you go
you
okay so now that we've got our
motherboard installed we've got our LED
light installed and we've got our front
panel connectors installed the next
thing we want to do is we want to get
the power supply ready to go
I didn't plug in the USB front are
technically top USB ports on here yet
because I want to get the power supply
in here in the bottom and I'm going to
kind of run the cables all together so
cable management is definitely going to
be a challenge inside this case so we're
go ahead and put in the motherboard or
the power supply on the bottom and we're
going to get our short cables ready to
go and then we will see when that's done
okay guys we've only been at this a few
hours because Jay is OCD and here's what
we've got done so far we've got the
motherboard installed the CPU installed
we've got the H ATI installed we have
got the power supply installed all the
front side of inputs from the reset
switched power switch LED power LED
we've got the USB 3.0 installed and
we've got all of the corsair link fans
wired up all of the USB stuff in there
we've got our 8 pin power plug installed
right here on the side and then on the
back as you can see we've already
started some OCD cable management back
here I mean I'm what we have left to do
now is we need to install our RAM and
then we need to install our graphics
cards and our hard drives and power for
the hard drive so we're getting near the
end here to the points where we're going
to do our test boot and let's go ahead
and install some RAM ok this is one time
when you don't have to be embarrassed to
pull out the motherboard manual in fact
there's two times I recommend that you
pull out the motherboard manual one is
when you're hooking up the front panel
connectors on your case some other
boards have it printed on there some
dope no problem in looking at the
motherboard manual to figure out where
those pins go the other time I always
always recommend looking at the
motherboard manual even when you're
dealing with the same manufacturer not
all Asus boards are the same not all MSI
boards are the same and that's looking
at your memory configuration naturally
you want to say red is a channel and
black is a channel when you're looking
at the colors of the DIMM slots however
in this case the red is channel 1 and
channel 2 or channel a and B so we're
going to install our RAM in both red
channels if we had done red and black we
would have put ourself in single channel
mode which would have cut our memory
bandwidth in half so we're going to go
ahead and take our vengeance program 16
gigabytes to 8 gigabytes tix and we're
going to install those in our
motherboard and as you can see we've got
kind of a color combination going on
here a nice little rog red black in this
really kick-ass small form-factor case
and there we go we've got our RAM
installed and I don't say so myself this
is turning out to be quite a
badass-looking little system right here
this is this color scheme this ROG red
and black may be done a lot but I think
this looks really damn sexy I like the
way that Ram looks that is awesome okay
so before we go ahead and start
buttoning this up and putting in our
graphics card I want to go ahead and
install the main fan cage right here
that goes in the middle of the case this
one those in the bottom and this one
goes right here like so I just want to
get this in there so I can plug this
into the motherboard and get that out of
the way and as you can see here it's
definitely a tight fit the h80 is going
to push slightly on the center of the
fan but fortunately that's not going to
cause any problems in fact we can kind
of push that up out of the way as we get
this ready to go
all right we're getting down to the
nitty-gritty we're almost done with this
build we really only have a couple of
things left to do we have to install our
data storage or SSD and our hard drive
and for that we're going to be using the
included SATA cables that came with the
motherboard this particular motherboard
comes with two types of SATA cables one
has a 90 degree plug and a straight plug
on one end and then the other cable has
two straight plugs for this case we're
going to be using the two straight plugs
for both of our drives so we need to run
power for our SATA and we also need to
run our SATA cables and then we have our
hard drives installed and the last thing
after that is installing our PCI Express
power cables and our gtx 780 so let's go
ahead and get this thing finished up
okay we've got our hard drives installed
here inside of the case got the SSD
installed here and it's a little bracket
and we went ahead and opted to put the
hard drive inside of the hot swap Bay as
you can see right here I did that
because I felt that the easiest way to
install the SSD was with the cables
facing up and unfortunately that moves
into the other installation area for
this hard drive and so I don't believe
this buyer is going to be changing out
his hard drive any time very often but
if he wants to upgrade his hard drive
now he doesn't have to have any
installation skills to do it and take
anything apart he can just drop it right
in here push it down and the new hard
drive is now installed so now we only
have one thing left to do and that is to
flip this thing around get our PCI
Express cables installed and put that
bad boy that beast of a monster card
that's 780 inside here and then we're
going to do our first test boot
some people would argue that we should
have put an AMD card in here some people
will say we should have put a 690 or we
should even put a Titan in here the
bottom line is this is the card that we
chose to go with and it is massively
long I've not personally held one of
these before I forgot just how big the
card used to be this is about the length
of the 580 and the 680 was a little bit
shorter
they'd shortened up the card a little
bit with the 680 this thing is massive
and initially my first thoughts are
uh-oh this may not fit inside this build
but I already know it's possible because
I've seen it done before I just want to
show you how tight of a fit we really
have with this card in this case
unfortunately the GeForce green kind of
ruins a little bit of the aesthetics but
it's ok because it is just such a
massively powerful beast so let's go
ahead and get this thing in here and
then once we hook it up to power this
build hardware-wise is complete
all right well there it is a lot of you
guys questioned on Twitter and Facebook
on whether or not all these parts would
actually fit whether or not we can get
all those products into this tiny little
case and guess what it's also very light
and it's still pretty portable I mean I
could pick up my 900 d like this if I
wanted to even if it wasn't water-cooled
the case management are the wire
management on the back as you can see is
very acceptable I mean it's kind of
bunched up a little bit right here but
this is where the wiring is intended to
go it's very deep on the back I've got
nothing but great things to say about
this case I mean you have a couple of
gripes but I'm not going to get into
that in this video
gtx 780 fits in there in fact we've got
about another inch and a half worth of
space before we hit this fan so we could
have easily fitted 690 in here or a 79
90 if we wanted so there's plenty of
room for graphics cards now a lot of you
guys have wondered how airflow is going
to work in this case the way it works is
the 120 millimeter fan on the bottom
here pulls in from the dual 80
millimeter holes as you can see right
here on the bottom you could also put
two 80 millimeter fans here for more
directional airflow if you wanted to do
that or if you're going to water cool
you could do a dual 80 millimeter
radiator there but that fan on the
bottom right here blows air to the
graphics card now some of you may have
wondered why I didn't go with a custom
cooling graphics card something with
like the two fans like the EVGA
or the asus direct CU or even the
gigabyte wheel with the three fans or
the twin fros or any of those options
because they're known to be a bit
quieter the problem with a case like
this and the fact that it's got stacked
airflow design is that you have to have
directional airflow and those graphics
cards just swirl the air around inside
of your case because they're expecting a
bigger case with more fans to exhaust
that air so we have to go with a blower
style fan
that way we can exhaust it out the top
we sacrifice a little bit in terms of
noise but this particular buyer was made
well aware that it's going to be some
noise involved with this fan compared to
one of those other custom cooling
solutions he's ok with that in fact
there have been reports of people
putting in those multiple fan graphics
cards that are not directional and they
are
the blower turbine type of fan and have
actually reported overheating problems
in their case when using those types of
graphics cards so this card was chosen
for a specific reason now there's only
one thing left to do that is to button
it back up hook it up see if we get a
good boot and then install our operating
system and then we start our
benchmarking okay so the operating has
been installed everything is updated all
of our drivers are fresh freshly updated
I try to do a little bit of overclocking
on this computer
unfortunately this 4770k had absolutely
no interest in doing any sort of
overclocking beyond 4.2 gigahertz this
chip was just unfortunately a bad luck
of the lottery draw and it has no
interest in doing anything about 4.2 but
that's okay because this buyer had only
one thing in mind and that was to get as
much power as he could in a small
package but he wasn't interested in
going in high overclocks
and for the sake of stability I think
it's a good idea we were able to cram a
lot of very good components inside this
tiny little case and battlefield 3 runs
at over 100 frames per second in all
situations and on some cases it's
running in the 150s and 160 s and
staying up there the entire time
this gtx 780 is a massive beast it's an
amazing card so with that there's only
one thing left to do let's go ahead and
