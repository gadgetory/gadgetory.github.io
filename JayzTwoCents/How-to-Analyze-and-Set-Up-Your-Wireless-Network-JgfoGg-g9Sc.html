going to tackle a topic today at one
that I definitely need to address in my
new home here and that is wireless
networks most people are not fortunate
enough to live in a home that has a
pre-wired network because that's
something that started around the early
2000s now although I'm fortunate enough
to have that in this new house I still
need to have a reliable wireless network
and because of the arrangement of this
house the wireless access point is quite
a distance from some of the living space
in the house and I thought this would
make a good video to show you how to get
the most out of your wireless network
using free tools that I have used for
quite a while now I've actually used
these this tool I'm going to show you
today for years with its specifically
tuned copper base and maintenance free
plug and play operation the EVGA 980ti
hybrid offers ultra-fast gaming
performance at the lowest temperatures
possible click the link in the
description for more details now even if
you do have pre red network cable in
your home or you ran it to the rooms
that you have your computers in it's
still good to have a wireless network
because of your wireless devices you
know you've got your tablets you've got
your smart phones your laptops and you
don't want to be tethered down to a wire
if you don't have to be and with
wireless networking getting much faster
you know a be in the beginning and the G
was the and then wireless n was
like oh my god and now wireless AC is
just that much big bigger badder and
faster with better coverage you should
have a wireless network in your home and
not to mention most of our routers have
wireless capabilities and 9 SPS they're
sending modems now that help built-in
wireless AC in them as well so why not
at least get the most out of it
especially if it's already there
now just fair warning this is going to
be a multi-part video I'm going to try
and fit it into but it might need three
depending on how this goes the first
thing I'm going to show you in today's
video is how to analyze your Wi-Fi how
to find your dead spots and how to
adjust your radio so that you can get
the best signal when it comes to your
wireless most routers you can just set
to auto and it will auto set its signal
but as things progress and people open
up new wireless networks in your
neighborhood signals might start to get
jammed up and the auto isn't always
going to change itself
so I figured today we will go ahead and
show you how to change the radio and how
to find the best channel now one of the
other things I'm going to be doing with
the video as I move forward into the
next part is going to be how to extend
your wireless network how to add access
points that will extend your wireless so
that regardless of where you go it will
just handoff to whatever the strongest
signal is and then the next part is
going to be getting Network down into my
builder space or my as Jerry calls his
makerspace but for me it's gonna be my
my nerd space I guess is how I'm going
to get wireless down in there because
there is no wired cat5 in there and I'm
not going to be adding a wired cat5 in
there because I don't feel like sneaking
things through the walls so I'm going to
be doing a wireless bridge into there
with obviously a built in hub in the
router and because it's not going to be
my main workspace I can get away with
the wireless not to mention with
wireless AC being all the way up to what
thirteen hundred megabit per second it's
more than enough and we'll talk about
that at that video at that time but
anyway today's tool I'm going to be
using is free for anyone with an Android
device unfortunately at least at the
time of making this video this app Wi-Fi
analyzer is not available on iOS devices
but if you have an Android tablet or an
Android phone it's free head on over to
the Play a google play download it I've
used it for years and it's going to work
absolute wonders for getting your
wireless set up so what I'm gonna do now
is I'm literally going to walk around
the house with the camera showing you
how the app works showing you how to
identify your dead spots so that you can
try to figure out where you want to
either move your router to or add an
access point if that's the route you're
going to go now just to recap the reason
why I'm doing this video is here is my
Nighthawk x6 which is my router and
wireless access point but I actually
never showed you guys what this looked
like after it was all wired up not too
bad but anyway this is on one extreme
end of the house and the problem with
that is the other extreme end is going
to get signal degradation because of all
the walls in between it Plus this is on
the second floor and if you're on the
far end of the house on the first floor
then you definitely aren't going to be
getting the full benefit of your
wireless okay so the app I'm using here
is called Wi-Fi analyzer when you open
it up you've got a kind of a menu here
with a
bunch of different views that you can
use the main view you probably use here
is channel graph this is going to kind
of give you an idea if all the wireless
networks in your area
as you can see we've got quite a few
going on here especially when you're on
the upstairs of a two-story house
because you get better reception the
higher up that you go
so this wireless 24 gigahertz are
technically 2.4 but you can't use a
decimal point in the SSID that is my
Wireless right there and I've also got
another one wireless 5 gigahertz that is
not going as for some reason not showing
up but anyways I do have a wireless 5
gigahertz on here
maybe this device isn't 5 gigahertz
capable I really don't know view you've
also got your time graph this is kind of
showing you over time what the signal
has been like so if you wanted to keep
this thing stationary in one area and
let it run you could see if your signal
is kind of dipping down and coming up
and dip and down you've got here channel
rating this is showing you a rating of
stars the quality of the channels that
are available so as you can see it's got
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 stars so you can
see channels 2 through 9 right here it's
saying or just completely cluttered
don't bother using them you can see
Channel 10 11 and 12 right here have the
best signal 12 11 and 12 being the
absolute best access point list right
here this is showing you the actual
radio signal strength of DBM here so you
can see channel 5 which is what I'm on
right now 2 point 4 3 2 megahertz is
getting a minus 42 it's actually pretty
good because I'm very close to the
router the router is actually on that
side of the wall right there so I'm
really close to it you can see all the
wireless networks in your area based on
signal strength one of the other views
which I just went to here is signal
meter this is one we be using here it's
also got a sound which is really kind of
annoying at the beeping sound that will
speed up or slow down based on signal
strength and then you this is right here
where you'll touch and select the
wireless that you want to check the
rating on as you can see again my
wireless right here because I'm only
about oh I don't know 8 feet from it
with one wall in between us is very very
strong if I turn on the beeping sound
again you'll hear it's going to beep
really fast
so we're going to do now is we're
literally going to walk around the house
and kind of document where our strong
signal is and where our weak signal is
because that's what we want to try and
fix here is the weakness in various dead
spots of the house now there's lots of
things that can actually cause
interference with your wireless
especially 2.4 gigahertz it's a very
cluttered spectrum there's lots of
wireless routers on there what cordless
phones just all sort it's like the old
800 megahertz was back when you had the
original cordless phones it just was
super cluttered cellphones were using
800 megahertz so then everything went to
2.4 and now it's cluttered and
everything's moving up to 5 gigahertz so
you can kind of see a pattern there so
here's the upstairs family room and like
I said on the other side of that wall
right there is whether Wireless is so I
would expect this room to obviously be
pretty good also please ignore the mess
we are still moving so we're going to do
now is we're just going to stay on the
upstairs here we are going to walk back
towards the bedrooms and see what kind
of signal we're getting over here here
is the office which I very bright room
huh which I expect to be pretty good
yeah we're still well up in the green
not too concerned about that move back
here to where the kids bedrooms are and
as you can see we're actually not
getting too much degradation this is
little Jays room right here we are now
about as far as we are going to be able
to get from the router and you can see
we're still up in the green it's not too
bad but one of the things I did for this
video is I put myself on channel 5 which
is cluttered and I want to compare it
once I move it to a less cluttered
Channel
so you can see right about here we dip
down into the yellow not too bad though
could be worse
I'm actually going to attempt to
navigate the stairs while holding the
meter if I fall down it would make a
pretty epic video I'm sure so as we come
down stairs here the TV's still on let's
take care of that okay so here we are in
the downstairs family room as I pretty
much expect it we've got full full
signal because we are literally right
under it the wireless is right up there
so because we are literally right
underneath it I expected the signal to
be fantastic which it is and I was kind
of curious as to how it would be you
know with the floor
between us and some electrical wiring
here with the overhead lighting so let's
go ahead and head here to the far side
of the house and see if we start to get
any real degradation so here is the
dining room you can see we're dropping
here a little bit it's going to start to
drop a little bit more rapidly as we get
to the far side of the house where the
playroom is and that sort of stuff still
looking green though it's actually not
as bad as I thought it was going to be
it's really not dropped down to the
right on the border there let's go over
here to the office what's going to be a
front office that I have not even begun
to get everything put together but you
can see it's really not that bad so
let's do this then let's go into a speed
test and let's compare alright so I
started up speed test here on the old
iDevice and so far it's stuck on finding
the best server yeah that's never a good
sign
anyway let's see how we're going to do
here in the farthest point away from the
router and although we are getting a
good signal according to the Wi-Fi
analyzer as you can see right there you
can see that signal is only part of the
story if that signal is got a ton of
other things being completely what's the
word I'm looking for here it's being
completely garbled by other radios
stomping on top of each other on the
same channel then you get this this is
what appears to be a good connection
however it is a dead spot really bad one
okay now let me show you guys what I
mean here if I now open up the app back
in the kitchen because we're right under
the wireless ban it picked it up with no
problem whatsoever
so if I begin the test you'll see we'll
get some pretty good speed here it's
preparing here it's going to test our
ping it's not acting funky at all and
you can see now we're getting no 33 on
the wireless now watch as we start to
walk away do this you can see the
degradation just do to do to do to do
falling falling stuck at 14 at the
moment
okay see now watch the upload see back
in the dead spot here we have what it
appears to be good signal but as we walk
back over here watch what happens
wait for it Oh failed so test again
alright let's walk away and you can see
it just draw up and off like that look
at that so we have I clearly identified
a coverage issue here now if the upload
still works right here nope it's not
working upload isn't working let's walk
closer to the kitchen okay mine you can
do it you can do it Oh see it failed
again but now watch if I don't move
you'll see everything's going to work
just fine now we go to speed see that
and the upload huh it's not as fast as I
used to get but you could see I'm
getting it so how do we fix that well
once again we bring out our handy-dandy
signal tool now here's the thing you
might be going but I got good signal
which could lead a lot of you to be
blaming your ISPs thinking we're getting
terrible service I've got good wireless
but the ISP keeps dropping well no what
you have here is a strong signal that's
being completely stomped on by other 2.4
wireless that is mixed messing up your
your actual data being sent to your
device from your router it's kind of
like when you have your in range of two
different radio stations in the car at
the same time and they start kind of
walking on top of each other that's
what's happening here
so let's go ahead and do this then we're
going to go to our view we're going to
go to channel graph well look at that
we've only got one router chillin over
there but as you can see right here my
router has about the same signal
strength as three other routers in the
area they cease the net
year and the summer so these three right
here are what's causing me the problem
but you can see we've got a lot less
going on over here on the right so let's
go move the channel let's move it over
to channel like 11 or 12 and let's see
what happens we'll rerun the test
okay so now as you can see I move my
router over to here and to do that you
just have to go into your routers
wireless settings and change the radio
of channel for your router so you're
going to have to go into your own manual
and figure out how to do that now
something important to point out here is
I want you to notice that our signal
strength is a little lower than it was
before we change the channel now here we
are in the same room same router all we
did was change the channel if we open up
speed test now you can see like that
immediately it recognizes the server and
gives me the begin test option now
that's already better than we were
getting before because we couldn't even
get the app to recognize that it was
online let alone actually start a test
so now for ping we're getting nineteen
and yet we're not getting the greatest
signal here we're still only getting
what five megabits of my 60 and it's
dropping off a little bit down into four
and a half back up to five but the
important point here is that by doing
nothing but changing the channel we were
able to get a good signal because we
don't have all those routers stomping on
each other so there you go
so you can see we're now connected in
this room which before we had nothing
nothing whatsoever and we didn't change
the location of the router at all so
it's going to talk about this now
there's a few things you can take away
from this video one there's no
replacement for having a properly placed
wireless access point and in this house
that would have been probably in this
office because it's very centralized
above the middle of the house and as
high as it can possibly get now if
you're like me where you're kind of
stuck where the placement of the patch
panel in the house was poorly placed in
the master bedroom closet which a lot of
them seemed to be then you're kind of
stuck with mounting it over there now
sure I could have turned one of those
leads into this office into basically a
feed to the router and then had it
basically another feed going back to the
patch panel but that would have been a
nightmare because none of these rooms
actually have two Ethernet running to it
like a lot of newer houses do this one
only has one going to each room so that
wasn't going to be possible so the next
thing that you could do to fix this
problem is add a second access point now
there's a lot of access points that are
available out there very easy to set up
things like ubiquity have power over
ethernet where you literally just plug
the damn thing in and that's it it's
it's it's easy to set up and it you can
place them all over your house and have
literal
no dead spots and I would like to do
something like that in the future but
for right now I do have the asrock
gaming router the wireless AC 3200
router where I'm going to be hooking
that up on the other end of the house
which again is not necessarily the most
ideal having one access point on one
extreme and the other on the opposite
end maybe I'll put it in this office
that might actually work because I do
need a switch in here and we'll kind of
see how well that works but the nice
thing about having the wired ethernet in
the house like this is that I can move
it around and see where it gets the best
coverage so apps like this can help you
at least identify where your dead spots
are when it comes to your wireless
because as I showed you can show that
you have strong signal but it doesn't
mean you have good data transfer it's
being completely stepped on by all of
those other routers so if you've been
dealing with good connectivity but poor
speeds for your wireless there's lots of
things that could be interfering use an
app like this identify other networks in
your neighborhood you might be surprised
just how many there are this house by
itself is running three wireless
networks it's got a dual five gigahertz
radio band as well as a 2.4 gigahertz
but at least if you can identify what's
happening and change your channel of
your wireless you have a good chance of
at least getting some of the dead spots
with ok connectivity when it comes to
data and then adding other access points
or moving your router you can also use
this app to move your router and find
the best location for your wireless I
hope this videos helped you guys it's
something I've always struggled with
with dead spots in homes and stuff and
I've always used this app I've used it
at work when you're setting up wireless
and offices when I worked in IT it is
free not sponsored this is just an app
I've always used and I think it's
fantastic unfortunately not available on
Apple like I said Google Play is your
only option anyway guys tell me what you
think let others know your tips and
tricks when it comes to setting up your
wireless access points and as always
guys I want your suggestions on the
types of videos you want me to cover
because if it pertains to you it
pertains to somebody else and it could
be beneficial for the masses alright
guys time to get out of here thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
