insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys you're watching Jays two cents and
we're continuing our exclusive insider
coverage of CES 2014 and I'm still in
the ROG booth here for the Asus suite
and we're going to take a look at
something that I think you guys might
find really interesting you guys are
always asking me about different types
of controls for your fans and other
aspects of your system so JJ is going to
show us something here that I think is
really unique
I really don't know much about it I mean
we talked about a little bit right now
but I'm going to turn it over to JJ and
let him tell you why what we're looking
at here is considered really awesome so
JJ take it away yeah so what we have
right here is actually the ROG front
base so something that we've been
working on for a while
if you've kind of been following ASUS
motherboards for a couple of years one
of the big focal points on the design
front has been our evolution of fan
controls
we're really the first vendor that
committed to saying hey if you're going
to have fan headers on a board we want
extensive functionality it's not just
about being able to plug it in and have
power we want to be able to go in
customize fan profile curves want to be
able to set you know and three pin fan
on PWM friendly yeah we want to be able
to have that flexibility and support and
so that's become now standard right
whether you're looking at our x79 or z87
even our AMD motherboards we're giving
you the BAPS of the best class of fan
controls but for some users they want
even more flexibility as well as they
might want something that aesthetically
looks cool so we started off on z87 with
this little guy right here which was the
OC panel and this guy's actually just
started to hit the market and this was
originally only provided with our
maximum six extreme and it gave a lot of
specialized functionality such as being
able to dynamically adjust the voltage
or the B CLK or the multiplier you could
see your post code display information
when your system was starting up I
really like the adjustable display on
here so you could lay it flat on your
desk you could set it in the stand and
you had you know even more esoteric
levels of controls for users that wanted
to you know do bench
top testing they could plug in fans
directly into there they could go ahead
and do some soldering so that they can
have advanced voltage control so they
could overclock it their GPUs even more
effectively you know and a lot of other
specialized controls now the cool part
was we've made this a dual type setup so
that you go ahead and take this guy dock
it into this right here and then put
that in a five and a quarter bay and
then you could have you know one touch
adjustment for your CPU fan one touch
overclocking you could see your CPU
temperatures and voltages and whatnot
but what we wanted to do was even evolve
this further and so that's what we've
actually done here with the front base
so if we take a look at the front base
we've moved over from a basic display to
an extra full four inch LCD which you
can see is carrying a lot of information
that we have on there so we're getting
everything from our CPU frequency to the
RPM data to the CPU temperatures we can
make adjustments to our volume so you
know if you've got your system maybe
positioned down on the floor I've got a
big t jo7 as one of my primary jassi's I
wouldn't have it on my desk um so you
know although you could quick access
that on your keyboard maybe depending on
your layout maybe you want that
functionality there we've got that
incorporated in there but another
element that's really nice about this is
how we're taking audio into
consideration one of the things that a
lot of people have noticed on our boards
for a couple generations now is our
supreme effects audio design or the red
line is sometimes people call it now
what sometimes people don't realize is
that the cable quality that you have
inside of a chassis it's fairly subpar
and that's just you know it's the it's
the semantics of the industry where you
know sometimes a lower cost has to be
considered into what the cable
manufacturers are putting into the
chassis and that ends up affecting the
DB output it brings in noise which
reason which are mention is really good
point a lot of people don't realize when
you use front panel headers for audio a
lot of times that hiss that you hear is
coming from that line not if you were to
take your headphone and hook it to the
rear of the computer directly to the
motherboard
a lot of that noise is gone because it's
appear yeah for sure I mean there's
multiple factors of course how does it
interface with the motherboards USB 3.0
I know and that's actually the the cool
thing so if you take a look here down on
the board if you're able to see it maybe
even get some b-roll and you guys can
cut it in there but this board features
our isolated gridline audio design and
that includes the front audio connection
so we've gone ahead and used the same
front audio connection that you would
normally
use for your chassis but instead we're
connecting that directly to the front
base so one we get that improvement in
sound because of that isolated design
and we've also given you a fully
shielded cable that also is two strands
directly for the left and for the right
channel so right so it's not going to
pick up like we have it running across
the PCI Express power right here it's
not going to pick up any interference in
that it's exactly we're going to get a
much better experience so you know if
you've got a nice set of cans plus
you've got a great board that's got
great set on it you can actually take
much better advantage of it so this is
really a combination piece it's about
giving you something that looks cool
it's functional but also gives you
definite benefits as a gamer because
you're going to get better sound quality
plus you also get some cool levels of
functionality here we've got some
switches on here so you can go ahead and
do some OneTouch overclocking there's an
actual escape function so there maybe
you want to quickly quick drop out a
game can you switch between OCC profiles
in the BIOS through there you can assign
an OC profile it will be linked in there
so in that respect you can make an
adjustment to that but it would be only
for one profile specifically in addition
to that of course you can make
adjustments to the fan RPMs settings
that are in there as well so a lot of
functionality we're bringing in horse
Lassie we even got a quick charge USB
port so you got a tablet smartphone
something like that you want to be able
to quick charge plug into we're good to
go and you and you said this is already
available on the market it's going to be
coming very soon but definitely before
the end of q1 right now we're just you
know finalizing in last couple of things
in terms of the firmware in the software
package because it is a combination of
both in terms of getting everything to
work right but it will work with any one
of our z87 series boards that has
essentially the OC panel header as well
as a boards like our rampage for Black
Edition so there you go guys right we're
looking at here the ROG front base here
from Asus if you've got one of their is
the 87 ROG motherboards and it what was
the name of the header again I'm sorry
the OC panel header the OC panel header
you can control just about every aspect
of your computer here and it's a really
nice looking display it's really sharp
and it aesthetically looks really
pleasing so guys you've been asking
about how to control your motherboards
if you have an ROG motherboard check see
if this is going to be available for you
as always guys make sure you're
following us on Twitter here for all of
your insider coverage at CES 2014 and as
always I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
