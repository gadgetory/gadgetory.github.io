have a guest on the channel that we
haven't had here in a while disc this
guest actually deserves no introduction
but let me go let me go get them they're
shy somebody we had a scene hey it's
gunk works the strafe RGB mark 2 from
Corsair features genuine Cherry MX
switches perky RGB backlighting USB
pass-through for convenient access and
dedicated multimedia keys with
integrated volume knob making it a great
value for gamers and keyboard
enthusiasts alike learn more about the
strafe RGB mark 2 by visiting the link
down below so this system has actually
been running back at my house now for
shoot almost two years as long as I have
been in this studio this remember this
never came over with me and a lot of you
guys have missed it she's dirty she's
always been a little dirty though view
known as Ryan she's a little dusty man
this thing's fit tight we need to clean
it out a little bit but that's actually
not the purpose of today's video holy
crap those fans are filthy
we are gonna these things are built Ford
Tough let me tell you this thing would
carry Silverado up a wall of cinder
blocks you know what I'm saying a
mountain of cinder blocks
it's a throwback to the old 80s
commercials for Ford but anyway I
digress that's besides the point
today's video is actually about Intel
CPUs and Specter slowdown because a fun
fact about this system this is still
running Windows 8.1 pro I never upgraded
this system to Windows 10 I avoided all
of the free updates I never took any of
Microsoft's sham toys to get you to
upgrade all of their spyware and be
honest I never had any performance
issues and so why bother oh that's so
bad I read an article today I'm gonna
put a link to it down below that talked
about Intel trying to suppress and block
independent reviewers or anyone for that
matter to actually talk about Specter
slowdown and showing comparative compare
and contrast with before and after
patching and this is on their most
recent licensing for the most recent
spectre and meltdown patches and the
whole reason why I'm doing this quite a
bit late it's because Intel seems to
think that at some point that they could
tell me that I couldn't do that well to
that I say I'm gonna do it anyway we are
gonna be running Cinebench obviously r15
we're be running fire strike fire strike
extreme and fire strike ultra so those
are the four tests I'm gonna run they
should those two combine but the cpu
score and the GPU score and the
Cinebench should be enough to at least
paint somewhat of a picture of what
performance is going to do once we go to
Windows 10 okay Cinebench r15 here we go
this is going to be our base run and
let's see look at all them cores man
this is see there's no need to update
your systems every year like like I do I
mean we kind of have to around here we
have to build systems it's what we do
but that's why this system is actually
remained untouched for two solid years
now even the fluids although I think I
have to top off my CPU fluid ok 2308 was
our score on that one so I'm gonna run
in
one more time 2321 okay so the
difference was what one point okay we
run around Cinebench one more time 2310
okay so it was a 23:08 or something that
a 23 21 and a 23 10 so I'll just put 23
10 and now we're gonna run all three of
our 3d marks so here's our total score
thirty four thousand six hundred and
twenty which is pretty damn good
graphics core 55,000 971 the physic a
physics score I was a physics physics
score of twenty seven thousand four
hundred and five this is the one we're
really gonna look for here this is
straight up CPU and CPU only I'm most
interested in this number because if
this number goes down then this number
goes down because well not really a
bottleneck but this number is directly
related to CPU performance because with
these types of FPS figures right here if
the CPU can't keep up with 267 FPS and
of course it's gonna go down and then
our combined score so we're gonna take
all three of these numbers across all
three tests run it again on Windows 10
and we will compare so I will save you
guys the boredom of watching us do this
very repetitively and I will just come
back with the results and of course
after the windows update and then the
updates to the updates because
apparently nvidia pays me to
so here the result windows 8.1 we got a
thirty four thousand six hundred and
twenty with a physics score of twenty
seven thousand 405 graphics score a
fifty five thousand nine seventy one and
a combined score of 99 eighty nine now
Windows 10 we actually saw over about
eleven hundred point reduction on the
physics score not really enough to
really notice like day to day but there
was indeed a reduction our average FPS
dropped from 87 to eighty three point
seven so we lost approximately what 3 F
3 point 3 FPS on that again probably not
going to notice that our graphics core
though ironically on Windows 10 went up
which could vary for a few different
reasons one it just could have been the
improvement in Windows 10 operating
system in terms of games this is using
DirectX 11 it's not DirectX 12 test so
that should have had anything to do with
it so that's why our difference in the
main score wasn't that far off but our
combined score in Windows 10 dropped
approximately four hundred and seventeen
points from a ninety nine eighty nine to
a 95 seventy two bottom line there is
nobody is going to really notice that
now if we go all the way up to ultra
we're gonna skip extreme we go straight
to ultra so 1080p high FPS all the way
up to ultra 4k which means more load on
the GPUs less on the CPU now the ultra
score was a fourteen thousand seventy
nine on Windows 10 versus a thirteen
thousand nine ninety four on Windows 8.1
our physics course still lower though in
4k by approximately a thousand points
however our graphics score was overall
about eighty points higher on Windows 10
so kind of staying in line of what we
saw with the standard test where our
graphics core is a little bit higher and
our CP score was a little bit lower our
combined score was also higher here on
ultra in Windows 10 than it was a
Windows 8 but all of these are within
margin of error you're not going to
notice any of this in any sort of a
gaming scenario but I wouldn't have
expected to you considering the fact
that we have such a high core cow high
core clock that this is the kind of type
of thing that if you were notice
this sort of percentage of change in
like an i3 or something like that you
definitely would have noticed it a bit
more so in terms of gaming at least in
this particular scenario skunkworks is
affected a little bit by spectre and
meltdown patching in fact the BIOS we
loaded on this motherboard to install
Windows 10 specifically stated it was
for the spectre in meltdown patch
microcode updates so there is that but
there's one other test we need to do
here we need to do our Cinebench I think
we should do that live that way we can
kind of compare our results with our
first test so here we are windows 64-bit
we need to bring up our previous results
right here as this is going and our
previous score if you recall was a 2310
we ran it three times and it fluctuated
around that score so let's see what we
got right here I'm expecting it to be
maybe twenty two hundred and eighty one
that's my guest 2281 will be my my
prediction see if I'm right or wrong
2313 so three points higher than the 23
ten we settled on so I still don't know
why my 7900 X on my D frame build with
faster Titan cards on a newer platform
is slower than skunk works on older
hardware slower graphics cards
technically a previous generation older
CPU getting better results than a newer
hardware so you could guess I guess you
could take this video and swing it from
a comparative results of Spectre
remember I'm doing this as Intel said
you can't at least in there you as it
stands today not to try and prove or
disprove whether or not Spectre is gonna
ruin your day but just to test it
because they said we can but I still
don't know exactly why the results are
the way they are so if you know how
about you tell me down in the comments
below
I mean temperatures are well in check on
both systems yes this is a soldered IHS
versus the 1700 X having ace Tim in
there but end of the day you're not
going to notice any of this at least not
in this level of hardware if you guys
have noticed any sort of massive
negative performance impact on your
hardware regarding Spectre in meltdown
Kay let me know what hardware you're
running down in the
that way I can try and maybe recreate
that myself but at least for us in this
exact situation although we know that
the patching existed and we know that
Intel was worried about something which
is why the language is in the EULA to
begin with wasn't noticeable would have
never noticed it in this situation all
right guys we're gonna go thanks for
this video where we just decided to kind
of stick the middle finger up to the man
I'm the man in some instances so to
myself all right guys we're good to go
thanks for watching and as always we
will see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
