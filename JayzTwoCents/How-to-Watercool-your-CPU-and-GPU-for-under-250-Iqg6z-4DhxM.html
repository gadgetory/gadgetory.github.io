line here from ek this you guys have
been messaging the crap out of me about
talk about this because these are
aluminum water kits and I'm going to
warn you right now if you're from the UK
and you get you know triggered when I
say aluminum and not aluminium get ready
because I'm going to say aluminum a lot
in this video
bring out the bling in your PC with
Corsairs new Vengeance RGB series ddr4
memory with its hassle-free lighting
controls in superior overclocking
performance click the link in the
description to learn more so it's
actually three new SKUs in UK's fluid
gaming lineup there's the a 120 the a
240 and the a 240 G now the G is in
Stanford gangster old school or anything
like that it basically just adds a
graphics card waterblock inside the kit
that's what we're gonna be focusing on
today because I want to take my test
bench here I'm going to water cool my
GTX 1080 and the CPU we're going to see
how well it actually does we're going to
talk about a couple of things as well a
lot of people are really freaked out
about the fact that these kids are made
out of aluminum but EK themselves have
thought about that obviously a lot of
things are cooled with aluminum your car
gloom heads aluminum blocks so is it
really all that bad we're going to try
and tackle some of that today
so I actually haven't opened this up yet
I wanted everything I do with this
particular video to be raw and
experience it for the first time on
camera here's the cool thing about this
everything in here is made out of
aluminum aluminum radiator aluminum
fittings aluminum blocks aluminum wall
everything I'm going to hope that the
internals of the pump are also aluminum
because normally they're a steel
impeller so I don't know if they are or
aren't so I can't actually comment to
that but that's what most people are
afraid of most people are afraid of the
whole concept of galvanic corrosion and
now there's lots of things that can
cause galvanic corrosion there's also a
lot of things that can mix will expedite
and speed up the process of galvanic
corrosion and one of those being mixing
the two metals of copper and aluminum so
that's why they even came up with their
aluminum fittings so we've got our fans
right here that include two EK Vardar
eighteen hundred and fifty rpm fans
these are the black and gray ones we've
got 3/8
tubing which is very common for systems
like this size we've got a triple fan
splitter here which is kind of ironic
because we only have a 240 millimeter
radiator fan a radiator so I would have
liked to have seen a 360 with this kit
because we're calling a GPU as well so
that's one of the reasons why I'm
testing this config is I want to see how
well a 240 can handle both the GPU and
the CPU in the same list so you get your
SATA power plug here presumably for the
pump our pump res the combo this is
extremely light this is way lighter than
any DBC I've ever held but I don't even
think this is a DBC here is our ek
supremacy 8x block it is an aluminum
block as you can see right there it's a
polished aluminum it's so lightweight it
actually feels like kind of fake it
feels like like some sort of a little
like plastic mock-up but it is of course
metal that's one of the benefits to
aluminum too is it's pretty lightweight
we've got a ek cryo fuel it is a
concentrate so the only thing you really
need to add to this is your distilled
water and it looks like this dilutes
into I'm going to assume a leader yes
it's so this is 100 milliliter bottle
and you mix it to 900 milliliters of
distilled water we've got some more
compression fittings right here they're
so lightweight wow they're so
lightweight because they're aluminum
again I'm going to assume that this is
our radiator so freaking light yep again
aluminum radiator okay if you felt a lot
of radiators right here right working
with me in this channel peel this if
you'll if you'll fake right it's just
aluminum is so incredibly light compared
to copper when you're used to copper and
brass blocks yeah this is yes I got a
little news flash though for the people
that are terrified about the whole
concept of aluminum you know those a iOS
you put in your system all the ASA tech
stuff stuff from Coolermaster course a
or whatever use flash most of them are
running ASA tech radiators which are
also aluminum so yeah let's go ahead and
not jump the gun here on the whole hate
bandwagon when it comes to aluminum okay
and here is our GPU block again
everything you need to install it not
sure if this one actually oh you know it
there's the question you actually get a
back plate with this holy crap I'm gonna
double check the price on this and I def
only don't want to misquote this I'm
gonna have you hold this block - man
check this out if you've held the block
as well right it just feels weird
it's this real life but the fact you
also get a back plate with it now here's
the coolest part about this this is
actually the so this block right here
says it supports a founders edition 1070
1080 Titan ex new Titan XP and 1080 TI
you know they're able to do that they've
actually milled out all the areas that
might come flicked on these different
cards but it still touches GPU BRM and
memory so you have one block it's
actually cross compatible with all what
was that four or five cards that's
pretty cool but here's the best part
about all of this
everything you see here guys two hundred
and thirty nine US dollars do you know
how much just a copper GPU block is with
no backplate they usually are about a
hundred and fifteen to one hundred and
twenty-nine dollars so if you do the
math on that this is the hell of a
bargain we're not going to do a base run
on the graphics card because we already
know it's going to hit 84 C because it
is a founders card and it will hit
thermal max so let's go ahead and
install this and compare the temps
all right so we've been playing here for
a little while trying to load up the CPU
and the GPU at the same time I'm curious
as to how this little 240 rad is going
to perform so far it actually doesn't
feel too bad
we are I'll show you guys that the
temperatures in a second here a little
bit of a firefight but we are running
1080p on high settings actually what are
we we're not ruining 1080p at very high
and of course we have got 16 threads the
performance here trying to be cooled and
here's what the temps look like
currently our cores are sitting in the
40s and our GPU is sitting at 43 at 98%
load at 1886 mega it's not overclocked
or anything like that this is just the
base boost clock but look at his core
temps right here both CPU and GPU
everything's in the 40s that is pretty
damn impressive so as you saw gaming was
fine right this 240 right is more than
enough to keep the 1080 GT X 1080
founders edition cool and the CPU at the
same time everything was sitting in the
mid 40s right now this has been running
a 264 for a while and we are sitting
with the temps averaging geezers 58 c ni
c 70 see on the cores max we ever saw in
here with 78 so pretty much the same as
what we were seeing with the triple
radiator solution and this is a thinner
red may not aluminum it's smaller so
obviously you can see when it comes to
heat dissipation this is actually my
three my three sixty right is obviously
overkill for a CPU and this is handling
a single GPU just fine in an open
testbench situation like this
people are pretty much conditioned to
hate the idea of aluminum water cooling
well here's the thing
aluminum itself is not the problem the
problem is when you mix aluminum with
other metals it can accelerate the
process of galvanic corrosion your car's
most of them today modern engines have
aluminum head the aluminum blocks brass
radiators and they're mixed metals so
you have to have some sort of corrosion
and inhibitor in there to keep growth as
well as corrosion from happening again
Vanek corrosion it's something that can
happen even without fluid okay so it's
really fascinating if you go and read up
on it and I'm no chemist so I'm not
going to be able to do a very good job
at explaining it so I'm not even going
to try but I'm going to tell you right
now the ek has gone through the steps
and have gone through the effort to make
sure that that's not a problem here
they're using the same grade of aluminum
all their aluminum parts they even have
warning labels saying do not mix these
parts with brass and copper components
you have to use them with approved
components for that very reason now why
do they even bother making them out
aluminum will easy it's a heck of a lot
cheaper than making things out of copper
and it allows us to have a full custom
loop like this including a GPU for 239
u.s. dollars this is opening up the door
for way more people to get into water
cooling without breaking the bank and
fortunately they put everything into a
kit that's going to keep it as safe and
it's reliable as possible now here's the
part where I'm going to get a little bit
subjective I would love to have seen a
triple radiator because an expanded unit
like this would definitely have taken
advantage of a triple red a little bit
more than a dual 240 in my mind and I do
know that if this is a just a
off-the-shelf aluminum radiator used by
a lot of AIO companies I do know that
they also make a 360 that would have
been nice to see especially when you add
a GPU to the loop temps are obviously
fine but we're also in a controlled
space if you're in a warmer environment
the temps are going to be higher but I'm
not worried about galvanic corrosion I'm
honestly not in fact I'm probably going
to set up a loop just to let this thing
run for a while and we'll go back and
visit it in a few months and see what
happens
but I'm not expecting anything to happen
so when you create a product as part of
a genre that's usually way too expensive
for many people to experience but you
bring it down to an affordable place
more people can afford it and more
people can enjoy it that's a good thing
and as long as they've done their their
due diligence and make sure that we're
not going to problems with the aluminum
here then I think we're
going to be fine I mean the fluid that
they have here obviously has anti
corrosion properties to it and that on
top of it being all the same metal
shouldn't be an issue I think it's a
realistic fear a lot of people have
because I get to say we've been
conditioned for that but sound up in the
comments tell me what you guys think and
tell me what you think about those temps
and the price to performance ratio on
this kit damn near unbeatable alright
guys thanks for watching and as always
I'll see you in the next one cringes -
to see you kick my teeth hold it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
