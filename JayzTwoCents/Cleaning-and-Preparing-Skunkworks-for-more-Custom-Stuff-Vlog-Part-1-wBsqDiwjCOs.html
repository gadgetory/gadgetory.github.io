we are taking a look at the backend of
skunk works we're looking at her big ol
booty anyway today's gonna be kind of a
vlog style video I have an upcoming
project I'm gonna be doing with this and
collaboration with loot row customs and
I've got to prepare for some wiring work
here so I figured we'll do a vlog e
style video I haven't done in a while
and yeah let's just say that my PC is
not always as clean as some people might
think why is my focus broken oMG so yeah
this is for those people who are saying
your computer is always so clean how's
it always so clean oh my god you must
clean it every day yeah I've actually
already wiped some of the dust off but
if we take a look at the power supply
here look at that yeah guys I'm trying
to focus here guys I'm sorry I'm using a
cheap the cheap camera anyway earlier
this that is so gross anyway what I'm
gonna be doing here with loot row
customs is we are going to be doing a
custom wiring harness for this thing so
as you can see I've got extensions here
that I did a review on for both the 8
pin EPS power I've got a 6 pin axillary
going to the PCI Express Lanes on the
motherboard and then I've got my 24 plus
our 20+4 pin extension and then I've got
6 6 pin extensions for the 3 9 80s in
there as you can see the wiring is a bit
of a mess and because their extensions
I've got way more cables and I need and
so they basically said let us do a
custom wiring loom let's let's just do a
whole complete custom kit so what I've
got to do is I've got to take all these
wires out I've got a plan and route
where the wires are gonna go and then I
have to measure how long each harness
needs to be and give them those
measurements that way my EVGA 1600 watt
p2 power supply will have proper length
cables so I'll probably get some custom
fan cables made or make those myself but
I figure we'll just kind of do a vlog
little maintenance here and how I clean
the computer I basically use this guy
for the most part this is just a
electronics brush with the anti state
bristles and sort of a microfiber II
type material and then you just kind of
dust like that like I'm like your maid
now there is why the pumps and stuff
looks so bad is because you know it's
now I have the 560 rad right in there
for the graphics cards and the air is
pushed into this compartment and the
only thing I have pulling air out at all
is I basically just take one of my
static my extra static pressure fans and
I'd literally just sit it there I plug
the fan in up here and one of my molex
things and then I let that help exhaust
some of the area at least so it can
force you know not warlike force but
coax the air to move its way out the
rear vent otherwise the dust just comes
through and lands on all this and
has nowhere to go so one of the
downsides of having extra long power
supply like this one here and then the
two pumps down here and all this tubing
is I can't mount any fan you know
brackets back here to move the air out I
guess in hindsight I could have
relocated these pumps somewhere else and
then had like a 240 mount here which
would pull the air through but really
the temperatures don't suffer at all so
I just kind of left it this way but yeah
as you can see it's a it's pretty bad
it's it's gross
so I guess before I get too crazy on the
dusting I might as well just go ahead
and remove all of the cables get those
out of the way
now one of the things I do which really
helps with cleaning the cases I'll just
take a microfiber cloth and I'll damp it
that way you can see how like you get
inside all these little I forgot to use
this lens damnit this is raw unscripted
see all that dust and stuff right there
like these brushes don't really get in
there too good but if you damp like a
microfiber then you can get in there
nicely and clean off all that dust a
case like this is textured so the dust
gets in that texture and it makes it
really hard to clean
so yeah damping dampening a cloth is I
feel the best the best thing to do and
I'll just do this usually like New
Year's it's kind of a tradition for me
to do this sort of thing obviously it's
New Year's right now and then I guess
it's a lot of work but dust is an enemy
to electronics and so I take it pretty
serious all right so I got pretty much
got the cables straightened out how I
want you guys can see my fan splitters
up there
fanciful you can't see how she has one
in front of the radiator down there and
then there's one there so I've had a lot
of questions I guess I didn't cover very
well when I did my build log on this was
how everything's wired up I have the
four top fans in the in the top 480 red
going into a splitter right there which
then has this cable coming off of it
here like you're really bright has this
cable coming off of it here which
through this extension connects to the
one down there in front of the radiator
which also has the four fans on it for
the
five sixty though for 140s and then I
have up there a molex to three pin
adapter which is actually going to the
motherboard CPU one header now the CPU
one header on this was is able to handle
two amps and I think it was twenty eight
watts maybe twenty four watts and all of
these fans at full load come in at less
than that so all eight fans are actually
being run off the CPU fan header which I
can control through the BIOS and smart
fan control the three on the front are
just being powered off four pin 12-volt
molex width you can kind of see it there
it's got three voltage reducers on there
so the front fans are running at only
about I think it's about eight hundred
rpm bringing in a lot of air actually
because it's completely unobstructed on
the front you can you can kind of see
there it just has absolutely wide-open
airflow into the case and then the rear
fan is also being controlled off of the
fan header on the motherboard it's just
one of the chassis fans and so
everything is everything's controlled on
this with the exception of the three
front fans which are static now I'm
actually considering adding a 360 mm
meter rad to the front just for the hell
of it and actually makes me kind of want
to put a 120 in the rear as well because
uh why not just fill this thing up with
radiators I don't know we'll see
you may notice there's an air bubble up
there and my in my tube that's just
because I moved the drain tubes I have
right there which had some air in them
and of course they worked their way up
when I move those and then once I turn
on the system that'll that'll sort of
just work itself out and that won't be a
problem so what I'm gonna do now and I
didn't unplug the 24 pin or the 8 pin
and 6 pin down there because I don't
want to go through having to plug those
back in I'm not gonna actually unplug
those until I'm ready to remove those so
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna get
some string and then some alum measuring
tape and I'm going to just pretty much
route out the cable paths that I want
measure them and then write them down
and get those over to loot row alright
so what I've done now is I've basically
just taken a piece of like kite string a
pretty long length longer than I would
need for anything else in here and then
a measuring tape which I've just laid
out flat and I've got a note pad here
with
all the different cable links that I
know I'm going to need are different
cables like 24 pin 8 and an EPS 6 pin
PCI Express mobo connector for
exhilarating time 6 SATA times 2 for the
upper dry of SATA times tubes the lower
drives molex times 2 for the pump and
then on pumps and then molex times 1 for
that guy so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
just gonna take the string and I'm gonna
lead it from where it's gonna start on
the power supply up to wherever the end
connection is and I'm going to add maybe
one inch to that we'll see and we write
down the measurements and then that's
how we're gonna get our links for all
the custom cables now people have asked
me before about these SATA cables
they're round SATA cables that Lucho
just puts leaving on so that they look
better and as you can see they are too
long so I'm gonna I'm gonna measure
those just in case I don't know if they
have different lengths SATA cables
they're pretty much a standard like a
three inch short and then something like
you know 16 inches for normal or
something I don't know well go ahead and
measure all that out and see I'll just
give to him anyway but anyway it's all
cleaned up my major goal for today was
to clean the thing and then get these
measurements they've actually been
asking me to get these measurements for
them for like three months that's the
first chance I've had to actually tear
the system apart so alright let's do it
so while I was in here I decided to go
ahead and reroute the fan fan fan cables
yeah the PCI Express cables and as you
can see I've got they're not perfect I'm
going very ain't all over these wires I
don't know why since they're coming out
but instead of swooping in the side and
taking up all the space next to the SATA
cables
I've crammed them all down that little
bitty hole down there
I've crammed it in two whole guys it's
how babies are made anyway yeah so it's
going down in there and well that gives
me a pretty good idea of how long the
cables need to be since the end of the
PCI Express is right there so literally
I just subtract about two inches from
each one of these and there's my link so
yeah there's that but tell me what you
guys think about this versus when they
were kind of going sideways
I thought with everything else in this
case kind of having an up-and-down theme
that these goings like kind of a
diagonal looked really silly in there so
tell me what you think
all right well I got all my measurements
and my chicken scratch there so I guess
it's going to be time to hook everything
back up put it back together and stop
screwing with this focus all right guys
I will keep I will keep this alive this
vlog thing once the cables are done and
we'll come back with part two of getting
it all wired up we'll do a review of
those cables because is these are like
the stiff it's very stiff like plastic
or nylon sleeving which I'm not a huge
fan of and we're gonna be doing paracord
on the new cables so that'll be fun all
right guys Jay is two cents as always
thanks for watching follow on Twitter if
you have any questions or just want to
see some behind the scene pictures of
this thing check out Instagram and as
always guys I will see you in the next
one which is going to be CES yeah baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
