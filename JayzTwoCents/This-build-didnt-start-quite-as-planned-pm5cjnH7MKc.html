shill anyway I'm at least look the part
I got new merch it's available now crowd
me calm /jc sense we got zip up hoodies
we got tri-blend we got a new logo I
digress
since 2012 it's a big risk logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys
live it up we can all kinda stuff zip up
hoodies have beanies polos don't take my
word for it cuz obviously I can't do
this ad so just look in the description
below and you guys will find the link
Thanks so this is the white define our
601 we use in our ad where we put the
slick wraps white front panel on this
and I thought to myself this box this
this box gave me inspiration I've been
wanting to do a white build but I hadn't
been able to decide like how I wanted to
go about it then the amazing appearance
that is the Titan r-tx card although
extremely overpriced extremely
impractical unnecessarily existing enter
any sort of analogy here that you would
like the fact that we ended up with two
of these I just I wanted to do something
with them and not just have them sit on
the shelf we've already talked about the
fact that they are not a gaming card
they although they're the same exact
architecture is the gaming card they
came out with but I digress I found the
box extremely inspiring and I went what
if I did a white and gold build well
they actually had an r5 white and gold
edition so I kind of decided to make my
own r6 and yesterday I did some painting
and stuff and I decided I'm going to
make a video about this I wasn't
planning on making a video very rarely
do I do anything computer related around
here I don't make a video but I thought
you know what I'll go ahead and share it
with you guys
we took this box and that's our
inspiration so I painted some pieces
already that I'll show you guys and
we're gonna paint some more cuz I wanted
to sort of proof of concept to see if I
could come anywhere near the colors of
the card so we went to Lowe's and I
found this Kryolan fusion which I've had
a lot of success with and some of my
mods it holds well it's a to paint and a
primer so you can usually paint it
directly onto a surface although it's
not gonna be the most durable if you
don't prep the surface I thought the
color looked close enough to the
backplate and in between the polished
and the
or the Sutton okay we could probably get
away with it and then I compared it to
the box and I went that's pretty damn
close and of course Phil being the
super-smart guy that he is was like yeah
but the color gold on the box isn't the
color gold of the card and I was like
let me have this just let me do this so
these are the pieces that I painted to
kind of give us our gold accents here
and as you can see compared to the Titan
cards they definitely flow well enough
in the gold color family and even my
table you see I spray-painted my table
cuz I'm done so where this gave me the
accents and colors that I wanted I was
kind of torn on this front piece here
because we are going to be doing water
cooling we're not gonna water cool the
graphics cards oh no we're not doing
that because of the fact that we're
using the cooler as inspiration and you
know there's no reason why we need to
water cool them because it could have
been a 20 atti then for all that matters
and all those blocks are silver or
nickel-plated so I mean I could have
gone with the copper but this is not a
copper build this is a gold build and
when we took this and we sort of helped
this in here we were like oh yeah yeah
the white and gold that would be perfect
for any Saudi prince like the color
scheme you would see of like like a
Saudi prince honestly but I thought we
needed some more so I'm gonna go ahead
and take these pieces and kind of put
them in here so you could see what they
look like you know against the white
which I think just absolutely looks
phenomenal so this is how I ended up
painting my table though because I did
like this and then there's these gaps
between the cardboard on that one
yeah so would be putting another layer
on these I'm gonna show you how I
painted the screws and because the
screws are knurled as you can see right
there they actually stick creating well
it's got a lot of surface and jagged
edges to grab on to but I want to do a
little bit more for good measure now the
way I painted the screws though because
that's the hardest part is I did it with
cardboard but I'm gonna show you how you
could do it with foam now just like poke
it into some styrofoam cardboard
whatever and it's sort of like screwed
in there a little bit that way it's
holding it up and you can get to all
sides so like I said I had done this
yesterday with cardboard but today I'm
just gonna use the foam because there's
more paces more paces
paces there's more pieces on this case I
want to paint like the fan blades they
do just pull off but so Phil's cracking
up because I'm using the power screw to
screw these into the cardboard I ran out
of room on the foam well I technically
there's more room but these are harder
to get into there so these are the fan
screws you know for the fans we just
destroyed because we learned the hard
way you can't really get the blades off
the dynamic fan that comes with the case
unfortunately Josh from fractal design
got back to me right after we learned
that so yeah we got some more fans on
the way so we technically have the
Vardar fans that are white but they're
more of an off-white they don't match
the case at all and since the quality of
I guess died whatever plastic they're
using in the case matches with the
dynamic fans that come with it we're
just getting more fans I'm also gonna be
painting the envy link bridge I know
that the motherboard I'm gonna be using
is a triple slot or three slot spacing
so this is gonna work but because this
LED glows green I believe that this is
also an RGB LED core know the truth
because we already open this up and look
behind there it's not a film making it
green like on the old cards and bridges
so we'll be unplugging that light
altogether so it doesn't glow and then
we'd be painting the silver gold because
obviously this would clash with our
cards so once we get all this painted
then we can start a sort putting in the
case to show you guys what it's gonna
look like so I get asked this all the
time what this toolkit is that I use
this was actually not a sponsored
toolkit although I fix it has sponsored
some youtubers my wife bought me this
for Father's Day last year either that
or my birthday I remember which day
anyway
it doesn't really matter you guys can
look down the description below I'll put
a link to it to my amazon affiliate and
there's it's a whole bunch of stuff
there's different types of kits big ones
small ones even magnetic trays so you
can use it for like computer building
repairs of like smartphones tablets
laptops it's got all the possible bits
we need even security bit so yeah you
guys ask me all the time that is what
I'm using now the NBA link bridge
hopefully it comes apart easier the
second time because it snaps together
and then it has two Phillips on the
bottom two torques on the top
and then it's a clamshell that goes
together on either side of the actual
board it's 90 dollars or 80 bucks for
this thing I want to I don't have to
break it so Phil and I were looking at
this yesterday this is what makes us
pretty much positive that this is RGB
look at the amount of cables going into
the light there is actually a are a red
a green and a blue wire so I'm gonna
find a way to unlock it on here I think
after all this time I'm finally ready to
paint
I got a mask top about as best as I can
I mean it's never gonna be perfect when
you're masking but I think it'll get the
job done as long as there's no silver
showing so let's go ahead and make some
fumes
I got fan exhausting air
okay so we had a we had a mishap okay so
here's what happened I had this sitting
here like this and this had a nice new
fresh coat on a heavy coat because I
wanted it to be more glossy this is a
gloss paint and because I've been
dusting it it gives it that sort of a
matte look that I wanted this piece to
be a little bit glossy here instead of
going with like clear or something I
just sprayed it on heavier and then I
moved the fan over here because I was
like oh this will help it dry faster and
this wet and it fell on it while it was
wet and that's like no so I picked it up
it like it was all stream that's like oh
that's okay I can wipe it while it's wet
so then I took paper towels and poured
alcohol on it and yes I know alcohol is
not a thinner I'm well aware it's not an
acetone or anything like that
anyway I tried to wipe the wet paint off
and now you can see we've got this
lovely textured effect so if we want to
go for that weathered steampunk look we
nailed it but anyway I'm now gonna show
you how to strip this piece and start
all over so this to the rescue aircraft
paint remover you can find it in
different brands this one happens to be
by a clean strip you can find it from
rust-oleum called air craft remover
there's different types of paint
stripper I've had really good experience
with air craft remover so it basically
will strip off all the paint on the
metal the problem is if it's powder
coated and it's a very terrible or very
thin layer powered table hood the
problem is if it's a very thin layer of
powder coat then it could potentially
take that off too but since we're
painting it anyway I don't care so we're
just gonna spray this on liberally and
we are going to let it start to do its
thing and eat into the paint you can
take a brush to sort of work it in there
if you need to what I'm gonna do while
this is eating because it's gonna take
about ten minutes for this to do
something I'm gonna take one of my ice
chests and I'm gonna fill it with water
so we can dunk it in there and clean it
off that way yeah so as you can see we
are getting down to the white paint now
see that it's just sort of peeling it
off so that's what it does it just eats
through the paint and then yeah there's
a lot of paint on this I put way more
layers of paint on this that I really
needed so it's so gooey watch
ha it's like I'm reaching into a
diarrhoea film see you can even fix my
epic pickups alright time to put back
together
yes I'm aware that there's no
motherboard in there
obviously they're just in there to see
what they're gonna look like so I think
we did a pretty good job of balancing
the amount of gold versus the white now
obviously this is part two or there's
gonna be part two for this I I'm sorry
about that I don't like doing multi
partners but that's because I got a wild
hair at my ass yesterday decided I'm
gonna do this and I don't have any of
the water cooling stuff I need for this
so part two is gonna be doing the loop
for the CPU putting that together we
have gold fittings coming some black and
gold fittings actually and I think it's
all gonna look really good glass for
reservoir same one we used in the thread
Ripper build actually and I cannot wait
for this to be done this might end up
being my my new work machine because
I've got I mean this just really doesn't
but the Titans aren't good for gaming
and stuff I mean they are but just their
performance is abysmal in terms of their
cost but I think he'll this channel has
always been about kind of doing things
that are a little bit impractical we
show you guys how to do things and I
like to sometimes go extremely
over-the-top that's why all the white
and gold on this looks amazing
unfortunately I broke the fan and then
by seeing whether or not that was a
fluke I tried it on the next fan and
broke that one and yep so we've got new
fans on the way and I'll probably just
mask those off and paint the blades if
we feel like it needs it but once you
get the radiator and the pump and the
tubing and all that stuff we will be
doing rigid in this I'm just going clear
on the coolant I'm not gonna be doing
any colored coolant I mean pastel white
might look good but I've had the white
unfortunately fall out over time and
some builds to where it's sort of like a
nonfat milk look rather than just a nice
thick opaque white milk I don't know why
I'm doing this I'm doing it so yeah I
can't wait for this build to be done
motherboard wise this stuff probably
gonna just use the same 79 60 X that
I've gotten my system upstairs where
we're gonna be going with the new asus
deluxe ii which is basically a white and
silver motherboard i'll probably taking
the silver pieces off of the heat sheet
he cheeks the heat sinks and painting
those gold to match yes i know that when
he paints a heatsink it loses some of
its efficiency but it should be fine
we're not pushing the overclocks and
stuff really far but i think obviously
the best part of this I'm really proud
of with a Tesla
which turned out I wish that they had
made a gold envy link that matched the
cards but that's not off enough to look
out of place we also got custom cables
that are paracord white black and gold
as well that'll tie this whole build
together and then all the water cooling
stuff will be over here to fill in the
front part and my backup plan if I
wasn't able to repair that panel that I
completely jacked up as you see looks
phenomenal after like an extra hour and
a half two hours worth of work was I was
gonna cut the box and it's like who
would staple it on their iPhone duh
okay we've we sniffed enough paint fumes
today I'm sure some of you were already
typing at some point in this video Janey
should be wearing a respirator nothing I
could say that would be incorrect so
I'll give you that one Internet we
should have been wearing a respirator
but we had a fan in an open window
subscribe it'll save my brain cells
alright guys part two coming after the
Christmas break at some point we'll see
you then merry new year and a Happy
Thanksgiving
crap yes shot of you falling out the
window oh you were you were hoping look
at you I like boobies come on you big
baby
see even my echo see even my echo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
