talking head videos feel free to
minimize it really even media if you
want to I guess but that's besides the
point we're gonna talk about the
precedent that's been set how dangerous
is is and what the future holds
potentially what the future could look
like because of article 13 or more
commonly known as article 13 it's
actually the European Union directive on
copyright yeah you could tell that was
written by old people today's video is
brought to you by Nord VPN a service
I've been using for a long time and it's
becoming more relevant than ever as we
will talk about in today's video
obviously with the passing of the
European Union a directive on copyright
and specifically article 13 we'll be
talking about that in today's video so
we're probably going to see a huge rise
in VPN traffic here in the near future
because of net neutrality and now
article 13 but fortunately Nord VPN has
you covered with thousands of servers on
more than 61 countries including you
guessed it Europe in fact Nord VPN even
has a campaign going right now to bring
awareness to this ongoing issue with a
fight the Mima ban with memes
competition taking place in fact you
guys can find a link down the
description below it's designed to make
people aware of what is happening and
what we are talking about in today's
video but not only all of this it's just
good practice to protect and encrypt
your data when you connect to the
internet with military-grade encryption
you can bet that the ISPs and the
governments and all these other entities
will not be spying on your data in fact
new users you sign up for Nord VPN using
my offer code J's two cents at checkout
can save 75% off a three-year membership
that is a very small price to pay to
maintain the open freedom of your
internet experience so you guys waiting
for start taking things serious and
shove it to article 13 by signing up for
Nord VPN using my link in the
description below alright so here's the
thing net neutrality was a big bad scary
thing because it basically gave the ISPs
freedom to lock down the internet if
that makes sense which is such an
oxymoron right there because an oxymoron
written by morons that being edge of Pi
net neutrality was good
we the battle of net neutrality was lost
because of corporations paying billions
and millions and billions of dollars to
people like a Japan but you know what
though that kind of pales in comparison
to what article 13 can kind of do to the
future because the biggest issue with
net neutrality or the lack of net
neutrality is the fact that ISPs could
charge you they could charge you to
connect to YouTube they could charge you
to connect the Netflix or they could
draw all your internet which they
currently do they can slow down your
internet connection to these sites
because they are bandwidth hogs or if
you want to get full speed you pay for
it and that's that's the the spirit of
non neutrality but this isn't discussion
about net neutrality it's much much
worse and that being I as I already
mentioned the European directive on
copyright the European Union directive
on copyright now what that basically has
is a it's a big law it's a big
legislative piece of a bunch of old baby
boomers that sit around and some
parliament and Europe somewhere and to
say this is the way it should be done
can someone help me log into my AOL
account you just listen to some of the
legislators and law passers talk about
lawmakers passers whatever just listen
to it's like listening to them talk
about the Internet is like listening to
me talk about law these lawmakers that
pass article 13 still use a trackball
someone out there watching this right
now is like I still use the trackball if
you use a trackball hit F anyway so
article 13 the way thing okay to
understand what's changing you have to
understand the way things currently work
now right now in YouTube I'm gonna use
the United States state the United
States I'm hungry try to have a serious
conversation guys the United States of
a1 but understand the potential of how
this could all work in the future yet
understand how it currently works today
at least yesterday or the day before
before it actually went into effect here
in the United States that's the only
laws I know and can go by so I can tell
you the way it currently works at least
with YouTube is YouTube does have to
follow the local laws of the areas that
they're being viewed so if you're
viewing YouTube in Europe or you're
viewing it in
chyna I think you compute in China maybe
on a VPN for you viewing it in Korea are
you viewing it in Taiwan or South Africa
there are local laws have to be applied
to where you're currently watching
things because although the internet is
all-encompassing in a connection the
entire world you're still bound by your
local laws so I am in the United States
and those are the laws I know and
understand so that's what I'm be
referencing but it could affect us here
because it sets a precedent and other
governments like to follow suit with
those that pioneer and do laws and
things first and so this could be making
its way here and the problem is I see
article 13 and the European Union
directive on copyright but the old
people here in the United States going
that sounds like a really good idea the
way it currently works right now is that
I upload a video or Kyle uploads a video
that uses any other material I created
J's two cents I upload these videos this
is this is content that I own because
its intellectual property I'm making
this I'm creating it and if someone
takes it and uploads it I can legally
claim that content under copyright Kyle
did that very sip the verge PC build and
you all know how that turned out he was
hit with a copyright strike because
someone in the team was like we don't
like what he's saying we're gonna
copyright it but he's protected under
laws known as fair use here in the
United States
so although Kyle used that piece of
content from the verge for a parody that
was under fair use in accordance of fair
use which is an actual law here that
states that you can do that you can make
parodies you can use bits as long as
it's used in a new creative format and
not just a reload or a copyright you
know just obviously using copyrighted
material for the sake of reuploading it
in its entirety now fortunately the
editor-in-chief of The Verge agreed that
it was an erroneous use of DMCA which is
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
similar to article 13 here in the United
States been abused too many many times
it was up to the verge to first initiate
the copyright strike and then it was
also up to the verge to remove it
article 13 basically states that it
would be up to YouTube now to identify
and make sure that copyrighted material
does not make it on the platform because
YouTube does benefit from every single
upload that hasn't ad on YouTube they
take 40% of the revenue
and as such if they get 40% of illegal
copyright uploaded material then that
makes them basically implicated in the
violation as well so article 13
specifically in Europe states that the
platform has to be responsible for the
copyright makes making sure that they
are in compliance and not uploading and
benefiting from copyrighted material so
here's a few problems with that one it's
very open to interpretation in fact they
very clearly state that it's open to
interpretation and it's up to the
individual countries within the Union
that being obviously the European Union
to implement a system that stops the
copyright material from being reuploaded
so one how do you do that it's not like
YouTube or Twitter or Facebook or Google
or whatever hosting platform we'll talk
more but more about that because there
are guidelines in here or requirements
in here as to who doesn't have a have to
have a filter system who does etc etc
it's not like they receive a list of
this is copyrighted it's not like they
receive a database that says here's the
image match or the sound match or the
sound file or whatever that states oh
this is copyright when it's uploaded so
how is the platform supposed to know one
because the platform now can be
potentially fined and held responsible
for copyrighted material my fear is that
the platform is going to become
extremely sensitive so if you thought
there were a lot of false positives
before I think this is just the
beginning now in terms of uploading
though like I said it's not like they
have a database so there's no way for
them to know what is or isn't copyright
material and many people don't know this
it is up to the copyright holder to go
in to the YouTube system to give it
samples to say this is our material look
for it remove it when you find it or you
have the manual claims like you saw
against Kyle so the issue there is
YouTube Twitter Facebook and all the
other major platforms are not going to
have a mechanism in terms of knowing
everything that has copyright compliance
its copyright material it's gonna be up
to the copyright holder to still feed
that data now this is coming directly
from Wired co uk so I'll put a link to
this article down below it says the
final wording of article 13 sense out
exactly which platforms will need upload
filters in which ones will now currently
on YouTube will not
something if I've just um if I'm just
erroneous and I say I'm gonna upload
this entire fight scene from Avengers
infinity war it will get captured it
will get immediately removed you have a
choice as the copyright holder do you
want to monetize the material and just
redirect the funds to yourself do you
want to give them a strike which is the
most damaging to the content uploader
and then or do you want to just remove
it entirely but if I upload it something
that's straight-up owned by like
Universal or DreamWorks or whatever it
will get caught it will get caught
during the upload process because that's
a very cut and dry copyright those have
the manpower and the money to go in and
feed the AI to feed the filters to let
them know this is copyrighted material
it's a lot easier to identify as well I
own this video right now I'm creating it
I own it it's my IP it's on YouTube they
get a piece of the money but this is
mine if someone else uploads it I have
the same options as Universal or
DreamWorks wood or Marvel or Disney from
any other piece of copyrighted material
the only way a site that hosts
user-generated content can avoid putting
in a place or in place at upload filter
is if it fulfills all three of the
following criteria it said it has been
available for fewer than three years not
many platforms that we consume content
on these days or fewer than three years
old it has an annual turnover below ten
million euro that's not a lot of money
if you're a hosting platform it has
fewer than five million unique monthly
visitors so basically this as you could
as you can probably guess this means a
huge number of sites from phishing
forums to niche social networks will
need to install filters let's just use
for example like overclock net one of
the oldest still running and operating
compete websites with a forum a forum
that allows you to upload pictures
directly to its own hosting database as
like a you know it's a registered user
and if overclock net meets doesn't meet
all three of those remember it could
meet one two one or two but if it
doesn't meet all three they have to have
some sort of mechanism in place to
filter out the copyrighted material so
one of the issues with something like
overclocked net is the fact that sure
they may not have five million unique
visitors a month anymore but they are
definitely older than three years
and I don't even know how a site like
overclock net or any form would be able
to afford any sort of filtering system
that doesn't exist you know YouTube
wrote its own AI to do it you know
Facebook has its own AI to do it these
small companies don't have any way of
complying with these type of overclock
are these these copyright laws I believe
there's even an overclockers UK or
something like that as well there's
there's a ton of European sites that
it's just there's no way for them to
stay in compliance with this so what I
see kind of being the obvious answer to
that is they just remove uploading
entirely
there's even clauses and other language
inside of here that I haven't even
gotten into yet that also refers to
linking and hot linking to copyrighted
materials so how do you then control
your users from being able to provide a
link that then brings up a hosted image
somewhere else of copyrighted material
that's on your platform and they want
the platform to still be responsible for
that so I don't understand how this is
something that's going to be able to be
enforced I have zero idea and see it's
just this they just threw this whole
blanket over the problem but it says
that the blanket has a bunch of holes in
it it doesn't make any sense so I can't
see how sites like that are going to be
able to be to enforce this I don't even
see how there's there gonna be
enforcement over this at all if you want
to know the truth I mean outside of the
mate's like the major sites like you
know YouTube for example they're big
enough to be on the radar and
governments and law law law enforcement
will go after stuff like that but the
small guys I mean I'd I kind of feel
like you could slide under the radar but
do you want to take that risk so as
another article in here we're gonna
leave that was like article 12 a
basically states that if you go to a
sporting event you can not take out your
phone and record it and upload it to
Facebook and share it with your friends
without potentially also being caught
under copyright Facebook could also put
a filter in place and say we've
identified this as copyrighted material
you cannot share it so what does this
mean if you're a european-based content
creator it means that the platform is
gonna start getting a lot more stringent
fair use is one of those things that's
like probably out the window now because
how you gonna determine what's being
used in fair use if it's a voiceover on
a clip that's being shown in its
entirety but it's still considered fair
use or
just something that looks very similar
to something that has been used in the
past and it has the Oh copyrighted
material fortunately there are some ways
around this right now and I don't know
how well this is going to work in the
future but right now there are ways
around it you saw the ad earlier in this
video that would be that of a VPN or
virtual private network where you're
tricking your ISP and the in the
platform you're connecting to and
everything to look like you're
connecting from somewhere else so right
now if you live in Europe a VPN of any
sort that you trust is highly
recommended because for now you need to
mask where you're from to kind of get
around this log so this video is just
kind of putting it out there and making
you guys aware of why it's important to
stay active but involved in what's
happening with your laws specifically on
the Internet the Internet is the future
and a lot of lawmakers understand that
but they don't understand exactly what
it is they're making laws about and you
get crap like this you get the European
Union directive of copyright ironically
those people that are in opposition of
it Facebook Netflix Google I think eBay
was on there as well a lot of the online
sites you know who's all for it record
labels movie producers publishers
because they're the ones who benefit
directly obviously from all of the
copyright material and so they don't
want any bit of it even a snippet or
even a meme to make it out there on the
internet without getting paid so it's
pretty obvious who's for and who is
against unfortunately article 13 has
passed and I believe it is now in effect
so things are definitely not looking
great for the internet so at the end of
the day between net neutrality in the
United States and the directive of
copyright in Europe it's just not
looking good for the future of the
Internet and this is what happens when
you buy a have a bunch of old people
sitting around not sure how to log into
their Yahoo making laws about the
internet so anyway I just want to get
this information out there and just
basically and spark a little bit of
interest for you guys to go and read and
research this and I am dead serious when
I say you need a VPN like I said even if
it's not mine a VPN is the only way to
start having any sort of fight or
pushback because if the can't get the
data from you to know what you're doing
and where you're going and stuff at
least that's the first line of defense
it's not a foolproof one but it's at
least the first line of defense all
right guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you
