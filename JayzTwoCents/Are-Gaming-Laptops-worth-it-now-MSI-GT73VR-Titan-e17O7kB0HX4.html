video it's that you guys seem to think
that BEC is a green-screen
okay that's really outside gaming
laptops this is one of those topics that
even bringing it up makes some of the
highest end enthusiasts in the community
cringe because often they're considered
to be too heavy too hot and a terrible
value now I would normally agree with
that in fact I wasn't even doing laptop
reviews for the first four years of my
channel I felt that there was no point
and I was with you guys when I said that
they were too expensive for which get
but that's all changed now let's talk
real quick about gaming laptops and who
might actually want one maybe we should
start with what is a gaming laptop well
typically gaming laptops just have
discreet graphics it's the only thing
that really makes them different usually
they have a little bit faster CPUs maybe
a little bit of overclocking available
to them but usually they're pretty
locked down and very limited now that's
where this comes in this is emphasized
new flagship the GT 73 we are tightened
I've been using it now for about four
months I told the company that I was
going to be doing some extensive testing
on this in all sorts of environments
including traveling and I wanted to get
a real hands-on experience with this
without just playing around with it and
then saying oh yeah this is a gaming
laptop and this is hell performed I
actually rendered all of my CES videos
on this guy I rendered my video from San
Francisco on this guy and so far since
I've been here in the office the only
computer I've been using is this guy now
the only person I could really see
wanting this level of power a laptop
would be be traveling power user now
that's what I used to do for my company
one for almost ten years I worked in IT
I traveled to our various satellite
offices and our customers and clients
that we service sometimes on the road up
to three weeks at a time when I had a
little HP probook that had you know
integrated graphics I could barely even
play a game like League of Legends and
trust me when I say that three weeks in
the hotel with no gaming and nothing to
do made for a very depressing trip so
obviously something like this would have
been welcome but that was also back in
the mid to late 2000s and there wasn't
that much power to actually be had in a
notebook but that's all changed due to
the efficiency of GPUs and CPU
today now this unit right here it
specifically featuring 268 20 HK it is
an unlocked overclockable chip we'll
talk about that in a second but it also
has a full-blown GT X 1080 chip in here
giving you an extremely good gaming
experience it's not a 1080 M or some
sort of an M version of the chip which
you know usually has lost CUDA cores and
less power this is the same exact thing
you would get if you bought like a
founders Edition card and yes it is also
overclockable now even though we've seen
some great efficiency improvements on
CPU and GPU cooling is still something
that's very important and that's what
MSI has definitely thought out on this
particular unit right here the entire
bottom is nothing but one big giant vent
it's got completely open intake on the
bottom and it's got four exhaust ports
one on each side and two on the back now
speaking of the back it's got a very
cool look that's something that a lot of
people tend to not like about gaming
laptops they tend to be very
over-the-top and very gaudy and this
one's kind of on the edge of that
depending on what your tastes may be but
I think it has kind of a neat like sort
of a lamborghini aventador look to the
back of it that's obviously going to be
subjective to taste but I think MSI kept
it pretty toned down compared to some
gaming laptops that are out there
MSI also offers full tailoring of these
so that you can outfit them to kind of
meet your need to bring the price down
in some areas like for instance is
available in a 4k I opted for the 1080p
120 Hertz panel because what the 1080
it's still not enough power to do 4k
gaming and the 17 inch screen with a 4k
display in my opinion is just not very
smart
so attending 2p 120 Hertz was perfect
especially for gaming and the 1080 has
no problems keeping up with high frame
rates and very smooth g-sync 120 Hertz
because it is this is also a GC panel it
also has an SSD raid setup in here as
well as an SSD main drive so we are
getting extremely fast performance on
this thing if you don't want all that of
course you don't have to configure it
that far up now it also features the
SteelSeries keyboard in here so it's got
LED lighting you can configure them by
zones or individual lights however you
want to do
there's a lot of customization here now
let's talk about overclocking because
that was something that was important to
me especially since I'm doing my
rendering on this now this is a full
four core eight thread 6820 HK like I
said that I currently have clocked to
4.1 gigahertz how big of an overclock is
that well this chip actually ships out
of the box at 2.7 gigahertz now it can
get a little bit noisy if you're doing
things like rendering and whatnot but
you can also go into the msi software
the dragon app and actually set up fan
profiles with the lighting profiles and
all sorts of screen customizations and
thai blue filters and stuff like that so
really you're getting the same type of
experience you would on a desktop in a
very much more portable form factor the
gtx 1080 is also overclockable on this
thing so you have complete overclocking
of CPU and GPU but of course you have to
keep in mind that if you do that you are
going to definitely ramp up the heat
that's in the thing which you're going
to want to keep it cool with an
aggressive fan profile which means noise
in fact it even has a button on here
like a turbo button for the fans so if
you're doing something that's really
strenuous and you just want to say hey
fans though as fast as you can or you
can push that but keep in mind you might
make your neighbors a little upset
it kind of looks like a jet in the back
sounds like one two now I was able to
get about an hour of gaming time on this
with it on the high performance profile
which means no slowing down of CPU and
GPU and dimming of the screen try and
save battery life but a solid hour with
this much hardware it's actually not
that bad
the downside though is check out this
power brick yeah this thing right here
is about the size of some laptops
altogether it definitely weighs a few
pounds as well something to keep in mind
yeah now the cool thing about this
having a full sized GT x 1080 GPU and
there is that pretty much any game I
play with the 120 Hertz 1080p panel it's
pretty much locked at 120 fps the g-sync
in there does a great job of keeping the
frames really smooth I play games like
Grand Theft Auto 5
rise of the Tomb Raider Diablo of color
Diablos not very demanding on games but
any game I threw at this it had no
problem whatsoever just churning out the
FPS and giving me a very usable
experience a usable man was damn good
experience 120 FPS locks on most games
would even a game like a grand total 5
like I said a lot of CPU usage in that
game has no problem keeping up
whatsoever I definitely wouldn't
recommend though putting this on your
your lap if you still value maybe having
kids in the future it gets a little hot
at time now one thing I want to talk
about real quick that you should
probably keep in mind on a laptop this
size and the size of the vents right
here in the back of the laptop they're
big enough for small objects to kind of
work their way in there if you have any
sort of debris or anything in your
backpack see if you can hear it
oh one just fell out ok that's good in
my backpack I left one of those little I
didn't see it in the bottom of the
little silicon packs that are designed
to kind of like I guess absorb moisture
or whatever they're there for when
they're in shipping it broke open and
then all those little pellets went in
here thankfully there inert and they're
not like any sort of conductive piece of
stuff but I've already taken the bottom
off this thing and put it back together
and then I traveled to the airport San
Francisco and came home and there was
more rattling I said what the heck and I
finally figured it out so keep your
backpacks clean small little objects can
work their way in there which is not
good so my guys tell me what you think
about gaming laptops in general I know
they're typically a love it or hate it
type of product and typically the only
people I find that actually appreciate
them or understand their purpose are
people like me who are power users who
travel and want the power to go with
them at the sacrifice of weight noise
and a little bit of extra heat this guy
right here is definitely giving you
desktop performance and something that
can fit in your backpack which I think
everyone should appreciate but it's not
cheap I mean these can go up to well
almost endless but this one right here
is about $3,200 not cheap now the four
months I've been using this I have not
experienced any sort of weird issues
with the hardware itself I've really put
this thing through the paces I
overclocked it on day one it's from
running a full speed overclock nonstop
it's sitting here right now at the
desktop at 4.0 5 gigahertz it's actually
set before point one but like I said
because the P clock adjustments it goes
down slightly fewer power users you know
what that means with the SSD raid array
and 64 gigabytes of ddr4 in this laptop
I have to say that I am absolutely in
love with the performance of this thing
now that's exactly what I requested from
MSI I need I said I need something that
I can play my games on in my you know
pcmr high refresh rate high fps you know
I can't go down to 60 anymore because
I'm a panel snob now and I need
something that can also meet my needs
with rendering and I rendered a 50
megabit 4k video the tour that you guys
saw this 11 minute video in just under
20 minutes that's not bad at all for a
laptop that's fantastic all right guys
time to go thanks for watching today's
video I hope you learned something about
some gaming laptops at least seen how
far we've come and even just the last
couple of years in terms of small
form-factor computing power so I'm going
to go now once you guys hit that like
button if you enjoyed today's video give
me some more topic ideas you think I
should cover and as always I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
