James two cents bringing you not really
a new part for red mist but in fact I
decided you guys commented that you
never get to see anything happening with
the build so I figured I'd go ahead and
take the opportunity of having to
install the replacement pump if you
recall we had a bad pump in the previous
part that was part 5 kind of lost track
this build seems to be just never-ending
I figured we'd go ahead and show you
guys the sexy rear end of red mist here
we'll take a look inside the bonnet
under the hood so I don't know exactly
how this video is going to turn out it's
not easy to record something while I'm
doing something like this so hopefully
it doesn't entirely suck and maybe you
got to learn something today now if you
guys watch the most recent Tech Talk
you'd know I kind of did a little text
segment I'm going to try and do in every
single video now where I show you guys
something actually happening hands on to
try and explain a concept that I get a
lot of questions about so you guys
wanted to know when I mentioned the pump
was bad you guys kind of want to know
how pumpkin go bad and unfortunately the
pump that went bad in this build just
happened to arrive bad it wasn't
anything I did it wasn't anything that
happened with the build in fact from the
moment it was turned on it was out of
balance and that was the problem now
I've mentioned before and water cooling
videos that the worst thing that you
could possibly do to this pump right
here is run it dry in fact any water
cooling pump it doesn't matter running
it dry is the quickest way to kill it
you could kill it in a matter of seconds
depending on the RPM the pump actually
turns at so this is actually a perfect
opportunity to not just tell you why you
can actually ruin your pump running it
dry but I can show you so here's a d5
pump we have the top on it already it
doesn't do us a whole lot of good
because it's not a very good visual aid
consider you can't see inside it however
I do have the bad pump right here and I
can kind of show you guys what I mean by
what happens when you run a pump dry now
this is actually what a d5 pump looks
it is nothing more than an electric
motor and an impeller on here that spins
around pulls water in the middle spits
it out the outside it goes out whatever
the least path of resistance is which
will be the outlet and water moves along
its merry way
now unfortunately these impellers as you
can see are just floating on there as
you can see this thing is kind of moving
around on there because what keeps the
actual pump bearing from grinding on
itself is that there's a layer of fluid
that fills inside that gap when there's
no fluid in there that bearing is
rubbing around the outside and if you
guys watched on Tech Talk you know when
I took the new pump and just barely
turned it like that you heard some
squeaking of metal because that pump is
completely dry this one still has a
little bit of residue left in there so
it doesn't make that sound so anyway
that fluid fills in the gap around the
bearing and keeps it nice and protected
from rubbing it shaft tech tip guys
never miss a perfect opportunity to
appropriately use the word shaft at a
technology video while simultaneously
making thousands everywhere giggle so
yeah bad pump that thing is out and I
actually got an opportunity to show you
guys what happens when you run your pump
dry which is very very bad okay so we're
going to do now is we're just gonna kind
of install this pump in the bottom right
here get it plumbed up and then gonna be
it for just kind of a little bit of a
build blog a techie blog a bung long the
Fong the thong the Dom I guess it's now
time to move it a little bit closer so
you can actually see what it is I'm
doing because showing you something that
makes sense if you could actually see it
at least so I've heard now this
installation is going to actually be
really straightforward and pretty simple
you can see we've got the red loop here
which is our graphics card loop it's all
put together plumbed up bled and it's
good to go that's one of the reasons why
I like having dual loops when I can is
when I have to take something apart like
I had to do here as you can see it
allows me to be able to only deal with
the parts that are affected rather than
having to drain and bleed everything
it's going to be a whole lot easier to
fill and rebleed just one of these Lou
and it would be to do both with the
graphics card and everything in there
now we've kind of got everything ready
to go here you can see I've got some
holes drilled on the bottom for the pump
mounting and this is just the drain port
right here which will go on top very
similar to this pump and then we've got
the existing tube which is going to
actually attach right up in there and
that top fitting right there
so anyway we'll just go ahead and get
this bad boy threaded on here
and pretty much because we're dealing
with dealing with palm material which is
a plastic you want to go too tight hand
tight is all you need and there it is so
we can go ahead now and also get this
top piece on since it'll be a lot easier
to spin this well actually we can do
that with it already in there that's not
a problem so you get your collar on
there for locking it down you don't want
to forget that that'll make you have a
bad day I'm gonna go ahead and get it on
the fitting right here just actually
these are very tight fitting fittings
fit fittings have a funny any word and
same thing with the compression fittings
you pretty much just want to tighten
them down as tight as you can get them
by hand there's no real need to tighten
these up you know with a wrench or
anything they're gonna get plenty tight
of their own they're not going anywhere
there we go now I have the I don't know
if you could really tell you can see
down here here's under the desk I have
the PC pretty much spanning across the
corner of the desk that way I can get up
under here because if it was flat on the
desk I would be able to screw it in the
bottom so it's actually coming across
the corner of both of my desk right
there so I basically I'm just gonna hand
tighten the screws here until I get
everything kind of in place and then
we'll just go ahead and crank it down
imagine can see this is actually a very
fast install
so yeah simple enough we got it hand
tightened now we're just going to
tighten down the screws and the pump is
actually believed or not guys almost
completely installed it's really easy to
install a pump as long as you kind of
know where everything's going to go and
you creep plan I think I mentioned that
about 50 times throughout this build log
is proper planning is by far the most
important component you can do in a
build log or just any build period
proper planning there's no replacement
for it all right so there's our pump
nice and installed it's not going
anywhere the top piece here and we just
screw that sucker in now some people
have kind of said that they felt that
this was an ugly way of doing the bleed
port but you know guys it worked
flawlessly when I needed to bleed this
system once I realized that the pump was
bad so I had no complaints whatsoever
about how this turned out in fact you
don't even see it so it doesn't really
matter if you asked me how it looks it's
all about function over form in this
area down here because you don't even
see it in fact I've got one of the tubes
you can't even see going along the top
of the radiator to make even more room
therefore the red loop so this tube
right here pretty much just runs up
along to the upper red and this is the
this is the outlet so it goes into the
upper red first and then it goes into
the rest of the loop from there simple
enough
so there you go guys just that easy with
a very awkward very up-close and
personal look of my nose you can see we
now have both pumps installed took a
matter of minutes with like I said
proper planning so the next thing to do
now is going to be to fill it up and
bleed it and I guess we since we're done
installing this now we might as well
just go ahead and do that together now
that we have the pump installed the next
thing we need to do is obviously fill it
up bleed it drain it or will not drain
it obviously we'd be back to square one
we need to fill it up and we need to
bleed it and get it all nice and primed
I hope you guys heard that but a cat
just meowed all youtubers owned cats and
if you know that that's the secret to
success on YouTube guys we must own a
cat so for this build we're going to be
using you guys already seen it but I'm
going to show you again it is the mayhem
pastel white for this loop is a
concentrate we actually use three
bottles of this to get plenty of it but
there are some other white cooling
options you guys asked about so in the
future we are going to be taking a look
at the dragon ice fluid here from Dragon
and that's going to be in a separate
video now there's actually a couple
different ways you could fill a loop and
this one here I chose not to do any
actual fill ports and tubes coming off
the top of the reservoir because I don't
really feel that it's necessarily the
cleanest look for this build I have done
it in the past but all we're going to do
basically on this loop is we're just
going to turn the top get the top off
right here and then we are going to just
take a funnel and a piece of extra tube
kind of stick it in there like that make
sure that it doesn't come out of the top
I've done that before makes a mess that
actually really sucks then we're going
to fill it up as far as we can turn on
the pump let it come down stop the pump
and keep repeating that process until we
get all of the system filled now because
we are using krill clear acrylic tubing
or rigid tubing it's going to be easy to
tell when we've got all the major air
pockets out because we can see through
the tubing but if you are using a solid
piece of tube like you have here or like
I have in my build over there with the
black tubing you can't see it too well
but in this case it's going to be nice
and easy
no pun intended literally in this case
it will be really easy so come on in
let's fill
this loop and let's get a nice and bled
now I've got the first bit of reservoir
nice and filled up with the nice white
coolant now one thing I forgot to
mention of how I'm going to be turning
the pump on and on it's important that
you don't actually start your system
with it missing a second power supply
with a power supply jumper on there and
a power supply that has a switch on the
back so I can turn it on and off just to
power the pump so I want to make that
part clear don't start up your system
and run it with empty fluid like this
because you're going to end up having
some overheating problems and if there
happens to be a leak you don't want your
system powered on so while I'm filling
it right now and I'm going to kind of
speed up the video here to make this a
little bit easier and more bearable to
watch you guys are going to notice that
the fluids going to go up its going to
go down so go up is going to go down and
during that whole process I've got
tissue paper on the underside kind of
looking for leaks I already know the
front here doesn't leak I'm just
checking for leaks in the parts that I
replaced and the part of making this
video so while making this video make
sure no those fittings and no those
tubes are creating any sort of leaks
down in the bottom so without further
ado let's go ahead and get this thing
full of white blood cells
well there you go guys red mist is back
up and running a little bit of a delay
but I have to say overall the RMA
process through frozen CPU was as easy
as could be I mean they they watch the
video that I made they said okay here's
the problem they sent us out the part
right away and it took this long to get
the video up because it really took me
that long to get back to it I've just
got so much stuff going on but as you
can see it is up and running behind me
pumps work perfectly it is perfectly
bled and couldn't ask for an easier swap
and overall like I said customer service
is what matters with me and companies I
couldn't be happier with the way things
went with frozen CPU now I know some of
you are probably looking back there
right now and going wow that is way too
bright I don't like that keep in mind
guys the camera does not pick up the
lighting the same as it does in real
life I mean in order to make me not look
like a shadow the lights on the PC are
being blown out by the camera so I'll do
a little bit of glamor footage here
hopefully you guys can get a better
representation of what the build looks
like but red mist is coming along nicely
now one thing I want to go ahead and
mention is that some of you were very
unhappy with the cable choice with this
PC by just going with the plain black
sleeved extensions so I want to go ahead
and just let you know right now that the
awesome people over at Lu TRO customs
have reached out to us and offered us
perfectly sleeved cables with an ROG
theme that are going to match this build
perfectly so gonna be red white and
black cables very similar to what's in
my 900 D for my build so now we can say
this build is perfectly top of the line
with the best of the best and I couldn't
ask for a better project so far to be
working on I'm really excited about this
project but I just can't wait for it to
be done it takes up so much room
and I'm just tired of looking at it guys
I'll be honest with you I love red mist
but I want it to go to its rightful home
which is where it belongs with the guy
who bought the computer yeah guys this
is not my computer some of you guys seem
to think that I've just made up this
mythical magical buyer who doesn't exist
just to mask the fact that I got this
big bad boy for myself but guys the
reality of it is as you already know
that is my bad boy right there
check it out yeah so that thing is
waiting to get worked on for me
project skunk works so I think we're
going to call it haven't really decided
yet so it's been Jays two cents part
five and a quarter we'll call it because
we had to do a little bit of repair on
this thing as you can see it's up and
running beautiful computer couldn't ask
for more hopefully soon we'll get this
thing finally fired up and get some
benchmarks because I know we're all
dying to see what the numbers are
including myself
i'ma get on outta here guys follow me on
Twitter I'd love to interact with you
guys up there it's easiest way to get a
hold of me with your tech questions and
as always I will see you in my next
