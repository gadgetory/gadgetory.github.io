it's Jays two cents here and today we're
going to take a break from the normal PC
genre type of video and we're going to
go into a different type of technology
we're going to talk a little bit about
home theater I used to have a 7.1 Yamaha
surround system here in my living room
and when I went to Best Buy to pick up a
new 4k TV I got suckered into picking up
a Sonos playbar and a Sonos wireless sub
basically on the recommendation of a
friend who owns one we're going to show
you how this thing works because it is
at the same time the most advanced yet
simple home theater system I think I
have ever used EVGA ACX 2.0 cooler with
its three phase 6 slot motor 11 swept
fan blades and double ball bearing
design offers reduced power noise and
thermals for the optimum gaming
experience click the link in the
description to learn more I think one of
the first surprises I got when I took it
out of the box was the fact that there
is nothing in there except the play bar
itself which you can see right here it
actually it's pretty long it actually
runs nearly the length of my TV which
happens to be a 55 inch and an optical
cable and a power cable
there is absolutely no remote control
there's nothing else in the box except
for a single product quick set-up guide
now the cool thing about this was it it
left me wondering how the hell do you
install this thing well it's all done
wirelessly through your home network and
your smart device now set up was
actually a lot more simple than I
thought it was going to be normally when
you get a home theater setup you've got
to plug in speakers you've got to plug
in the ethernet or HDMI cable or 4 to
pass through you've gotta have HDMI an
HDMI out and it can just well that what
the old saying of it's like connecting
stereo speakers or it's like setting up
stereo instructions that's where it kind
of came from well this is actually very
very simple the only thing in the box
optical cable and a power cable and then
a Quick Start Guide that's it and when
you plug it in you're actually prompted
to connect to the wireless device itself
through your smart device or the iPad
iPhone or Android and
then it will walk you through setting it
up to your own wireless that you may
have in the house and that's it that is
it and the reason why you want this
thing hooked up to your wireless and I
realized this later I actually was a
little bit annoyed that I had to connect
to a smart device because I know some
people who don't actually have a smart
phone but it all makes sense and when
you realize what it's all about
now the Sonos playbar itself is actually
pretty long it runs nearly the length of
my TV it's got six mid-range speakers in
it it's a powered it's an active powered
device but when it comes to simplicity
of the device itself there's only two
buttons on it as a play/pause and a
volume button that's it everything else
is actually controlled through your
smart device now I'm using my iPhone to
do this and when you plugged it in it
guides you through setting it up it
guides you through connecting it to your
TV or whatever actually have the optical
out running from my 4k TV here down to
the Sonos and then to ask you to pick up
your TV remote or whatever remote you're
going to use pointing at the Sonos and
push the power button or exceeding the
volume button and when you push the
volume button it then controls the Sonos
from the right remote control it's just
that easy in fact it was it was almost a
bit too easy because I'm reminded of
that old saying if this thing reads like
stereo instructions because stereo
instructions hooking up home theaters
and stereos used to be pretty
complicated back in the days like the
80s and 70s there was definitely
difficult I wasn't around in the 70s but
I hear it was actually quite a difficult
time for setting up stereos now the
Sonos app is entirely freed it's full
functioning and it's not one of those
things that you have to let's say you
know oh if you want to get full
functions you've got to buy a paid
version of the app no it's absolutely
free and the cool thing about the app is
if you have friends come over and you
want them to be able to control music
and stuff this is exactly how my friend
was using the Sonos when he's
entertaining and having a party then he
can allow other people to connect to the
device and cue up music to play so it's
almost like a jukebox so you can have
your friends put in there their music
requests and the Sonos will handle it
all for it now the Sonos doesn't only
work off of TV it works off of anything
in fact it takes your smart device and
it turns this thing into the player and
that just plays the music now there's a
lot we can talk about with this
so I'm going to talk about a couple of
the expandable features and then I'm
going to give you a little demonstration
of how the thing works now it doesn't
come with the sub the sub is Wireless
and it's individually purchased and it's
not cheap the sub is seven hundred
dollars and the sound bar is seven
hundred dollars so it's a $1400 plus tax
investment into sound but considering
the fact that I removed my 7.1 surround
from the living room altogether I have
not had a single regret now when it
comes to connecting the external
speakers it actually has satellite rears
that you can wirelessly connect to this
thing again using the app and just
simply pushing a single button and then
it will connect the speakers you can
also do satellite speakers in other
areas of the home I could take another
speaker put it in the baby's room and
play lullabies independently from what's
playing out here I could take another
speaker put it in the kitchen or put it
outside and I could have outdoor
partitioned volume and and things that
are playing independently from what
we're watching here in the living room
so there is a lot of expandability to
this but unfortunately I guess pretty
pricey because each one of those
external speakers are those separate
speakers are $200 a pop they don't sell
them in the pair a single their single
sale only single single sell
no single sale whatever they sell them
as one at a time alright so let's go
ahead and kind of do a quick demo here
of how this whole thing works
okay so here's the main screen of the
Sonos right here and as you can see in
the background I actually have the
guardians of the galaxy blu-ray playing
back there now you can see we have all
sorts of different things that we can do
on here we've got Sonos favorites you
can add things to favorites you've got
your playlists this phone we've got a
built in app radio by tuned in which you
can actually use to connect to local
stations if you want Pandora I added you
can add other music services you also
have a TV because that's the one device
we have hooked up to it right now
physically and then you can set alarms
and go through other settings and in
other settings you can change it the
settings by the room type so we only
have the living room on here right now
and as you can see we can play with the
equalizer a little bit and you can do
things like change the room name TV
setup and control so you can actually
add a new remote if you need to
white indicator light that's for the
front of the Sonos and then you can even
remove the sub if you want this is where
you would add surround speakers if you
wanted to add surround and we're not
doing that today we're going to go ahead
and give you a pretty basic demo of how
the whole thing works okay so right now
I can control the TV by the remote I
have a Logitech Harmony uh ultimate
remote but if we touch on TV here we can
also control it with our phone so right
now I have it muted but if we go ahead
and take a look here you can see I can
just touch this whoops I can touch this
slider and turn it up
yeah you guys I wish you guys could
actually hear the sound oh well okay so
we can do that but let's say we want to
listen to some music we can turn on
Pandora and then let's listen to so you
can see my daughter's got some stuff on
here let's do some easy listening and
it's going to tell me the TV's going to
stop
whatever that is we got to change it
okay see so there you go we've got music
playing now and we're not going to play
it too long so I don't get in trouble
but now let's go ahead and say that we
want to set an alarm clock so we can say
new alarm we want it to go off in the
living room and any other rooms that you
have speaker set will show up here you
can say I want the alarm to go off we
can have it go off by music the Sonos
chime and then you can hit set the
volume of it you can set advanced
features in there how long the alarm
goes off for include grouped rooms you
could have it go off I just hit the
camera you'd have it go off in other
rooms at the same time there's a lot of
things that you can control on here so
it makes that useful as it turns if you
put one of these speakers in your room
you no longer have the need for an alarm
clock because if you're like me I
actually use my cell phone as an alarm
clock
so my alarm clock is still my cell phone
but then I have an even cooler function
for being able to set the types of
alarms that I want so that's just kind
of a quick tour right there but as you
can see we can go back to the TV just
that quickly and now we're listening TV
you believe they call us criminals when
he's assaulting us with that there you
go but like I mentioned you don't have
to control it all with your phone it's
just a function that you can use if you
want to I've got my Logitech Harmony
ultimate one remote here and then
obviously this thing controls everything
as well as you can see so setting up is
very very very simple but it sounds
absolutely amazing I wish you guys could
hear it you can't I mean even the demo
inside of Best Buy doesn't do it justice
I even told the salesman I said look I
would never have purchased this thing
based on the demo because it sounds like
 but because I had already seen how
it works and heard how it sounds in my
friends home that's what actually sold
me on it so I don't know Sonos if you
guys ever come across this video you
guys need to do some serious calibration
to your demo units because I guarantee
you're missing out on sales because your
demo kiosk sounds like absolute garbage
so I just thought I'd throw that out
there but anyway guys I hope you guys
have enjoyed this video a lot of you
asked me when I'm used
for my home theater when I mentioned I
got you know kind of an upgrade in here
I haven't upgraded my home theater
system in quite a few years so now we've
got the Sonos playbar in here and I
can't wait to start adding other rooms
to it because you are going to be able
to control it from anywhere in the house
you don't have to come in here and use
the remote to turn it up or down if you
have st. mp3 player hooked up to one of
your home receivers it's all done
wirelessly through your wireless
internet now I mentioned earlier that it
requires a smart device to set up and
that did make me a little bit unhappy
because like I mentioned it's rare but I
do know of a few people who do not own
smart devices no tablets no smart phones
they have a basic flip phone and that's
it some people still prefer to live that
very simple non connected lifestyle and
it doesn't say anywhere on the packaging
that this requires a smart device to
install that's where my beef is not that
it requires it but that the packaging
does not say anywhere on it that a smart
device iPhone Android tablet or
something of that nature is required to
set it up and in my opinion that is a
huge mistake because even I didn't know
that that's what was required to set it
up I knew you could control it that way
but I didn't know that that was what was
required so guys it's been Jays two
cents talking about the Sonos playbar
with the wireless sub what are you guys
using for your home theater what do you
guys look for a lot of people thought I
was crazy for getting rid of the
surround for a sound bar I'll tell you
right now I watched this movie guardians
of the galaxy last night for the first
time fantastic movie by the way but
first time on my new TV with the new
Sonos and I absolutely didn't miss the
surround sound whatsoever the sound is
so phenomenal the bass is so freakin
rumbly and the cool day but the sub
forgot to mention is it does have two
opposing subwoofer cones that are very
oblong oval shape they're not round
they're oval and they're opposing with
the opening being in the middle of the
sub so that each of the woofers are
moving opposite direction from each
other which really cuts down on
vibration of the unit itself if you guys
have ever set something on top of us
traditional sub woofer that has a single
cone that moves in and out you know what
vibrates and things on there can rattle
and move around but because of that my
entertainment center doesn't rattle
anymore but I
they'll get just as much rumbling bass
through the ground explosions in this
movie were absolutely amazing with that
sub and it sounds just like a movie
theater but I don't have things shakin
and rattling around I think of that
opposing design of the subwoofer cones
is making a huge huge impression on the
way vibrations work but you don't lose
any of that rumbling low frequency sound
whatsoever so there you go
tell me what you guys using down in the
comments what kind of sound systems do
you like what kind of sound do you look
for and as always guys follow on Twitter
if you have any questions forums forum
distance comm Facebook and of course
right here on the YouTube channel and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
