here with Jays two cents and if you live
on planet Earth like most of the people
on planet Earth
chances are you'd love to get your hands
on some water cooling but you just can't
afford it
you work your ass off you get very
little in return and you just can't
afford what it cost to get a custom
water cooling loop but you sure as hell
would like to have that kind of
performance so what do you do well you
take a look at the coolermaster glacier
240 L now let me just go ahead and start
by saying that no the glacier 240 L is
not new to the market in fact some might
even say Jay you're a little behind on
this video well I'm gonna point out that
even though it doesn't say it anywhere
on this box this is actually v2 or
version 2 of the glacier - 40 L when
they took some customer feedback of the
original model and they've made some
enhancements to it so that's exactly
what we're gonna take a look at here
today now the glacier - 40 L sports a
two-year warranty this is a fully sealed
ready to go all in one water cooling
solution but if you've never seen this
cooler before maybe you recognize the H
- 20 from Swift tech well this is pretty
much a rebranded Swift tech H 220 with
some of cooler masters features and
flare put in here to give it a little
bit more oof if you will now the box is
pretty much straight forward it's a box
you've got some cooling dimensions and
stuff back here whatever we don't care
about the box at least I don't care
about the box if you do here you can
have the Box now as far as cooling
dimensions go this is a 240 millimeter
radiator so that fits to 120 millimeter
fans and the packaging inside is very
basic in fact you've got some egg crepe
type material right here on top where
you immediately see this now right off
the bat you're gonna notice that the
tubing on this is quite a bit different
than the all-in-one cooling units that
you're used to seeing which have the
very hard rigid plastic you know riff
ruffled ruffled up remember they're
called the tubing that actually has all
the
in them you got your users guide right
here the installation instructions and
the unit is already completely
preassembled in fact the fans are even
on it which makes it quite a bit
different than some of the other units
out there where you have to install the
fans the only thing you have to do is
select your appropriate mounting bracket
for your platform whether the AMD or
Intel and pick your right socket set
install it in your system mount the fans
essentially and you're good to go now
what makes this radiator different than
the H 100 I'm gonna kind of keep wrench
mentioning the H 100 because that would
be the closest comparison in terms of
price and performance I think now the
fans on here are preassembled which i
think is really cool the very high
static pressure fans which is what you
want on a radiator like this and they
are two thousand plus rpm fans now
before you freak out over the RPMs in
the noise level these do have a very
wide rpm range I believe 600 rpm to
2,000 rpm all control through PWM
headers so if we hook these up to the
CPU PWM fan header on your motherboard
you can control these through the load
of your CPU so they're nice and slow
when they're not doing anything and as
your computer and the temperature ramps
up the CPU performance it ramps up the
fan speed as well so it doesn't have any
proprietary software controlling the
actual unit however you can allow your
CPU to control it through BIOS settings
by plugging it into your motherboard or
you can plug it into your favorite fan
controller if you prefer that as well
but they are already installed they are
installed in a push configuration so
obviously it's meant to go this way now
the fittings as you can see they are
rotatable so you regardless of where
you're mounting this row that we may be
side mounted in a stacker or you've got
it on the top or even the bottom of the
case you can make sure that you have the
fittings point in the right directions
young crazy kinks or bends in there the
tubing is 3/8 inch tubing it is a gloss
black I kind of wish it was a dull like
a matte black sort of like the EK tubing
or like on the h ati that comes from
corsair because I think the matte black
looks a lot better it doesn't show all
the dust and fingerprints on it nearly
much that would be my only gripe when it
comes to the tubing plenty long so you
can run it wherever you need but this is
the kind of the powerhouse of the unit
right here the pump now the pump
features a fully copper block it is
powered by a single SATA power connector
and at this point you might be asking
yourself well what exactly is different
then because it's all seeming exactly
the same
well the difference guys is right here
in this plug they have decided to make
the cables actually unplug a bowl that
way it's easier to install this without
the cables in the way and also to you
don't have an issue where these cables
could potentially break off because of
moving it around you know they're pretty
thin cables so you want to make sure
that you don't damage them so you can
unplug them get them out of the way when
you're installing it plug it in and then
install it into your motherboard power
and your rpm wire right here that
controls the pump speed rpm and PWM wire
right there
now the cooling of this unit is superior
to the other brands and pretty much all
the benchmarks on all the various
reputable tech sites have proven this
because this is an all copper radiator
copper is a much better conductor of
heat than aluminum is and all of the
other all-in-one units tend to be
aluminum now it does have a bit of a
weight disadvantage to it for being
copper but you know what the cooling
capacity of it more than makes up for
the added weight I mean most of the time
you're not gonna be moving your computer
around too much anyway
so that shouldn't be a problem now what
makes this different than other cooling
units well all in one cooling units are
not designed to be serviced so that
means they're completely sealed in fact
if you were to drain the coolant out of
an all-in-one unit
you typically will void the warranty but
in this case you actually have AG
quarter thread right here a plug that
allows you to drain and refill this unit
because this unit packs enough power in
the pump that you could add multiple
radiators and multiple blocks to this so
if you decided that you wanted a custom
loop but you can't afford it up front
you buy a unit like this and then it's
designed to be expandable over time so
you could add a second radiator you
could add a graphics card to the loop if
you wanted so you start out on the cheap
and you expand to grow to your needs and
it's got the same quality radiator as
any standalone radiator that you would
be using
if you built your own loop but it's got
the added benefit of having a very
contained block and pump unit which
makes things very very easy for
installation all right so enough talking
about this let's go ahead and throw it
in my test bench I'm actually getting
ready to rebuild my test bench in one of
my fractal cases because I kind of like
to change things up and I just want to
test some temperatures inside a regular
case rather than an open-air test bench
so we're gonna put this inside my
fractal Ark XL we're gonna seal it up
and we're gonna see how the temperatures
are right here with the glacier to 40 L
or Glaser acupuncture I think glacier
cuz glaciers are cold
right they're ice so they're very cold I
don't really know what a glacier is
maybe someone could tell me what a
glacier is but glacier sounds a hell of
a lot colder to me than glacier so we're
gonna call it the glacier to 40 L
coolermaster you can you send me your
hate mail if you like but anyway there
you go guys it's going to install this
and see just how well this thing
performs all right cooler masters
glacier 240 L how does it compare and
how does it perform well you know I
think if you have to give credit where
credit is due
it is by far the closest temperature
that you could get to a full custom loop
with the comparable radiator size I
could not build a 240 millimeter custom
loop that could get any better
performance than this kit is I'm being
just perfectly honest out here I have
all the parts to do it but I know better
because I've built enough systems to
know what temperature should look like
in the glacier to 40 L is right on par
with a custom loop at just a fraction of
the cost I mean this encompasses a bill
I don't even if that's really a word
guys somebody help me out here I keep
trying to say it's customizable yeah
upgradeable expandable all that stuff
and it doesn't break your bank it's
basically a custom loop that's
preassembled for you now the core of the
glacier 240 L the design of it pretty
much is implemented by Swift tech with
cooler masters key touches on there as I
mentioned earlier in the video now Swift
tech is one of the older companies that
have been building standalone custom
loop parts for years and years so you
know you're getting a nice heritage
built in to this loop right now I kind
of want to call them a custom I want to
call this a custom loo
because really it gets the exact same
performance as any 240 millimeter custom
lupica to Bill I mean that's the awesome
part about it but it comes in a fraction
of the cost
I couldn't have bought a block in a pump
and a radiator and fans and tubing and
fittings and all of and fluid and all of
that for anywhere near the cost of what
this is in fact I did a video about
building a your own custom water cooling
loop on the cheap months back and that
still came in at about $200 $50 more
than this thing cost so it really you
just cannot beat the price for
performance and if you're on a cooling
budget and you want custom loop but you
can't afford it now but you want to
upgrade in the future
you've got to skip like the things from
Corsair and NZXT and and and all of
those companies you just you've got to
go with this 100% because of the fact
that it gives you a place to go now
let's go and talk about temperatures and
why you should go with this cooler
I took the 4770k which is notoriously
hot because of Intel's horrible
integration of their heat spreader and
the thermal compound and it's just it's
just bad which is why I on the new case
key refresh they're gonna be reefs are
during the heat spreader thank God for
that isn't over cooling enthused over
clocking enthusiasts I thank you thank
you Intel for finally listening to us
after 3 years of garbage if you know
anything about Intel and has well you
know that 1.3 to 5 volts is kind of that
threshold where things are like ok you
better have some really good cooling on
hand or you're gonna have one really
badly melted chip in the long run so one
point three to five volts on there with
a 2.0 5 v Rin or V V roll to voltage
input oh my god I hate the Haswell
setting so you have voltage input and
all that crap anyway and you guys are
probably begging right now for a hassle
overclocking video I don't know if it's
gonna happen it's just too finicky but
anyway so 2.0 5 volts into the CPU and a
1.3 to 5v core and all the V cache and
all that stuff not gonna get into my
settings bottom line was I was pushing
some heat loaded up a 264 put on the CPU
extreme test and the sink capped out and
then in the 80 degrees Celsius range on
an all-in-one cooler that cost around
105
d dollars so this cooler right here gets
two thumbs that actually gets three or
four thumbs up if I had more thumbs I'd
be sticking them up because you just
cannot get a better cooler for the money
I'm sorry the aluminum all-in-one
coolers from Corsair and the other
brands and even even cooler masters own
aluminum coolers they're good but you're
not gonna get anywhere near this thing
so if you guys are considering like an H
100 or an H 110 please look at other
videos on this besides just mine get
reviewers inputs on this go to NN Tech
overclocked forms hard o CP Tom's
Hardware anywhere that reviews hardware
look at the reviews and you'll see that
this thing just smashes everybody when
it comes to the competition so there you
go guys
cooler masters glacier 240 l version 2
with the removable plug on the pump
bringing you probably the best cooling
that you can get in a box so guys make
sure you check out my other videos and
stick around because you guys have been
asking for some more mainstream type
reviews rather than the extreme high end
which I've been doing a lot of lately so
we're gonna be taking a look at
gigabytes win force 270x graphics card
right here we originally were going to
do a - ATX we decided to do a 270 X to
see how much performance you can pull
out of a mid-range card like this it
doesn't come anywhere near breaking your
bank so guys when Jays two cents follow
me on Twitter if you'd like to talk
about this video or other videos that
I've done or you just want to talk and
chat about tech and as always I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
