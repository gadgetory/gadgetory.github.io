cents keeping my promise of bringing you
guys some more affordable product
reviews of things that just about
anybody can get their hands on and
letting you know where you should be
placing your hard-earned cash when
you're buying your PC components now
today we are going to be taking a look
at the gigabyte Radeon r9 270x windforce
Edition okay guys the box is incredibly
long well because the card itself is
actually pretty long now the wind force
Edition from gigabyte is pretty much
there no holds barred cooling solution
for keeping their graphics cards as cool
as possible now the box as you can see
it's a kind of embossed here with
gigabyte it's black its basic you open
it up and there's the part that really
matters the part yeah that part being
the gigabyte graphics card now it does
come with some power adapters here
you've got two molex to 6-pin PCI
Express adapters because this does
require two 6-pin PCI Express powers it
does come with a dual slot crossfire
bridge and that kind of a copper color I
do kind of wish that was black but
that's not really the fault of gigabyte
your driver disk your warranty material
and of course a box of high-tech foam I
love this stuff I love eating this stuff
hey guy really did eat some of that it
is a custom PCB developed by gigabyte
based on the 270x so what it means is
it's going to give you more power more
oomph and more overclock ability than
reference models would typically afford
jet and the card is stuck in there there
we go
so here is the card right there you've
got three fans on there that give you
super quiet operation while keeping
things nice and cool
PCI Express of course you have got your
two DVI dvi-i and DVID output here you
have an HDMI and as well as a full size
DisplayPort on there
so when it comes to connectivity for
your monitors
got more than enough now when it comes
to cooling this this is kind of where
gigabyte really stands out with this
card now not only does it have a massive
heatsink on there as you can see that
runs the full length of the card it
actually extends off the back of the
card quite a bit it does feature their
triangular pattern here on the heatsink
itself which is designed to not only
push air down through it to cool off the
components being the GPU and the RAM and
the VRMs as well it's actually forcing
the air through a controlled pattern for
one less resonance or sound resonance of
the turbulence of air going through the
fins here but also it directs the
airflow out the sides so you get more
efficient transfer of air through the
heatsink creating a more efficient
cooling for the card itself now it also
features not only the GPU sync but it
also has what they call their unique Ram
sync which is going to allow more active
cooling for the RAM rather than it just
being passively cooled by a piece of
metal plating a solid piece of plate
touching it with no sink on there at all
actually has a ram sync now it does have
two eight millimeter copper pipes
running the length of the card they are
contained entirely within the card so
they're not sticking out or looking like
engine headers or anything like that so
it's got a nice clean look to it now the
power delivery as I mentioned does
require two 6-pin PCI Express ports or
Express power so you're going to want to
make sure your card can accommodate that
and the PCB is a nice gloss black it's
not a matte black but is a gloss black
and it's not like one of those PCBs that
try to look black but they're really
just really dark brown note this is a
nice deep black so it looks really good
on the top there you do have your
crossfire bridge if you were to
crossfire this with another 270 or 270 X
or really any other AMD compatible
crossfire card from the same family of
GPUs so without further ado let's go
ahead and throw this in the test rig
let's do a little bit of gaming on here
and see exactly how this thing performs
at this mid-range price range so don't
go away this is the cool part this is
the part where you get the numbers that
you came here for but I listen to me
babble and talk about you know my summer
vacation where I show you guys slides of
you know me getting a root canal and
and that time that you know aunt Aunt
Betty fell and broke her leg in Hawaii I
really happened all right so the
gigabyte r9 270x wind force OC edition
now let's go and talk about the
temperatures and acoustics first now
they talk about having the triangular
design on the heatsink which lowers the
resonant and turbulent sound of the wind
passing through it while increasing the
efficiency of cooling the components on
the PCB I'd have to say that that is
exactly accurate the card is extremely
quiet in fact on my test bench I was
hard pressed to even tell what was the
graphics card sound versus what was my
cooler sound
I couldn't differentiate the two of them
period and that was at full load like it
is right now in fact this loop of valley
benchmark behind me has been running for
over an hour and the temperatures are
sitting right now at 55 degrees Celsius
in a closed case I might add this is not
an open test bench this is one of the
reasons why I moved over to a case
instead of an open-air bench I wanted to
give a little bit more real-world
scenario when it comes to cooling now
the temperature inside this room right
now is about 77 degrees Fahrenheit I
don't know what that equates to in
Celsius because you see here in America
we like to be a little bit different in
Nerissa in fact I don't even know how to
equate that there Fahrenheit to the
Celsius I see we like to do things like
driving on the right side of the road
got the right the right side of the road
which to y'all maybe the wrong side of
the road but I digress
alright now that I'm done pissing off
the southerners let's go ahead and move
on with the review
okay now performance of the card sits
exactly where I thought it would it's
faster than the 270 and it performs
really really well on a 1080p panel as
you can see now battlefield 4 the
frostbite 3 engine as you know is pretty
demanding not the best optimized engine
but it is pretty demanding
in fact the 270x on the ultra preset was
sitting higher than 60 frames per second
about 65 to 68 frames per second on
average it does drop down below 60 in
some maps like operation Locker where
there's choke points and the lots of
grenades and rocket launchers and lots
of explosions but if you're playing lots
of open conquest type maps the frames
per second the averages were much higher
overall now if you take that ultra
preset and you bump it down one notch
too high you do get nearly 100 frames
per second on average which is quite the
jump from ultra to high and in fact
you're not even giving up that much i
can be going from ultra to high and
you're just going to get more frames per
second because of it now just as I
expected this card is pretty much a
1080p performer if you start to bump up
the resolutions higher you do start to
see a pretty exponential drop-off when
it comes to the frames per second and
performance but given the price point
that this card is that this is the
perfect card for the person who is on
the strict budget but wants to get as
much performance as they can out of
every dollar that they have to spend so
if you're looking for a graphics card
that's sitting in the low $200 range
this is definitely one that you should
consider the acoustics are great the
performance is awesome the temperatures
are extremely low it's not going to heat
up your your room or your small case and
you're going to have great great gaming
performance out of it in fact it's hard
pressed to tell the difference between
this 780 and that 270x behind me once a
vertical sync is turned on they both
pretty much cap out at 60 frames per
second you can't tell the difference the
last thing that I want to mention is
overclocking this thing does sit at 1100
hurt core clock out-of-the-box I was
able to get twelve hundred megahertz out
of it for plus 100 megahertz overclock
didn't go for anything extreme in fact
above that it started taking more
tweaking that I wanted I did notice that
the core voltage is locked I was not
able to change the core voltage on this
thing and that is running the 14.6
mantle drivers I also might add so guys
this has been Jays two cents taking a
look at the gigabyte r9 270x wind force
OC edition from gigabyte gigabyte makes
the gigabyte cars I know if you knew
that with all that said I'm gonna go
ahead and get the heck on out of here
and as always guys I will see you in my
next video yeah I just karate-chop dust
a 780
I would not be funny if I let go of that
would it you'd probably laugh I would</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
