gonna build upon the last couple of
videos that we've been doing because
when I take on you know experiments like
how cheat can we build a computer it's
funny how many things like sort of pop
up as that series progresses right we
had part number one where you guys
didn't like the parts I chose maybe the
part number two where I found out that
the bottleneck and we'll talk about
bottleneck to in a second here but the
the results that we saw were actually
being caused by something other than the
CPUs when we were doing a CPU test so
yeah here it goes part number three I
guess dude great this is the best part
right here it watches watches guys it's
new Celsius x36 from fractal design yeah
so but do you know what it does yeah it
makes things cool yeah cool hey guys and
today I am super excited to be doing a
video with the one and only next two
cents yo
I am excited man so what are we doing
today we're gonna review the Celsius s
36 I get that a lot today what's up sure
I could give you some workout tips how's
tomorrow sound awesome later
and serger
the new Celsius as 36 can make almost
anything cooler almost so I discovered
in my last video that even though we had
two identical msi gtx 1050 graphics
cards right here is Nayan 1050 Ti it's
not like the arrow it's not like a
special card it's just there I TX PCB
with a single fan doesn't even have any
power connectors on anywhere gets its
power only from the motherboard we had
two identical cards here are the boxes
for those right here identical part
numbers to that we were seeing variants
and performance between both of those
cards unfortunately the comments section
in the last video some people called me
out saying that nope they're the
identical cards something else is
happening here because they should be
performing within like 1 FPS of each
other that's not what's happening here
now before you guys start saying J stop
addressing the haters no there's points
to be made here and this is good
conversation to have because what I what
I found was when we swapped the cards
the poor performance followed the card
so that's the point of today's video
it's not about whether or not AMD is
bottlenecking or Intel's bottlenecking
or something was wrong in system a
versus system be the problem followed
the card which told me the card is where
we have to investigate so this is the G
4560 system right here that we used in
that benchmark and the card that's
currently in there right now is the one
that was originally in the AMD system
the one that we realized was actually
not boosting as far as we'll say we'll
say GPU number one right here we'll call
this GPU two hopefully we can keep track
of that counting is hard especially for
me you can see right here we've had this
test running for a while now it's made
quite a few loops the temperatures have
equalized it's sitting at 62 C you can
see we got the GPU running at 99% load
that's at 17 hundred and thirty-four
megahertz
that's GPU boost 3.0 that speed is
faster than what the Box advertises this
bathroom manufacturer advertises because
GPU boost 3.0 from Nvidia is a self
overclocking utility it's gonna take
into account things like how much power
is being drawn from the card how much
Headroom there is between max TDP
allowed for total board more power and
what are the temperatures if it sees
that we have power left over and
temperature hit target left over then it
will self overclock which is what you're
getting here right now so based on the
63 see the
power draw its overclocking itself to
seventeen hundred and thirty-four
megahertz now if this had been a card
that had its supplemental power like a
PCI Express power connector on it you
would actually be able to move the power
target slider in our case we can't do
that and this everything you're seeing
right here is stock MSI Afterburner is
just reporting what it sees and that's
allowing us to just kind of monitor
what's happening here so we're only
using heaven here because the experience
is that I'm about to show you carried
across in all of our tests and all of
our benchmarks especially ones where CPU
were not that important because then the
GPU is responsible for everything and
the higher the FPS the the more CPU
potential bottlenecking will have here
and that's a whole nother video I'm
gonna revisit the whole idea of
bottlenecking
in another video I haven't talked about
that in a while
so you saw we actually we've done in
1696 for a second there that's just that
one scene it doesn't use a lot of GPU
but you can see 63 see seventeen hundred
and thirty-four FPS or megahertz is
where we basically capped out and I'm
gonna take a picture because I think my
brain has reached the maximum capacity
of what I can actually remember now and
I will remember those numbers so now I'm
gonna do the official benchmark run and
let us get a number here and then I'll
swatch the swap the GPU and show you the
difference that way you guys can see
there was no shenanigans here but I'm
not trying to figure out what's
happening here anyway we'll come back
so the test is complete we got a 16:57
as our score and to kind of recap where
we were when we did the video the other
day with this GPU again the same GPU we
got a 1665 and the other GPU we had a
1708 member these are the H 1/10 scores
not the H 270 which was the original
that we had used so the score is pretty
consistent
16:57 HCI scores of 17 34 and again
temps kind of chilled out around 63 if
we take a look at MSI Afterburner you
can see as well that we didn't really we
didn't have any throttling really I mean
it came down a little bit but wouldn't
call that throttling that's just based
on the temp because you understand the
way it works it has these states right
the BIOS basically says the state is
temperature range between here go to
here temperature range between here as
its lower go higher so as the
temperature does this the frequency does
that right so making airplane curves
here that's what basically happens so
some folks would call that throttling
that's not throttling the actual
definition of throttling is saying that
it's slowing down the speeds because the
temperatures I had reached max so
throttling specifically refers to max
temperature max temperatures have been
achieved therefore we have to slow down
the cpu to keep it from going above that
maximum temperature so although people
would say yeah this was throttled
because it slowed down based on
temperature no that's a curve this is a
curve throttled the official definition
of throttled now is have to argue people
about this the official definition of
throttling refers to saving a PC
component from overheating this is not
overheating by any means but that's what
it looked like you can see it was pretty
damn consistent right so there is our
GPU usage though every all those dips
are between scenes here's our CPU
temperature this was me restarting the
test right there to check for a
consistency and yeah so there's
everything else right there CPU usage
you can see that this is why I'm using
this test because it allows the GPU to
push itself as hard as it can this is
CPU usage and you can see we're not
maxing out the G 45 sixes whatsoever so
now that we've got those scores right
there a 16:57 someone take a picture of
this so we can reference
and yeah we're gonna swap the card now
and do the same test again all right so
we swing and switch things over gotta
make sure everything's identical you
only have to do is close one draw if you
ever notice you an uninstall one drive
and Windows keeps putting it back every
single update that's really really
freaking annoying show you guys once
again there's no overclocking applied
whatsoever it's all exactly the same
temp limit same power limit like I said
you can't even add power limit right a
hundred is the max this is the bad GP I
say bad this is the lesser performing
GPU we're now running the exact same
settings again but I want to show you
guys do I remember how where it went to
on the previous one it was sitting there
like seventeen thirty something of the
1739 watch it watch where this one's
gonna go remember same GPU 1810
immediately now it's gonna come down
right but you see how it's already 60
megahertz faster then it then this guy
was now 60 megahertz matters trust me it
matters on a core or on a GPU like this
this is what I was trying to explain
that we finally realized what's
happening because before we were just
running our tests and going through them
and we're thinking wow same cards same
memory even the same series of
motherboards we're applicable when we
did the first video we tried to make it
as seriously concise and and
specifically matched as possible some
folks even suggested that the power
supply was to blame but if that was the
case he would see right now we wouldn't
see the GPU performing better out of the
box versus this one right because now
it's in the same system and this is the
way we should have done it initially
because what we actually introduced here
was a variable that we didn't foresee
being a problem that actually ended up
making our results look very differently
than what the reality actually was so by
trying to create two identical systems
as close as possible I actually added
flaw in the video and yeah so as you can
see right now we're still sitting at
1785 temperatures are starting to come
up a little bit but what I'm gonna do
right now is I'm gonna let this run for
a minute try and balance out and figure
out where the max temps are gonna be
where the max frequency is gonna drop
and we'll run the test again you guys
will see
score and how that's actually performing
better with that GPU and why my claims
of the graphics card were the problem
were actually accurate so it looks like
things have stabilized interesting note
though is heaven although it is a GPU
benchmark and stress test
it doesn't hammer the card as hard as
something like Ghost Recon does Ghost
Recon has to go on low settings and
still maxes out the memory on this but
we are seeing at least identical
temperatures here it looks like we hit
64 for a second you can see so paper to
come up this scene right here is really
interesting in that it doesn't leverage
the GPU as much see how it came back up
to 17 72 on this card remember it
dropped down into the 1690s and then
came back up to 17 30 but what I want to
show you now is by running this test
again that's actually 1c hotter than
this one now go figure
anyway we'll just throw temperature out
the window because 1c is not going to
make a big difference in terms of the
curve as you can see but I'm gonna run
the benchmark again remember what was
our previous score see this is why I
took pictures cuz I'm telling you I will
have to tell you I don't remember a damn
thing all right
16:57 is what the previous score was but
we're also gonna look at the minimum and
maximum because that that's actually how
the score is generated min max average
so yeah we're gonna let this test run
and you'll see now with the same exact
system and switching the graphics card
to an identical graphics card how much
performance difference there really was
so the test is done and we just got a
1704 and the previous test right was a
16 57 now let's compare that to what we
got in the video the other day so ramp
my spreadsheet here and I take a look at
what we got 17:08
with this same card on the last video so
a difference of four which is huge but
let's talk about the min max right so
the average FPS here was sixty seven
point seven on the previous tests right
before this was sixty five point eight a
minimum of twenty nine flat over here
twenty five point seven on the on the
previous GPU and a max of 130 point
eight the previous test was a max of one
twenty seven point nine so as you can
see it's pretty obvious that even though
we have a truck backing in and its
backup beeper making noise even though
we have two identical cards right here
there are clearly differences between
the cards and that's gonna fall down
it's going to come all the way down to a
six all right a six is a really
fascinating subject if you actually
takes the time to research
Asics exists and anything that have a
circuit board but it has to do with a
six and anyone who understand a six
knows the difference it makes when it
comes to overclocking not specifically
in the frequency but the voltage in the
way the voltage interacts with the core
the amount of voltage leaks and the
amount of power that you can actually
give it it makes a huge difference in
terms and I know I'm really simplifying
this but it makes a huge difference in
terms of overclocking and I think that's
what we have happening here I think we
have two different Asics that are
causing a significant issue here what I
should have done actually before I swap
the card was check the ASIC quality let
me see if I can do that real quick well
I just tried to read the ASIC quality on
the card it looks like the Pascal cards
are still not showing up in gpu-z when
it comes to ASA quality that's too bad
cuz I think that would have told it's a
little bit of a story here Asics do not
a sequela does not guarantee an
overclock it is not like the higher the
ASIC quality the better the overclock in
fact some people would argue it's the
opposite lower the ASIC quality the
better the overclock but I seeing a huge
difference in value here where at least
given us some place to look I'm not too
concerned about the card itself having
anything physically wrong with it I
think it's just that I think it's just
variants and core quality I'm starting
to wonder if maybe this is something
that's present more so on the lower
tiered cards o than the higher tiered
cards I have a lot of 1080s a lot of 10
70s a lot of 1080 eyes and they all
perform within a ridiculous margin of
each other I have for ten atti founder's
cards here right now for various builds
I have tested all of them and they all
pretty much run identical the only thing
that seems to vary between them is they
get a little better over time because
the drivers improve but then if you take
another card and throw it in they pretty
much are the same score not massive
differences like this guy right here so
I would have loved to have put in a high
tier graphics card and test this the
problem is I'm using the budget built I
mean maybe we'll maybe this would be
something we test in the future on the
test bench and we'll start with the low
tier and then use a couple of identical
cards and the high tier and see how much
of a difference that actually makes but
obviously here this video shows that my
dog graphics cards are created equal but
that said guys I'm going to go tell me
what you thought of today's video what
other experience you think we should do
I might revisit this in the future with
using the test bench and testing it on
very low end cards that are identical
and very high-end cards that are
identical and I think it'd be cool to
get them from two different sources
because I've always had this theorem
mind that some places seem to get lower
tiered or lower quality parts I know
it's really hard to discern but things
like stepping on CPUs I've always
noticed that the CPUs I get from Micro
Center never overclock as good as CPUs
you get from somewhere else and I want
to test that and see if that's true
anyway it looks I'm gonna be spending
more money time to go guys thanks for
watching as always I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
