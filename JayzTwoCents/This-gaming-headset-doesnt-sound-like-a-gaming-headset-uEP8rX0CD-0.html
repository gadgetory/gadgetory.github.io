to do a headset review I swear I would
never do another one of these yeah it's
no joke I've not done a headset review
in a long time and a couple of reasons
for that one I'm not an audiophile and
anytime you talk about audio the audio
files like to come in and really sort of
flex their audiophile muscles and yeah
I'm not talking to you today I'm talking
to the average buyer who wants to get
better than the typical shitty Chinese
knockoff headsets that you get with
gaming headsets that sound terrible have
horrible microphones and just leave your
ears practically bleeding at the end of
the day so that's why I'm talking to you
average gamer who wants a better sound
experience because today we're taking a
look at Sennheiser's new PC 370 3d 7.1
surround gaming headset I want to give a
huge congratulations to the winner of
the GTX ten-eighty g1 gaming giveaway
William lines
I've more stuff to give away this
holiday season so make sure you grab
your lucky charms and know that isn't a
euphemism so stay tuned alright this is
my second time warning you if you're one
of those audio files that it gets all
tripped up on all the specs and you care
about this and that and frequency range
and all you've come to the wrong place
that's your second warning so you don't
have a foot to stand on if you don't
like the way I do this review tough
anyway two years ago I did the
Sennheiser game zeroes a review of these
guys because I thought it was
interesting that a company like
Sennheiser which makes like HD 800
headphones that are considered to be the
best in the world I guess depending on
who you ask has dabbled in making gaming
headsets and it's not their first time
but man are they getting good at it and
the game zeroes were awesome they had a
couple drawbacks though they were hot
they were closed back they if you put
the leather ear cups on and they get
very sweaty but the sound was amazing
especially for a stereo headset the
microphone quality was really good
although it could use a better
windscreen because your peas and other
sounds tend to make pops in the
microphone which makes me want to put it
away from my mouth a little bit but
everything about these just screamed
quality the problem was they also took a
lot of power to drive in the beginning
and if you didn't have a DAC or any sort
of a preamp on your motherboard then you
were gonna get not the greatest sound
experience so let's go ahead and fast
forward to today now the new ascent
Heiser
pc3 73d still note the number means but
it's interesting kind of takes a lot of
the heritage here from the game zero
builds upon it but then also takes some
of the things I loved about the game
zero and Nix is it so I'm kind of
curious about some of the designs that
decisions they made for instance the
game zeroes as you can see I'm gonna be
going back and forth here guys sorry
you're just gonna deal with that and
also to if I sound nasally I've got a
cold
but I'm dedicated to you guys so I'm
working anyway I'm not calling in sick
guy my bosses an asshole anyway these
fold up so that you can put them in a
carrying bag or something they even come
with a carrying case actually and as you
can see they fold up pretty nicely
they even fold up flat like this that's
kind of how they go in their case you
see how flat they are and it makes them
very friendly when it comes to traveling
these guys however do not fold up at all
fact I didn't even check did they even
come in the bag nope it does not just
has a plastic sleeve in there that they
were they were in believe it or not
cochlea monkey is actually the one that
unbox these he came over one day to play
some games I'll need some headphones I
was like here buddy
did you try these out and hand them to
him and the rest was history it's got
pretty much the same microphone as the
game zero but one of the major
differences is these are an open back
and they have velvet ear cups which
allow a lot of breathing now I've worn
these for several hours at a time and
the new open back design and velvet ear
cups actually make it some of my ears
weren't sweating and what I like about
that is I typically do not like velvet
ear cups at all it tends to get itchy
and I just don't like the way it feels
but that didn't really bother me with
these guys right here
maybe it's the open back maybe you it's
it's the velvet feeling when I started
to sweat on a closed back headphone that
I don't like but whatever the case may
be these were very very comfortable of
course it's got the volume knob on the
side right here so you don't have to
reach for the dongle the tie and turn it
up and down you can do it right there
and your ear same as on the game zeroes
but this is a USB cord so you're not
going to worry about plugging these into
any sort of an amperage DAC but it also
means if you want to use them for
listening to like your mp3 player you
can't do that though which you could
have done with the game zeroes and just
let the mic fold it up
speaking of mic folding up that is how
you actually mute the thing there's no
mute button you've got to reach for
let's say you're gaming and you're like
this you know you're you're playing your
games stuff and your mom comes in and
it's like did you do your home
mark you don't be like mom I'm busy
right now playing my games cousin
everyone's gonna hear that and they're
gonna be like yeah you're gonna get
barest it's gonna get recorded put up on
YouTube and then you're forever going to
be you know embarrassed of the fact that
you were caught on discord arguing with
your mom but if you want to mute it push
it up there's a very noticeable click
and then the mic is not only out of the
way it is also completely muted
something else I really like too is
there's a much thicker pad up here on
the top of the headset and all those
you're not very heavy they're only I
believe seven hundred and ten grams very
light the one on top of the game zeros
right here although leather was not
quite as thick and it squished a bit
more and you started to feel the weight
of the headphones the games zeros are a
little bit heavier than the 3:7 3d so
now's the part we're gonna talk about
sound remember I'm talking about my
experiences here which is gonna be
entirely 100% subjective and your
opinions may differ and your results may
vary but anyway here's the dongle right
here the only button on this thing the
only reason this thing is here is to
turn on and off the Dolby mode the Dolby
Surround
I kind of wonder why they couldn't just
made a button on the ear cup or the ear
can then you would've needed this dongle
and the other thing I find kind of
interesting about this and I just don't
know why that's the case
is it unplugs to a microUSB it's just a
regular old microUSB cable here at one
point is a one point three meter I
believe one point three meter and it's
like the same one you would charge your
Android with I don't know why that
exists I'll be honest because it's not
like it came with another cable or
anything in there where you could make
it you know play regular audio like on a
mp3 player or something I just I'll be
honest I don't know but when you first
plug these in USB of course they sound
extremely flat I was actually very
disappointed I was thinking I expected
better from Sennheiser I was completely
flabbergasted I didn't know what the
issue was until I decided to download
their software then they woke up because
the software communicates with these and
the software i'm on the pc obviously
controls the eq because it is a USB
sound card and all contained unit here
and then they woke up and started to
sound
being phenomenal I mean they its
Sennheiser they sound great
now the EQ unfortunately is not user
definable you cannot adjust sliders and
make the EQ just how you want it you
only get four settings if you include
off otherwise you get three that being
music gaming and eSports now gaming and
eSports kind of sound the same right so
you go what look what the heck what's
the difference well gaming it's very
emphasized on just kind of the loudness
is up the explosions are very booming
the bass is very heavy but manageable
doesn't hurt your head remember these
are 7.1 drivers in here so they are not
going to be like a huge 50 millimeter
driver pounding bass into your head
it sounds very full realistic especially
playing games like Battlefield one it's
just like the sound is so damn good now
eSports what it does is it flattens out
all of that and it boosts up and
emphasizes the vocal range of the human
voice to make it so that you can hear
and prioritize what you hear from your
teammates because in eSports obviously
it's all about communication and less
about the sounds of the game who cares
what the game sounds like you want to
hear footsteps gunfire and the people
talking but most importantly people
talking now the music setting was a lot
like gaming where the base was punchy
and tight but it didn't it didn't kill
your ears it wasn't like beats by dre
and those pieces of crap the highs were
very crisp I liked the way everything
sound it sounded very full the
soundstage was wide and it made
listening to music very enjoyable so I
don't know exactly what the difference
is between music and gaming because you
can't see the EQ you can't see the
sliders you just click a button and
that's it now of course the Dolby is
engaged able that's even a word on all
of those settings but it's really gonna
make most noticeable in gaming right
because music is mixed down to two
channels left and right and really games
are the only place where you're gonna
notice the 7.1 especially in games like
battlefield where they just really take
advantage of the enormous soundstage and
sounds happening all around you I I love
the visuals of battlefield but man the
sounds the sounds are what make
battlefield is so much fun so now we're
going to talk about the microphone we'll
do a sound test with the mic because
sometimes you get really good audio and
a shitty mic with a headset or you get a
really good mic you get shitty audio but
anyway let's go and see how the
Sennheiser sound here's your mic test of
the Sennheiser 3
seven 3d looks like we're hitting about
negative 15 to negative 12 on the DB
meter with a mic positioned immediately
in front of my mouth I wish it was a
little bit more sensitive but as you can
see with a small microphone of this
nature it's got kind of a tinny you know
headset sound you're never gonna get
large diaphragm condenser mic sound out
of a headset but I digress
it does seem like the windscreen has
improved because I can say Peter Piper
picked a peck of pickled peppers and
it's not just going to pop in your ears
so that's that there's an improvement
there at least alright so they're not
the best but they're not the worst
either I'd say it's kind of right in the
middle they've got it's a challenge to
get a tiny little microphone in here and
make it sound amazing but I mean
ultimately what it is it's very
well-rounded now if you are a gamer
looking for better than average audio
you're definitely gonna get it but the
last thing to mention here is these are
very pricey they are two hundred and
fifty US dollars that is like double
what you would typically pay for a
decent gaming headset now the only thing
I could really suggest is trying to find
some sort of sennheiser retailer where
they have got these on display and take
a listen for yourself anyway guys I just
want to share this with you I wasn't
planning on doing this video I mean it
was they were kind of sent over to see
if I wanted to check them out and I did
and I've been using them for a while and
it finally I was like you know what I'm
gonna share this with you guys and
hopefully they'll like it
oh no somebody else tried to mention of
course it pulls out from there too so
yeah there's that if you have to mention
that alright guys time to go I like I
said I'm not gonna do a lot of these
headset reviews don't be like oh my god
I like the direction of this channel is
going I don't like that there we go I'm
not doing them all the time I just want
to share these with you because I
thought that they were actually pretty
darn good for the price it better be but
anyway I digress so alright guys time to
go as always I will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
