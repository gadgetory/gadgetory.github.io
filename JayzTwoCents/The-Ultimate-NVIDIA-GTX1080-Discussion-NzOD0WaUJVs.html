little bit of a heads up this is going
to be a long video because you guys told
me you wanted to see this this is the
full recording of the conversation that
took place between Luke Anthony at tweak
town myself and Paul's hardware where we
kind of talked about our first
impressions regarding the live stream
and information on the 1080 rumor we got
to learn about the 1080 at the exact
same time as you guys we this is our raw
reaction to it we went back to the hotel
had this conversation so it's gonna be a
long video feel free to skip through it
or listen to it on your own you know how
to actually watch the screen it's just
us sitting there on a couch but again
huge thank you to Luke at Linus tech
tips for giving me this footage letting
me upload it and do what I want with it
so I just basically put it up there and
did an edit for time and cut out some of
the pauses and stuff but anyway enjoy
this video and guys I will see you in
the next one we've got lots of 1080
coverage coming up I'm gonna mix it up
it's not gonna just be purely 1080
coming at you in the next few weeks
anyway
thanks for watching guys and I'll see
you in the next J's $0.02 video the new
z170 classified motherboard from EVGA
features eight phase-- PWM 4 Way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more
ok so we just sat through the Nvidia
keynote presentation thing you guys just
saw all of our like pre speculation
stats kind of stuff and I think for all
of us it was a lot more than what we
expected so absolutely I guess let's
start with Paul and work our way over
what do you think well I think usually
when you're talking about a new launch
you're looking at I don't maybe Intel's
gotten us to used to expecting a 10 to
15 percent performance boost per genome
awkward yeah so the numbers at least
that we're seeing from Nvidia as far as
performance compared to last generation
specifically like Titan X I mean it's
insane the fact that you could get a
1070 for 300 and
which is a 3 333 79 it's better than a
tekneqs right now I mean that's the
reference 1070 it's better than Exynos
gonna be board partner versions yeah I
was most shocked at the fact that Cu and
I would speculate like what are they
gonna compare to your they gonna
benchmark against 680 or they gonna
maybe 79 I thought at the most it would
be sub mated they came right out of the
chute with the 980 and then went there
and said it's faster than tight next
yeah they literally obsoleted their
current offerings entirely babies in
that's a lie that was crazy that was
nuts when I put that up you do have to
remember that their charts are a little
bit cherry-picked so maybe they would do
things like it was faster but then the
the x-axis is wattage yeah and then in
like this one it's like strictly PR VR
performance they never talked very
specifically about like the m50x valve
yeah they didn't talk about DX in this
latest I think obviously because of the
demand of P 100 we weren't expecting
this to be hmm to card but I'm looking
at this going okay 16 nanometer the
performance jump going down to 16 the
memory the memory speed increase and the
fact that it's not HBM
and it's obliterating everything on the
market now we're HBM one stuff we go
from fury X and Titan X I was joking
around with all of you like okay
whatever there's a lot of fanfares for a
small jump but I let this event going
okay what just happened I honestly I
thought the exact same thing I would
want to solve the order of 10 branding
and all that kind of stuff was like hey
yeah sure like this is your you shooting
way above with the marketing here yeah
like yeah this might be the biggest
generational jump they've done yet yeah
which which I and the reason why I
wasn't expecting a huge jump was because
in the the GDC
you know he mentioned like yeah we could
have gone all-in with our chips and
benefiber jump but we chose to do the
smart thing and make it incremental
which to me was almost like
justification for like okay you're not
going to see he jump with it with
consumer card but we're players were
playing it safe but
it obviously they've made this huge jump
and we're not even on what's considered
their current top to your platform yeah
right Pascal on an HB M platform we do
we do have to like all wait till we get
it in office and are able to bench it
right like what they've been able to
show so far is pretty damn cool yeah but
I would have to assume that they're not
going to be bold to make these
statements that aren't backed up in
independent testing obviously you know
you we still have to go in there and be
objective and say okay there's a bottom
line here we're gonna do our independent
tests you know but I I see no reason to
disbelieve it but then again alright as
independent reviewers we have to say
okay we need to see this for ourselves
you have the tech specs up there so - PC
/ who I unfortunately was not able to
wrangle in here 2560 CUDA cores
easy-to-remember 2560 bit it's a lot
yeah this is for the sin 80s we don't
have these specs with 1070 1607
megahertz base clock that gives you 8.2
teraflops at base 17 33 megahertz boost
clock it for 8.9 teraflops and and
that's pretty impressive 320 gigabytes
per second is the memory is the memory
throughput 256 bit 8 gigabytes of gddr5
X + 180 watt listed power with a single
8 pin connected nothing most impressive
ultimate like how they're able to go
from having this call that uses so much
power like a like a tiny it's hot and
it's loud yeah and it can use a lot of
power but it's it's really fun thank God
that's what's single yeah okay that's
just
well I choked and we tweeted during the
event you know that I personally I don't
care about power consumption give me all
the FPS I'm ok with a power hog but this
is my this might be the first time I'm
actually excited about the TDP reduction
because I with obviously with three type
X's underwater loop and massive
radiators I still do with a lot of heat
and any any amount of heat that I can
reduce now it's only bonus yeah you said
during the
like when they're doing that whatever
demo that was where they were just
spinning around the guy and that was
only right 67 degrees yeah yeah when
they brought up precision X overlay yeah
it showed
2114 megahertz which we are we are kind
of speculating that's gonna be like
founders edition yeah the founder curve
but it's and memory was overclocked to
eleven hundred and sixteen yeah
effective eleven thousand thousand sorry
eleven thousand thousand sixteen records
for the DVD but like just considering
potential over clocks or fat whatever
the founders like we don't know yet I
either
we don't know if what we're shown as a
founders edition yet we're speculating
it because of how far percentage-wise
that is but so much Headroom like
sixteen to seventeen hundred megahertz
basement boosts but up to over two
thousand and this is fairly early I
thought it was like we're talking about
before what they showed us we don't know
if that's if the founders Edition has to
type in characters what haven't said
anything regardless the temperature
shown was 67 C so unless they had this
thing with like some sort of an air
conditioner blowing directly on it yeah
what the eff is up with that temperature
in that overclock yeah and like we're in
Texas
I'm super sunburned like wow that's
pretty but like even me the area we were
in which it was probably in a different
room but still it was what hundreds of
people in there yeah and like that must
have read it at least a little bit it
was what do you guys think aesthetically
over the card because going into this
the the photos that we saw from the like
whatever factory that a leaked from and
then the leak they had the leak they had
booked it did wait supervisor
yeah like I thought there's gonna be
massive cut in chunks and stuff right
it's actually somewhat subtle a lot less
transformers line yeah they look just
like I was a waiting for that to like
just transform but it looks why cleanup
I feel like Lena I feel like I would
have liked to have seen a more radical
color design changed since it's such a
radical new new innovation for them in
terms of 60 nanometers you know I I
think we've kind of the cooler I'm
disappointed I like the new angles of
stuff hopefully maybe that I lost some
more air to get in there for reference
style multi you know GPU could face but
I don't know we've seen the same cooler
now for like four years a long time 602
plastic 680 was old school play yeah
yeah okay
I remember a head stack the stack power
connectors alright yeah so 780 was when
they showed the new like tungsten or
magnesium cooler yeah and it's been the
same thing now ever since and I would
have liked to have seen something new I
was I was like when I saw this super
angled setup of Canada supporting I was
like that's gonna be kind of hard to fit
in themes yeah but then also really
excited because I wanted to take like
the razor core and make a bat will be a
lot right so like work in the card stuff
and now it's like it's it's not even
that aggressive it just looks like
there'll be slightly reflective surfaces
right cool but yeah but but how many how
many of you guys notice to reference
back plate again yeah you know 980 had
it and then 980ti and tight next it not
yeah and now it's back again but that
might be that might answer your question
about the 67 degrees you know that can
dissipate heat off the back of the
collar I'm not that much though that
unit four or five degrees yeah but we're
used to reference coolers especially
when you overclock them right hitting
that 88 to 90 C threshold not 67
nowadays so I'm still I still in the
back of my might have to wonder like is
this an a ID card you know because we
didn't see the test demo that s great
yeah so the the card running in the back
that was live rendering things we don't
know what card that was it could be the
the mystical founder card it could be an
add-in board burner because we we saw
there was people from ZOTAC there there
was people from a Seuss there Corsair
VGA EVGA like MSI em aside probably
other I don't know you say gigabyte
right gave I was there I don't I didn't
personally see gigabyte
so like there was a bunch of out in
bored people here so I would be
surprised at all and none of them acted
like but ones I talked to you after that
they were like that that's cool yeah
they've already been working with it in
fact they had a they had a slide show
going at the event showing the board
partners like car yeah not because some
coolers but they were showing like
gigabytes you weren't extreme you know
and okay and okay what what price did
you all expect it to be I expected it to
be $6.99 or 5 into 649 649 okay because
that was kind of like the debut price
yeah a long time I thought it would be
649 so it was cheaper than that but then
so it's it's $50 cheaper than you
expected all right the founders card is
only $50 more the more I think we've all
reached the point to where it takes a
lot to surprise us anymore no like I
just I don't get like super excited
about new hardware but I'm kind of there
right now
yeah this is kind of cool and I think
one of the main reasons why it's kind of
cool is is the price points if you
expected any change or if I expected me
to change I expected it to go up yes
they're gonna be like oh yeah Ashley
since they just obsoleted everything
they're offering right now see before it
was like okay the new card but the
Titans still faster or something no
literally he even came out and even used
his own price I guess we think our
thousand dollar card is now like slower
yeah more impactful than anything even
though we haven't mentioned it all yet
is the 1070 yes because the price point
for that is very aggressive that's still
super mysterious because we have no
specs yeah but all we saw was that it's
still faster than Technic yeah oh five
teraflops on a 1070 yeah yeah yeah I
said that's that's gonna be tweaked a
lot more now in September 2014
right rewind to when Maxwell launch
small Maxwell
everyone was so excited about the
1979-80 wasn't yeah that's cool but
everyone was flipping out over the price
to performance of 970 yeah and they did
it again yeah totally
like the 1080 is a very cool card but
when they announced the price and when
they announced the like teraflop and
whatnot
of the 1070 like wow yeah that's the
wasn't Gangi kill gas yeah and a way
more impressed gas because they they're
like Oh big performance but you pay a
lot it's cool but they're like actually
still pretty freakin big performance and
you don't pay a gouging amount yeah see
it's not your big white like Jensen
comes up being you know cool lucky
always is he's like GTX tiny blah blah
blah and then it's kind of like gtx 1070
my drop yeah he did the apple but
there's there's something else there's
you know that's not all kind of thing
right yeah I feel like for that price
level or that performance level they
could have gotten away with five hundred
dollars for that card
yep they could have but it didn't sound
still quite a bit but like it's this I'm
very impressed
this sounds to me like this might be
probably one of the more mainstream
centric launches in videos had in a long
time
yeah which makes me happy because I've
got a buddy back home that like two
three weeks ago I've been building a
computer since high school right and he
was like hey man like my cards are kind
of acting up and like things getting
weird I should probably get a new
computer so I specter one out for but
I'm like you know what dude you should
just wait because like there's so many
rumors about these cards and like I
don't know if they're gonna be that much
better but even at the very least the
current cards were down to price a
little bit on the used market or
something and like we could pick up some
of those so everyone knows I'm building
project redness right now for a client
that instead of sitting outside the
money to just build he bought the parts
in peace and then it was like okay let's
build it
three 980ti is just bottom a couple
months ago and they've been sinning
until he was ready to do the building
way he's passionate ready to get a
replay - I saw him betray him right now
oh no he he tweeted or he's not tweeted
he text messaged me during the event
that picture of that guy sitting at the
desk and I reply reply back with just
try nothing
just try and think that it's killer
machine but it's just knowing he paid
the same price right now as what's
that's also the 980ti which is still
significantly more powerful than the
1080i sorry that the two non ATS of
their competitive GTX ten eighties as
fastest to 90s but are not any guys to
look Kalispell and and he also was
putting a 59 60 X in there and the new
broad well II like just I'm sorry but
sorry like you know it's never build a
PC at spring one time to do a computer
yeah look what I did the video I showed
the bill blog happening right now
everyone called it out like why is he
building this now I'm like I'm just
building it for minute he's deep it's
the parts but yeah I think no matter who
is buying a 5 X 2 or 3 times X's then
wow the pain from that would that would
have it not any guy it's okay EB genius
step up so how much is a tape mix right
now
so you can get you can easily get to 10
70s and that's all one drops off so much
and that they didn't show any
performance for that yeah you better get
you could get 310 70s for like 180 Niva
T or ever surprise even one type next
yeah that's pretty beastly which is
crazy and I wonder if the 1070 will have
a single 6 pin if the 1080 has a single
painting would they go right down it's
just gonna use the 75 watt PCIe draw
this dump our pin go 750ti style just
yeah I think today like it I was taking
them back I was kind of blown away about
what their hope to do without HP m2 and
then it excites me even more to see what
they could do with HP m that's the thing
right so last year HBM one fury xk III
and all that yeah amazing this is the
nvidia killer this is the nvidia killer
and then everyone expected the answer to
be HBM to because last month right
no they just came out like don't need it
don't because honestly they don't the
more I thought about it the more I
thought about it after yeah we kind of
knew going into this it wasn't gonna be
HBM to because they already said
production for p100 which is going to
eat up all our HBM to samples it's going
like end of the year right it's just
insane to think that no we have not
maxed out the limits of the current
configuration of memory to CPU you know
in grew up in physical relative to your
relative 'ti to each other yeah it
literally was like a mic drop today and
if that had used I could be up to the
prospered have been like 799 it would
have been someone I think minutes or yet
yeah they may even have had problems you
know just manufacturing that's what I'm
seeing yeah I think they just really
didn't need to
yeah we've known it more time not
refining an important oil and I rather
than take that path I'd rather than use
gddr5 that means we achieve the cards
and we get a lot of them if they do HBM
to the numbers in any sort of lorina
when now they can just pump these things
especially the 1070 that thing's gonna
be crazy it's gonna be so popular by and
it's it's small Pascale yes right so GP
104 amazeballs
what's GP 100 really gonna show us next
year yeah like okay it's good its I
can't I don't think I can even think
about all right I think we single you're
gonna have long Cod that does 4k 16
without a problem
well that's the thing to bear down the
game tight necks could do that
oh the problems are more like the new
games love batter food wall which are
three or k61 titan yeah well that's what
that was showing off right that in GT X
1080 with like the division oh details
the maxed out single card and it's like
I don't know just walking around there's
no explosions
no physics involved there was no
interaction it was just walking
visualize volume and realities thing was
cranked up and it was still smooth yeah
that's what impressed me like it was
walking past you could see the buildings
was sharp
yeah that it was just smooth it was
super super space bot
that's what was that like you didn't see
any action it was just like he's a demo
I don't know why he was dead because
they're trying to like do it all alive
and if they run into a problem where if
there's like the one little dip right
they will just get that was you see a
hashtag damn it tom was trending yes
there I was I was standing next to him
when some and I'll freaking order done
he's like oh I looked at Twitter and
what was trending now like because I saw
bunch of people cuz I tweeted like this
is really getting weird right now it's
like watching a married couple argue
yeah and then someone responded like
hashtag damn it Tom and then I looked at
what's trending now at hashtag dammit
Tom was like number eight oh my god just
like immediately to the top of Twitter
because how many thousands of viewers
were watching okay I have to say I
nailed the social media at this event
yeah they had this social media game on
point like they just yeah and I think
that that whole Tom thing that kind of
like ran with it but I think Jenson was
he was pretty pissed
through the clicker and in very
temporarily but still left the stage
which is like huge yeah
Wow we've all seen some pickups on an
Nvidia you know keynotes and stuff where
usually it's kind of like a little
giggle you like like last month with my
dick with a
wozniak yeah I was like wow so I feel a
little sick right now
Jen's is like you know that's not a very
helpful comment but this was really
awkward yeah yeah why Cameron I think
was like it was very good like you could
you could feel the entire room start
looking at each other going like is this
a joke like it doesn't feel like I know
yeah yeah I thought it was planned at
first I kind of did a minute just kept
going
going and he throws the clicker and it's
like okay and he could kind of see lunch
instant spike oh yeah these facial
expressions was like almost like a high
tuition yeah yeah yeah
so what do you guys think amy has to
pull out I'll be honest
so everyone everyone knows like I prefer
nvidia for my personal Billups but I
have to remain objective in these little
views yeah I just based on the last five
years alone and NVIDIA hasn't been
bested by AMD since 79 70 gigahertz
edition and even then it was marginal I
don't know if AMD can answer this
because but are they do even want to I
think they have to because let's say
Polaris is gonna be the same price and
if it's significantly slower well how
would anyone why would anyone do that
okay so rumors of $2.99 price point even
and if it's significantly slower than
1070 my recommendation would have to be
save the extra 80 bucks get 50 percent
more or whatever it might be you can
kind of work that out so if you if you
look at the two GTX 980 s and SLI Nvidia
said that the 1080 was faster than that
or just as fast as that right so that
means the 1070 is gonna be safe 30%
slower which means it's only one and a
bit times faster than a 980 so then and
AMD can't come in a flaca
even if even if 99 you're gonna have $3
to attend 70 or you gonna grow by second
hand it's more than just FPS even right
raw horsepower of a graphics card is
such a minimal factor now because people
hate IP or a game works camera
everywhere there was all the game works
we asked oh but I'm sorry the the
surround fix finally so we're not
dealing with the outside Rikuo I'll
probably talk more about it tomorrow so
so you're not dealing with the skew I
got I ditched my surround set up
specifically because of the skewing it's
so stretched out so there's that there's
VR works there's so much proprietary you
creation of software development going
on not just GPU perforce but the
software side of it to where it's more
than just the number of FPS you can get
yeah I mean if you're gonna be getting
one yes and all of this support Nvidia
sells you an ecosystem with the video
card it's one part of the system they're
actually selling you story much and all
of it is free right they could come out
go which I'll do 40 dollars a month for
a premium back yeah founders package
yeah yeah there's something whatever
that means but no asynchronous
discussion here but like you said on the
bus right we were coming back it's not
that important right now I was
disappointed very disappointed I was
weirded out that they didn't talk about
direct x12 oh it is weird
do you meet some good comments on that
on the bus again there isn't very many
dicks 12 games right now and like no one
really seems to be pushing that ban away
by DTX puppy or something like that I'm
not sure but it just doesn't really seem
to be picking up we've been even like
dx10 right it wasn't until like dx10 see
or whatever it was it wasn't like that
really widely adopted and then suddenly
everything was dx10 and like obviously I
would love to see you guys 12
performance numbers yeah I would hope
that they're killer but like yeah so
like I'm not super worried about it
again I would love it if it was super
great but they showed none of those
numbers so I'm assuming they're at the
very minimum not nearly as impressive as
their VR stuff that makes me wonder will
IND attack that well that's our
injection soldier with what it's gonna
be kinda like that but we have 512 bit
memory bus who cares
it didn't really make a difference at
the end of the day yeah well I have 4096
bit on fury X and fury age we don't know
who's gonna lose what but it will lose
to 1080 and Tandy has a 256 bit memory
boss so people if you look at that
people see two classics and I see 4096
if I give you two hundred fifty-six
dollars I may give you both out of $96
there's a big difference so you would
expect not really it's a but $256 256
it's isn't directly compute or relate
that way I had some really good
conversations for the video in the past
my flat out ask PDR want some I'm like
why 256 first 384 on bigger cards and
stuff and a name these 25 12 this is the
deal III can't even relay the technical
specs that were thrown my way of like
here's why that number doesn't matter so
much
yeah so I think people should I stuck on
the 256 I've done fairly extensive
testing I like trying to show any real
improvement for that and I can't
yeah I've seen you guys have done yeah
I've seen some of it but like it's hpm
for me this morning I wasn't old boss to
arrive before it's more important for
the form factor yeah performance-wise
there's no benefit if you can if you can
show a gddr5 based car like a 390 x
versus a HBM card there's no real
difference well we're still on
traditional architecture and it's
destroying HBM 1 yeah yeah
and the use was so low for that and
that's the problem with HP on twos it's
gonna be perfect for professional cards
the games these days don't need you know
1024 you go off the second recipe does
anyone recall what the teraflops was on
the pro dual 15.6 I think it was like 15
I think
cuz I think Radeon as we know i neva
tably this is gonna be a lot of no I am
DS got the pro duo but that's a dual GPU
code yeah it's not it's really it's a
maverick Harriet about personally I
passed a single graphics card yeah but I
don't you know I don't that's the things
see you know how many people were
calling out Nvidia right now like cuz
they said it's the fastest GPU ever
I passed GPU in the world yeah it's the
fastest single GPU to get caught up on
its he didn't say card he said GPU yeah
but you know I've said it a million
times
my podcast and everything else I don't
want anybody to fail I really don't but
I really like it there to be railing so
far behind right now that the game isn't
can they beat Nvidia it's can they even
get with an ear shot I think it will be
very bad if Andy has to go the position
with graphics cards that they've been
doing with CPUs for so long where they
abandon the high-end they only have
these middle and low-end offerings and
they seem to get lower all the time like
it hurts the image of the brand of the
company you know it's best what does
anything they don't get lower they just
get enough pine boy yeah yeah they get
older no no new items yeah
they focus remember 2013 they put a lot
of eggs in the API or the API which
didn't pan out well they take you you're
preaching to the enthusiast market with
an APU and that's not gonna fly yeah
well because if all the room is right
now is that the pilars for not 400
series or whatever it is is gonna be a
mainstream pot so you're looking like
1080p or 1440p under $300 but then it's
like $300 riding on pro do I go this
usually enthusiast car that no one no
normal people that I bought it but it's
like where where is anybody's thinking
now are they going for the customers
that want to do $300 or less or are you
gonna go fury X which is like this
Wheatley place card in the middle of HBM
and like the crazy Radeon from Julie
it's just a way they're in a very weird
space but then maybe they could do an
end video and completely surprise
everyone but it's gonna be hard for them
to win back that mark show what uh
something you brought up on the bus I
remember win but it was actually a
really good point is the once they do
move to HBM because like you don't you
don't see aim D graphics powered high
end laptops ya know you just don't
really these days but once they're all
APU
ya know exactly they they have like
actually pretty damn good skew lower end
laptops with a fuse in them which are
solid but like you see the really high
end like well we have a desktop 980 in
this in this laptop you brought up
having HBM on there would be huge I
don't know
like obviously the thumbs are pretty
crazy that the on our nano what's
perfect well why can't I just put a nano
if you can if you can put a desktop gtx
980 inside of a no-go
you can put an eye on that I even like
nano powered notebooks would be pretty
sick if they could get the heat in check
yeah I think that would be a thing I
just don't think that the voice I don't
think the manufacturers are ordering I
don't think there's a demand I think
that also the yields on HP my nice are
lawyer that I brought the seller
graphics card you know make the money
from the graphics card didn't you fault
that prosecute it was that wideness
supply issue in the beginning of yeah
anyways I think we're done I think we're
all retired and I think a long day I
have to wake up pretty damn early in the
morning oh yeah you sleep in no you're
all right we're all waking up really
early in the morning so yeah that's it
party till 1:00 a.m. oh be on the bus at
7:30 in the morning that's it check out
their coverage of the event I'm sure you
all have it you guys's information will
be on boards and stuff thanks for
watching I'll be making another video
