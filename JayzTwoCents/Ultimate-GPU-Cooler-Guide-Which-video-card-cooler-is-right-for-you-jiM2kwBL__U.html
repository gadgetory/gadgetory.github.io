season and that means you're gonna be
spending a lot of time on your computer
doing things like homework and research
and video games and that's why it's more
important than ever to make sure that
your online activity is safe Norton
security has over 25 years of experience
in protecting users from cyber threats
but not only that Norton security has a
great suite of parental controls that
allow me to keep an eye on what my
daughter is doing and can keep her
online activities safe most people don't
even think about cyber threats until
they've already been a victim so don't
be a victim keep yours and your family's
online activity safe with Norton
security what is going on everybody Jays
2 cents here and we're going to talk
about a topic today that I think a lot
of people kind of get hung up on which
makes it harder for them to choose the
right graphics card for their next build
or upgrade now graphics cards are
usually the most expensive single
component of your computer which could
make buying the right one or the thought
of potentially buying the wrong one kind
of nerve-racking and really start to
where on your on your psyche when it
comes to building your computers you
want to get it right you want to enjoy
it and you don't want to regret any of
your purchases so we're going to talk
about today is specifically the cooling
options when it comes to your graphics
cards what they mean and hopefully armed
you with the information to be able to
make the right choice the first time now
there are technically 5 different types
of coolers for graphics cards and today
we're going to talk about the 4 of those
that would pertain to people like you or
me the fifth one being liquid nitrogen
cooling which is usually only going to
apply to those that are going for world
record overclocks I'm highly doubt any
of you are actually watching this video
that would apply to ln2 when it comes to
graphics cards but I digress but the
first type of cooler we're going to talk
about here is the blower style cooler
and these can be found on om style cards
from nvidia and AMD alike all of the
reference style cards always have blower
coolers on them and the reason for that
is this is a lot less dependent on the
amount of case cooling available to it
than something like a recirculating
cooler and we'll talk about that next
now the way this cooler works as it
pulls air into the face of the fan and
then it exhausts it out the back of the
card through these this vent right
here now typically these cards do tend
to be louder because they fans run at a
much higher rpm and they do tend to push
the card to about its max temperature
limits simply because there is a lot
less volume of air moving through the
cooler where would you want to use this
cooler because on the surface that kind
of sounds like a bad idea right it's
louder it's a bit hotter but this is
going to basically have its own a sealed
environment here for cooling what that
means is if you're using it in something
like a small form-factor build like an
ITX build or even a small m ATX build
home theater PC build it's a much
smaller footprint of a card it doesn't
have a taller PCB on it doesn't have a
ton of fans but most importantly it
exhausts all of the heat out through the
card rather than forcing your case to
exhaust the extra heat that the graphics
card is going to produce the graphics
card is the single hottest unit inside
of your asset unit yeah I know it's a
single hottest piece inside your system
which means that if you are using the
wrong type of cooler at a small
form-factor build then you could
potentially make the card throttle and
make everything else in your system like
your CPU your hard drives get way too
hot so this is where you would want to
use this cooler something where airflow
and size is definitely going to be a
concern now the next type of cooler here
this is pretty much the most common one
you'll find and you'll find a lot of
people asking well why wouldn't you use
this cooler well like we already
explained with the blower style cooler
it does have its use it does have its
applications where it makes sense but
most people tend to go with coolers like
this where you have multiple fans
pushing air down on a massive heatsink
that has copper heat pipes in there
doing the best it can to move the heat
away from the card extremely efficiently
as well as very very quiet now because
when you typically have more fans they
can spend at a lower rpm which pushing
more CFM or volume of air through the
heatsink giving you much better
temperatures but one thing you have to
keep in mind though is the air that's
being pushed down through these heat
sinks it's coming out all sides of the
car and all four sides coming out the
back the bottom the top the front and so
that means that your case is going to
have to be able to handle the heat that
your graphics card is going to be
putting off the graphics card is
undoubtedly the single hottest component
inside of your system so what that means
is you have to make sure whichever
you're putting this in is able to
exhaust that heat efficiently so
multiple exhaust fans multiple intake
fans maybe a larger volume of air like a
larger full ATX case or even a high flow
mid tower is going to be something you
need to keep in mind with a cooler like
this if you were to take a card like
this and stick it in a small form-factor
bill that only has say one intake fan
and one exhaust fan what's going to
happen here is the case is not going to
be able to expel the hot air fast enough
which means these fans are going to ramp
up because the card is getting hotter
which is only going to exacerbate I like
that word exacerbate which is only going
to exacerbate the issue by making it
even hotter because the fans are
speeding up the graphics cards getting
hotter and the case cannot move that
heat fast enough and inevitably you will
end up thermal throttling even with the
cooler like this because the case is not
able to make the environment cool enough
for the card which is where something
like this would definitely make sense
now for those people who want a little
bit more exotic cooling but they're not
ready to go with something like a full
custom water loop over the last couple
of years we have seen the introduction
of much more of these hybrid style
coolers manufacturers have taken the
very popular all-in-one cooling units
like you would find on a CPU and they
have modified them to fit on graphics
cards and then still use a fan here to
cool things like VRMs &amp;amp; MOSFETs and
memory chips on your graphics card
that's why they're called a hybrid
because they do have an air cooler unit
for some parts and a water cooling unit
for others now you're going to find some
varying the styles of cooler on here
some have no fan at all some still a fan
like this hybrid here from a BGA but
they all pretty much use a single 120
millimeter radiator we haven't seen any
240 s yet of a feeling we might see some
- 40s in the future but these definitely
run the coolest of the three that we've
seen so far usually keeping temperatures
around the 45 to 50 C range which is
very very cool now you're going to see a
benefit to using hybrid coolers because
your boost clocks on both AMD and NVIDIA
are not going to be fluctuating nearly
as much because the temperatures are
more constant you see less temperature
spikes and the more constant and steady
the temperature stays the less GP booth
has to dynamically adjust the clock to
keep things thermally control
but you have to make sure obviously in
an environment with a hybrid cooler that
you have an extra space for 120
millimeter fan and enough clearance
around that fan mount so that you can
actually mount the radiator as well
because obviously you have to account
for not only the fan but the radiator as
you can see is a little bit taller not
necessarily wider but it is definitely
taller and thicker both top and bottom
than a standard 120 millimeter fan so
although you might be able to fit a 120
fan it doesn't mean you can fit the
radiator so you're going to have to do
some research on your case to make sure
that you are able to you know exam is
going to go now there's even some
upgrades that you can do to these which
we've already taken a look at in a
previous video where you can change the
fans and go push-pull with all kinds of
stuff where you can actually take a
little bit more control over a hybrid
cooler and get even better cooling by
changing out fans and stuff which is
something you can't do with the two
previous options we looked at with the
blower style cooler and the multi fan
config now the last one we're going to
take a look at here which happens to be
my personal favorite that should be no
surprise to you guys is the full cover
water block for custom water cooling
loops these are going to give you the
best temperatures these are going to
give you the quietest operation but
unfortunately it comes a bit at a price
premium where the block itself can run
upwards of one hundred and twenty
dollars and as you can see this one
doesn't have the back plate installed
yet I am putting a back plate on here
when the back plate can run you another
30 s you're talking a hundred and fifty
dollars on top of the price of the card
to go with some sort of cooling
functionality like this now although
these are going to give you the best
thermals it does not necessarily mean
though that you're going to get better
overclock so I mean it's going to help a
little bit maybe an extra 25 megahertz
at the most pretty much because we've
reached a very interesting age of
graphics cards where even coolers like
the hybrid cooler are keeping these
things cool enough to where we are
hitting korlam limits and voltage limits
long before we're actually hitting
thermal limits when it comes to these
graphics cards heck even some of these
air-cooled cards you put them on 100%
fan speed it keeps the temperatures down
in the 50 you're going to find that you
are not hitting temperature limits but
you are hitting core stability limits
and until you start doing custom VRMs
and really high voltage and exotic
cooling like
- you're never going to hit your
temperature limits before you hit the
limits of the core at least it the way
that they ship with their BIOS and
voltage limits it's really more of an
enthusiast thing where you water cool
your graphics card because you like to
not because you need to which is kind of
an exciting place where we are today
where you can get amazing performance
idea graphics cards without the need of
water cooling which only five years ago
you had to do water cooling if you
wanted to get your max overclocks there
you go that's that the four main cooler
types here and if you think I missed
something let me know down in the
comments and add to this video lots of
people come to these videos for
information about making their next
purchase and as a community we can all
rise together and help the community be
stronger with the correct knowledge out
there especially when it comes to things
like water cooling and air cooling and
such as that
as always guys you can hit me up on
Facebook Instagram and Twitter if you
want to have a one-on-one conversation I
do the best I can to get to all of you
but good lord there is a lot of you but
that said it's time to go as always
liked this video if you'd like to
subscribe if you're new here and as
always we will see you in the next one
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
