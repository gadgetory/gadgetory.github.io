here with JC cents and today we're going
to be taking a look at a pretty cool
product from EVGA and with z97 just
launching in Devil's Canyon 4790k
processors coming out it's got to be a
cool component right
maybe you brand new z97 motherboard or
maybe it's going to be an awesome
graphics card or maybe it's going to be
easy gaze brand new torque x10 Gaming
Mouse yeah EVGA made a mouse
now the torque x10 from EVGA bring some
pretty cool features to the market and
you would think that this was not their
first Mouse in fact you think they've
been doing this for years but this is a
pretty unique Mouse and the first thing
I'm going to go ahead and point out if
you're a left-hander you have some
pretty limited options of what you can
use when it comes to a mouse but EVGA is
showing you some love bro they're
showing you and the decks Trias mice is
the future
check it out you have got thumb buttons
on both boasts both on both sides of the
mouse that is pretty friggin cool if you
ask me now the mouse is mostly hollow in
fact there's not a whole lot going on
inside there I mean you can kind of see
right through the mouse so it really
cuts down on weight but if you like a
heavier Mouse like I do a hollow Mouse
is probably not something you're looking
for
so EVGA has combat at that as well by
making a panel that removes right here
it pops right off and you've got some
adjustable weights that you can stick in
there you've got a bunch of different
size weights and you pretty much just
stick them in there to add as much
weight as you want now I'm using both 14
gram weights here does come with a
variety of different weights and I like
a heavier Mouse so I've made up for that
hollowness by adding that weight in
there and now I've got some pretty cool
adjustability going on in there and it's
on the top of the mouse not the bottom
like a lot of mice company tend to do
now the buttons as you can see right
here they are flat top buttons they've
got a nice texture to them so you're not
going to be slipping and sliding all
over the place while you're playing your
favorite shooter games which we all know
would be pretty freaking annoying and
I'm clicking things on the screen right
now that's okay bear with me now you do
have LED lighting on here you have a lit
EVGA logo right here in the back and
you've got a lit scroll wheel it might
be hard to see with the lighting but
you've got a lit scroll wheel and you've
also got on the fly dpi adjustments as
you can see right there now you've got
on the fly
dpi adjustments and sensitivity
adjustment so you've got two different
adjustments when it comes to sensitivity
but it is an 8200 dpi Mouse now the
movement is very very crisp there's no
lag in this thing whatsoever and that's
due to the Avago 9800 sensor in there so
they went with a pretty hefty sensor
giving you very precise movement now
when it comes to all the buttons in the
saying you do have 20 million clicks 20
million that's like two games a
battlefield for me but the omron
switches in here have a 20 million click
expectancy of life that's an awful lot
of clicks guys like that that's like
that's like 20 million of them now the
really cool functionality and this
doesn't stop with just the ambidextrous
buttons or the cool LED backlighting or
the fact that it has a nice rubberized
scroll wheel that's a notch II wheel on
the fly dpi and sensitivity adjustments
and removable weights and adjustable
weights it does also have a butt hole
yeah quite seriously this mouse has a
butt hole and they give you this to put
in it I think that joke pretty much
wrote itself but if you like the mouse
to be a little bit taller or a little
bit shorter you just take the tool just
stick it in the rear end and you can
adjust the height of the mouse and I
just made it easily a half-inch shorter
by doing that stick it back in the rear
end give it a twist be gentle
it's one sensitive you bring the height
of both the palm rest and the switch
higher giving it a little bit more
adjustability for comfort now it does
have a built in arm 32-bit processor and
you have a an on-the-fly
profile adjustment right here on the
bottom now it does come with software
that allows you to control the profiles
the LED colors that you want the
sensitivity for each profile you can
have different profiles for different
games so you could have a super
sensitive first-person shooter or even a
super uncensored of first-person shooter
profile if you want and a different
profile for RPGs or mmo's or something
like that and without having to load up
the software you can switch it right
here with this red button and not only
that you can have different lighting
effects for each profile too I've set a
few up here we've got red as we can see
if I can actually push the button here
we've got red green blue that's actually
purple you can't really tell them the
light yellow back to red you do have
five profiles but you can set up pink
purple blue yellow green red orange
I think orange was in there but even if
it wasn't the only
are missing that I really would have
liked to have seen would have been white
oh well it can't be perfect now it does
have a six-foot cord on here which is a
braided cord very heavy-duty nice thick
junctions on there doesn't feel like
it's going to break or bend on you and
you know I really have nothing but great
things to say about this mouse I played
with it quite a bit in fact I was using
it when I did that console video for the
keyboard and mouse I don't know if you
guys caught that but this is the mouse
that I was using it was very very
comfortable now it's not as comfortable
as a ergonomic mice for a specific hand
I mean they have to be able to fit both
hands equally so they're not going to
have the palm contour to it like some
mice will but they do a pretty good job
at making it fill ergonomic for both
hands I'm not left-handed but I can put
it my left hand in it it feels okay if
you take a right-handed specific mouse
put it in your left hand it feels a
little bit awkward now I've only got one
complaint about this mouse only one
believe it or not and that is the fact
that they went with the piano finished
polished plastic on the side and that I
don't like that for two reasons one it
gets fingerprinted and grimy looking
quickly I mean you can polish this up
and the moment you pick up your mouse to
set it down somewhere or move it it's
going to fingerprints all over it again
I prefer a rubberized or textured
surface for the gripping portion of the
mouse that's just me I really like
rubberized mice I tend to get sweaty
hands yeah it's kind of gross I know but
I tend to get sweaty hands when I'm
gaming and so it gives me that nice
comfort grip on there that I think
that's the only thing that this is
missing now this thing is launching on
June 27th if you're watching this past
that then it's already out and available
now you can pre-order this at Newegg for
$49 but if you miss the pre-order it's
going to go up to about $90 for full
retail so it's got a hefty price tag to
it but it's also got a hefty amount of
features that I'm particularly fond of
so if you do a pre-order you get like a
50% discount on this which is a pretty
smokin deal if you ask me now if you
really like carbon fiber they actually
have a carbon version of this mouse
where the piano finished polished sides
are actually replaced with real carbon
fiber
not carbon fiber stimulate real carbon
fiber but it adds about 30 bucks to the
price of the mouse so there you go guys
EVGA is very first attempt at a gaming
mouse I really like it I like everything
about this mouse with the exception of
the polish finish personal preference
you guys may like that some people may
say it looks very reminiscent of other
mice on the market I tend to think the
overall idea of the mouse kind of
reminds me of the rat 7 from sideboard
but I hated that Mouse I'm just going to
say that now I hated the cyborg Mouse it
just felt clunky this one has no squish
or movement to it no creaking like the
cyborg products tend to creak I just did
not like my cyborg rat or my cyborg
joystick just wasn't so there you go
guys the EVGA torque x10 mouse look on

link to their website where you can
