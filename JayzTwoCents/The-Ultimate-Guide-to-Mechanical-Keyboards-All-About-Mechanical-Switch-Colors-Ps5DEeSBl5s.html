cents and today we're going to talk
about something that you tend to handle
and fondle and maybe get a little bit
intimate with and sometimes gets
downright dirty at your computer know
we're talking about mechanical key
switches your mind out of the gutter you
pervert
so today's video has been brought to you
by CM storm which is cooler masters
gaming line of PC peripherals it's
really cool stuff so you definitely want
to give those guys a big thanks for
supplying me the equipment and the
touchpad that I'm about to show you to
be able to educate you on exactly what
all the different switches man now when
it comes to gaming keyboards as nothing
as nice as finding that keyboard that
perfectly matches you that one that
feels just right it's got the right
weight it's got the right sound and a
lot of people seem to think that
mechanical switches is something new
when it comes to PC gaming and
peripherals I'm here to tell you that
it's not gaming keyboards are not new
when it comes to mechanical switches in
fact the mechanical switches have been
around for decades when it comes to
computer parts and computer components
they've been around since the 80s and
overtime manufacturers found cheaper
ways to cut costs and cut parts and
really get cheap when it comes to
keyboard generation and jeep keyboard
manufacturing because for the most part
people just use keyboards to input data
but now as we've evolved into gamers
we've decided to bring back the
mechanical switches to our keyboards and
over the last couple of years it's been
getting very confusing on making
keyboard purchases because there's so
many options out there people get
confused and they get a little bit
overwhelmed because they don't know what
all these different switches mean what
I've got in my hand right here is a
little keypad with six different colors
of Cherry MX switches now before we get
into the different tactile feedback and
the actuation points and all the other
lingo and jargon that we can talk about
when it comes to Cherry MX switches
let's go ahead and talk about what the
differences are between a mechanical
switch and a membrane switch now
membrane keyboards are very basic
you've got your key cap and you've got a
spring under there which makes it go up
and down and when you push down on the
key it pushes on a rubber dome that will
flatten out and it will make a
connection or bridge between a little
circuit underneath that key that tells a
piece of electronic to say hey the user
has just pushed key Y or key T or a or
whatever it may be now mechanical
switches on the other hand you have your
key cap that moves up and down on a
spring but you actually have a
mechanical mechanism in there that moves
back and forth to make a connection with
that circuitry so instead of having the
rubber dome and all the feedback of the
rub
and just dealing with a circuit board
you have a mechanical switch actually
clicking back and forth in there making
that connection now one of the things
that really sets mechanical switches
apart from membrane switches is the
activation point the activation point on
a membrane switch is when the key is
fully depressed because you're pushing
that key down and you're flattening out
that dome and making the connection on
the circuit board inside of the keyboard
when it comes to mechanical switches the
connection is made inside the switch so
not only do you most cases not have to
push the key all the way down many cases
the key doesn't even have to come all
the way back up before you can make
another key press and how to register
inside your computer so what happens
with a new mechanical keyboard owners
are someone who's never owned or typed
in a mechanical keyboard is they tend to
push down on the key way too hard
because they're used to having to push
the key all the way down to flatten out
that rubber dome inside of a membrane
keep that now with mechanical switches
that's not the case you can actually
push the key about halfway down and let
it come about halfway up
narration point is about in the middle
of the whole total movement of the key
so you don't have to sit there and push
the key all the way down you can just
kind of feather it and push it you know
right around a sweet spot but where that
sweet spot is on every single switch is
a bit different so we've talked about
membranes let's go ahead and talk about
the mechanical keypad and what it is you
need to know with the different colors
now there's a couple of things that
you're going to want to familiarize
yourself with really good really deep
and intimate I mean we're talking really
intimate when it comes to your
mechanical keyboard know what I'm saying
the first thing you want to get to know
is the weight of the switch or the
actuation weight of the switch and
that's always measured in grams but
there's also the description of the
actuation of the switch you've got
smooth you've got audible click tactile
bump and they all really describe the
way the switch feels as well as the
switch sounds now I'm going to do my
best in this video to really describe to
you what it is you get here with these
different switches even though you can't
feel it some of them you can hear some
of them you cannot now I'm going to go
through each one of these keys right now
and I'm going to give you the
description of these particular switches
by color as I've described in cm
university net which is cooler masters
awesome website giving you all sorts of
information about different types of
peripherals and arming you with
knowledge just like
I'm doing today so make sure you go and
check out that website now the most
common switch you'll find in mechanical
keyboards is the Cherry MX blue this is
the same switch that you find in almost
all razer keyboards you can find them at
corsair you can find them in CM storm
you can find them in a steel series
they're very very common now the Cherry
MX blue has a 50 gram switch and as you
could hear it is described as an audible
click with a tactile bump now what that
means is you have the click and you have
at the point of that click a bump so you
physically feel the button go over a
hump of some sort it it overcomes a
little resistance and that's when you
get the click so that's a cherry MX blue
now the next switch on here is the
Cherry MX brown this is becoming a much
more popular switch lately because it
gives you the same tactile bump as the
Cherry MX blue but it does it without
the audible click I'll go ahead and
demonstrate that now the next key on the
top here is the Cherry MX red and this
is probably quickly becoming one of the
fastest growing switches and most widely
used switches between mechanical
keyboards because they offer you a nice
feel but there's no tactile hump or bump
and there's no audible click it's just
one smooth motion back and forth now the
way the Cherry MX red is described is 45
grams actuation weight with a smooth
linear motion go and demonstrate that
now as you can see there is no hump and
no noise now a lot of people tend to
confuse the Cherry MX red as being a
loud switch because they come from a
membrane keyboard and as I mentioned
earlier in this video
membrane keyboards require typically a
harder push and a full compression of
the key which sounds like this so people
will mistake that sound as being the
switch but if you actually let the
switch be the only motion this is what
it sounds like what you're hearing is
the switch bottoming out that's what
most people tend to too with mechanical
keyboards until they get used to them
and start typing a little bit lighter
now the Cherry MX screen is pretty much
exclusive to the Coolermaster line of
keyboards but we'll go ahead and
demonstrate that
or you know it is basically the exact
same switch as the blue only it has an
80 gram activation weight versus a 50
gram actuation weight so it is quite a
bit heavier of a switch so you have to
push it a little bit harder and because
of that you get a little bit different
sound on the click this is cherry MX
screen this is blue green blue will go
back and forth I want you to listen the
Green has a little bit deeper sound than
the blue the blue is a little bit higher
the green is a little bit lower it might
be hard to pick up on the mic but take
my word for it it's a little bit
different sound and it is definitely a
lot harder to press now the next key
that we have here is the Cherry MX clear
now the Cherry MX clear essentially is
the same switch as the brown only it has
a 55 gram actuation weight versus a 45
gram actuation weight of the brown so
it's the same switch it just takes a
little bit more force to activate and
just like the brown it has the tactile
bump and it has no audible click as you
can see right here you can hear the fact
that it has that bump but it doesn't
click like the blue of the green blue
and green Brown are clear and here's
brown so it's got a hump and you can
actually hear the hump but it doesn't
click like blue and grain now the last
key we have on here is the Cherry MX
black and it's essentially the exact
same switch as the red only it has a 60
gram actuation weight versus a 45 gram
of the red and just like the red it's
advertised as smooth linear no click no
tactile hump check it out perfectly
smooth no hump like the clear has a hump
and the Green has a clique now this is a
really cool tool that gives you a really
good idea of what it is that mechanical
keys are actually doing now of course I
can only bring you so much experience to
the power of a video here on YouTube but
hopefully this video is shed some light
on what mechanicals key switches are how
they work and how they're classified but
the most common switches as I mentioned
going to find are going to be blue brown
and red and on the bottom you've got the
green which is going to be exclusive to
coolermaster clear and black more
companies are starting to use black now
because I think they just like the way
it sounds right now I'm not sure oh and
last but not least if you want to own
one of these you can go to cooler
masters website and you can buy this for
$15 but here's the cool part about this
you're going 15 bucks why do I want this
little keypad for 15 bucks so am I going
to do with it you're going to take it
you're gonna play with it the keypad got
the keypad family show family show stop
giggling okay you're going to take this
here and determine which key it is you
like you're then going to go over to
coolermaster if you buy a cooler master
keyboard they're going to give you a
$15.00 credit if you show them proof of
purchase of this keypad so in the end
you get the keyboard for the same price
and you get to keep the little keypad
show all your friends and you get to be
the cool guy that has the keypad that
really doesn't do anything but I think
it's totally worth it because the only
way you can make an informed decision
honestly is to try them all out guys I
really hope this video has helped you
understand mechanical keyboards because
it can be definitely very hard to make
that decision when it comes to
mechanical keyboards there's just six
keys is a lot because you you have to
feel them all out and I want to bring
you this video to give you the
information and the education that you
need to arm yourself with being a smart
buyer especially with Christmas coming
around we've got so much stuff we're
getting ready to review on the channel
we've got the coolermaster stealth
mechanical keyboard we've got the
ultimate the Quickfire ultimate
mechanical keyboard this is a brown
switch this is a red switch I've also
got the k70 video that I've already done
and hopefully we'll be doing more
keyboards in the future making you guys
a smart holiday buyer this season so if
you guys have enjoyed this video and you
think this video will
anybody you know what to do with it you
can hit that share button if you stumble
across my channel check out some other
videos and I certainly hope you stick
around I'll see you guys next time and
as always see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
