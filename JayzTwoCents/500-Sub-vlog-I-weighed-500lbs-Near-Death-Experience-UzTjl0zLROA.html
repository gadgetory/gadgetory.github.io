is gonna be a bit random just go ahead
and put a nerd mode back hey guys this
is a bit different I'm not even looking
at you there you are I see you now so
this is a bit different I'm in my
natural habitats surrounded by computers
and phones and knick-knack E's and stuff
even though I already put out game
addiction today I decided it's important
that I put out this video because during
the weekend I hit my first milestone two
months ago when I set out with this
channel I said if I hit 500 subs that
would be amazing
and on Saturday I think it was Saturday
I crossed that mark unfortunately with
how busy I am I have a very crazy
schedule I never have any time to think
half the time today as of making this
video to say thank you for subscribing
to me which I don't I don't know why I
don't know why you did that you guys
need to find better ways to spend your
time than listening to me talk about
technology and games and stuff like that
actually I don't mean that you need to
say subscribed and stuff to me huh Jesus
I am so out of breath so anyway I wanted
to do a vlog to say thank you so much
for subscribing to me and bringing me to
538 so it's because by the time I got
around to this 38 more of you subscribed
and more than 32 thousand views on my
channel in just over two months
that's from zero zero to five thirty
eight and thirty two thousand and some
change and growing I get all of your
comments and all of your feedback and
all of your subscriptions and all of
your messages sent to my phone and I
have my phone set on a 15 minute site
to check for email every 15 minutes and
every single 15 minutes there are
updates from YouTube from subscribers
and messages and comments and I think
it's very important for me to try and
comment and reply to every message that
sent to me and in the beginning that was
really easy because there wasn't very
many of you but that's growing and if
I've missed a comment from you I
apologize send it to me in a message if
you want if you need advice for me if
you sent me a question just keep sending
it to me if I don't give you a response
because it's actually starting to get a
lot more popular than I thought I would
and for only 538 subs it's amazing that
I get at least a hundred messages a day
between all of my videos and Inbox and
all of that and Twitter on top of all of
that we're talking 100 messages a day at
least and I think one day when I put out
my Samsung vs. iPhone video that's my
most popular video today it's gonna hit
probably eight thousand views tonight
and it's only been up since
see that ding-ding is a sound I set for
YouTube specifically in the last 15
minutes I got seven more
so I'm trying guys if you're sending me
messages I'm really trying to get you
the answers to the questions that you
have but I'm rambling again I really
want to thank in pushing me to make a
youtube channel that first person is
going to be holiday doc I know you guys
have heard me mention him a lot I met
him a few months back when he came into
my live stream on Twitch I only had a
couple of viewers he put out a tweet
mixing I know I had 30 or 40 and that
kind of gave me my start because that's
where people said hey you're kind of fun
to watch and I went well maybe there's
something to this but I didn't think I
had anything to bring to YouTube
whatsoever so I told doc now no I don't
want to do YouTube I'm not interested in
YouTube I don't I'm not interesting
enough not funny I'm not an expert and
you know you know many of you would say
I'm an expert in technology but I'm just
like anybody else you know I'm an
average schmuck who works in technology
for a living as an IT engineer but you
know I'm not perfect and I get things
wrong from time to time
but he told me no dude seriously just do
it put it out there what do you got to
lose so next thing I know I've got 10
subscribers 15 20 30 40 and it just kept
going and going and next thing I know
Yosh was willing to partner me so I went
ahead and did the partnership and from
there I just keep growing and it's just
amazing but I thought how can I say you
know thank you and it done to me there's
something I've been wanting to share in
the community because my old channel I'm
not even gonna bother linking it because
it's just it's not even worth looking at
I had started a weight loss blog because
you see well many of you may not realize
as I'm constantly calling myself fat
because I am a chunky dude I'm six foot
four and I'm 290 pounds I'm a big guy
I'm huge so I'm a big guy but what you
guys probably don't know about me as I
used to weigh 500 pounds yeah five zero
zero I was a big guy so when you're that
big as you can imagine you know you're
constantly ridiculed both socially
mentally at you can't escape what comes
along with being that big whether it's
in public at work whatever you're
humiliated all the
in fact before I get into this story I'm
gonna go ahead a picture and this is
this was me in 2008 I recall a time that
I was at a restaurant and I was getting
lunch it was that I was at work but I
went to lunch and I'm eating my food and
I couldn't sit in a booth he could boots
were out I had to sit on a chair and it
had to be a chair without arms because I
was too wide I was far too wide I was a
62 waist and a 5x shirt and I remember
this woman kind of off behind me saying
talking talking to her kid and telling
him how important it was to make sure he
eats his vegetables and stuff because he
was you know not wanting to eat the
healthy stuff on his plate and I
remember her sick I remember clearly her
saying do you see that man over there do
you want to look like that man eat your
vegetables and at that point it's like
I'm just sitting here minding my own
business and now I'm an example a
negative example to some stranger I had
to make a life change and you know here
we are in 2012 and I'm down to 290
pounds so I've lost a lot of weight I
work out regularly my wife works out
more than I do she's the one that's
turned into a gym fanatic but I lift
weights religiously and because I'm
really trying to bulk up to fill out you
know some of the looseness that is in my
body still I decided to go ahead and
share this information when I have a
small viewership because you early
subscribers are the one who basically
showed that you have interest in me so I
wanted to give you a little bit of
feedback about who I am and where I come
from and you know this that's not
something to be sad about you know and
one other story that made me really
decide that I had to change my lifestyle
was in the end of 2008 actually
September 25th 2008 to be exact I look
like the photo that I showed and why
wife was one month pregnant we had just
found out that she was pregnant with my
daughter and so I went to work and when
I was a field rep for the company I
worked for and I had to travel to and
from various parts of Los Angeles and
one day I was
driving to work and was on the freeway
and you know Los Angeles traffic is a
lot of stop and go and gridlock and I
was sitting there stopped in traffic
perfectly stopped when and f350 doing
about 55 miles per hour slammed into the
back of my car and here's a photo of
that what I remember most about that one
I was hit so hard now this size that I
was ended up upside down in my seat my
head was where your butt would go and my
legs were on the dash of the car I did a
back flip in the car I was hit so hard
at that size just the sheer physics of
it don't even seem possible but that's
what happened but I what I remember most
from that traumatic experience you know
as your memory gets all screwed up with
some that traumatic was the fact that it
took eight firefighters to lift me up
onto the gurney and that was after they
had to remove me from the car and cut
off all of my clothes I'm laying there
in the middle of the freeway granted
they made like a box with their fire
trucks and ambulances and stuff because
there were four cars totaled in this
wreck I was shoved into a whole mess of
cars and the car was just mangled as you
can see but I'm laying there in the
middle of the freeway they had to shut
down most of the freeway because of this
accident they take scissors and they cut
off my clothes and I'm a 500-pound man
laying there buck-ass naked on the
freeway and they put a medical tarp over
my privates and you know then it took
eight of them to lift me up in the
gurney and then on the ambulance ride to
the trauma center the gurney
has these wheels lock in to the floor
and there's like locks for the wheels
that kept coming unhooked because I was
just too heavy for this thing so you
have the paramedics and firefighters
inside this LA County paramedic unit
struggling to keep me locked in and they
were so occupied with that they weren't
able to do any treatment on me until I
got to the trauma center so I was like
okay enough is enough it's time to do
something and it's time to lose some
weight so you know Here I am today
and I'm still struggling with some of
the the social
Karami that comes with being a guy
that's that big because mentally in my
mind I'm still that fat you know it's
just it's what it is you know that's
weird so don't be sad about that I hope
that wasn't a depressing story I just
wanted to share something intimate with
you guys because you guys have given me
a lot of your time and I'm gonna do the
best I can to keep the channel growing
and I'm gonna try and keep bringing you
exciting content and I hope to hear from
you guys so check out game addiction I
