gonna kick off my rise in the second
generation coverage with some
overclocking a little bit of a guide
more or less taking you guys along for
the ride
because we got some new features here
with Rison 2nd gen I want to kind of
test out we've obviously got some faster
speeds especially with the 2700 X I want
to see whether or not these faster
speeds have reduced the amount of
overclocking Headroom we have or if we
can still maximize even more potential
out of these CPUs so today we're gonna
we're gonna test all of this we're gonna
test some cooling we're gonna see how
this thing does in Cinebench and then
yeah I guess we're just gonna kind of
see what happens we're gonna take you
guys along for that ride today's video

let's talk about the hardware we're
using we're using a 2700 X we are using
an asus crosshair 7 hero motherboard
which is obviously an X 470 chipset we
need even though these chips could be
installed on X 370 we need X 470 to take
full advantage of some of the features
we want to try out today for cooling or
running a Celsius s30 Citroen fractal
design it's got three 120 millimeter
fans it's PWM controlled so we can
control the speed pretty easily it
integrates seamlessly with the
motherboard and we're running 16
gigabytes of g.skill Sniper X memory
which is again rise and optimized and
it's rated at 3400 megahertz
I believe CL 15 is as tight as the
timing can go but we're gonna play
around with a little bit of that as well
some of the other things I want to test
out is Rison first-generation was
extremely dependent on memory speed
we're quite often there was more of a
performance gain to be had by
overclocking your memory as fast as
possible then rather than touching the
core speed at all in fact I believe Gabe
Nexxus did a very in-depth video showing
leaving the core speed where it was and
increasing the memory speed was a direct
benefit to the infinity fabric which
showed more regains in performance and
results both in gaming as well as
synthetic benchmarks and even real-world
tasks like Adobe and blender and stuff
like that then touching the core clock
but AMD Rises on 2nd gen talks about
more efficiency and better latency when
it comes to memory interacting with the
CPU so that may not be as much of the
case this time so that's something that
I definitely want to check now the
reason why I'm using Cinebench r15 is
because it's free
it's consistent and it's something that
you guys can download on your own and
actually share your results so if you
want to follow along download city bench
r15 doesn't matter what hardware you're
using just download it run your tests
and in the comments below once you guys
put in there your system specs and what
your score was that way we can all see
exactly how we're kind of comparing to
one another especially if you're
considering getting rise in 2nd gen and
you're currently on 1st gen share those
figures so that you can see whether or
not it's even worth upgrading from first
gen or not so with that said let's go
ahead and start tinkering now got Ryze
and master open here but I'm gonna be
using the Asus BIOS to actually do all
of my overclocking I'm kind of old
school and that I don't like using
software that's built into the OS do my
overclocking I want it to happen at the
ground level of everything that's
happening with the system but the reason
why I'm even got I've even got rise in
master openness for two reasons one I
want to check out the temperatures and
two I want to see what's happening with
the core clock so you can see here
they're all kind of bouncing around on
the 1800 X you would have one core that
would jump up to 4 gigahertz and the
rest would state about 3600 megahertz
under load and that's because it wasn't
overclocking all of the the course but
what's happening now with the new
algorithm here is it's actually
smoothing out those cores where instead
of having one that's pegged and the rest
kind of running at their base clock
you're running more of them closer to
the turbo clock based on things like
over power draw Headroom as well as
temperature Headroom so it's all on its
own without us touching anything that is
already dynamically adjusting itself to
try and get the most performance out of
it now there's other features built into
motherboards that can handle this that
can do it automatically so if you're
doing overclocking you want to make sure
that those
are turned off as well but it's
important to note that we are sitting
exactly in the factory settings that are
coming from BIOS I don't believe the
core enhancements turned on but we'll
take a look at that when we get into the
into the BIOS but that's one to sort of
show show this right here where it's
gonna jump all around between 4.1 and
4.2 depending on the type of load that
were under and how much power is being
drawn so let's go into our base run here
I'm going to do two runs one with the
Rison master open to see temperatures
and then I'm gonna close it because
risin master does give a little bit of a
hit to performance so we got the test
running on the background you can see
we're sitting at 46 C 47 48 48 and a
half looks like we're gonna sit right
about 48.5 C which is obviously giving
us tons of temperature Headroom we don't
even have these fans running Macs yet if
we take a look at our score here as soon
as this is done we got a 1617 and again
that was with Ryze and master open so
I'm gonna close this now and I'm gonna
go ahead and run this one more time to
see there's any improvement okay so
jumped up a little bit to 1628 not a
great score not a terrible score but
considering everything is factory
nothing has been touched that's actually
pretty good now temperatures are
actually doing really well as well it's
also important to note I should have
said this earlier make sure your desktop
performance mode is set to high
performance you're running all the
latest BIOS all the latest drivers which
of course we are so that's important to
note so yes we're gonna save this result
and now we're gonna go ahead and reboot
into BIOS so here's what our base
settings look like we've got a frequency
of 30 700 megahertz because that's the
base clock on this one our temps are
sitting at about 34 not bad cuz hearing
BIOS puts a small load on base clock 100
that's normal core voltage is actually
pretty high i'm surprised they put this
much voltage to it factory 1.46 - that's
a lot of volts and then our ratios 37 so
the reason why you get that clock is
it's a base clock times the ratio gives
you that number so 100 times 37 or 3700
as you can see our memories at 21 33
voltage at 1.2 and then our capacity is
16 gigabytes so we're gonna go over here
to the extreme Tweaker and no that's not
because it's legal in California now
that's just with the calling it a
overclock tuner we're going to set
to manual that means we don't want it
doing anything for us you could see
there's all these different preset over
clocks Auto default manual we're just
gonna set it to manual because we want
control of everything we're gonna leave
it in synchronous mode this is something
kind of new image asynchronous mode and
asynchronous mode for the sake of
simplicity we're gonna keep it as
synchronous we're gonna sync everything
and we're gonna leave our beat clock
frequency at 100 could have left it at
Auto but I just like to type it in
performance enhancer we're gonna leave
that at Auto actually set it to default
I don't know exactly what its gonna
increase it says right here maintain
booths frequencies longer resulting in
higher performance level 3 and 4
overclock settings which might not work
with all CPUs so again we don't want any
automated overclocking we want to
control this now our CPU core ratio I'm
gonna set this to 40 we're gonna go
straight to 4 gigahertz I don't think
we're gonna have any problems running
that our performance bias set to auto
set to none we don't want to have any
Cinebench 15 automatic you know
overclocking helped in their memory
frequency we're gonna leave the memory
like I said I want to test and see what
happens if we overclock frequency for
CPU or overclock frequency for memory
and then do the two together and see if
anything could be combined for our best
results so I'm testing to see if we're
seeing good improvements without
touching memory first for performance
boost so to auto I guess I automatically
overclock the CPU and DRAM to enhance
system performance we're gonna disable
that because we don't want it doing that
for us as I've said a bunch of times
we're leave our voltage where it's at I
I feel it's kind of high but I want to
see what Auto voltage does if we go too
high on volts then it might reduce our
clocks because again it's looking for
things like temperature and power draw
if it draws too much power then we're
gonna have a problem okay so we jumped
up to seventeen hundred and sixty-nine
so I'm gonna go ahead and save this I'm
gonna open rise and master we're gonna
do it again because I again I want to
see what the cores are doing and I want
to see what our temperature is doing is
I'm gonna start the test and with rising
master open you can see everything is
just sitting at four gigahertz our
temperatures rose a couple of degrees
we're sitting at fifty point two five C
so obviously we still have a lot of
overclocking Headroom but I look at our
core voltage under load it dropped down
to 1.30 and I assume that's going to
because of light
load calibration so we're gonna do now
is just keep incremental e increasing
our multiplier until we get a crash at
stocked voltage if we get a crash at
stock voltage then what we'll do is
we'll try playing with the voltage a
little bit to see exactly where we can
get it to kind of come back to life
without pumping too much voltage in it
because then the temperatures will just
climb exponentially well go 241 all
cores and do it again 4.1 past our score
jumped up to 1803 and our voltage jumped
up to 1.3 5 which meant our temperature
came up a little bit higher as well our
max temp hit about 56 C so we saw about
6 Celsius of increased temperature just
by going from one point three to one
point three five again the voltage is
auto and we just passed four point one
so I'm gonna keep going and see where we
crash so here we are running for point
two and it went immediately to one point
four five so auto voltage is obviously
starting to add a lot of voltage so we
definitely want to keep an eye on
temperatures our temperatures also shot
up to about 62 C and our score came up
to 1829 again that's with Rison master
running to see with our test going right
now our temp came up to sixty two sixty
three sixty three point seven five sixty
four so it's definitely getting warm now
the air coming through the radiator is
not hot at all this is just the amount
of heat that's immediately inside that
process just because the amount of
voltage that we're pumping to it the
fact that it even stops right there
shows that our a IO is definitely doing
a good job when I tried this with the
prism cooler it immediately went up to a
DC which started to deal with throttling
so that's something we don't want but as
you can see the score is doing great
1835 and I'm gonna run it again here
with Rhys and master closed so I can see
if that score improves at all one thing
I want to point out too is I have all
the air that's coming through the
radiator which is actually still very
cool blowing directly on the vrm and the
memory so it's blowing on to the
motherboard normally in an open
environment like this you don't have
proper airflow over the motherboard and
we certainly do so look at that I came
up to 1860 we gained almost 30 points
right there by shutting down dry zen
master so when you're doing your tests
and stuff run it once with it open to
check your voltages and your
temperatures and then close it and run
your test again and you see you can
improve quite a bit so here we are 4.3
Hertz it went to 1.5 volts immediately
which shot us to about 71 or 72 C at max
load so you can see we are starting to
get to the point to where even an AI Oh
like this is not gonna be able to
transfer heat fast enough because it's
so focused inside that 12 nanometer
process but a score jumped up to an 1887
once again with Rison master open so I'm
gonna run this one more time when it
closed and see if we get another jump
over 1900 on this would be amazing and
remember we haven't even touched memory
yet I could not get my 1800 X anywhere
near this and we are running 4.3 yeah
1902 1902 with it with resin master off
that's insane so I'm not feeling too
confident though that 4.4 is going to
pass or make it past Cinebench I I have
a feeling it will make it into the into
the operating system no problem but I'm
not feeling confident that we're gonna
actually get a 4.4 all core overclocked
to complete a Cinebench run but well so
far it's only still showing 1.5 volts
but we are running 4.4 all the way
across is the test gonna even go nope it
immediately crashed system lock right
there I'm not gonna give it any more
voltage so I'm gonna say 4.3 on a very
brute force non-surgical method of
overclocking by just increasing our
multiplier is gonna be where we're gonna
call it a day at least on the CPU so now
we need to put that everything back to
factory and overclock our ram and see if
anything is improved so I'm gonna save
I'm gonna actually put this back to 4.3
and we're gonna save this right because
we don't want have to go through all
over this all over again so we're
profile name is 43 we're gonna save it
to profile 1 there we go so we can call
these settings back up later optimize
defaults restart our BIOS we're gonna
leave everything on auto again and then
we're gonna overclock our RAM to the
rated speed of this which is 30 400
megahertz so with everything on fact
we're gonna go to a i/o overclocked
tuner because this is where we can
actually load up our memory speeds right
here so if you see now it wants to go to
ddr4 3401 16 16 16 36 yes
at one point 3 5 volts so that's our
memory
overclock remember all ddr4 runs at 2133
unless you go in and overclock it and
the rated speed of the memory is
actually an overclock on top of what the
base ddr4 is so if you forgot that
remember if you've put memory in your
system and just left it you're probably
not running at max speed so you can go
in there and check that so we are
running at 3400 maegor's 1628 was what
we ran at the 3.7 gigahertz all stock
clock before and there probably will be
a little bit of an improvement here the
question is gonna be how much how much
whoa it jumped all the way to 1819
immediately so it went from a 1628 to an
1819 like just like that the question is
now can we run the chorus beads that we
were seeing with the memory speed being
overclocked as well one thing that kind
of sucks as it accidentally removed my
original score which was a 1669 I think
it was but what I want to check right
here is I want to see exactly what's
happening with the cores because
remember I talked about that since MI
where it's going to dynamically adjust
its own core speed and stuff I have a
feeling we're probably we're getting
faster core speeds anyway so I'm testing
that right now at the 3600 and no our
cores are down to 4,000 25 which was
exactly what they were when I showed you
guys on the first test so that's not
something that has taken into account
right here I'm gonna go ahead and stop
this test because I don't want to save
that one so he jumped up to 1840 at
3,600 memory so now we're just gonna
keep bumping up the memory like we'd
have a CPU and see how far we can get
3,800 boot looping yeah memory sending
said boo reset due to failure all right
so 3,600 it is I'm not going to be
adding any more voltage to the memory so
what we're gonna do now is we are going
to go ahead and just reboot at 3,600 and
we're gonna start adding more voltage so
I'm gonna go straight to 4.1 because we
know it's already running at four point
zero to five so I'm gonna try going
straight to four point one memory clock
is running at 1,800 so that is 36 works
for me but our temperatures like that
came back down to 20
or our previous 4.1 it look at that 1866
so we already gained 26 points by
overclocking at seventy-five megahertz
seventy-five megahertz with that memory
speed remember we were running 4.0 to
five on the original test seventy-five
megahertz just gave us twenty six points
remember the higher we go at the core
clock the more stress we put on that
memory controller like I was just saying
so interesting we might have to drop it
back to 3400 then the question is if
we're at thirty four hundred and forty
two hundred megahertz on the cpu is that
gonna balance out or do we still get our
max performance with stock memory at
four point three I'm gonna try apply I
don't really recommend this but I'm
gonna try applying it's a tiny bit more
memory voltage one point three six let's
try that see if that helps a little bit
so it is 1800 and we're running at four
point two perfect let's do this
so our last test was in 1866 we've got
to beat in 1866 1900 we are two points
behind where we were with overclocking
just the CPU but we are a significant
less voltage as well in less Heat
all right so we're gonna try four point
three again at the thirty six hundred
megahertz this is where he just failed
but we added a little bit more voltage
to the memory but what I find really
kind of interesting is the fact that we
got this huge initial jump by going to
the faster Ram but then as we
overclocked our CPU after that we got
very small jumps to where now even with
fast RAM and the CPU clock at nearly
where it was before we were at right the
same just the same number only a
difference of two but it looks like
we're gonna actually pass this test
nineteen hundred and thirty three I know
I can't do 4.4 I wasn't able to get 4.4
with just a CPU of without overclocking
the memory and even by putting more
voltage into the memory we couldn't boot
thirty eight hundred so this is we're
getting our hands on some 4000 megahertz
memory it would probably be fun and
maybe we'll revisit that but if you look
at here on the left you can see our
intervals of the way things were kind of
leapfrogging along the way but obviously
our single biggest jump was running our
rated memory speed and Rison still takes
huge huge advantage of it but it seems
like obviously doing a mixture of CPU
and men
Marie gave us the best results at 1933
so yeah this obviously isn't a complete
stability test we need to run all sorts
of different tests to make sure that
we're fully stable but at least right
now we're stable for Cinebench r15 guys
thanks for coming along today I'll
probably do this with some of the lower
end CPUs as well but I just wanted to
kind of see what kind of potential we
had with rise n2 on its new 12 nanometer
process and you know if you if this
isn't the kind of thing you want to
tinker with you could leave the core
enhancement and the sense mi features
turned on and then just go in turn on
either it's gonna be called XMP or do CT
memory flip that one switch and you see
that you can get a huge improvement all
right guys I'm gonna go if you've got
any other suggestions of things you'd
like to see with Rison second generation
let me know and I will try my best to do
those tests but as always guys your
views are appreciated around here thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
