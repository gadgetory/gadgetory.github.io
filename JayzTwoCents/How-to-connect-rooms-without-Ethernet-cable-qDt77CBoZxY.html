now the other day at Fry's Electronics I
picked these up and I don't remember
exactly what I paid I want to say that
the wireless AC 1200 was about 30 or 35
bucks and then the tp-link powerline
adapter I want to say was about $79 but
this has the 3 port gigabit pass-through
on it so it's basically like a switch as
well now the question when it comes to
installing powerline adapters is where
in the house does it need to be plugged
in now personally I feel that powerline
adapters should be plugged in as close
to where you want to get the internet as
possible so it doesn't have to travel so
far through the power system the way
that these work is they turn an outlet
into an extension of your network so
these will communicate with each other
through the power outlets and you have
one that has a source and one that
becomes a feed so the source gets
plugged into an Ethernet or your router
or a switch or whatever it's you know
your source of internet's going to be
and then one of these will be outputting
to in my case the test bench that i have
behind me now one of the reasons why I
never really had good success with these
in the past was the quality of wire
inside of your home is what really is
going to determine how well these things
work now it does say up to 1200 you know
Mbps but the thing is there's a lot of
factors that can
really differentiate how much speed
you're going to get how much noise is
there inside the line how much
interference is there other you know is
it near microwaves I mean there's a lot
of things that can actually cause
interference that really slows that down
and can give you lots of intermittent
you know in and out when it comes to you
know the actual quality of the signal
being sent to the power line now the
same thing can actually be said for the
wireless you know how far is the
wireless have to go what's in between it
are there a lot of walls is there a lot
of electro interference how many
wireless are in your area we already
covered that in a different video so
there's a lot of plus and minus too both
of these systems when it comes to
getting internet in a place where you
don't already have it the cool thing
about the powerline starter kits though
is they come with everything that you
need at least in this case here it comes
with the two powerline adapters as well
as two Ethernet cables so that you have
one for either end it's advertised it's
really good for you know 4k uhd
streaming that's obviously going to
depend on your service provider that has
a huge bearing on 4k streaming but it
says it uses the latest AV 2 standard
which they call future-proof your
network obviously there's no such thing
as truly future-proofing but I went with
this one because it has pretty much
everything I wanted it's got the extra
outlet on it it's got a built-in three
port gigabit switch inside each one
which is going to kind of solve to you
know issues that I had I didn't want to
use up a plug so this is going to give
me plug pass-through and it's going to
give me a switch in another room that
actually wanted to be able to hook up
more than one ethernet in there now I
decided that I'm going to go ahead and
plug the source into the baby's room
which is actually right above here and
over just a little bit so there's only
one wall between and I think that that's
going to give me the shortest route
between the plugs where I'm not going to
have anything really happening in
between again I wouldn't want to plug
this in on the other end of the house
where the ethernet and the switch is
simply because there's a lot the entire
house between there and here when it
comes for there to be interference and
noise in the line and because this house
is already pre-wired for Ethernet I'm
fortunate to where I can do that but if
you have a home that does not have pre
wired Ethernet then you're really going
to have to think about you know the best
place to install this and might try
different plugs in your
home by running you know an Ethernet
cable to it and seeing it to get any
better performance but anyways we're
going to do we're going to go ahead and
load up the powerline adapter we're
going to get this thing online and then
we are going to load up the wireless and
compare the two and see which gave us
the best results transition so the
installation was stupidly easy it was
literally plug-and-play plug it into
power on one end plug that in into
Ethernet plug in the other side over
here into where you want Internet and
then plug that into the device in this
case my test bench so I've got a 60 by
for internet connection so that's the
baseline here that we're going to see if
I'm getting that whole internet
connection so let's go ahead and see
so my ping was 16 but as you can see it
kind of stuttered there on the start but
then it got us our entire you can see
out there I'm getting 65 megabit down so
I'm getting a little bit of bonus there
from my ISP now my upload is 4 so let's
see if I'm getting my full 4 yeah pretty
much sitting like 3.9 there's 4 so we're
getting it yeah so so far I'd say the
powerline adapter in this house is
working pretty damn good but I think
that might have something to do with
where I placed it it's as close to this
room as I could get it well the other
thing to do now is to try out the
wireless
so just to recap this is the d-link I
picked up the AC 1200 it does advertise
it it's a 300 megabit + 867 megabit so
it's giving us our dual band 2.4 and 5
gigahertz Wireless so we're going to go
ahead and install this now and see if
it's giving us max speed if it does then
I guess we've got some discussion here
don't we well the wireless adapters
installed that took all of 45 seconds
because it's so easy on a test bench
slowed up the drivers and see what we
get I think I'm going to get full
internet connection here but you know
got to complete the test all right we're
on the wireless now the wireless 5
gigahertz I'm only getting 3 out of 5
bars on the wireless here which is kind
of interesting considering I've got that
router placed where I thought was pretty
ideal let's go ahead and see how the
speed goes
selecting best server again based on
ping ping here 16 but look at the speed
though you can see the wireless is
sitting right around 15 16 17 on the 5
gigahertz band we're down to 2 bars of 5
though but part of that issue here I
think quite honestly as I've already
shown in my other video is there are a
ton of wireless networks here so you can
see we're only getting a quarter of the
speed that we were getting with the
powerline adapter and the ping is the
same the upload will probably be fine
will probably at the full for barely
three point seven three point eight
there's our four Wow okay so let me jump
on the 2.4 gigahertz and see what
happens
so rather than for you guys here I just
went ahead and jump forward you can see
we got thirty point six nine down and
we're getting the full four up on the
2.4 well I guess those results kind of
speak for themselves don't they well
guys I think those results kind of speak
for themselves clearly I was wrong when
I said that I thought that the wireless
here would be the better solution
clearly with this shop being on the
first floor and a lot of house above it
and the wireless still having quite a
few walls to go through 5 gigahertz
couldn't deliver in 2.4 gigahertz only
gave me half what my actual bandwidth is
capable of here with my ISP so clearly
in this case powerline worked perfectly
it didn't give me any additional ping
then my other system is 16 pings seems
to be kind of normal sometimes I'm under
10 but then again you know it is what it
is I'm doing the best I can with what
I've got but I got the full 60 in fact
65 by 4 when it came to the powerline
adapter now the quality of powerline
adapter is going to matter if you get a
cheap powerline adapter you were going
to get cheap results and there's a lot
of articles out there that talk about
powerline adapters the top 10 best ones
that you can get but I think what the
biggest factor here is going to be when
it comes to powerline adapters is not
how fast your internet is it's going to
be the quality of the wiring in your
home and one of the reasons why I had a
terrible result with powerline adapters
in the past was as I mentioned the other
house I lived in where I tried using it
five years ago was
built in 1963 over 50 years old 53 years
old and the wiring in that house is
original so that says a lot about it and
obviously being in a much newer home
built in 2004 the wiring matter so if
you're in a really old home with poorly
insulated powerlines and you are going
to have a lot of things hooked up to it
a lot in between it to where you put it
in your home doesn't matter as well if
you've got a lot of interference between
the two boxes that can be a problem as
well things like turning on microwaves
can create big issues but it's working
perfectly for me so it's definitely
something worth checking out if you
think that the wiring in your home can
support it and you just don't have any
other choice I don't like being tethered
down to a wire but then again it's a
test bed to stop me moving around a
whole lot so it worked perfectly for me
anyway guys thanks for watching today's
video you guys requested it I went ahead
and did it and I'm glad I listened
because I'd be sitting out here with
wireless going oh I wish you had a
boudreaux Turner connection when all
along you guys would be like well Jay if
you weren't being such a dick hole and
you actually listened to what we were
telling you you would have better
internet connection well I did and I've
got a really good connection here out
here in the shop so thanks for
suggesting it guys I'm glad I did it let
me know what you guys thought of today's
video and as always thanks for watching
and I will see you in the next video
don't forget Scottevest comm /j I love
this hoodie this hoodie is freaking
amazing alright guys see you the next
