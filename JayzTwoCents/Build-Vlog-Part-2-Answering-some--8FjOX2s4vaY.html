part 2 of project skunk works actually
just finished up Tech Talk a little bit
ago watched a movie with the wife and
the kid and I can't go any farther with
this build until I start tearing things
out of the nine hundred d but I don't
want the nine hundred D to be down in
the mean time so what I'm going to be
doing is pulling out the water-cooling
stuff and putting in some air cooling
stuff and then I'm going to be taking
one of these graphics cards up here
probably just the 760 in the mean time
and sticking that in there and one of
the things that I'm regularly asked is
how do you get the fluid out of your
system
well my way is kind of crude I'm not
using any valves in this build like I
was in red mist but if you take a look
down here you can kind of see I've got
this long fitting right here with this
extension on it I basically just lay
this case upside down so all the air
will travel to the highest point in the
loop which will be that point and then I
unscrew the fitting slowly the air will
basically be resting right here again
the case will be kind of upside down and
then I just screw in this hose with this
fitting which I then just stick that and
in the bottle so it's not the best way
of bleeding your system but it does give
me at least something that I can do so
tonight's plan before you move on to
some more the build tomorrow is we're
going to pull out the graphics cards
we're going to pull out the pumps that
are down there you can't really see them
and we're going to pull out the
radiators so let's go ahead and get
started so you can see I had the case
laying on its back right now pretty much
all of the air has left the reservoir
well most of it anyway you can kind of
see the long bubble there most of the
air is going to be sitting up here
however they're still going to be some
leakage when I undo this little fitting
cap right here so I'm going to go ahead
and put some paper towels around here
and then we'll open it up and see if we
can't get to our fitting attached
right there for bleeding and then once
it's on there I just stand it back up
and everything will basically piss right
on out of there
all right we go perfect I don't even
think we lost a drop of coolant on there
see yep
now all we do is go ahead and thread
this bad boy in there that will be good
to go now for the least amount of like
leakage you want to go ahead and stick
the hose in the hole prior to well you
know go ahead and give you guys a little
physics lesson here you may or may not
realize nothing is actually coming out
of here
the reason for that is we have a sealed
reservoir up top so before anything can
come out into the fill or the bottle
here you have to allow air in fluid
can't actually leave until we allow air
in so that's why I actually have that
fitting right up there on the top so the
moment I release that little cap
everything will pretty much come rushing
out so that's how I believe my systems
and there we go cap out and now my
computer is basically taking a leak now
we're gonna have to tilt it around a bit
to get all the fluid out of there but
there you go
there's J's a drain lesson how to how to
drain your tube yeah all right there it
is we're completely bled there's the
empty system who's coming apart that's
okay because that one's going to be way
cooler I think what kind of sucks most
about doing these types of system swaps
is there's just a very particular order
that they have to happen in I have to
take things out of this system at a
certain order and move them over there
in a certain order so it gets a little
bit hectic hectic especially when I
don't want to be down without the system
for very long so what I'm gonna do next
if I guys you see the camera here there
we go is I'm going to pull up the
graphics
Bard's pull off the CPU block and get an
air cooler on there and pull out the
radiators and the pumps the pumps are
down in there not sure you can even see
those but they're down on the bottom
there and we're gonna get those cleaned
up because these fans and this I'm gonna
use the top four eighty actually it's
the newest radiator these fans are
really filthy I've got to switch out the
fan rings I want to pull out the
extension cables and then pretty much I
think that might be as far as we get
tonight maybe I'll get the graphics card
to put in the other motherboard and
we'll go from there maybe get the
crystal link I guess we'll call it a
crystal link but it's just the acrylic
tubing between the graphics cards we'll
get that ready to go with the Primo
chill fittings so let's go and get that
done I guess enough talking come on J
stop talking do some work would ya well
the graphics cards are out and the top
480 radiators out certainly really empty
inside this thing I haven't seen it this
empty in a long time and the CPU block
is off we got our sexy lucho customs
cables out I haven't really got a chance
to show the basement of this setup here
so these are the two alpha cooled e5
pumps right here
variable speed pumps and they are
running in series at least in this setup
they were now I anticipated doing a dual
loop setup at some point that's why I
got two pumps so now we'll be doing a
dual loop obviously in the new build so
one pump per loop but yeah this is how I
had it set up down there there's the
radiator there's the power supply and
then there are the pumps right there so
all I had to do was bring down this back
panel and then I could adjust the speeds
if I needed to not too shabby
now you guys were probably wondering how
I did the series pumps I basically took
two alpha cool 90s and then they're
hardline nickel-plated fitting right
here that you would pretty much use in
between GPUs in fact they're the same
thing I use in between these GPUs and
then they were just sitting between the
pumps right there and in fact these can
seriously just pull right on out there
just pressure fit no rings now somebody
in tech talk tonight was asking quite
furiously how you can attach a reservoir
what
now drilling well you can see the some
of the residue here from where I had the
pumps mounted these pumps were actually
as you can see just two-sided tape down
in there this is 3m Automotive tape you
can get it at Home Depot or whatever
it's very very strong
and I used it to mount the pumps in the
bottom of this case because I knew that
I was going to be taking these out at
some point so that's how I had these
mounted there was no drilling down here
for the pumps and since they don't move
it's not a problem okay now here's
something interesting I just noticed
took the top rad out took the fans off
to clean the radiator and I want you to
take a look at the dirt pattern notice
how only one-half of the radiator
actually has a buildup of dust compared
to the other half for some reason the
900 D was choking the front half of the
radiator for air and the back half was
getting all of the airflow you can kind
of see that I'm trying to get a good
angle of it but there you go you can see
how only part of the radiator the the
front half of it was actually getting
air and what's interesting about that is
that was the side that was closest to
the motherboard tray so I can't quite
figure out why that flow characteristic
seems to exist in the 900 D but this is
just another valid argument for positive
air pressure and why it's really
important in cases so I just figured I
would point that out before I went to
bed here because I was a little bit
surprised by this I was not expecting
this very interesting all right so the
entire cooling system has been a yanked
out and you can see just how dirty my
case really is you guys seem to think I
have dirt Mike's system I don't know why
it is but look at this this is pretty
dirty I mean the fans oh that is gross
oh I got to clean all these fans so
there's the radiator in the pumps and
everything I've got the other 480 rad
sitting on the sink had to clean that
one out because it was pretty bad but
I'm going to clean all these fans I'm
going to clean up my mess and then I'm
gonna put the stock cooler back on this
thing it's only going to need to be
together for a couple of days and then
that's pretty much it for tonight we're
going to clean up this mess not too bad
of a mess that I got a little bit of a
mess and then we'll we'll get some stuff
done tomorrow so until then guys I guess
well it'll be only for a second for you
but for me I'll see you guys tomorrow
good morning everybody I worked in till
about 3:30 in the morning prepping my
system so I can start building I mean as
you see yesterday I took out all of the
stuff from the 900 E and you guys were
curious as to what this looks like when
it's not being water-cooled yeah it's
pretty freakin empty so definitely not a
air-cooling case if you ask me but then
again I really feel like it's a water
cooling case either considering it
really sucks for airflow there's
something I want to talk about here in a
previous video that I did actually the
previous video where I showed the
radiator that was damaged what we're
looking at right here is the 480
radiator and you guys might notice
there's a lot of copper color showing in
there I just want to also point out that
alpha cool only puts one very thin coat
of powder coat on the radiator to keep
it as efficient as possible so that's
why you see you know you can see kind of
black on one side and copper on the
other so I just want to point that out
that is by design but this is the 480
versus the size of the 560 yeah as you
can see it is quite a bit difference now
I weighed this bad boy to see how much
it weighs and it came in at five pounds
as five pounds of solid copper that's a
lot of weight to come crashing down on
these end tanks so yeah but anyway I
just wanted to kind of show you a size
comparison there the 480 versus a 560
the thing is a behemoth so let's go
ahead and get the new fan rings on there
here's the fan rings I painted in the
part one there's some of the fans there
go ahead and get the fan rings on there
one of the things I did last night that
wasn't on camera was I cleaned up all of
my fans you know they're lots of dust
built up in there and then I also had to
and I didn't record this but I've got my
loot ro customs extensions in there
I had to flip all of these I had to
unpin all of these from the connector
here and flip them to the opposite sides
now you may be wondering why well the
reason for that while I am really bright
the reason for that is loot row customs
they know the way that they normally
have to bend
to kind of get around to the back of a
motherboard tray and since that's a 90
degree fitting it's actually reverse of
the way that it normally goes well
because they have the longer cables on
one side than the other to give it that
natural curve it was naturally curving
the opposite direction so I just
reversed all the pins on those and we're
good to go so now we're going to go
ahead and get the fans ready get it
mounted to the rads get the rads in
there and just kind of start fitting
things to see how I want things to go so
this is the old fan ring and this is the
new fan ring you can kind of see the
difference in color there the top one is
a bit more of like a mustard color the
bottom one is definitely more of a
bright yellow the reason for that if you
look at the old motherboard in there you
can see that's clearly not a yellow that
is definitely more of a mustard color
and now that we're on the topic let's go
and talk about this guy real quick now
you guys are lots of you have been
asking well if you like yellow so much
why the heck aren't you using the mPower
I'm worried that there would be too much
yellow but there's also some other
reasons is this is a anny ATX board so
it comes all the way to the end of the
motherboard tray and the mPower also has
green and blue LEDs on it where this
just has red LEDs so it came down to
function of this motherboard the fact
that it can handle three or four-way SLI
if I ever want to get crazy and it
doesn't have the ugly LEDs on there so
I've not tested the overclocking
function of this motherboard I'm really
putting all of my chips in EVGA on this
one that they got their act together
with the BIOS so we're just going to see
how that one turns out but I wanted to
answer why I'm not using the empower
motherboard now the empower motherboard
is in that system over there doing a
good job of giving me a nice solid test
bench but we are going with obviously
the EVGA in this bad boy for other
obvious reasons well maybe they're not
so obvious are you guys win the best
kick
click tah-dah obviously I've got enough
fans for push-pull on the 480 yay some
people have asked how the lower radiator
mounts into the SMA eight
well this bad boy pretty much is just a
bracket and you can get this for 564 80
360 240 whatever size you want and that
just holds in there with these screws
and these screws go through these little
holes and thread right in there so yeah
pretty easy mounting mechanism just
going to set this on top of the radiator
and then we take our fans and we set
these down in there and then we screw
them in like that we pinch it in between
the red and the fans pretty nifty gas
man and the amazingly beautiful miss G's
two cents brought me coffee of course
this whole entire channel is brought to
you by Starbucks actually I bring them
lots and lots of money alright so one
thing I want to talk about here which
also seems to be very controversial
constantly it's people saying why am I
going with AF 140s on the radiator on
the 560 guys they do not make an SP 114
on LED fan with the removable rings I
want the fans to match my SP 120 s over
there yes I am using SP one 20s on the
480 on the 560 this is my only option if
I want matching fans however with the
size of these fans and the fin density
of this radiator which you can look look
you can see right through it even with
the fan there there is not going to be
any issues with optimum air flow using
an airflow fan on it a fpi radiator so
if you guys are going to give me a hard
time about using these AF fans on this
massive radiator uh you need to realize
just stop repeating everything you hear
on the internet and not talking with
first-hand experience because
unfortunately you guys are making
yourself look bad every time you bring
this up decided to take a quick break
and just enjoy some de Michi note 804
review hardware connects love those guys
push fans installed on the upper 480 red
and one of the stickers came off I might
as well just take up all the rest of the
stickers these don't show anyway but I'm
going to be
doing something kind of custom with the
labels here I don't like Corsairs logos
being all over my build so I'm going to
be trying to use some of my 3m carbon
fiber sticker paper and make circular
cutouts to put on top of these fans so
that we can hide that Corsair logo we
don't want their logo anywhere on here
so yeah we'll just know we'll circle
back to that but now I've got the lower
high I've got the lower rad in there the
560 and I do like the way that the Rings
just sort of kind of ghost through like
that it looks really really good I like
that so you can see that the yellow is
really starting to come together I have
no idea what I'm gonna do next honestly
I'm just got a mess here and we're going
to figure out what's next heat tools
ugly carpet oh and there's the ek 480
rad had to use the hardware from that
one because all of the hardware that
came with my optical rads with copper
and unfortunately copper just does not
look good with this build so you can see
I used the black screws from the ek rad
right there just have that ek red left
over from red mist in fact that buyer
still needs to decide what he wants to
do with that rad because it's just
sitting here well you know I was just
thinking to myself man so far I haven't
run into any issues
pretty simple build so far and of course
I jinxed myself now this may seem hard
to believe guys but here is the
thickness with push-pull on the next t45
push-pull on an XT 45 does not fit in
this case let's see if you can actually
see that right there probably not it is
actually hitting on the memory modules
right there as well as the CPU power let
me get the brightness brighter so you
can see right there it's hitting on the
CPU power and it's hitting on the memory
modules so unfortunately we're not going
to be able to do push-pull with the fans
on the inside now I would have loved to
have just said well so you guys may be
thinking ok fine put the red up against
the top at the fans on the bottom and
put the other fans on the top like this
exhausting hair
well I would do that however I went with
the standard thickness top which does
not as you can see it does not fit so
had I gotten the thicker top piece I
would have been able to do push-pull
like this but you know what redness
didn't have push-pull and it wasn't an
issue so I think we'll be okay it's just
kind of sad now that I'm at four SP 120
sitting there doing absolutely nothing
maybe I'll you know I'll get a thicker
top later and put the fans up here oh
well that's a little disappointing snag
number one no push pull on this bad boy
but again low FBI only eight FBI in this
radiator so these fans even while slowed
down move plenty of air through the rads
in fact I didn't do push pull on that
thing so I don't technically need it
here either I just kind of wanted to do
it because I had the fans know I'm sad
all right so there's the top red like I
said no push pull but man the yellow is
really starting to come in on this build
this is going to look really fantastic
you can see I got the top EPS power
going up there the 24 pin and you can
see that the wiring is going to be very
very very tidy on this build so I gotta
decide I'm gonna do the reservoirs now
that always seems to be the thing that
hangs me up on these builds is how I
want to do the reservoirs but I'm pretty
sure it's just going to be boring
mounted to the back wall nothing custom
but that you can really see I was
worried about the yellow in the gunmetal
but the more I put in there and the more
that the yellow is just sort of accent
it looks really good now again that's
why I didn't put the end power in there
I think it would have been a little bit
over powering on the yellow if you know
what I'm saying that there was
definitely an intended pun in there and
here's what it looks like without the
cover on the bottom one of the things
that kind of sucks though is you can see
that as if it goes in focus here hit
this manual focus crap you can see that
they have this gap right here and that
the whole bracket I'm using the lowest
holes on here and the reason for that is
when I drilled the pass-through
and the 90 degree fitting that comes
through the floor here for the graphics
cards it collides with the radiator if
it's up any higher I learned that with
red miss I would love for this to be
centered but I'm not going to be able to
because of the 90 degree fitting on
there but it's starting to come together
now I don't have a whole lot left to do
today I'm gonna get the graphics cards
on there and then what's going to be the
next step pretty much is gonna yeah
obviously get all the water cooling
plumbed up and then I'll shoot I guess
she'll be pretty much done well it
sounds like it's right around the corner
but there's actually a lot left to do so
actually what I'm going to do next is
I'm going to make the pass-through right
here it's got this grommet cover if you
was just a hard cover there and instead
of running the wires down through here
like I did for red mist I'm going to
just drill a hole in this and run them
through there now the way you get a nice
perfectly centered hole is you take your
you take your punch right here this is
just an awl like a punch at
spring-loaded one you can see I already
put the hole in there but you find
Center you take your awl and find the
hole oh find the hole
sorry in my life push it down spring
load pops a hole in there you take your
pilot bit you drill a small hole in
there and then you take a Unibet and
then you make the hole the size you need
it to be it just needs to be big enough
for the three pin fan connectors to fit
through so let's go ahead and get that
out of the way alright there's our hole
I even countersunk it a little bit so it
looks bitter and should be the right
sides go ahead and try it out so all
three fans are just running through
there right now and you know you can be
able to really notice that once the
reservoirs and stuff are in there so
it's a lot easier for me to wire those
up that way then running them all the
way down to the bottom like I did red
mist
I learned a lot of things with red mist
though since I'm working with the same
case and I'm kind of this is almost like
red mist 2.0 if you will but yeah so
we're starting to wrap wrap it up for
the day we'll see what else we get done
here and then we'll we'll call it a day
okay i've got the two gtx 780 s that are
hacked and overclocked and bios over
bolted and all that crap in there but i
still have to do the connections between
them and then all of this has to come
back out actually the motherboard tray
and and all that because I still have to
mark down here where I need to drill the
holes and decide exactly where I'm going
to be drilling the holes and decide how
I'm going to be doing this I'm thinking
I'm going to do in and out it's going to
be parallel loop it's going to go in
pass through go through there and then
back out so I think I'm gonna have to go
in and out right here on the bottom
rather than how I did read myths where I
had that one tube that went along the
bottom I think I'm going to do it that
way but all I'm gonna do for right now
let's get the link in the middle ready
to go get those acrylic tubes cut to
length and then I think that's where
we're going to stop for today
all right we're wrapping it up here I
just want to show you one last tip since
people always ask me what I'm doing
these pass through fittings like this I
go into this floor how do I know where
to drill we can say I've already got one
hole marked the question people ask is
how do you know where to drill because
you know it could be slightly off or
whatever well this is the method that I
use I take my iPhone I turn on the
flashlight and I make sure that the top
port plug is open and that the where's
the focus Jesus vlogging with a DSLR Cal
sucks alright so I make sure that it's
open all the way through take my
flashlight and I shine it in the hole on
the top and as you can see down on the
floor I get all these different rings of
things happening but if you focus the
camera better you can see that there's
going to be one point where they all
pretty much line up perfectly which is
right there so you make sure that it
lines up perfectly all around same
amount of gap there if you have the tube
in between it gives us a nice shimmer
effect which gives you even better way
of telling if it's centered
once you find where its center you take
your awl or your punch and you will
going to be loud cover your ears
here's your hole punch and there are
your marks to take once again your pilot
bit drill the pilot take your unibit
drill it and there you go it'll be
perfectly lined up with the entire unit
so there you go guys that was part 2 of
Jays project skunk works I want to get
farther today but actually got quite a
bit done I spent a few hours on it today
but a lot of time just kind of looking
at brainstorming as you guys know when I
do this build I talk about always
planning and prepping and thinking three
four or five times about it measuring
three four or five times and then doing
the work once so that's what I recommend
so I'm going on out here guys it is
fourth of July we're going to go see
some fireworks and stuff tonight and
from then we're going to go ahead and
see if we can't finish this build up
this weekend and as always guys I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
