the way back in May when we were at
Computex and I couldn't wait to get my
hands on it we have got a rise then
based laptop sporting a full fat 1700
risin 724 gigabytes of ddr4 as well as
an rx 580 with a free sync panel so I
think in terms of paying for buck and
performance and portability this is this
is gonna be a package that seems to have
all of it so the resin 7 1700 is AMD's
first CPU in the 8 core lineup it's a 65
watt chips that makes it perfect for
something like this in a mobile platform
but it's got all 8 cores all 16 threads
but it's a it's the full 3.7 turbo clock
with the 3.1 gigahertz all core turbo
clock on here 24 gigabytes of 2400
megahertz
ddr4 and of course an rx 584 gigabyte
model now you can step up those specs a
little bit you can add more RAM up to 32
gigabytes it's it's a pretty impressive
package because when you draw a Venn
diagram when it comes to laptops there's
very little overlap if you're looking
for something that's got price to
performance performance and portability
you can easily get two of the three but
it's hard to get all three where usually
if you want performance then with it
you're also getting a little bit less
portability this might be bigger heavier
bulkier if you want performance you'd
certainly not gonna get cheap so it's
hard to make that Venn diagram really
line up but I think they've done a
pretty good job here with this
particular model because the 1700 again
as I said 65 watt chip it's not too
expensive it's still got all eight cores
16 threads so it definitely turns and
just obliterates your professional
workflows now in terms of weight and
form factor it measures 1.3 inches high
at its highest point
it's a 17.3 inch panel and it weighs in
at 7 pounds so it's not the lightest
laptop but certainly not the heaviest by
any means but in terms of the panel tech
it is an IPS panel so that's a plus
alright oftentimes you'll see high-end
hardware go with a TN panel or something
like that because of a higher refresh
rate but IPS tech has definitely moved
along so this has got an IPS 75
Hertz freesync panel built-in so you've
definitely got all the stuff you would
certainly want to go along with your you
know your gaming and professional laptop
now in terms of build quality there's a
lot of plastic on here but it doesn't
feel rickety it doesn't creak when you
push on it is very little flex it
doesn't make noises it doesn't feel
cheap at all but on the top of the
laptop it does have a brushed metal
finish with these accents so it's not
in-your-face doesn't have all these
colors and lights everywhere so ah it's
basically a dual purpose laptop where if
I still worked in my professional
environment I would have no problems
taking this into a board meeting or a
meeting this looks elegant but also can
play your games and do all your work
with no problems now speaking of color
once you open it up the speaker grilles
right here do have a little bit of red
color accent to them the keyboard is a
red LED backlit it's not our GPS you
can't change the color so you can of
course turn the backlight off if you
want and you've got this red Asus logo
right here and some white lettering that
says Republic of gamers but it's not
in-your-face and over-the-top and gaudy
so no problems with that also - and
speaking of hinge quality the hinge
keeps its position and the nice thing is
it's weighted and balanced just enough
to where if it's flat on the table you
can open it up without the base lifting
up right you can see it kind of wanted
to right there some laptops the hinge is
too tight so when you go to pick it up
and open the lid the whole laptop folds
back but not in this case here in terms
of connectivity we've got quite a bit
going on here we've got a full size
Ethernet port right here but the cool
thing is when you're not using it sort
of flips up and out of the way but if
you want it this little hinge pushes
down exposing the full opening of the
Ethernet port full size HDMI which is
perfect for VR and your HMDs and your
headsets because this is very V already
the plenty of horsepower to run your VR
games no problem of course we've got a
USB type-c another USB 3.0 and our
headphone jack flipping around to the
other side here we have got full-size
well an SD card reader so that's nice
and then we've got two USB ports right
here as well as Kensington lock so it's
pretty standard in terms of connectivity
but it's not lacking which a lot of
laptops as they shrink them down you
start giving up some of this connect
but not in the case right here now let's
talk about what everyone's gonna care
about in gaming
honestly it games like any desktop with
a 1700 in it and nrx 580 the RX 580 even
the 4 gigabyte model although I'd like
to have seen an 8 gig rx 580 has no
problems pushing 1080p whatsoever which
is exactly what this panel is the
freesync definitely comes in handy
because the RX 580 at 1080p even with
high settings on games like rise of the
term raider rise of the term raider who
rise of the Tomb Raider pray GTA 5 all
exceed 60fps by quite a bit so the 75
Hertz free sync panel is definitely
doing some work and the free sync is
definitely smoothing out those frame
rates but in terms of noise it wasn't
very loud it wasn't very intrusive the
fans do indeed ramp up but most of the
time when you're gaming anyway
especially with a laptop you're probably
wearing headphones anyway because
although the sound quality on this is
very good most people I know who game on
laptops wear headphones anyway so the
noise isn't gonna be too intrusive now
in terms of heat it all exhausts out the
back of the laptop you've got pretty
ample ventilation right here it goes
right out the back how are you gonna be
doing is blowing heat at your neighbour
it's not your problem it's theirs now it
pulls in from the bottom of the laptop
so you're definitely wanna make sure
that you're not blocking that off with
your lap or something you want it on a
flat surface but as I said annoy your
neighbour not yourself blow the heat
their way now in terms of battery
performance I mean it's not terrible
it's a 65 watt TDP chip at least the
desktop version
I assume this one's the same because
it's got all the same specs as the
desktop version rx 580 is not the most
efficient
GPU out there but it's certainly more
efficient than like a full-size desktop
Vega but you're gonna probably get a
couple of hours of gaming out of this
not the greatest gaming experience
though because I'm battery power it
really does pull back its coarse beads
and stuff unless you'll just leave it in
performance mode then it will just run
balls-to-the-wall until it goes into
power-save mode where everything then
ramps down to like it's base clock and
farther back for instance the CPU on
battery power will go all the way back
to 500 megahertz so 0.5 gigs is what
you're going to get on battery power but
that's on the you know conservation mode
when it's below 10% because what it's
trying to do at that point is give you
enough time
save your work and shut down the system
or plug it in without a critical
shutdown that's just gonna lose your
work but you know I think for most
gamers though they're not too concerned
with battery power gaming because we're
gonna plug it in anyway because we want
all the FPS right what's the point of
having a precinct panel if you're gonna
be gaming on battery but you could for a
little while anyway now some final
thoughts here in terms of pros and cons
it was really hard for me to find
anything I would change with this laptop
it really comes down to a couple of
things one with the amount of cooling in
here the heat pipe design the
independent fans would have been nice to
see at least some level of overclocking
available to this like we see on some
other laptop models because we know that
the 1700 does overclock well without
adding too much more voltage and too
much more heat I think we could have
gotten this guy up to four gigs on in a
laptop without too much of an issue or
at least 3.7 with all course
rikes 3.7 is only one or two cores 3.1
is the all core turbo clock I think we
could have got 3.7 on all cores the RX
580 what I'd liked to have seen an 8
gigabyte version be standard but I
understand the reasoning for having two
different versions and giving a little
bit of a cost you know tier system here
so that you can make it more affordable
to more people and definitely definitely
needs faster memory 24 hundred megahertz
although not a slouch
we know that rise ins infinity fabric
takes a direct performance impact on
memory speed so the faster memory you
have the faster the Infinity fabric
works the better performance you're
going to get so 3,000 megahertz plus is
the sweet spot and where you want to aim
for at least give us the ability to
overclock the so-dimms a little bit to
see if we can get there would have been
nice but that's pretty locked down so
you can't really touch any of that you
can change the memory but then you're
buying memory that you're gonna change
anyway which kind of affects the cost of
performance in the long run but that's
really all I got I don't have a lot that
I would really change with this I mean
it got it has everything you want eight
cores 16 threads putting it on par with
something like the old 59 60 ex from
Intel in a laptop plenty of ddr4 in here
storage wise it's expandable we've got a
256 gig SSD and a one terabyte hard
drive which is what all the games are
suffer on here performance on gaming
more than enough for 1080p 1080p IPS
free sync panel
I mean what more can you ask for if you
guys have any comments put them down in
the comments below obviously I've been
waiting to get my hands on this all year
and it didn't disappoint it's an amazing
performer and the cost of performance on
this is great so check links down below
you guys can see links on where to buy
and how to outfit it and all that but
that's all I got if you guys got any
comments or suggestions for a soos or
this laptop of what you guys would like
to see moving forward make sure you
sound off down below subscribe you guys
are new around here and as always I will
see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
