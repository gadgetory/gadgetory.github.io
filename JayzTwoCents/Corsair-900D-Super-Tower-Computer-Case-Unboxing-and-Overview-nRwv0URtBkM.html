and I've been talking about it forever
on Twitter about upgrading my case to
the nine hundred d and that's what we
got right here this massive massive
behemoth that my computer my big switch
810 is actually behind this box that's
just how big this is
and for a size comparison you can see
right here we've got the fractal X
defined XLR to full tower gaming case
right here compared to the 900 d so you
can see when it comes to the size
comparison just how massive this thing
is we're going to unbox it we're going
to take a look inside and we're going to
see whether or not this case really
lives up to all the hype and all of the
the ruckus that this case has been
making ever since CES so stay tuned okay
so I just put the fractal up here for a
little bit of a size comparison we'll go
ahead and get this guy out of the way
because we're not doing a fractal review
although I do have one coming up on the
channel so stay tuned for that the
corsair obsidian 900 d they ought to
call it just the the corsair absurd 900
d because this case is massive there's
not much I really I don't like to talk
so much about the box I mean it Corsair
really didn't spend a whole lot of
design effort on the box it's cardboard
they've got you know different languages
on here to fill the space and they've
got a slogan on here what will you do
with all this room talks about designing
your ultimate PC on the back and there's
my switch 810 as you can see when we
talk about size comparison on the back
here it's got just an exploded view of
the to list removable parts that come on
this 900 d that's the box I really don't
care about the box let's go ahead and
take a look at what's inside got my
trusty blade I can't even tell you how
many times I've cut myself with this
thing and there we go
and there she is 100% upside down so
this has been Jase two cents an unboxing
an overview of the NIE no I'm just
kidding I'm just going to go ahead and
say right off the bat this is definitely
bigger than I expected it to be and
what's crazy about that is I've already
seen this case at CES holy crap
okay do the lift bro this thing's heavy
so we've got our styrofoam protection
off here toss that aside
get your come on in closer
it smells like awesome that's first
thing I want to say I probably should
have clean my desk off a little bit for
this I think I underestimated the size
the sheer size of this bad boy oh my god
coconut what are your initial reactions
to this case that's what she said went
into room let's see we've got okay this
is a latch here so that you can get the
side panel down as everyone's already
seen before you've got your it's taped
in right now but you've got your
magnetic band filter here dust filter
just plops right on and there you go
we'll set that up and out of the way and
then on the back here to release the
side panel you've got this button you
push that in and once you get all that
tape off this thing there is the side
panel and it just simply has screwed on
if you can see those screws the plastic
here is a slightly smoked it's not
completely clear it is just an ever
slight tint to it but it's not flimsy I
mean it does have some flex to it
because it is mostly an acrylic panel
but it's heavy and sturdy we're going to
set that aside but look at this look at
the amount of room there is in this case
right here you do get a few fans in here
that are included let's get this stuff
out of the way
here and I just want to point out one of
the things I was most concerned with on
buying this case was whether or not this
shelf the Shelf of cool stuff that Jay
likes was going to be in the way and as
you can see right here get a top shot it
the case is taller than the shelf so
yeah it's probably a lot easier to move
the shelf than it is to move this case
there is the aluminum panel the brushed
aluminum will leave this cover on this
plastic on for now it just simply has
these four little tabs that push on
right here in the front and then when it
comes to the fan filter once again
quality and tape click it and it comes
right off and here is your fan filter
your washable fan filter for the 900 d
and you do get three fans included with
this they are a slightly different
design than the AF 120 and the SP 120
even though their advertising is an AF
120 L not sure what the L means I
haven't researched that but the blade
design is slightly different than the
regular AF that I have in that switch
810 right there but you do get three 120
s in the front up here on the top this
is your i/o and power switch panel here
so you drop this down everything is
listed right here on the top with some
icons two USB 3.0 four USB 2.0 your
microphone headphone jack power and
reset switch right there this is your
power that's your reset so when it comes
to the five and a quarter of drive base
here obviously these are wider than a
standard five and a quarter so you
simply can pop this out without breaking
it hopefully because I don't use any
five and a quarter drives I don't want
to break it
this is the only case I've ever been
able to stick my big ol head
when it comes to your standard
five-and-a-quarter
bays obviously this is wider than a five
and a quarter so what Corsair has done
to kind of make this aesthetically
pleasing when you pop this out you do
have the steel right here which is kind
of contoured it's kind of nice and then
your five and a quarter slides right in
and unfortunately if you're only using
one drive I don't like the way that this
is recessed slightly but you know it is
what it is a lot of people aren't using
five and a quarter four drives anymore
using it for Bay reservoirs van
controllers that sort of thing so it's
really not so bad the finish on this
isn't shiny this is just a plastic cover
on here a protective film that will go
ahead and leave on here for the most
part right now but as you can see when
you peel this back if you can kind of
see right here on the corner it is a
brushed aluminum finish so the entire
case is brushed aluminum it is not shiny
case fans that are included you've got
the 3-1 20s up front you've got the AF
140 L on the back here you've got your
cord right here what I like about the
motherboard standoffs here is that
they're already all you know attached
everything's in there you don't have to
mount any of the standoffs I'm assuming
that you know it's going to come with
all of the hardware as well and looking
for the hardware be sure where the
hardware is and there it is they always
stick the hardware in one of the drive
bays so there you go this is where
you're going to find all of your screws
and other things that go with this case
this is the side panel right here for
the lower portion of the of the case if
you want to have sideways mounted fans
right here for a radiator or just if you
want side flow in through this case this
is the rail for that so by default it
comes with this rail installed in the
lower position with the hot swap bays
right down here in the bottom I will be
removing these bays because I don't plan
on using those if you look at the top
here from the inside you do have native
mounts for a quad radiator of at 120
quad or a triple 140 right to put three
140 millimeter fan
for 120 millimeter fans you do have ten
expansion slots so you can fit your
large form factor motherboards in there
your server boards have plenty of i/o
for that
graphics cards four-way SLI absolutely
no problem and then last but not least
we will go ahead and move around to the
back Jace was just very heavier than I
expected
oh and real quick on the back here I
want to point out you do have native
dual power supply unit compatibility
here so they leave one cut out by
default you remove this one you can't
have two power supplies if you so desire
here is the rear panel lots and lots of
room here for your cable management it
comes with an extension already and
pre-installed right here for your CPU
eight pin or four pin it's got these
tabs right here that you can use to
easily manage the cables inside your
case you've got three of these easy
access right here to your drive bays and
then just like on the front you've got
this right here which pops down and
gives you access to all of your dry base
but what I like right here that I didn't
even notice is it's got SATA cables
pre-installed same thing with power that
is a very nice feature I haven't really
seen anybody showcase this so you have
one single plug I really like this
because I hate having all of those extra
cables running around for your different
drives you've got one set of plug right
here which powers all of the drives in
this Bay and then you've got your three
SATA connectors that are already
installed because this is a hot swap you
just stick your drive in there and you
can use these to install into your
motherboard and have one power cable for
all of it I think so far that is my
favorite feature of this three hundred
and fifty dollar case I guess it doesn't
take a whole lot to make me super
excited okay guys that's been Jays two
cents unboxing overview here of the 900
d I'm going to be taking my components
and converting all of my opponent
into this case and seeing what kind of
water cooling setup I can come up with
when it comes to routing with this case
here it is the 900 D I finally got it
we're going to see what I can come up
with and make sure you check out all my
other videos if you're new to my channel
subscribe check out the Facebook fan
page and the Twitter account because of
all the stuff that I'm constantly doing
up there which is really silly and
retarded but usually tech based but
anyway thank you guys for watching my
nerdy video and I will see you guys in
my next video
when I see you it's so big I'm gonna die</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
