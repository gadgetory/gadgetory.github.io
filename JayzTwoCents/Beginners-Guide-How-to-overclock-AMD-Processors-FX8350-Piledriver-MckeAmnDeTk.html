dinky little mic because I don't want to
unplug the Yeti but I want to go ahead
and talk about something that I've asked
on a regular basis because I'm a huge
advocate for overclocking your processor
now I mean huge in the physical sense
because I am pretty big I mean why not
unlock as much performance as you could
possibly get out of your processor when
most of its free and it's absolutely
safe there is nothing to worry about
whatsoever when it comes overclocking
your press holy so a couple of things
you got to know right off the bat before
you start tweaking with your settings
and trying to overclock
is you've got to first make sure your
motherboard supports overclocking
believe it or not not all motherboards
are created equal so you've got to go
ahead and do the research first and make
sure you even have the capability of
overclocking before you start trying to
do any of this stuff and I also want to
go ahead and mention that this is going
to be geared a little bit more towards
AMD and MB overclocking is a little
different than Intel but I will be
coming out with an Intel version here in
the near future so before we go ahead
and jump into the BIOS there's a couple
of programs that you're going to want to
install for the sake of stability
testing because what good is an
overclock if it doesn't stay running if
your computer crashes you get blue
screens or you get you know reboots or
lock ups it doesn't matter what speed
you're running out if it's not stable so
on the very left over here you see my
mouse going round and round that is what
I use to control my fans that is not
necessity it's just a program that I use
called speed fan consider that an option
the middle program here is CPU Z this
tells us everything we need to know
about our processor tells us our core
speed our multiplier our bus speed tells
us our voltages everything we need to
know about our processor and that's very
important when it comes to overclocking
and on the right over here this is
hardware monitor hardware monitor is
really important because it shows us so
much going on with our computer and not
just with the processor but tells us our
voltages it shows us our temperatures
for everything that's got a temp probe
inside the computer fan speeds core
temperatures minimum maximum
average it's just got that just goes on
and on so this is definitely a must-have
and the two benchmarks that I like to
use is this one on the left here called
Haven DirectX 11 benchmark it's a gaming
benchmark it's a synthetic loop or it's
a free range free roaming environment
that you can use to test your gaming
overclock because it really pushes your
GPU as well as your CPU and then for
Stevie and then for CPU stability we've
got prime95 over here which is just a
very simple program everything I've
listed right here is free go and
download it now before you continue this
tutorial because you're gonna need it
okay so as I mentioned this is an
overclocking tutorial a little more
geared towards AMD a lot of the
principles here do apply to Intel and
this is specifically for overclocking
the FX series AMD processor I am running
a crosshair 5 formula motherboard here
from Asus it's a very stable
overclocking motherboard I highly
recommend it it is a little bit on the
pricey side especially if you're
building an AMD rig but just make sure
any motherboard that you do go with does
support overclocking and a UEFI bios
like this is very easy to use so we're
going to go ahead and start here by
resetting our settings to our failsafe
optimise defaults and let's get started
so this is the way things look right off
the bat everything is pretty much set to
auto as you can see in the extreme
Tweaker and we're going to be doing some
preliminary setup here before you really
start messing with things inside of your
bulldozer or your piledriver CPU you
want to head over to the Advanced tab
and go to the CPU configuration you want
to disable cool and quiet disabled by
CPU you want seeonee disabled you want
svm and disabled and you want Core 6
state enable this fine this is one of
those settings that a lot of people say
needs to be disabled some say enabled
all the forms I go to say enabled us
fine and I have absolutely no problem
with leaving it on HPC mode you want to
turn that to disabled and APN master on
auto is fine you want to then head over
to extreme Tweaker and for the AI
overclocked tuner or whatever the
equivalent is for your motherboard your
turn that to manual that's where it
gives you control over the frequencies
and things that are going on with your
processor CPU level up ignore that that
is the automated overclock we want to
get a max table overclock that we
control so ignore that CPU ratio by
default on AMD is 20 so you want to turn
that to a static setting of 20 and get
it off auto and we want to turn the
turbo core technology disable the memory
frequency is one of those things that's
going to definitely depend on which
memory that you're using as well as the
memory controller capabilities of your
processor the CPU Northbridge frequency
this is where we're going to do our
North Bridge overclocking I prefer North
Bridge overclocking as opposed to
multiplier overclocking because you get
better single core or single threaded
performance out of each individual core
as opposed to relying on the hyper
threaded or multi-threaded tasks of some
software we're going to go ahead and set
that at the default 2200 and the
hypertransport link we are going to set
to the default 2600 if you're wondering
how I know those defaults are began they
are right up there in yellow because we
are currently on default settings right
now CPU spent spread-spectrum we're
going to disable PCI spread you can
leave it there
EP you leave it there extreme tweaking
your gonna enable because we want to
extremely tweak this thing get as much
as we can for our dollars out of the CPU
and trust me
piledriver and bulldozer are definitely
worth there overclocking value digi
theorem or vrm and power control is very
important we want to turn CPU load line
calibration you know this is going to be
one of those things where it definitely
depends on the motherboard and the power
supply unit that you are using because
this is the part where it keeps the
voltage from drooping as it goes under
load my motherboard is capable of ultra
high and my power supply unit is a gold
rated so it means I'm I don't have to
worry so much about power spikes so I'm
comfortable with leaving it ultra high
and the CPU Northbridge we are going to
leave at high and we're going to have
over current protection set to a hundred
thirty percent these are some advanced
settings right here because I'm doing a
very far overclock you can leave both of
these at high or medium and set this to
you know 110 percent hundred twenty
percent if you're not comfortable with
allowing one hundred and thirty percent
buffer there on the voltage and then the
phase control and these other settings
you can go ahead and just leave that
default the next thing we want to do
right now is we want to go ahead and set
our CPU voltage to whatever the setting
is you see right here statically see how
it says one point three eight volts but
it's on auto we're going to go ahead and
take that and set one point three eight
static and leave it there in the CPU
Northbridge manual voltage it's at one
point two so again we'll leave that at
one point two and there we go what we
want to do is we want to find out what
our max default overclock here is and
all we've accomplished so far as we've
gone through here and turned off the
settings that would prevent some of the
overclocking stability like the you know
the spread spectrum and whatnot and now
we've taken all of the values that were
set to auto and set them to their
default in a static format so the
computer can't change any of those
settings on us but what we're going to
do right now is the default here for
four gigahertz is twenty times x equals
four thousand or in this case that would
be two hundred as you can see right here
as we change this CPU bus frequency if I
change it to say 201 this is going to go
four thousand twenty right there because
it's this number times this number gets
us our CPU speed so what we're going to
do it now is we want to find our max
overclock for the stock voltage but I
also want you to notice right here that
the RAM speed as well as the North
Bridge and the hypertransport has
changed because these are all based on
multipliers of this number so as this
number gets higher to keep these with
near default you may need to go in here
and change them so just keep that in
mind as you're overclocking here the
first starter here I would go ahead and
set this to I would say approximately
220 in my case which puts this up to
four point four target speed we're going
to go ahead f10
save these settings and we're going to
go ahead and go do our first stability
test to make sure we are stable at that
voltage and that multiplier and bus okay
so now that we're booted here if we go
ahead and load up CPU Z we can see right
here right off the bat we are running up
to 4.4 gigahertz that we set at our
stock voltage temperatures are nice and
cool at 28 degrees Celsius I am on water
that's another point you really need to
make sure that you have adequate cooling
for this as you bump up the voltage the
temperature is only going to get hotter
but so is everything else about your
computer hmm so make sure you've got
nice adequate cooling you've got good
air flow in your case and a good CPU
cooler because it is going to be
necessary so we're going to do now is
we're going to go ahead and open up this
prime95 right here and we're going to
set this to the first bullet or the
first bullet a radio button here for
small F F F or F f TS this is just a CPU
stress it's not really using very much
ram at all and we are going to go ahead
and hit OK and as you can see here it
starts all sorts of tasks and you can
see over here on the speed fan which I
also use to monitor my core activity
everything went right to 100% the
temperature is slowly starting to climb
and we want to let this run about 10 to
15 minutes per test because we're
letting this thing go for a stress test
and we want to find where our numbers
start to fail what I mean by that is we
want to watch for over here in each of
these processes if one of the cores
fails it'll say tests stopped and you
can see over here that any cores that
fail the test will just they'll drop
down to 0% they'll no longer be green
and that doesn't mean anything bad
happened it just means that prime95
noticed that hey this core failed
something so it shuts off the test to
that core and there's no damage to be
had it's a very safe program to use but
as you can see right here as the
temperatures start to climb it certainly
becomes a bit more stressful on your
cooling system that's why it's very
important to make sure you have adequate
cooling and on Hardware monitor here you
can scroll down and see what the cores
are doing and you can see my cores are
at 35 degrees Celsius which is bear
very very cool so you want to make sure
you know what the thermal capacity is of
your processor as well I happen to know
that this
8350 is capable of 62 degrees on the
core and 70 degrees on the socket so as
you can see right here well below that
at 43 socket and 35 on the core okay so
we're going to go ahead and do a reboot
here we're going to boot back up into
our BIOS and we're going to go ahead and
leave the voltage where it's at but
we're going to bump up our frontside bus
just a tad so let's go ahead and try to
25 which puts us at 4.5 gigahertz F 10
save the settings reboot into Windows
and repeat the stress test this may seem
tedious and it may be very boring and it
can take up to hours to get this done
and dialed in properly but it's
definitely worth it you don't want to
cut any corners and you want to make
sure that your stress testing because
it's only going to be a headache later
when you're dealing dealing with blue
screens and lock ups and your you're
going to kicked out of your games and
you're just not going to have a good
time and you're going to say this
processor sucks when it turns out the
only thing that sucks is you're
overclocking stability
okay and just as I expected here we had
a core fail and the reason why it failed
is a word I have a feeling and I already
know this for a fact actually that the
4.6 gigahertz is just a little too much
for the stock voltage and if you look
right here you can see workers stopped
and that's core number 6 and if you look
up there on the activity for core number
6 absolutely nothing so the next step
this is where a lot of people on their
overclocking go oh I don't know what to
do next so that must be all my
processors capable of and they'll back
it off and then they leave it there and
they don't realize they're not getting
the most out of their processors so what
you need to do right now is go ahead and
stop the process stop the tests and
reboot into BIOS and I'll show you guys
now how you get stability out of your
overclock all right so we're booted back
into our BIOS here and these are the
settings where we had our first failed
course we're going to go ahead and leave
everything where it's at leave it at 20
leave it at 230 leave the PCI Express
auto leave the memory the the
Northbridge and the hyper transport
leave everything where it's at and go
all the way down here to the voltage and
we're going to go ahead and bump this up
basically point one volt at a time so
now I'm going to it's at one point three
eight one two five zero now I'm going to
put this at one point four zero just for
good measure and we're going to go ahead
f10 save reboot back into Windows and
repeat the test okay so just a couple of
things worth pointing out here we've had
our test run in here for a little while
everything seems to be perfectly stable
but I want you to take a look at the
temperatures and how they've changed
over just a couple of millivolts here on
the processor we're running at one point
404 volts but you can see we've gained
four degrees Celsius on the core and a
few degrees Celsius on the socket right
up here so that's why it's so important
people that you have adequate cooling
for your computer and as you can see we
just jumped up to 40 for a minute there
40 is the max this is going to continue
to go up as we increase the voltage so
cooling is so important I can't even
emphasize it enough let's go ahead and
bump this thing up a little bit more now
on the frontside bus since we've got a
stable voltage and we just keep
repeating
this process over and over until we no
longer get any results from adding
voltage and we can't get stable and then
you back it off a little bit and then
you reduce the voltage until it's no
longer stable bump the voltage back up
and that is your max overclock so let's
do it alright so now that we've done all
sorts of tests and stability tests and
you can see on my overclock I'm happy
with four point eight one six megahertz
I had to bump the voltage all the way up
to one point four eight or one point
four eight eight at load to get a stable
four point eight measured but by
applying the same concepts to the hyper
transport link as well as the
Northbridge I was able to get this up to
two point six mega or two point six
gigahertz as well as two point six
gigahertz on the Northbridge so I'm
really happy with our results here our
temperatures look good everything's
right where it should be and I have
prime95 tested this thing for over an
hour once you start to get this thing
higher and higher on the clocks you need
to do your tests for longer and longer
run prime95 because the longer prime95
runs the more it starts to change its
algorithm and it increases the load as
it runs the test for longer and longer
and it really really pushes your CPU to
the max so you're going to be able to
find if there's any stability test it's
going to burst any instabilities it's
going to really creep and show its ugly
head farther into the test so i
recommend ten minute tests when you do
the voltage and the you know intervals
on the bus speed but once you're where
you think you need to be you need to run
that test for at least an hour some
people recommend six hours some say
twelve some say twenty four I've never
needed to personally run it more than an
hour I've been doing it for years
and I've been very stable on my clocks
so do what you're comfortable with but
you need to make sure you run it for an
extended period of time no matter what
I'm going to be doing this for Intel
guys I've got a I've got an Intel
computer than me overclocking for a
friend so I'll do the same concepts and
I'll show you guys the settings on how
to do
Intel because it is a little bit
different than AMD but if you've got
yourself a bulldozer which is an 80 128
150 or the 4100 6100 series processors
or you have the new V Shira piledriver
processors which is 80 360 300 or 4300
stuff it all applies and you can get
some really really good overclocks from
AMD if you're willing to put a decent
cooler on your processor if you have any
questions about overclocking or you guys
just are stumped on how to get farther
put your questions down in the comments
I'll do the best I can to help you guys
