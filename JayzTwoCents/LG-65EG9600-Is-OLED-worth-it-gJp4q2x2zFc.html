you can't tell we are not in my usual
studio that's because if you saw my vlog
that I put up recently about redoing my
living room in preparation for doing a
review of this big guy then you would
already know that this review was coming
anyway today we are going to be looking
at LG's brand-new 65 inch OLED curved
UHD TV now LG was kind enough to send
over one of their new flagship 65 inch
OLED TVs specifically the 65 eg 9600
this thing is pretty badass it packs a
lot of features I'm going to go ahead
and get started right now now there's a
lot of different things we could talk
about with this video in fact I could
easily fill up an hour of your time
talking about all the features of this
TV so instead of doing that I'm going to
talk about two features that are really
important to me one we're going to talk
about obviously the picture quality and
the user experience and two we're going
to talk about LG's web OS which is a
built-in operating system on the TV
allowing you to actually be able to
watch 4k content and other streaming
services which we know is how 4k content
is being delivered at least in these
early rollouts I mean one of the most
common things you hear about 4k TVs is
what's the point there's no 4k content
but that's changing and LG has already
got you set up to be able to enjoy that
4k content right out of the box now
first things first there are a lot of
different panel technology types out
there and this one is featuring OLED
technology which we kind of first saw in
smartphones now the OLED technology
found in the 65 eg 9600 is absolutely
amazing in fact it is so good in the
amount of detail that you can see in
low-light situations in blacks and dark
scenes and movies and high quality
content it's going to make plasma in my
opinion completely obsolete
just like LCDs LEDs and plasmas made DLP
back projection TVs completely obsolete
this is completely going to change the
game obviously I have a movie playing in
the background now this is a vengers age
of Ultron it is a blu-ray and it is 1080
P being up scaled right now to 4k and a
4k upscaling DVD
now the picture is absolutely stunning
and sitting close to it you can't even
tell that it is not a native 4k blu-ray
so right off the bat the processing
engine inside this TV is doing a
fantastic job we're back in the day if
you took you know standard def and
upgraded it to or up scaled it to 1080p
or even 720p it looked absolutely
terrible looked blotchy
it looked really separated and fuzzy
that is not the case here obviously I
can't wait until we get native 4k
blu-rays to really be able to see the
picture quality in this TV but that's
coming at a future date now one of the
things that OLED technology has allowed
LG to do is actually to get very
accurate colors now there's a lot of
different presets for colors inside this
TV out of the box in fact there's seven
of them there's multiple expert settings
and each input also has its own settings
for colors that way you can calibrate
each device and get the best picture
possible but I really didn't do much
touching of this thing out of the box if
you go and look at different consumer
reviews at places that customers have
been buying this TV like Amazon and Best
Buy and you'll see that a lot of them
are a lot of consumers are saying that
the picture quality is fantastic
in fact color calibration on these is
sometimes not even necessary and I'm I
would have to agree with that the
picture quality and the colors look
absolutely obviously you can't see this
on the camera like you wouldn't person
definitely go to a retailer check it out
in person but some of the benefits to
OLED is is absolutely silent
it makes no noise and the only way you
could really get good low-light detail
in movies was to go with plasma because
plasma had the best blacks reproduced in
the market now plasma unfortunately
they're a bit thicker panels they were
heavy as hell and the fact that they
buzzed anything that had bright white
images on a plasma TV buzzed like crazy
and speaking as someone who had and
still technically has a plasma TV
it was absolutely annoying to listen to
in fact it was it was it was so
distracting it really took away from the
movie viewing experience
now OLED gives you that same level of
detail in blacks and lowlights and grays
and it does it at anime
using Leith in panel this panel is only
a few millimeters thick it is absolutely
amazing now the downside is the lower
half of the TV is where all of the guts
and internals are contained
so obviously the thin panel is kind of
offset by the fact that it is thicker at
the bottom now while mounting this thing
like I did was a little bit of an
experience considering the fact that
unfortunately this TV does not natively
have any way to mount it out of the box
to the wall it does not use a standard
base amount does not use standard TV
mounts it uses LG's own proprietary
adjustable swing mount that you have to
purchase separately and you can get
those again for around 100 bucks not
entirely happy about that considering
this is a four thousand nine hundred and
ninety nine dollar TV at least at the
time of doing this video so I would have
thought that something like that would
have been included in such a high-end
model for connectivity it has three
sixty Hertz HDMI inputs as well as a
digital optical output to hook up to
your receivers making sound setup really
really simple but display is nearly
edge-to-edge with only a half inch bezel
on this TV and at 65 inches that is
extremely small you can see behind me
right now it is a glorious thing to not
have a giant bezel around your TV which
is always plagued a lot of flat panel
TVs although this is a curved flat panel
you kind of get what I'm saying it is
available in a flat version as well if
you're not really into the whole curved
thing also - one thing to mention what
the curve is depending on how far away
from the TV you're sitting is going to
dramatically affect how curved the TV
looks now for instance my sitting
distance from this TV is about 13 feet
and at that distance you don't really
notice much of the curve at all even on
off viewing angles but one thing I did
notice with the curve is that there's a
lot less glare and it's going to on the
off viewing angles the TV doesn't feel
like it's really on an off viewing angle
it's really subtle and it's really hard
to describe but when you are sitting
about 20 or 25 degrees off center of the
TV it still feels like it's facing you
and I always stop at the opposite side
that was facing away from you would feel
really skewed but that wasn't the case
at all especially at the viewing
distance and I'm at now the closer you
sit to the TV obviously it becomes a
little bit more exaggerated on that
curve and it's really going to depend in
your unique situation on how the curve
is going to feel for you some people
like curved some people don't and like I
said it is available also in a
flat-panel version if curved isn't your
thing there is some reflection and glare
that you have to be concerned about
because this is a semi glossy panel it's
not as glassy as a glass panel like you
would see on plasma TV however that's
one of the ways that they are achieving
such rich colors is having a glassy
panel and that is something to keep in
mind
now when the TV is on and you're
watching scenes moving and and bright
scenes and it doesn't really show up too
much but if you're watching a scene that
is really dark like say in a cave or
something like that it does show up a
little bit if you have rear mounted
lights in your TV room so that's
something to keep his mind now setting
up at this TV is probably one of the
easiest I have ever experienced the
moment you hook it up and you turn it on
you're greeted with this kind of a
friendly little blob that will move
around and guide you through the setup
and it sets you it helps you set up all
your inputs it asks you what's connected
to the TV it asks you what devices they
are what inputs they're on it asks you
what cable provider you're using or
satellite provider it will set up your
remote for all of that and in fact the
remote even acts like a Wii or instead
of having to navigate through a d-pad
you can just point the remote at what
you want to interact with and it's just
like using a Wii on the TV it I wasn't
expecting that and on top of that it
also has voice recognition where you can
control the TV with your freaking voice
things like this or making Star Trek
seem a little bit less like sci-fi and a
little more like reality now the menu
system and webOS on this TV is a lot
less intrusive than some other brands
that I have used in the past where
sometimes on other brands you hit menu
it brings up a huge menu and it shrinks
your viewing portal down to a tiny
little window in the corner and while
you're navigating and doing your thing
you can't really see what's happening on
the TV on this one when you operate the
menu it brings it up very subtle as an
overlay it's transparent it doesn't
shrink your picture at all and it's very
easy to navigate because as I mentioned
the remote control acts as a Wii now if
you're using some sort of a third-party
universal remote you
lose that feature however with this
remote you can't control all of your
popular devices with it and get it set
up very very simple so the LG remote
does also work as a universal which is
really nice now some of the really
annoying things that have happened with
other Smart TVs is if you're watching
net now I know we've all had this happen
and don't say it hasn't happened to you
let's say you're watching Netflix or
you're watching Hulu or Amazon TV or
something built into your TV and you
accidentally bump the button or you bump
escape and it kicks you out and you go
back to watching your set-top box and
you bring up menu again and you have to
start all over to find where you were
and this TV that's not the case it's
intelligent and it remembers what you
were doing where you were last and will
basically pause whatever your webOS
experience was when you exited so when
you go back to it it picks up flawlessly
right where you left off now what's
really cool is the fact that they've
also got a very high performance
processor in here that is keeping things
very real-time we're switching between
different webOS features different
players or different streaming services
built within with the TV it transitions
very very quickly very similar to just
switching channels on your set-top box
you can switch between the different
functions inside the TV now watching
things like Netflix 4k streaming Netflix
Amazon 4k or YouTube on this in 4k is
absolutely stunning 4k really is making
its way into your living room and it's
doing it through your network provider
first but DirecTV is one of the brands
that is also starting to bring you in
home 4k without having to use yo your
internet connection which is a problem
for some people who have data caps or
slow internet speeds now I'm extremely
impressed with this TV but at its price
tag I had better been impressed with it
otherwise something would have been
wrong now I mentioned in my vlog I don't
really watch TV but I never said I don't
watch movies I love watching movies I
love the home theater experience and
this TV really does make me feel
immersed inside of it now it also is a
3d TV and it does it without using
active shutter glasses which is
something that's always bugged me if you
have to put on active shutter glasses
they're heavy they're weighty they
require batteries and they just
very uncomfortable and unnatural to wear
while watching TV however because of the
way that 3d is utilized on this TV all
of the magic is happening on the TV and
the glasses aren't having to do anything
when it comes to decoding of the 3d
signal so when you put on their glasses
they're very lightweight like sunglasses
or even like going to the movie theater
or you don't have these big giant
weighty things chilling on your face and
they don't really obscure any of the
color or any of the clarity it's just an
amazing 3d experience and this is coming
from someone who has never liked 3d I've
I've never liked VR I've never liked 3d
my eyes weren't compatible with it it
gave me headaches but that's not the
case with this one so I'm happy to see
that 3d is evolving and so is the
picture quality as well as the latency
when it comes to 3d and it's absolutely
it's been a complete joy to watch some
3d contents like the last three 3ds our
DVDs I bought this is actually a 3d
movie right here I started buying 3d
discs because I'm enjoying it I'm
starting to finally see what the whole
3d crave was all about it's not
something I'll watch all the time but
it's nice to know that it's there if you
want it anyway guys it's time to get the
heck on out of here this has been my
kind of a high-level overview and my
user experience with the LG 65 eg 9600
they do have other versions and flavors
of this TV available also in Full HD
which is a 1080p model and all the way
up to a 77 inch behemoth and it is also
available in a flat-panel version as
well as I mentioned if curved isn't
really your thing once again got to give
a huge shout out to LG for sending me
this TV to take a look at and give you
guys my opinions on if you guys are
interested in winning your very own LG
Smart TV make sure you look down the
description LG is running a sweepstakes
this month where you could win your very
own lg tv anyway guys that's it I'm
gonna get on out of here I'm gonna
finish watching this movie here I
haven't actually watched the whole thing
yet on this TV and I really really want
to I've been watching a lot more movies
ever since receiving this thing which is
why you've seen a lot less videos from
me so if if you want to know why you're
seeing less videos well you just go
ahead and blame LG in there damn amazing
TVs because now I don't want to leave
the living room alright guys time to get
out of here thanks
watching and as always I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
