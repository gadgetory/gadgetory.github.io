today we are going to take a look at
another gtx 980ti graphics card i bet
you never saw that coming did you now
little bit earlier this year we took a
look at the gtx 980ti gaming 6g from msi
but they had pulled out all the stops
with the bigger brother lightning
edition card have you been putting off
water cooling your computer because
you're afraid that you're a klutz and
you're just going to screw it up well
that's okay because EK water blocks is
launching its brand new line of predator
water cooling loops that feature the
exact same components that you would
find and standalone custom built loops
already put together for you so go ahead
check out the pre-order link down in the
description and while you're there you
can buy back your man card trust me you
want that man card back do it now now
the lightning addition card has always
been built from the ground up with one
thing in mind can you guess what that
one thing is they even write it on the
card Oh see wait is backwards yeah see
overclocking now the lightning features
MSI's military-grade components which is
very top-shelf selected components to be
put on the PCB so that you get the
highest quality parts you possibly can
in this thing reducing the limiting or
at least some of the contributing
limiting factors of how far your
overclock could go now they also have
two BIOS on this thing there's a
standard BIOS and an ln2 file so we'll
talk about that as well in this video
because I had some interesting results
with that now also to because you're
talking about overclocking additional
TDP because this is a 375 watt TDP card
using 2 8 pin PCI Express powers and a 6
pin PCI Express like I said for 375 watt
TDP yeah 122 percent power limit as well
as a plus 50 millivolt on top of the
already over volted core on this thing
now of course just like all other 980ti
is it does feature 6 gigabytes of gddr5
that's running about 7,000 56 megahertz
which is a little bit faster than other
cards on the market but one of the
things that people have had experiences
with on this card is being able to not
only overclock the GPU pretty far but
also pushing the RAM to pretty insane
levels and we definitely tested that as
well now because overclocking cards can
get insanely hot they have a massive
cooler on this thing featuring five heat
pipes and a heatsink that runs
beyond the length of the card actively
cooling not only the core but also the
RAM and the VRM which is very important
because if you're going to increase
voltage you're going to increase the
frequency of the GPU you're going to
start exciting all those electrons and
things are going to get really hot
especially in the power delivery system
so this thing is keeping that nice and
cool now speaking of power delivery it's
got 14 phase power delivery for the GPU
as well as three-phase power delivery
dedicated to the RAM so they've really
thought this through on how they want
this card to be you know power delivered
to all of the components because this
card is tailored towards high-end
overclockers and like world-class
overclockers you do have harnesses that
plug into the back here so you can get
live physical readings of V Corps as
well as PLL and V droop so you're going
to be able to monitor things that matter
without relying on software because
software is not very accurate when it
comes to voltage monitoring now on the
back here giving the card more rigidity
because although it's a big giant card
as you can see here even compared to
their 6g card it is quite a bit bigger
it's taller and longer than the
reference model by quite a bit which can
give it a bit more heft although it is
heavy it's definitely not as heavy as
the all copper EVGA kingpin 980ti but
it's still pretty heavy nonetheless so
they've got a backplate on here to give
more rigidity it's black anodized
brushed aluminum with the Lightning logo
on here as well as the Lightning jet
which has always been like the mascot
for the Lightning series cards giving
you nice rigid support is 4 Way SLI
capable of course now one last thing to
mention before we start doing the
benchmarks because I know you guys are
sick of hearing about the specs on this
thing why don't you just show us the
numbers J's you shut up and George the
freaking numbers well I'm getting to
that I want to tell you about their
mystic lighting app though because the
Lightning logo right here as long as as
well as these white lines do light up as
well as being able to be controlled and
change the color the only unfortunate
thing is it sitting right next to a
bright yellow stripe so unless you're
putting a yellow light on there which is
by default or changing it to white it's
pretty much going to be a color clash no
matter what unless you're like a
die-hard Lakers fan you could make it
Lakers colors like purple and gold or
maybe your 49ers fan you can
red and gold or maybe although it's not
really Gold's more yellow maybe you can
be like really into Ironman so you can
make it red and yellow whatever so the
color is going to clash a bit with that
light but I am going to give MSI and a
for effort for including controllable
lighting on there which I think all
cards that cost $800 like this one
should definitely have so let's go ahead
and put this thing up against other 980
TI s and let's see exactly how well it
performs
so the 980ti lightning from MSI really
didn't disappoint I achieved over 1500
megahertz which is kind of a magical
number they're all the way up to 1530
now I was able to complete some tests
higher than fifteen thirty at fifteen
forty five but the problem was I was
getting intermittent crashing and once
they once you crash the test is
invalidated and you have to back off the
clock because if it can't pass one test
of the Suites the entire suite is
invalidated so I backed it off to
fifteen thirty and that's where we saw a
lot of success now I did overclock the
memory on this thing as I mentioned I
was going to do and achieved eight
thousand fifty megahertz eight thousand
fifty megahertz at 384 bit bus six
gigabytes of it that was I saw here I
saw pretty big gains by overclocking the
memory so that was kind of a big deal
and I did also overclock the kingpin
memory as well that was also a plus five
hundred on the memory for 1,000
megahertz overclock of the memory so
both these cards are very comparable
when you look at the chart on how well
it performed even when put it up against
the more expensive 980ti kingpin Edition
from EVGA what I found kind of funny was
the fact that the MSI Lightning card
pretty much beat the EVGA 980ti kingpin
in all the 1080p tests except for a
couple but the kingpin card was beating
the msi and the 1440p and 4k tests
pretty much every time so what I think
that is being attributed to is probably
the memory being used in the cards now I
can't confirm which memory is in here
and I did enquire with MSI unfortunately
they didn't get back to me in time
before recording this but it overclocks
very very well I don't know if it's Enix
I even searched the internet and
couldn't find I don't want to take the
cooler off the card I don't want to take
the car to part which obviously would
allow me to confirm what is in there but
otherwise I will say that the kingpin
card uses Samsung memory which is a much
tighter timing memory than Hynix so this
is using helix then that might account
for why the higher resolutions were a
little bit lower on the FPS now when I
say lower we're talking a couple of FPS
which is also well than the margin of
error but these were done on the same
exact drivers as
now one thing I want to point out is
that if you're going to use the ln2 BIOS
you need to know that there's not really
any boost clock on that BIOS it's
designed to be full manual overclocking
because the card only went up to twelve
hundred megahertz on the boost roll on
the ln to by us without boosts it just
went to twelve hundred megahertz and
that was it so obviously when I started
my test I noticed that it was getting
just smashed by all the other 980ti is
when we were comparing boost clocks and
I realized there was no boost clock
after asking MSI if that's the way it
was supposed to be which they did
confirm once I switched over to the
standard BIOS I was able to overclock
this thing all the way up to fifteen
thirty but what I found funny was I
couldn't get past fifteen hundred
megahertz flat on the ln2 BIOS but I
could get to fifteen thirty on the
standard and and was stable so I don't
know the voltage monitoring showed as
well that the voltage was the same on
both of those BIOS as well as the power
target so I'm not entirely sure what
changes with the ln2 BIOS but I do know
I was less stable and that BIOS and I
was on the standard so I just went to
the standard and moved on the standard
BIOS boosted up to fourteen eighteen on
its own and then I pushed it up to
fifteen thirty another 112 megahertz
overclock on this thing and it did great
so that's the MSI 980ti lightning it's
just obliterating games in 1080p as you
would expect if you're running a 1080p
panel with high refresh rate like 144
Hertz then this could be a single card
to max out your frame rates a refresh
rate of your monitors otherwise if your
gaming at 1080p again perfect card for
1080p 60 Hertz or higher but when it
comes to 4k though this card is still
not capable of running certain games at
4k at playable frame rates I'm sorry as
much as you put for kale over the box an
advertised 4k this card itself on games
like Crysis 3 far cry 4 The Witcher 3
not playable at 4k whatsoever you would
need SLI for that hope you guys enjoyed
this video and finally got it out so you
guys can leave me alone and I just want
to mention to Kyle Kyle awesomesauce
network did a very good impression of me
however I want to want to correct some
inaccuracies in that he did not use
nearly enough hair gray hair spray
whatever it is I'm Way more gray than
that and second of all but
a little J's mspaint servers getting 10
of these not 9 and the other 4 I have
well yeah I am strapping them to my bike
what of it got a problem come at me bro
I think payback might be an order
especially considering I'm sort of an
impressionist myself get ready for a
little payback maybe I ought to pay you
a visit
maybe we'll come over and smash you
surprised in the face that was kind of
mean order I'm just saying it's gonna
awkwardly stare at you now for like the
next 15 seconds not you guys I'm staring
at Kyle right now staring into his soul
yeah you guys don't want to see what I
just saw No</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
