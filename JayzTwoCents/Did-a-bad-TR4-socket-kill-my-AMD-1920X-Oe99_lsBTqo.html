another more the Board of test is with
the only other X 3 9 board I have is in
threader build and that's all hard-lined
can't get that out of there very easily
and yeah I'm just gonna go out there and
say that I absolutely positively hate
the thread Ripper retention system for a
limited time by a select EVGA GeForce
GTX 1080 TI or GT X 1080 graphics card
or laptop and get a free copy of destiny
2 for PC help save humanity's last safe
city by following the link in the
description below I mean I I mean what I
said
I absolutely hate I cannot think of
something I hate more than this stupid
retention system on thread Ripper let me
tell you why when I installed the CPU
the 1950 X inside of you know fat system
back there that was that was that Asus I
think we need to move this again nobody
so when I installed the 1950 X inside of
the thread Ripper build back there an
asus zenith extreme no problems
whatsoever tightening down the screws
piece of cake
threads caught right away no problem
whatsoever but this time around it's not
the same so I'm trying to do a review of
this inner max cooler that's designed
specifically for thread Ripper it's a
full cover block you can tell by the by
the size of the pump look at that is
massive right that ain't no that ain't
no that's so heavy
that's no asa tech bullshit right there
this is a real full cover block and I've
always liked the inner max all-in-one so
probably rank one of my favorites but
the problem is when I went to install my
1920 X on this Ora's board I just could
not get I just couldn't get it to latch
right and I finally got it down but I
don't think it's working because now as
you saw we're getting no post no attempt
to post double zero showing on the
motherboard led to sit there for several
minutes didn't pop up so now here I am
troubleshooting this goop
damn thermal paste everywhere now huh
Andy why you do this the problem here
now is normally a troubleshooting at
least with what we've got here is I
could grab another CPU another
motherboard off we go to see if it's
working but that's not the case with
Rison or the thread Ripper because I
don't have extras I've got one other
board and one other CPU and they're
being used in the hard line build and
I'm not tearing it apart to test this
stuff I guess I'm not a hundred percent
positive as to why they have to have
this damn torqued system here for
mounting a CPU I I mean I get it in the
sense that they are concerned about the
size of it maybe in that they I know I
mean that the cooler helps hold it down
so why do you have to have this crazy
spring loaded thing but let me show you
what I'm experiencing with this one okay
so I'm taking it off three two one and
the order it's supposed to be
I'm also not convinced that I don't have
damage to the CPU and let me tell you
why because prior to what you've already
seen here we were in the middle of
shooting another video as I showed and
we were having some serious problem
getting the damn latch to close and the
threads to catch and one of the reasons
why I'm making this video today is
because a lot of you a lot of you have
expressed concerns about your thread
Ripper systems and that the stupid thing
doesn't want to catch now that I'm gonna
do this inner max review I have to use
different thermal paste which is now
gonna skew the results a little bit
because I can't use their thermal paste
if we used it all on this I'm not sure
this is gonna pick up on camera but
there's something I want Nick to try and
see right here if you look right here
you see this indentation the pen right
next to it it looks like it's being
scratched and scratched to the point
where it looks like it's lifting because
it appears to be interfering with
something over here oh yeah do you see
that right there yeah okay so something
is interfering and hitting right there I
don't know what it is there's no debris
down in here and I'm installing it
exactly the way it's supposed to be but
let me show you guys what I'm dealing
with here so when I take this light this
down the little carrier that clicks into
place and then the backside here is sort
of spring-loaded like it's supposed to
be right that's one of the reasons why
it has to ice I think it's supposed to
be spring loaded the other one was too
that's one of the reasons why now you
have to torque this one first and then
that one last but what I'm experiencing
here is that it's not going down far
enough and I can't tell if something
back here is hitting so that's making
like a clicking sound I take this get
drank it number one started
I have to actually push down fairly hard
do that like I actually have to put
weight into getting that thread started
which I don't think it's supposed to but
anyway so we're gonna go1 another
problem I'm having here is there's no
like you can't look how much weight I'm
putting into that I'm actually bending
the whole board in box right so I can't
get these started very easily like on
the Asus board there was enough
threading on these screws to where I
could just do that and it would catch
now to get it to catch I'm putting so
much waiting to that I'm too fat to be
doing this so I cannot get number two to
catch now and this is what I was
experiencing earlier and I'm pretty sure
by the way that these retention systems
are sense by AMD or whoever doesn't
manufacturing to the motherboard
manufacturers and they implement them so
this is not a like anti gigabyte or anti
Oris I'm pretty sure that that's how it
works I don't think they're the ones
making the socket they're the ones
mounting the socket that's provided by
AMD so if I you see I cannot get it to
start that's the problem here this is
number two this is supposed to be say I
cannot get the damn thing to go now I
think I can get three on first
you know I can't get for you to go
either now so I'm pretty sure that this
is why I'm getting a no post because I
think this is jacked up in some way so
it appears to have completely blue
barred and borked my ability to do the
video I set out to do because it just
simply will not latch I mean if you get
in there if you get in there Nick you
can see right there the screws line up
there's just no tide like there's no
length to the screw it's not enough to
catch it I'm putting I'm putting like my
weight like my body weight this is not
the way it's supposed to be I'm printing
look at the box you see the box right
do you see this yeah let's do this again
there with all my body weight in it and
I'm a fat guy I finally got that to
catch okay that's really hard to turn
like I'm almost positive we're getting
more force than that than the actual
like okay there's that now let's try
number three I just want to reiterate
guys when I did the other build I did
not have to come a body weight into it I
just turned the screwdriver so I'm
convinced now that something is not
right now three when I'm pretty easy cuz
two is torquing it down right let's get
three on there so much try booting it
one more time and we'll see what happens
but I'm not I'm not feeling very
positive on this one especially since
like I showed you that pin has like that
scratch it's like a different color and
slightly lifted because it's almost like
it's interfering on something in there
let's get a shot all right so moment of
truth number two we just reseeded it
which is always AMD's like level one
tech support if someone's having problem
with tr4 it's always well did your seat
to keep you properly it's like I mean
you can pay a monkey to say that okay
still shows double zeros I don't know if
that actually cycles through anything
like others do
I don't think anything's gonna work to
be honest with you I'm have already done
clear CMOS I've done all that crap so
yeah
enter max I'll get to your bucket do
your review when I can but first I got
to get through the barrage of AMD
problems here but looking at the
motherboard though I can see I don't
know if Nick's probably not to be able
to get in there but there's a red LED
that's red LEDs everywhere right but
that one right there all right that guy
right there is lit up saying CPU which
is saying we have a CPU fault
so I've already receded it once you guys
have seen I can't get that thing torqued
down without putting my whole body
weight into it normally it's a pretty
solid all right like I said any problems
with the other one lots of you guys have
built tr4 systems with no problems but I
mean I've gotten a lot of messages from
people though with problems with getting
this torque down and working properly so
I don't know if it's a QR or QA issue
you know Quality Assurance issue or what
but at this point yeah I don't know
where to go next if you guys are having
problems let me know in the comments
below thanks for watching guys and as
always I'll see you in the next one if
it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
