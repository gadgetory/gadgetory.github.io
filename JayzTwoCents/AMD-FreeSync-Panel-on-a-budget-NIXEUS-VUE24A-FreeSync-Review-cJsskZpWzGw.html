probably noticed that there's been a bit
of a trend over the last couple of years
when it comes to monitor technology it's
getting really being expensive so today
I am talking to the PC gamer who wants
something more than a super basic
no-frills 60-hertz panel and to do that
we are going to be taking a look here at
the NIC seus if I get the whole thing in
the frickin panel here the NIC CS NX
viele 24 a 144 Hertz
one millisecond response time AMD
freesync gaming panel yeah that's a
mouthful and I'm not really that strong
it's not in the boxes right there I mean
I think I was that strong did you the
mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro from
Coolermaster combines modularity with
creativity giving you the freedom to
build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description now I could spend all kinds
of time just going through all the specs
of this monitor but I'm not going to do
that because I don't want to waste your
time with a bunch of boring numbers if
you're a numbers geek like I am just
look in the description of this video
and I will list out all of the specs so
you could know what the max brightness
looks like and all of that sort of stuff
but on the high side this is a 24 inch
TN panel yeah I know the TN is going to
make some people kind of go mmm
but hear me out on this here in order to
keep things priced competitively and
give you the best bang for your buck TN
panels are still where that price point
technology is going to be but we will
talk about some of the color uniformity
and some of the off viewing angles and
stuff and whether or not it's really bad
it's actually not I've been using this
panel now for over two months and I
think it does a fantastic job but well
we'll get into that in a little bit but
when it comes to viewing angles it's 170
degrees horizontal viewing angle and 160
degrees vertical so it's got near 180
viewing but as you guys know a TN panels
as you get towards the edges of those
viewing angles then it's going to start
to get more color shift and as T n tends
to do it is an led-backlit panel and
they're advertising a one millisecond
response time for gray to gray that's
the amount of time it takes to the pixel
to go to full off which is technically
gray to full brightness white and then
back to gray now it's also featuring a
100%
and 44 Hertz refresh rate which is how
many times the screen can actually in
sync reef and that's not the music group
by the way 90s are that way that's
basically how many times the screen can
refresh the image and keep everything
together without tearing or in this case
it hurts is how many times per second so
144 times a second this screen can draw
an image without tearing it apart and
then on top of that it features AMD
freesync technology which does a better
job at keeping things in sync than just
vertical sync now the AMD freesync in
here is adaptive from 30 Hertz to 144
Hertz so that means that regardless of
how much your fps is bouncing around the
AMD freesync technology built into the
panel is going to keep things nice and
buttery smooth but the built-in adaptive
free sync does have a effective range of
30 Hertz to 144 Hertz now pretty much
all the high-end panels out there now
are featuring you know q HD and Ultra HD
IPS high refresh rate low response time
you know super accurate color gamut and
it's just one of those things that a lot
of gamers aren't going to need and
necessarily notice now if you were a
professional content creator or photo
editor then you're going to want the
super high accuracy color recreation
that IPS panels offer but if you're a
gamer that's probably not going to
matter to you nearly as much now at the
time of making this video the panel
comes in under $300 the reason why I
mentioned that is the fact that that is
a pretty good price point considering
all of the other panels that are
featuring either g-sync or even free
sync on other manufacturers are coming
in way more expensive than that so
you're going to get a lot of bang for
your buck at under $300 now it does
feature built-in speakers but as you
guys know built-in speakers really
aren't like you know great on panels so
it's there but I wouldn't I wouldn't use
that as your main source of audio trust
me but it's got a DisplayPort 1.2 a
which you have to use if you want to
take advantage of the free sync and it
has HDMI 1.4 in there as well as DVID
and a 15 pin VGA port which nobody
should ever be using why would you buy a
gaming panel and use VGA I mean
seriously
but honestly none of that matters if
it's not a good gaming experience and
your panel has a lot to do
your overall gaming experience so let's
turn around here let's take a look at
the refresh rate let's move some stuff
around on the screen do the best we can
to really tell you about this panel when
you know it's just a camera pointing at
the screen it's not going to do it
justice but there are some things to
mention with this panel that are
definitely worth talking about for
instance light bleed on this thing is
near non-existent I mean there's no way
the camera pointing at it is going to be
able to pick up the lack of light bleed
which LED and LCD edgelet panels are
notorious for that just doesn't exist
with this guy now does have some
built-in cable management here at the
bottom unfortunately the way the cables
come off and have to go through that
hole being at the bottom they're going
to be visible I would have liked that
hole to been higher up in the back of
the panel that way this wouldn't have
been sticking out right there but it is
a height-adjustable panel it's a pretty
decent standard it's actually very very
sturdy there's a button here that you
push with your thumb and then you can
move it up and down and you have a
pretty good amount of height adjustment
in there and then of course it can
rotate 90 degrees my cables need more
slack to be able to do it but it does
rotate a full 90 degrees if you want to
use it in portrait mode instead of
landscape mode and that's important for
you know people who want to do
programming and stuff on a panel like
that but whatever it's very very sturdy
and of course it does rotate quite a few
degrees and then it goes up and then it
'angels down now in terms of color
banding as you can see the gradient on
here is very very very smooth some of
the lesser quality panels tend to have a
lot of jaggedness when it comes to the
amount of banding I'm actually not sure
with the official term is for that but
you can see here the gradient is very
very smooth and when it comes to light
bleed man this is one of those things
that's definitely hard to do with a
regular camera pointing at the screen
but I can tell you right now that the
screen is on I know it doesn't look like
it but the screen is on you know in fact
you can tell because the mouse is right
there but a lot of times LCD and LED
panels tend to have a lot of light bleed
here they're on the top or on the bottom
or in the corners kind of shooting out
from the corners this does not suffer
from that and it's absolutely in
credible how well they built this panel
on a TN technology with LED and does not
have any light bleed this is one of
those things you just have to take my
word for it the camera doesn't pick it
up nearly as justified as it is in
person I was blown away by how little
light bleed there was compared to some
of the more expensive panels that are
just bleeding all over the place
literally like a gunshot victim now it
does have an on screen display that you
can use for just things like brightness
contrast gamma D CR you can do color
temperature color custom calibrations if
you want when you hit the menu it even
tells you which current resolution input
and refresh rate is so in this case it's
a 144 Hertz
we do have AMD freesync enabled in
catalyst control center or whatever
they're calling it these days I don't
even know and then you can control your
horizontal vertical you know on-screen
display settings time out so the screen
turns off if it's not you know receiving
an input over a certain amount of time
and then volume control and a massive
master reset now it's all controlled via
physical buttons that actually stick out
the bottom of the screen and are labeled
here with correspondent you know raised
hieroglyphics if you will so you know
which button you're pushing again unlike
a lot of high end panels where it's all
capacitive touch and you don't know
which ones which you're just guessing
and there are panels out there that
costs over $1000 that have terrible
button placement and integration so
Bravo on that now it is a TN panel so as
you start to get towards that off
viewing axis you are going to notice
that color shift and that is something
that is very notorious with TN you just
can't get away from that it's just the
way the panel is but most of the time
you're going to be sitting directly in
front of your monitor so it really
shouldn't be a huge deal now I'm
actually very impressed with the color
uniformity and that coming from someone
who's been using IPS panels for a while
now and and considering this is out of
the box and I haven't done any sort of
calibration on this the colors actually
don't look bad they don't look washed
out and they don't look like other TN
panels which are just ridiculously
oversaturated it looks really really
good now the way that you can tell that
you know 144 Hertz refresh rate is
working is as you move this thing around
the screen my camera can't even capture
the movement it looks like it's
flickering on camera it's
it's just the frame rate and the shutter
speed of the camera are not fast enough
to actually pick up this smooth movement
all you got to do to make sure the
freesync is turned on is go into your 80
AMD Radeon settings go into the display
tab and then make sure the AMD freesync
is turned on right here it is reporting
a 30 to 144 Hertz refresh rate so we're
good to go and one of the things I
really like about this panel is the fact
that it is a non glare display so it is
a matte display which is not going to be
you know causing you all sorts of
reflections and stuff which some 4k
panels and other gaming panels do most
most are not doing that anymore but I do
like the matte display it does cause the
colors to be a little bit less vibrant
but that's okay because I would rather
see ow
sons of bitches BAM
Oh YouTube the refresh rate obviously is
very very smooth as you would expect we
are getting right now 111 FPS our
average is 107 our minimum is 93 I want
to see here if you guys are curious my
AMD r9 390 from MSI the 8g version is
running right now at 69 C fans are at
1400 and 44 rpm and the GPU is at 100%
all that's right here that's the NZXT
cam software that's doing that so I'm
doing here is I'm doing a lot of quick
spins and stuff to try it see and yes I
use motion blur I like motion blur don't
judge don't hate you don't use it don't
use it don't tell me not to use it I
want to use it so therefore I'm using it
but it's very very smooth I'm not
getting any sort of tearing or
stuttering whatsoever that's pretty
ridiculous right that's a ridiculous
amount my fps is 125 while it's doing
that I'm not getting any tearing I am
very very pleased with this now I think
the bottom line here is it really
doesn't make sense to spend a ton of
money on your panel if you don't have
like super-high and hardware to go along
with that now most gamers don't fall
into these super rich super high-end PC
super enthusiasts have to have the
latest and greatest most expensive
overpriced piece of
equipment on the market that's my job
but if you're a gamer specifically one
with an AMD graphics card whine to get a
better gaming experience without
breaking the bank then you can
definitely consider the NIC seus vo e24
panel to be one of those that definitely
fits the bill now there's been very few
panels that i've ever truly recommended
and i think that this is one of those
and I'm really glad I chose to take a
look at it I'll be honest it's one of
those brands that I never really paid a
whole lot of attention to but I'm glad
that I did because it really opened up
my eyes how far panel technology is
coming and how inexpensive it is
starting to really become and it makes
it more affordable unobtainable towards
the average Joe PC gamer which is what
I'm trying to do I'm trying to get back
to some of those more average roots when
it comes to showing you guys things that
you can actually obtain it's like
watching videos about Ferraris it's
really nice but after a while you go you
know I'm never going to own a Ferrari
and this is just depressing but if you
were in the market for a 1080p high
refresh rate low response time panel
with free sync and you have an AMD
graphics card so you can take advantage
of that free sync but even if you don't
have an AMD graphics card you can still
take advantage of the high refresh rate
then the next CSV o 24 needs to be on
your shortlist really glad I took a look
at it guys thanks once again for Nick
SIA sending me this panel and of course
thank you you guys for checking out
today's video speaking of video if you
guys are interested on some of the car
stuff that I do I have rebranded and
relaunched my vlogging channel as a both
blog and car channel where you guys can
see more of what I do on the side of
just the PC stuff and it's definitely
worth taking a look at especially if you
want to see a guy like me who's pretty
mediocre and average when it comes to
knowing how to use power tools hand
tools and work on cars really every
video is probably going to include the
title of idiot because yeah that's kind
of what I am anyway I'm get out of here
guys thanks for watching it as always I
will see you in the next video Oh easy
pink
if you think oh you trying to be trying
to take the camera
hey JT camera Roger careful I bumped
your head sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
