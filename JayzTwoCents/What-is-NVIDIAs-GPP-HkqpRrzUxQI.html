didn't need any more GPU controversy
we've got a lot to talk about today
I waited specifically to make this video
to see if any new news would come to
light regarding this and I think I've
got enough information and an
understanding of the situation to
actually talk about Nvidia's GeForce
Partner Program and what that means to
the AI B's as well as the consumer
take your system from boring to awesome
quickly and easily with cable mod made
from premium materials and crafted with
care cable mod offers everything from
cable extensions custom right-angled USB
3.0 and SATA cables and their new line
of Pro Series complete custom kits I
quickly raised the bar in terms of
performance and aesthetics learn more
about how cable mod can help you bring
your system to the next level by
clicking the link in the description
below this story broke last week with
Kyle Bennett over at Hart OCP putting on
an article about the GeForce Partner
Program and how it is potentially
anti-consumerism and anti-competitive or
anti competition which is borderline
actually anything is borderline they
castrated illegal here in the United
States just ask Intel they were hit with
a 1 billion dollar anti-competitive
lawsuit not that long ago and yeah
Nvidia might be heading right down that
path but anyway I digress let's talk
about this for a second here I'm putting
a link to Kyle's article down below
pretty much all the main publications
have already picked this up so you can
probably find a lot of different
perspectives on this but Kyle is the one
I'm referencing because he was the one
who broke the story and NVIDIA actually
came forward and made a public blog
about the GPP and what it was what it
meant for consumers because they wanted
to get ahead of Kyle's story and I think
potentially do some damage control here
but this is a this is big news and I I'm
still not entirely sure how I feel about
this because I'm not lawyer and I don't
know what the legalities are and I tend
to understand that there's a usually a
bit of a difference between legal and
ethics and already ethics with major
tech companies already comes into
question all the time but that's besides
the point so the GPP or the geforce
partner program isn't is a a program of
incentives for AIB zorad inboard
partners to sign up for to give you
additional benefits to working more
closely with NVIDIA now we're here's
what we're going to do we're going to
talk about what currently happens with a
with a product launch we're going to
talk about the brand's the way they're
naming works and we're going to talk
about how the GPP fits into all of this
this right here is the gtx 1080 TI this
launched a good year after the gtx 1080
so rewind back to May of 2016 when the
pascal family of GPUs launched in Austin
Texas with the GTX 1080
1070 yeah almost two years ago that's
how long we've been living with this
family of GPUs the only card that was
available at launch was the founders
Edition card which was kind of a
historic event because it was the first
time that Nvidia resided in the retail
space selling direct to consumers in the
past
Nvidia made their reference cards sure
and those were the models that were sent
out to publications and tech analysts to
review and then the board partners were
able to actually sell the reference card
so they sold the reference style card
through the AI bees that's why you'd go
on to New Ager wherever and find the
reference style cooler available through
MSI or EVGA or gigabyte ace use whatever
that was how Nvidia sold to the consumer
Cass Gill was the first time that they
sold full-time available after launch
continuing through the launch to
consumers directly so what that also
meant was they were keeping an
allocation of the GPS for themselves
which we've learned over time was
usually the best binned GPUs which is
why the founders card performed on par
if not better than many of the custom
cards but that was a conversation for a
different day that's how the launch
worked you typically didn't see the
custom cards for a month or two after
the launch of a new family of GPUs and
of course as more cards came down the
line the 1066 gig the 1080 TI 1070 TI
you would see custom cards available at
the time of launch because the family
wasn't new and NVIDIA you know they
didn't care about the fanfare as much as
advertising their new line of products
so that's how typically launch has
worked in the past
now the geforce partner program promises
additional benefits to those who sign up
for including the pimping and promoting
of the custom cards at events typically
go to an nvidia event all they show is
the reference card the reference coolers
and all the boxes and stuff because
that's their product but one of the
benefits of the GPP is your custom cards
get a lot of that shared marketing you
know material as well promoting their
partners not just their own brand and
that's something Nvidia hasn't done a
lot of in the past so that seems like on
the surface a very good incentive
something else they offer are
apparently prioritization of allocation
of cores obviously right now with GPUs
as scarce as they are because of what
the cryptocurrency mining farms have
done to the market is made it very very
difficult because remember like I said
earlier Nvidia is not selling all the
cores to the AI bees they're keeping a
pretty good chunk of them for themselves
as well which puts additional strain on
the business that these guys are trying
to trying to perform they're trying to
keep their businesses alive through all
of this you know fiasco as well when it
comes to to mining so you take what's
left over and the GPP partners or the
the GPP part of the partner partners
they get prioritization over those who
have not signed up so if you are a soos
or your MSI and you're trying to build
cards and you're having to scrounge or
scrape the bottom of the barrel with
everyone else who hasn't signed up then
your business is going to suffer so
potentially a strong-armed tactic one
that NVIDIA knows there's incentive up
it's basically a fast pass for GPU
allocation and we all know what it's
like to stand in line for two hours and
that guy just walks up and goes I got a
fast pass and walks on the line but you
can't be mad at that guy because he
signed up for that fast pass he did it
before you and he's getting the benefits
so that's technically how that part
works the other thing that's very
significant with the GPP is the fact
that you would potentially be included
in launch days and what I mean by that
is let's say the 2080 card or whatever
it's being called is launched right
that's coming up presumably this year
we've we've had a two-year family of
card now instead of having that month
delay before your custom cards get out
you're included in the early access part
of GPP meaning you can design your cards
ahead of time ahead of those not a part
of the GPP and have your cards showcased
at launch giving you a piece of that day
one hype which can lead to very big
sales so those are the three major
things that have been you know sort of
uncovered on what the GPP means now
NVIDIA wants you to believe that the GPP
is all about a consumer experience it's
all about a transparent and consistent
experience across the board well how do
they do that
well what Kyle's article over at heart
of sepia stating is that there is India
agreements now he has a copy of this
agreement he has not shared it more than
likely due to legal reasons he has
uncovered that there is a line in there
that states that the GPP partners must
be aligned exclusively with nvidia this
is the part where there's a lot of
confusion the question is whether or not
Asus or MS I can only sell Nvidia cards
or can they only do it under certain
naming conventions for instance in
videos after that gaming lineup that the
the the Auris extreme the MSI gaming X
the Asus Republic of gamers obviously
these tricks is a sub category of
Republic of gamers but where the lot of
the confusion is and one of the reasons
why I waited to do this article is that
what we're not clear of because kit guru
also did an article on this trying to
tell everyone like hey you're blowing
this out of proportion is what's not
clear is whether or not Asus can sell or
Republic of gamers AMD card which is on
the top right here because look these
look identical right as a consumer
Nvidia doesn't want an AMD product to
look like an Nvidia product NVIDIA knows
that gamers are going to walk into a
store and they're going to buy something
that says Damon I mean let's face a
gaming is put on everything gaming power
supplies Gaming motherboards gaming
graphics cards obviously GPUs you know
the remain stream are gonna be for
gaming obviously every motherboard is
capable of playing games it's kind of
like when they put VR ready on a
keyboard right it's ridiculous they know
consumers are going to align themselves
with that gaming brand especially soui
we're unique those you and I we are
enthusiasts about this most of us we are
here because we love this we are nerds
we want to learn about this and we know
what we're talking about most of the
time and we can see through the
marketing mumbo jumbo of putting gaming
on everything but the average consumer
you walk into a Fry's Electronics and
you're there to buy a GTX 1060 because
you know that that's the card you
hypothetically mining prices out you
know out of the way you can afford a six
you know gtx 1060 you walk in and you
see this where you see this these are
both gtx ten 60's
knows that most people are gonna go for
this so that's why they're trying to
control the the marketing side of the
gaming line well what we don't know is
whether or not and this is what kate
guru's article kind of goes into is
they're stating no you could you could
make a republic of gamers line of AMD
GPUs it just couldn't be Strix if Strix
is the nvidia line it could be something
else
well the initial article on what kyla
stating is that the entire republic of
gamers line would have to be nvidia but
the thing is AI bees don't have to sign
up for the GP p it's just based on the
scenarios that i've already explained
it's obviously in their best interest to
do that because they don't want to be
left on a launch day they want to be
left out on allocation and they want the
additional marketing I don't know if
it's legal or not to force a brand to
only be able to sell Nvidia product
under a certain naming convention
because member this belongs to Asus this
is a CSI P the names the Republic of
gamers are Strix all that stuff belongs
to Asus but now NVIDIA is trying to
control that and that's where it starts
to get really dicey in terms of what's
legal and what's not not only that
you've already got a brand that you have
built up the reputation of Republic of
gamers goes back a long time the MSI
gaming series not as long but has gotten
a very high reputation of being a very
well-built robust beefy card anyone who
has held an MSI gaming X of either AMD
or Nvidia knows that these cards are
behemoths they are built to last
and they built that name that reputation
all on their own through no help of AMD
or Nvidia this is all in-house marketing
research design and NVIDIA is trying to
control that so yeah you could just say
Oh we'll find just rename it make it
something else but now what you've done
is you just diluted your own brand and
you're starting a new brand sub brand
that you're hoping will gain traction
when you've already spent all that time
and effort to build up your your entire
line of gaming products so that is where
the ethics on this really come in as
well as the legality of things because
the question is whether or not they can
even legally do that now the AIB is
they're the ones that are caught in the
middle of all of this the consumer yeah
it sounds like Nvidia
trying to to stifle AMD competition a
little bit but not as much as initially
thought because if they can still sell
the AMD brand under a different line the
AIB is take on the additional cost of
marketing and packaging and boxing and
all that stuff for another line of
product but let's be honest here a lot
of these companies have multiple lines
of product for instance we've got msi
here right so we've got the gaming but
oh this is even off camera but now
you've got the arrow is that off camera
Nick how about I do this we'll fix it
there yeah so you've got the arrow line
of product there there are multiple
lines so the question is I mean how much
would it really cost the brand to do
that but I think the bigger issue here
is the fact that Nvidia is even trying
to get involved with the way that AI
bees are doing business this is one of
those things where time is gonna have to
tell but it the three things that the
three incentives I've listed these are
major these are major things that impact
the way these AI bees are able to do
business and it means that obviously
with Nvidia holding over 70% of market
share they're gonna want to follow those
trends and do what it takes to sell
cards that they know are going to sell
they know that not getting involved with
the GPP is going to hurt them in the
long run just on GPU allocation alone
lost marketing efforts as well as the
day one graphics launches when it comes
to new families of GPUs now I've reached
out to a lot of people for comment
obviously nobody will talk about this
this is this is like it's like you you
mentioned GPP and everyone just shuts
down they don't talk to you what does
that mean if this is so good and NVIDIA
is so proud of this what why won't
anybody talk about it obviously an
exclusive brand with nvidia is already a
GPP but are they going to get the same
benefits are they going to get the same
early access to course sort of early
access to new launches or is this
intended specifically to create a
problem for AMD something else worth
noting though is AMD is the one that
also really pushed for this article to
go out there and AMD is not innocent in
a lot of the marketing stuff that's
happened in the past
AMD's played their games it's just now
the consumer is being affected by this
with the games being played with these
major business chess pieces all right
guys we're gonna go sound off in the
comments below I'm curious as to what
you guys think about
this fanboy isms aside try and put your
fanboy isms aside I know Andy fans are
gonna be screaming you know Lynch
in-video lynch mob lynch mob and of
course Nvidia fanboys are gonna be like
whatever doesn't matter we're better try
and keep all that aside I know it's hard
I know it's hard but I'm curious as to a
real discussion on what you guys think
about this the question is whether or
not it's legal and I don't know I'm not
a lawyer so I can't answer any of that
but I do know the myth them home what
you mentioned this with anybody man do
they shut you down fast and will talk to
you so we're gonna go guys
thanks for watching today's video go and
check out the link in the description
below like I said - Kyle's original
article and just do a Google search for
NVIDIA GPU lined a ton of articles out
there alright guys thanks for watching
hopefully this turns out better than
what it appears could be happening
time will tell as always guys we'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
