graphics card that can give you a very
good gaming experience then you've no
doubt heard all the rumors about the AMD
r x 480 that have everyone has been
waiting on hearing about for a long time
and you guys have been told over and
over Jo June 29th June 29th you can hear
about June 29th that you all kept asking
how does it perform well guys I've got
the 8 gig model right here I put it
through a gambit of tests and we're
gonna talk about that we're gonna talk
about this card where it belongs how I
feel about it and whether or not you
should even consider it whether you're
looking for a pump reservoir custom GPU
block or a complete loop and a box
output Kools wide range of products can
make your next water cooling adventure
an easy one click the link in the
description for more details now quick
disclaimer before we get into the
benchmarks I know we promised we'd get
right into it but I want you guys to
understand what it is you're seeing here
I use the same test I always do with all
of my graphics cards and I left ashes at
the singularity out not because I don't
trust it the devs have actually made
changes on that so the textures look the
same regardless of the GPU load it's the
fact that I'm still having problems with
the damn benchmark for some reason
getting very erratic results not what
this card but with some of the other
cards that I was testing with it so I'll
come back to it but the other thing too
is I compared it to the Sapphire 3 ATX
Nitro Edition which is a custom PCB 3
ATX Nitro which was the previous last
gen 380 series card from AMD and I
compared it to the 970 SSC which yes is
a more expensive card by more than $100
at the time of launch
I don't know current pricing is this
exact moment but at the time of launch
it was more than $100 more than this
card so why did I do that
well when AMD was here I they actually
came to my office here spent time with
me and we went over the card so I could
understand more about this card and why
it exists and where it's designed to
compete and I flat out asked the
question who is this card aiming at who
is this card trying to take down when it
comes to performance
they said for pricing it's aimed more
right where the 960 launched for
performance it's got the 970 straight in
its crosshairs
so did it actually compete with the 970
at a much lesser price well it's
the benchmarks and find out
now obviously when you look at those
benchmarks you can see that in most of
the test the 970 edge did this guy out
by just a little bit but I want to point
something out that 970 is an EVGA SSC
super-super clocked so you've got the
970 reference and then you've got the
super clock and then you've got these
super super clock which actually has
extra power phases and stuff in it so it
is not a standard 970 it's actually a
custom PCB with more power and more
frequency in it whereas this is just a
reference card now why didn't I use just
a standard 970 in the test easy I don't
have one
so I couldn't actually go back and
retest it but yeah I digress that's
exactly how that 970 SSC performed when
it launched versus how this is
performing on the latest crimson drivers
which obviously we had early access to I
did ask if the drivers were gonna change
between when I did my test and now and
when you guys can get them and they said
no so that's that's it that's that's the
way you guys should be getting it
hopefully as long as nothing goes wrong
but as you could see in some tests -
with 1440p and even 4k although this is
not a 4k card neither at the 970 neither
is the 380 X I just want to see how they
scaled under like 100% massive load
where the graphics card is just buckling
under the weight of all of those pixels
and it held its own very very well
edging out the 970 in quite a few tests
and as you guys could see at 1080 it was
like right there with the 970 trailing
behind it just a little bit in some
tests but then just like you know
completely pimps lapping in another test
which is very impressive considering the
card has 8 gigabytes it's a twelve
hundred and sixty-six megahertz core
which is the highest core clock we've
seen yet from anything to come out of a
Indies camp especially at this price
point and that it's running eight
thousand megahertz effective memory so
the four gigabyte version is exactly the
same it's just cut down to four
gigabytes 256-bit memory bus all of that
now it also has something that I thought
was really neat because I opened up MSI
Afterburner and I wasn't expecting this
I was actually directed to go into the
control center for crimson and then go
into the global settings in
side of where all the games are and then
you actually have overclock control
within the driver so it's a driver level
overclocking available onto this card
well you don't have to war lie on
third-party software to integrate for it
like MSI Afterburner or any of the other
software I guess that the other
companies launch you can actually do
driver level overclocking with this
which was very nice to see you could
control things like fan curve you can
even control the P States now P states
are a lot like GPU boost where it's
going to under certain load conditions
it's going to go to a certain frequency
and certain voltage control so you guys
are sometimes people ask me I don't
understand why it'll be in the middle of
a test and then suddenly it'll drop down
like a step of megahertz and then it
will step up and then will step down why
is it doing that well guys that's all
pistes and this is something that is
actually being you're giving access to
now with AMD where you can actually
control those P States and actually
control the voltage or each one of those
individually which is giving you a much
better overclocking experience in my
opinion now this does all of this guys
at 150 watt total TDP single six pin
connector as well as 75 Watts coming
through the PCIe Lane 450 watt TDP it is
not a power draw whatsoever now the card
obviously got hot but that's a blower
style cooler which you should expect
from any blower style cooler with a very
conservative fan curve the way it ships
out of the box it would rather it be
very quiet and get hot then being noisy
and not as hot so I turned up the power
or the fan curve to see what would
happen
temperatures drop down below a DC
obviously the decibels of it went very
high another thing I tested for with
this card was coil whine and I'm pleased
to announce that it is very low on coil
whine it was not intrusive it was not
like the fury where the fury was just
coil winding like crazy I'm screeching
like a banshee no this was not noisy at
all in an open air test bench when it
comes to coil whine one thing I want to
point out though is they did remove the
DVID connector from the back of the
cards so if you are using a monitor and
you're using a DVI cable you're gonna
have to either switch over to
DisplayPort or get yourself a
DisplayPort to DVI adapter or something
like that where you can then plug it
into your card they did say that the
board partners are gonna have access
to solder points that are on the PCB so
they can add that back so that's
something you're gonna have to look for
when it comes to the custom board
partner cards to see exactly what
they're gonna be throwing in now look at
the sides that PCB right it looks like a
pretty big card not well not pretty big
it's a pretty decent length like average
size card but you can see here the PCB
is actually very short and it's very
dense it allowed them to go with a
bigger heatsink on here
have the blower hang off the back and
push air across the entire length of the
card but again it's gonna be up to the
board partners on what type of cooling
solutions are going to come up with
inevitably you know they're gonna come
up with multi fan solutions that blow
down on the card so it's gonna be
interesting to see if it stays as short
as this or if you're going to be doing
custom PCB options to make it longer so
they can fit all those fans on there or
if they're just gonna over hang the heat
seek off the back of the card and do
fans across it anyway
which we've seen men do in the past now
one thing that AMD also advertises what
this card is that it is VR capable now
there's a lot of Technology going on in
graphics cards when it comes to VR and
I'll admit that I'm not prepared to talk
about that today that is gonna be
something that needs to happen on
another video and now that I have
purchased my HP's HTC vive I can
actually do some VR testing because
graphics cards go under intense load
when it comes to VR and the level of
consistency they have to draw the frames
so if this was having any trouble it
would be very very noticeable and we
will check that out just unfortunately
not today but I think right now if
you're looking for a new graphics card
and you've only got about 200 to 240
dollars to spend the fact that you came
for 239 bucks get an 8 gigabyte card 8
gigahertz effective memory speed 1266
megahertz and guess what I was able to
actually overclock this to 1360 that's
the highest core clock I've gotten on
any AMD card I have ever touched in the
history of me doing this channel yeah
this little guy just seems to keep
surprising us and that's the thing
everybody hyped this card hyped hyped
hype type type type type and I hate hype
train because often hype trains derail
but that didn't happen here
this card continued to impress me the
more I played around with it doom 3
1440p high settings 60 FPS no problem
whatsoever I can't wait to see what the
custom
cards are gonna hold from the board
partners and you know I'm going to
review those so keep your eyes peeled
for that anyway guys we went on sale
today June 29th our X 480 you guys tell
me what you think did it did it hold up
to the hype you know there's a ton of
videos out right now about this tons of
reviews so go and check those out not
just don't just take my word for it
please please do yourself a favor watch
all the reviews or at least two or three
of them to kind of get a better sampling
of what's happening we all have a little
bit different test methodology we all
use a little bit different settings and
I think it's important for you to kind
of try and develop a big picture based
on what multiple people were saying and
not just Jay said bababa blah but there
you go our X 480 I'm nicknaming this
thing the little beast because it really
is well as she isn't the first thing
I've named the little beast but I
digress so with all that said this card
sits pretty much all alone in the sub
$300 range when it comes to the graphics
cards when I say sub 301 mean deep 199
right 4 4 gig 239 for 8 gig that's a
pretty big deal and because it's sitting
all alone right there in that price
point that is where most people shop is
right around there that well there's
some statistic out there it's like 85%
of people shop for graphics cards that
are $250 or less right now it's all by
itself so the ball is in an invidious
court to see how they're gonna respond
to because we all know that competition
in the space is great for consumers so
we need some competition out there and
right now AMD clearly wins this price
point for now anyway guys thanks for
watching tell me what you thought let me
know if this card lived up to the hype
or did it disappoint sound off in the
comments hit me up on Twitter or come to
Facebook if you don't want to do any of
those things well then hopefully I'll
see you in the next video if you're new
here hit the subscribe button it's um
it's guaranteed way to know when I put
up a video so that you can just like
make fun of me that's more that's fun
that's a fun pastime there's plenty of
ammo waiting for you guys just to shoot
alright I don't know what else I'm gonna
say so I guess it's time to go alright
guys thanks for watching I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
