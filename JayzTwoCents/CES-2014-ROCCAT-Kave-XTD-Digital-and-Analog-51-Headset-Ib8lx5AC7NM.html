insider coverage of CES 2014 our trend
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you okay
guys now we've talked about headsets in
the past and headsets are one of those
things where most people are going to
have that one that they like and a
question that's commonly asked about
gaming headsets is 5.1 or 5.1 simulated
versus true 5.1 but what we're looking
at right here are a couple of true 5.1
headphones here from Roccat now these
are called the crave or excuse me the
cave cave XT DS this is the digital
version and this is the analog now the
digital as you can see right here has
what looks like a mixer but it's not
it's actually very unique in a couple of
ways you have your volume control on
here as you would expect but this also
has Bluetooth capability now with the
bluetooth capability let's say you're
gaming and you got a phone call or
something on your cell phone and you
know you're in a raid or something and
you tell your rate hey hold on I got a
phone call and it's noisy because you're
taking your headphones off and
everyone's waiting for you you could
simply push this little phone button
right here if you have this sync to your
phone and the moment you push that your
gaming headset now becomes your
integrated headphone device for your
smartphone or any Bluetooth capable
phone of course you have your mute
switch on here but what's also really
interesting is even though this is USB
interface you do have 5.1 analog here on
the back so you could use this as a
pass-through for your PC as well as a
5.1 speaker set so let's say you want to
switch back and forth between your nice
5.1 receiver or your headphones
depending on you know if you want to do
quiet gaming in the evening so you don't
wake up your kids you know which I deal
with on a regular basis you could switch
to the headphones but if it's the
daytime and you don't feel like blaring
out your neighbors you could switch to
your receiver all through that one
interface and not have to be switching
around cables now one thing that we have
over here is the analog version some
just don't want to use a USB interface
or maybe they just prefer analog and
that's what we have right here it's
essentially the same thing as the
digital but as it is analog and it has a
the nice what do you guys call this the
knitted cloth now it breathes it's very
comfortable
the netted cloth doesn't make doesn't
make me feel itchy I mean some
headphones have kind of a really fibrous
cloth which makes me feel itchy over
time longevity of wearing these seem
very very comfortable but maybe you guys
have ever I guarantee you guys have all
seen headphones that break at the joints
I'm gonna let Tim demonstrate something
here that makes these really unique when
it comes to their durability if you
wouldn't mind you just want to destroy
it are you not wanted I don't want to be
the one that breaks it but you wouldn't
do this if you weren't confident comfort
and durability is something that we've
been working on on this headset so and
if you look at this I mean nobody would
usually do this with the headset but
just to show you how how durable and how
stable it is I have four headsets in my
office I wouldn't dare do this with any
of them yeah so yeah I mean I have I
have a four year old you guys know that
you guys have seen her on this on the
channel before and she likes to wear my
headphones and she likes to take them
off by grabbing one ear and kind of like
yanking it off her head and that
terrifies me and all of their heads
headphones and headsets feature that
same technology now these aren't
released yet these are an item and works
right now right this is a stereo 2.1
version of the headphones that you're
looking at over there they feature the
Roccat blue cable row stylish same thing
with the logo on the side there and of
course you know we also have a flat
cabled in-ear headphones over here for
your smartphone or you know Apple
Android whatever it is but guys Roccat
is a company that you guys specifically
asked that I cover ironically you guys
contacted me just before CES and we made
sure that we could fit it in German
engineering and German engineering at
its best I don't think it can get a
whole lot better than this now hopefully
we can maybe get a review sample of one
of these in the future so that we can
really put it to the test and see if
it's a J's buy but so far I really like
what I'm seeing here from Roccat at CES
2014 Tim thank you for giving us
the tour of your products they're very
exciting I can't wait to see looks like
we're finding finally seeing some
innovation here when it comes to
headphones guys as always I will see you

CES 2014 coverage and I'll see you next
