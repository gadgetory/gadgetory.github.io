insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and why
sennheiser the pursuit of perfect sound
and of course by generous viewers like
you so strapped in with j's two cents as
he takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys you're watching Jays two
cents exclusive inside our coverage here
at the good goodbye OC event and i'm
here with Richard and Travis the
representing Nvidia here at the event
and they've got something really cool
and unique that they're going to be
doing here on site they are going to be
putting together primal chills wet bench
was which is a water-cooling friendly
testbed and of course test beds or what
we're looking at today here at the OC
event but what's really interesting is
that Richard is going to be doing
on-site rigid tuba tubing bending for
this wet bench so Richard go and tell me
what you're doing and what's going to
like in the end okay so here we have the
privilege chill acrylic hard line or
rigid tubing we also have some of their
new compression fittings and so these
are similar to the old style compression
fitting to use with flexible tubing the
difference is is that you have your
compression cap attach your o-ring and
all you have to do is screw it on to the
barb itself and the o-ring
this grabs on to the tubing and so that
way you have a nice solid connection
right so you know you're not relying on
clamping force as much as you are just
the o-ring compression ring is the
secret to the entire thing because I
remember some of the earlier models
people had problems with crushing on
some of the tubing because they were
over tightening thinking the old soft
tubing method yeah and so this you know
kind of protects it you will not break
the tubing and it's pretty solid that's
pretty solid yeah if you guys aren't
familiar with primo chill tubing they
have a whole array of colors both UV and
solid as well as we're looking at a
career a clear neon green obviously
invidia green the fittings what the
tubing's are available what two foot 3
foot links yeah they covered in several
sizes as well when I'm doing custom
builds of course I haven't sent me six
foot lengths because I do some crazy
crazy bands but just about any type of
case you're working on you can get the
right size tubing the rounds forward
awesome one of the really cool things
about acrylic tubing whether you're
doing a test bench or you're doing a
custom rig is you can get some really
tight bends without kings as well as
really custom designs if you just want
to do that now tell me about some of the
people that because I do a lot of water
cooling on my channel people are leery
enough when they're new to water cooling
with flexible tubing in itself where
they're worried about cracking or
popping off go ahead and explain how
your experiences are with rigid tubing
when it comes to the longevity whether
or not it clouds I mean what's your
experience been like like anything else
there's always trade-offs so you have to
look at what the purpose of your build
is one of the trade-offs of course is
that these can be fragile would not
recommend shipping a system built with
acrylic or rigid tubing that's Phil so
that's one of the trade-offs they don't
tend to stain so you can use dies in
there and it's not like a-- with the
vinyl tubing where you'll have a
cloudiness after right and usually the
cloudiness is some sort of a plasticizer
inside of the tubing so even the
highest-end tubing has a plasticizer
which depending on which fluids you use
could end up clouding up your system so
I definitely benefit to that know what
diameter are we looking at here this is
a
it's a half-inch outer though right so
you do lose lose a little bit of inner
diameter but I mean that's one of the
myths of water cooling is that bigger
diameter is actually mean better cooling
it's really not okay so what about the
test bed what are we looking at here
okay so we have a premature test bench
this is a customized one that we cut for
gigabyte so it's a branded with gigabyte
with the motherboard details on it as
well we actually added some nice touches
so we have a bullet holes and the heart
the rigid tubing will come up through
the bullet holes oh wow that's going to
look nice and so the way we'll do this
build is on the bottom side of the bench
will use a standard tuning on the top
side will do the heat band-aid of rigid
trivia so we'll have a combinational
yeah you're going to be using the rigid
more work shows for aesthetics right
okay so guys we're going to go ahead and
look they're going to build this will
check it out once it's all complete and
see how it takes a look guys it's been
Richard and Travis here representing
nvidia here at the gigabyte OC event
make sure you check out all of our
coverage here on twitter for insider
exclusive coverage and as always i'll
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
