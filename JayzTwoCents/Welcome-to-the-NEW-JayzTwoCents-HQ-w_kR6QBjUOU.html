if you can't tell by the title already
we've got a fun one today because
banging outside that's ok I'm not even
mad anymore you know why we're moving to
a new headquarters so all this sound can
just take it and shove it up their rule
the games from the seven kingdoms with
your iron claw Mouse from your iron
throne it has a scroll wheel that looks
like an off-road tire and buttons on the
side and pop to do stuff
don't lose grip while doing stuff with
the textured sides and do it in style
with the odd GP and now comes available
in wired and wireless learn more of
course air.com ok so we've been in this
studio now since the beginning of 2017
if you're not aware where the middle of
2019 so I've been in here a long time
this was a really good step up from the
old set you guys remember I had my
bedroom set and then I had the garage
set and this was that logical evolution
of that space and this we've had a lot
of good times we've had a lot of good
memories filmed in this place this place
certain looked like a studio and that's
scared people it might look like in one
of our next videos
by the cod now
one of the major transformations that
took place in here though is we got rid
of the whole living room feel when that
whole team krispies looked because I'm
not crispy at all in fact I'm team
fluffy if you know what I'm saying but
one of the things I was proud of as we
built this functional workshop here in
this space and we've got our lighting up
above we've got our ghetto sound
dampening we threw up there but as you
can tell some of the points of
contention here is the fact that we are
in a retail building and there's lots of
foot traffic lots of noise and that is
just not doing us any favors when it
comes to making videos you've turn on
look this way you can see we have
certainly outgrown this space this was
supposed to be our overclocking area
where we were supposed to kind of have
our overclocking battles and stuff with
Steve as you can see this is sort of
become a catch-all as most things are
because one of the problems with this
look at our camera look our gear section
right here there's a trash bag this is
our this is our gear section really this
we have this is so unorganized because
we have run out of space I mean look
under the stairs right here all our C
stands that's just for safety but you
know yeah the Dyson I paid for a long
time ago well crappy Dyson to first
understand why we had to get a new space
you have to understand what we're
dealing with now so this is my desk you
guys have seen when I built this set up
with the dining room table this is
Phil's editing area over here he turned
around this was supposed to be the green
area the sitting and yeah we're gonna
sit down as a team now and we're gonna
watch videos and we're gonna have
meetings and stuff here it never
happened all that happened was a so as
great as this space has been to me and
we look out over the balcony at our nice
little crammed area that's all about to
change
nuts because we got this
this is the new headquarters for J's two
cents to give you an idea what I just
showed you is narrower than one of these
concrete slabs that you can see right
here that lines of that line is a foot
wider than the space that I currently
record in so if that well if you want to
have some perspective of how we use a
lot of lens trickery to make our space
look bigger we legitimately have a much
bigger space now this is four times the
size just in terms of width actually
three times the size it's four times
this way so we've got our work cut out
for us we've literally got to build all
of our sets from scratch we got a big
giant roll-up doors it's gonna be nice
because you know getting something
tonight here is gonna be cool we're on
the second floor of where we are now
which is always kind of sucked so this
is kind of a reception area lobby we
don't know how we're gonna fill this out
yet it is a glass storefront and I'm not
gonna really show out that way we don't
go away too much information yet but we
don't know how we're utilize this space
yet because right now it's only Phil and
I that are here full-time we've got
Brian here who comes in throughout the
week we are planning on expanding the
team don't send your resumes yet please
have it asked for that but I don't know
how we're gonna work this space out yet
this is gonna be the editing then over
here where my desk and Phil's desk will
be I'm aware to that we obviously have
to do some noise treatment to cut down
the echo obviously with the build all of
that out but this is going to be
probably my area over here we'll give
Phil by the door over there or something
I don't know yet whichever area can fit
the most space will be mine that's okay
because I'm the box you know what's
interesting though is this unit actually
has two restrooms which they were
telling us is kind of unique for this
building most people only have one the
funny part is the women's restrooms
inside in the male's restrooms outside
or the which i think is kind of funny
yes I just assumed the men are gonna be
able to warehouse I mean that's sexist
right so we're gonna be making both the
bathrooms just unisex obviously so that
we don't the I gotta use the men's
bathroom I gotta go really bad cuz I got
to go to the bathroom I got to do this
let's see if the lab will you didn't
pick this up and with the door open the
echo is even cut down are you ready we
do plan on building out the sets and
putting noise uh you know stuff to cut
down the noise so our thoughts are
because the panels are over here and we
do have 480
coming into here which is nice for a
t-bolt we're gonna have the workshop be
on this side we're thinking we're gonna
do two sets right here workshop which
will be like literally this whole
quarter of the of the warehouse and then
over here we're thinking of building
like a bedroom slash home office set
very very reminiscent of the early days
on my channel I'd be totally fake think
like IKEA right we walk into IKEA
they've got those fake facades and all
that so it's gonna be very much a facade
we're gonna be building in here because
why the heck not one of my things I've
always wanted to do when I was a kid was
I wanted to be a director of photography
I wanted to work in movies I want to
work in Hollywood and so one of the
reasons why we get these giant building
up these bigger things is not for me
anyways it's not just because I need it
which I do it's because it's fun this is
the hobby the camera work the set
building the figuring out the noise the
echo and all that sorts fun for me so
obviously we're gonna have some moving
blogs rest some DIY we're gonna be doing
a lot of DIY some contractor work we've
got to get electrical brought in on this
wall there's no electrical here there's
no electrical on that side but yeah so
if you kind of look through like the
IKEA catalog how they have those fake
facades built up we're gonna do
something very similar to that but
probably not necessarily IKEA but more
for the talking head videos the easy
review pieces I don't require a big
workshop or computers you know and stuff
love a computer and all that set up
obviously but we got to decorate all of
it this side and I'm kind of torn
because I could take the shelving and
build a set over here very similar to
the shelving that you're used to now
with all the product behind me so I
think it'd be neat if I still found a
way to have our storage unit be another
very functional set if that makes sense
you guys are very used to seeing all the
product behind me one of the reasons why
I love that product is because behind me
anyway is because it shows I've used it
obviously I own it I'm not speaking from
a perspective of Oh will the forum's say
this it's like no I've used the product
I know where it's tax and all that so
it's kind of a reminder of what we do
around this channel which is hardware
and and a lot of fun DIY and all that so
we might do rows of racks if we don't we
don't use it in that sense
I still think it might be nice to have a
set here where it looks very much like
our old set maybe even do some fake
those four ones because you guys kept
calling my windows fake which they're
not which now they would be because
there's no windows in here and then on
this side over here I don't know we
still need to have room for intake here
with the giant door I don't think we'll
ever be getting giant palliative
deliveries where this door is necessary
a lot of people were like Jinyu she to
lift and park your card hearing Bobo I
might park a card here but I'm not doing
a lift because one of the things is this
building that I'm in is not zoned for
automotive a lift would not be approved
to be installed in here
I cannot work on the car in here it's
just not okay with the lease and yes
this is a lease now I purchased a
purchase would be much farther down the
road if we ever get to that point so
we're gonna kind of do right now is I'm
gonna have Phil sorta just turn and go
tripod mode where we're gonna kind of
overlay some of the 3d vision that we've
been working on we've been using
Sketchup to kind of come up with an idea
of how we want to utilize this space so
we're kind of showing you right now is
just sort of a rendering of what it
could look like it's very crude the
colors are not exact we're not doing
blue walls and purple walls that's just
what we were calling purple set blue set
whatever so that we could segment it and
see more easily how that would work out
so that's the point of this video just
to show you guys what you have helped us
achieve and I figured 2 million
subscribers was a pretty good milestone
to kind of take that next step of being
the best channel that we can be anyway
as well as I can produce anyway I'm not
a very good producer and in this face
it's my mother on the screen so we're
kind of screwed from the start but the
point of this video too is to show you
the before because obviously we're we
have a transition happening so that's
where we asked you guys to be very
patient with the quality of our videos
we know we need to work on the sound we
know we need to work on the lighting and
all that stuff and you're gonna see
stuff on that while we try to give you
normal content mixed in so anyway if you
guys appreciate what we're doing hit
that like button tell me what you guys
think down the comments below or hit me
up on twitter at JS $0.02 and if you
have any cool suggestions of what you
think we should do in here please let me
know because I am definitely open to
suggestions and ideas and it's gonna
take some time thanks for watching guys
and as always see you the next one
rather be from here or our other studio
and does that give you a good j4 scale
the so much room friend tivities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
