click the link in the description below
alright so I need to still do window
trim and I have to paint those bricks so
I figured I'll paint the inside of this
so this can be drying before I do the
actual window trim which I got more
pieces of because if remember in our
last episode of Jay doesn't know how to
build anything I cut one of the trims
backwards so the forty-fives went the
wrong way so let's see if by the end of
this video if I don't have what would
appear to be a convincing window but Jay
why do you want a window because many of
you guys missed the bedroom said I used
to have do you like that home feel so I
figured why not fake it and if there's
one thing that I learned so Terry Crews
took me to the set of Brooklyn nine-nine
at the CBS Studios backlot and I got to
spend about 13 hours there with not only
the cast but the crew the crew
especially I didn't care about the cast
one of the truth well the exception of
Terry Crews I mean he's pretty cool but
what's funny is he took me all around
the police station took me in the back
lot I took me in some of the jail the
jail room and jail sale interrogation
room and all that sort of stuff
and he said something that's very very
true and it resonates with me while I'm
building this he goes it all looks so
real on TV he's like but when you get
close you start looking at it up close
it's pretty bad right this this would
never pass as a bedroom so we're really
hoping that as the depth of field sort
of kicks in and all the walls are
decorated with bookshelves and desks and
computers and plants and and lighting
and all that stuff that there will be so
much attention drawn away from the wall
that you won't really notice the reason
why you notice these seams is one this
is hard board it's not drywall which
would have probably arguably been better
and this is pumping out which would have
arguably been better
this is lightweight and thin material
the problem is is this real wave Ian
Bowie
not David Bowie though so it's one of
the things I'm I'll probably use a
different material on the next set we
build but I'm just too far going to
start over on this one
let's just hope at the end of the day
it's convincing enough because that's
that's all I can hope for
so the first coat of white is on I
forgot brushes not to go back to Home
Depot anyway to get some touch-up gray
for that corner over there not touch of
gray like we'd seen looks like using my
hair but anyway here's what the trim
looks like when it's gonna go up there
and kind of fill in those gaps I don't
want to touch it with the pain right now
but so as you can see yes I I realized
there's lots of knots in this 2x4 that I
wasn't paying attention to which way I
was putting it when I mounted it so yeah
it's gonna be all naughty it's gonna be
a naughty window so anyway when you can
imagine now with the trim going all the
way around that's really gonna finish it
off and then it's gonna be blinds and
curtains and a curtain rod it's really
gonna sell it I think it's gonna look
like a real window we've got to go ahead
now and paint while that first coat is
drying we need to go ahead and paint
these bricks and then while this is
drying should have time to run to the
home dupatta get more so this doesn't
need to be perfect though this just
needs to look like old lofty tile type
of building that's head painted brick
and is starting to look a little aged in
fact I'm not gonna try and even get down
into the grout because I think a lot of
people wouldn't really do that I mean at
least we didn't when we had brick
fireplace that we painted well we'll
leave it to Phil to find some
interesting way for me to share this
with you
so there is our rustic looking pillar
complete with the college student paint
job that's what I'm calling it intended
to look like crap I wanted to look like
a weathered piece of brick you know I
mean that's been painted a bunch of
times I'm not kidding my old house I
used to live at when I first started my
channel had brick exterior like like a
like a trim it had been painted so many
times it looked just like this so sure
what I do I'm gonna do another coat of
paint on that windowsill set the fan up
on it and then we're gonna go get some
brushes a little bit of touch-up paint
for the gray because I'm out of gray and
maybe this stuff will be ready to go up
by then
so let's go
okay so as you can see we got the trim
in here I haven't filled it in with
putty or anything I don't think I'm
gonna bother honestly you're not gonna
be able to see it in camera you're
probably barely even see it from where
you're sitting right there but I I got
really lucky because these are some fo
blinds that I got from Home Depot which
means they're fake wood or simulate wood
and this opening Hey look trim pieces
this opening is forty six five eighths
big these are forty six inch blinds and
look at that so that's gonna work out
pretty well with these blinds up here
and then the other thing we're gonna
hang is gonna be a curtain rod I got a
curtain rod and I got two of these 84
inch panels that we're gonna scrunch up
together but as you can see they're very
close to the color of the carpet and
they're kind of a shimmery color so we
think it'll catch some of the light when
we set it up to be very moody and then
of course these are gonna be up on the
side and yeah I think this is really
starting to come together for a guy like
me who does not do interior design I'm
surprised this is even somewhat passable
as a room as long as it stays up there
good news is I don't have to wonder
where the studs are cuz
so we have a small problem huh okay you
want to see if the problem is are you
ready for what the problem is that's
your problem right there all right so
one of the things I want to do too is I
want to put a curtains up just I mean I
don't know we've been really conflicted
on this and whether not we want to do
curtains so we're trying these guys out
from Ikea we just went to Ikea and spent
a ton of money on the furniture for this
place but I want to see how this is
going to look one of the things I'm have
to do those might this face out those
rods I don't know we'll see
but the curtains that I got seemed to
just lay perfectly straight which is
obviously what we want I think I didn't
do though is I didn't get the little
ball that goes on the end forgot that so
I want to use a zip tie for now that's
okay let me see how these leg
oops hit the wall and if the length is
right on these Oh baby
wow that was luck that wasn't even
intentional all right so yeah I mean do
in things and curtains so anyway we've
got some furniture to start putting
together because otherwise this is just
a cube of nothing so I'm gonna put
together some furniture and see how it
looks
[Laughter]
it's like it's a cardboard carbon-fibre
so after nearly a week of work learning
as I went without any real plan I sort
of built as I went I know that kind of
shows probably this is what we've got so
we got a bunch of furniture here today
it's all IKEA I'm not a fan of IKEA but
man is it get the job done especially
for a set like this Billy bookshelves
lack floating shelves there which is
gonna be my GPU shelf these two wire
shelves are chuck neat this is a beckett
desk and the idea here is that we can
shoot from a bunch of different angles
of course we've got our fake window back
there and yeah when that chair is
probably my favorite i remember the name
of that chair I'm sorry but that sitting
chair that armchair that I was just in
sitting chair Buddhist dating gears um I
like that chair so much I'm probably buy
one for my own home office at home but
anyway the idea here is that this set is
going to be used for not just talking
head but showcasing maybe some small
like hands on stuff here like we talked
about like who's this cool little like
unboxings things like that I just always
wanted a space this this it's a flex
space it's the best way to put it it's a
flexible space that we can do whatever
we want with we could shoot from
different angles like Phil come around
over here
so if Phil was to go over there and
we'll do this live so you guys can see
how this set up with sort of me and that
scoot closer to him and he opens up that
aperture it's only enough for but if we
go with like our art lens which not only
is a like up to what 1.8 our 1.6
something like that we go down to like f
2.5 or something and I don't move then
you get this ultra nice depth of field
which makes the space feel even bigger
but like I said this room is bigger than
the one I started my youtube channel in
so I had a really hard time figuring out
how to fill it out so that is what it
looks like so let's go ahead and break
the third wall and let's step out of the
sets
we just start by panning up well the
other way yeah so this is what you owe
and one of the panels did fall down so
whoever whoever went ahead and took that
bet you win but anyway we'll figure it
out well forget we're gonna now that was
just I was curious if it would work and
it didn't so yeah we can you can see
we've got this ultra contrast II black
and white theme going on I stuffed up a
pictures on the wall I think I'm gonna
do pictures of my my Camaro cuz it's
white in black which I'll fit in here
nice got some plants to put in here you
know we've got the very first of product
placements which I just had that in the
car yes I was driving over the 1080i in
the car I'm sorry put that there tada so
I we start to decorate the thing I was
saying in the live stream that is it on
Twitter that this putting together the
framework like the framework being the
desk the chair the carpet the shelves
the window the walls the chimney which
isn't the chimney the pillar that's easy
for me now that I have to fill in the
blanks it's kind of like I don't know
what to do so this is where I'm gonna
start involving the women of my life I
am going to get my wife to help me with
putting things places and Brian's wife
and oh man I'm probably gonna be
spending some time on Pinterest as I
still think like Pinterest do people so
pin things do they still whatever all
right I want to go it's Memorial Day
weekend I'm taking the three-day weekend
we have worked tirelessly while also
trying to make regular content which
also we have to get back to next week
we'll probably film some things in here
and at the old studio we sort the set up
all the lighting bring the camera work
and this is one of three sets and it's
still not done so that gives you an idea
of how much work we have to do so with
that said I'm gonna go see you guys in
the next one
feel believable you got any of them free
