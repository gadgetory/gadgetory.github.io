and it is Vega launch day again actually
the Vega 56 just launched I don't even
know where mine is that do we know where
mine is that oh there it is right there
the Vega 56 Black has just launched and
we're going to talk today about some
water blocks for this because you know
what regardless of the pricing problems
and regardless of the supply and demand
these things are still selling out
everywhere in fact 56 ii and went on
sale was gone but there are some of you
that are also still interested in
putting some custom water blocks on that
so that's exactly what we're gonna talk
about today level up your gimme
experience with the Corsair one small
form-factor gaming pc featuring
water-cooled intel seventh generation
processors m2 nvme SSD support and
liquid cooled GTX 10 Series GPUs to
learn more just head to Corsair comm so
yeah I could definitely use the Vega 56
here for demonstrational purposes but
I'm gonna go ahead and just use my Vegas
64 special edition or limited edition
here and we're gonna talk about two new
water blocks here available from ek
water blocks these are pretty much
identical they work on both the 56 and
64 and ones an acetal which is the black
and nickel and then one is the clear I
think we're gonna go to clear the clear
or the nickel plexi whatever where's it
at there we go the nickel plexi has one
of the most elegant looks in my opinion
you can see through it obviously because
it's clear they already opened this one
hey what do you know I didn't need my
knife but if there's actually time today
we will actually do some temperature
testing with this because this sucker
gets hot I mean you guys know the power
draw on this is high with a lot of power
drawl comes a lot of heat and yeah it'll
get all the way up to whatever
temperature target you set if you set a
t5 that'll go to 85 if you set 90 it'll
go to 90 yes let's see if we can't tame
some of those temperatures but cool
thing about this too is check this out
it actually comes with a single slot
plate so that's kind of nice to see it's
not very often you see this anymore and
because a lot of graphics cards now are
doing away at the DVI connector this is
actually not something that can happen
now 1080i also got rid of the DVI
connector as well as titan x PU Technic
Pascal the official P yeah and here is
the block it's a really nice looking
block you can see right here because
it's Universal it's not gonna say Radeon
Vega 56 or
sixty-four it's just gonna say Radeon
you can also see there's been some
redesigned covers right here for what
they're calling the little terminal this
is actually called a terminal but this
is just a cover that goes on top of that
so if you were to remove that it would
look exactly like the past but check it
out look how small the block is most of
this plate right here it's just
aesthetic the block is really small
because once again you don't have a
traditional memory layout so you just
have to cut touch things like VRMs and
then the actual again the die and the
memory are on the same you know layout
so it's gonna be pretty easy to cool
that's also on the reasons why it's hot
you have a lot of really focused heat so
with all of that said why don't we just
go ahead and do it
well wouldn't be a JC cents video if I
didn't have some kind of a montage I
hope you guys enjoyed that but anyway
here it is right here it's running we've
had the loop going now for a while
actually been testing for about an hour
or so and we're topping at about 46 C is
the hottest that we've seen that's
pretty impressive given the amount of
focused heat there is on the HBM module
but what I'll talk about here is
overclocking for a second because vigor
really seems to like water but you'll
notice that the clock still bounced all
over the place and I think that's just
the nature of the beast honestly and
some of the noise that you're hearing
right now that's actually the power
supply in my test bench the fan is
making that noise it might be time to
actually service that the graphics card
is not cheap I mean it's being marked up
all over the world obviously it's so
it's coming at a premium and then you
added another 130 bucks on top it for on
top of that for a water block you're
gonna be talking roughly 850 dollars ish
to get this thing on water now
fortunately it uses the stock back plate
so you not to worry about getting rid of
that but you know it's all those things
you really just have to kind of look at
it and say is it worth it to you know
price is normalized and come back down
to around the $500 for the standalone
card or $400 for the standalone Vega 56
then it's probably worth it I mean with
these clocks now on water we're
definitely seeing 1080 speeds but it's a
hell of a lot more power draw and as
we're overclocking at power draw is even
greater now you'll see that it gets up
close to 1700 which is not bad in fact
we were seeing a pretty decent
improvement when I was doing my testing
here I actually saw a 5 FPS improvement
on Metro last light in 1440p versus the
standard turbo clock when it was on air
and then I saw almost 500 points higher
on my fire strike alt roads as a 4k
benchmark and we got a total score of 57
75 versus the original score which I'll
post right here but that's a heck of
improvement by simply putting it on
water unfortunately it's not big enough
improvement for it to really take any
sort of a massive lead over the GTX 1080
and it's definitely not reaching the
1080 Ti and once you put a block on it
you are definitely at 1080 TI prices
said something worth keeping in mind you
can see right here is sitting at 46 C 48
C I mean we've been running for a while
that air conditioner is off so the
rising temperatures you're seeing is
because the whole room is a as a whole
is getting hotter
it's summer in California so she 109
degrees today
110 degrees Fahrenheit you know what
that is in Celsius it's a shit-ton
that's a shit-ton to sell Celsius is's
it's up to you to determine whether not
this is worth it to you I mean I put out
a poll on Twitter asking if you guys
wanted to see this video and you guys
definitely wanted to see that oh and you
guys might have heard that squeak for a
second there one thing and this isn't
just Vega this is this is any graphics
card honestly once you put a solid piece
of metal against the die things like
coil whine are louder because it's
resonating across a bigger surface area
where typically heat sinks with fins got
kind of masked that sound and absorb it
yeah water blocks tend to make it even
louder so anyway guys how much you guys
thought in a comment section down below
do you think it's worth it right now to
water cool Vega or do you think it's
worth waiting for prices to normalize my
personal opinion wait for it to
normalize before you go putting in on
water I mean there's improvement to be
had not a hundred and thirty dollars
worth right now on top of a premium
product in terms of pricing and
availability now that may change as time
goes on but you know only you as the
buyer can determine what's worth it to
you anyway time to go guys as always I
did launch my t-shirt store you got this
amazing looking maroon run on me right
now on this on this sexy fluffy body you
guys want your very own look in the link
down below you guys can help out the
channel by actually getting something
back for your money merch rather than
this crappy content with that said guys
I'm gonna go thanks for watching as
always I'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
