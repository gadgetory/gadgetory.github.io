builder of nearly 25 years is one thing
I can promise you about the term
bottlenecking it is overused and under
understood
Misun misunderstood in order to
understand why I say the term
bottlenecking is overused and
misunderstood your first have to
understand exactly what bottlenecking is
but first let's go ahead and talk about
some of the questions I get asked every
single day regarding bottlenecking
hey Jay I want to get a gtx 660ti but I
only have an AMD 4100 am I going to
bottleneck my GPU the term bottlenecking
realistically is just like it sounds
you take something big and you're
shoving it through something small
generally bottlenecking is used in terms
of the graphics card being slowed down
by the processing speed or power of your
CPU there are tons and tons of hardware
configurations and combos out in the
market there's literally live little
overly endless combination of different
parts that you can use but we're going
to do today is we are going to take my
GTX 680 and my Core i7 3770k and we are
going to recreate some bottlenecking
scenarios and you are going to learn
exactly what it is that happens when you
bottleneck okay enough with the stupid
announcer guy whatever talking dude I
was doing I really want to make a point
here people people are terrified of
building a computer because I'm learning
that not only are they afraid to break
it but they're afraid to get the wrong
parts because they're they're so
terrified of this term bottlenecking
and that's a term that most of the time
is definitely missed most of the time
80% of the time it works every time
bottlenecking if you see that term being
used generally it's by somebody who has
absolutely no clue what they're
doing when it comes to computers and you
might as well just run for the hills or
get advice from somebody else people who
truly know how to build computers tend
to not use the term bottlenecking
instead of bottlenecking why don't we go
ahead and use the analogy or the term of
non optimized hardware because basically
what bottlenecking is is a situation
where you take your graphics card and it
has to slow down because your CPU says
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa - simmer down a
little bit I can't keep up with what it
is you're trying to do and a bottleneck
is when your GPU no longer runs at a
hundred percent utilization simply
because the CPU is sending a signal to
the GPU saying I can't handle all this
mess I got bronchitis and oh my god that
everybody's computer is going to perform
differently every game is going to run
different on every single machine
because of different things that are
running on your machine memory
allocation your operating system the
amount of programs you have running just
because you're not getting the same
results of somebody else does not mean
that you have a bottleneck we're going
to take my system back here we're going
to set up a couple of cameras and I'm
going to do the ghetto method of filming
my screen rather than using a capture
device because we don't want to have the
capture device slowed down any of the
speeds that are going to be represented
in this bottlenecking recreation
scenario we're going to take this PC
we're going to disable cores we're going
to disable hyper threading we're going
to slow it down and we're going to find
out exactly what point do we truly
create a bottleneck okay everybody so
the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and load up
Valley benchmark it's just going to test
the GPU only no physics no you know CPU
processing any of that we're not
adding any additional stuff we are just
going to see exactly what the raw CPU
rendering of the GPUs informational
inputs it can do so this is going to
take out you know it's this is all GPU
based right here so if there's anything
slowing down the GPU they're only Vanka
possibly possibly be is the CPU you
can't blame physics or any of that so
we're going to go ahead and
start up this benchmark and we're going
to do this here in one clean take no
cuts that way you can see we didn't
change anything over there obviously I
guess it wouldn't really matter because
we are doing our base test so let's go
ahead and load up the benchmark and as
you can see this is all still one one
take here we'll go ahead and fast
forward this thing just magic special
effects stuff and fast forward it and
let us see what happens
okay so there it is guys right there we
benchmarked of average frames per second
a forty four point nine base mark score
or baseline score of 1877 minimum score
of twenty six point nine maximum score
of minimum fps of twenty six point nine
maximum fps of sixty three point nine so
there is our baseline and that's what we
are going to use now for the rest of
these tests to see exactly what changes
alright we are back and we just reloaded
from the BIOS and basically we took my
i7 3770k and we turned it into an i5 35
70 K by slowing the cores down to 3.8
gigahertz to match a stock I 535 seventy
K's turbo speed and we disabled
hyper-threading all together because
that's essentially all in i7 and an i-5
is compared to each other as
hyper-threading and no hyper-threading
so let's go ahead and see now if we're
going to bottleneck this gtx 680 at all
on the GPU score or the valley benchmark
here for the GPU and let's see if
anything change by turning off that
hyper-threading
okay guys so there you have it by
turning my I overclocked i7 into by
turning my overclock i7 into a standard
clocked I 5 we've got virtually the same
results we lost it looks like a couple
of frames per second on the minimum I
have to go back and check the maximum
but the score is almost identical and as
you can see right there the GPU the GPU
managed to stay at you know a hundred
percent most of the time the reason why
it dips down is when it's changing
between scenes but there you go
at the i-5 speeds exactly the same now
you must be asking yourself ok well then
what does it take to actually slow down
this test well we're going to go ahead
and take things to a little bit of an
extreme ok guys and for this next test
we basically turned my i7 3770k that
normally runs at 4.8 gigahertz into an
i5 3217 u which is a 1.8 gigahertz or
with hyper-threading as you can see
right here in CPU Z we are running at
1.8 gigahertz 2 cores 4 threads and
there are the 4 threads right over there
as you can see core 0 and core 1 active
only so let's go ahead and start up our
benchmark and see just what happens with
the performance something tells me we're
not going to see anything too
drastically different here and if that's
the case then we're just going to go
ahead and have to move on to the next
test
okay guys so there we go there
definitely was a dip in performance we
went from an average down to
thirty-eight point to a score of 1600 a
minimum frames per second dropped from I
think 23 ish 22 ish frames per second
down to 14 but look at our max frames
per second didn't really change much so
what does that mean that means there's
something in this test there's something
graphically that happened in this test
at some point that made the minimum FPS
drop down to fourteen point seven
because the CPU couldn't handle that
much data that came at it now who knows
what point during the test that was it
could have been the light bloom it could
be these clouds it could be just about
anything but as I'm sitting here
watching this it's running at 40 frames
per second here on an ultra HD benchmark
I mean the the benchmark on this is on
Ultra HD it's everything turned on 1080p
light blue motion all that crap is going
and we just did it right now tricking
the computer into thinking that we're
running on basically an i3 a dual-core
with hyper-threading now I can hear the
haters already I can hear you guys I can
hear you through the videos that
technically not even done yet saying
flawed tests flawed tests that's a
flawed test and I'll tell you why
because you ran a synthetic benchmark
and because of that the computer already
knew it was coming and therefore it
didn't have to actually process any raw
data that's being thrown at it from
staying you know battlefield 3 64 player
server because the data is constantly
changing it's left oh it has a lot lots
of processing it has to do on top of
what the graphics card doing see the
graphics card you knew was coming
because it was a synthetic benchmark and
so it really wasn't much of a test being
thrown out to CPU so it's fraud yeah
that's pretty much what I hear you get
all you nerds out there saying yeah I
know what's happening here and it was
happening here because Billy Arnold does
gaming and stuff like that but ok so
that's what you guys want to test next
let's go ahead and do it and just like
we did last time we've got to go ahead
and do our baseline test for I'm going
to go ahead and throw my overclocking
setup back on this so that we can see
exactly where battlefield 3 on 64-player
Maps starts to bottleneck so now we're
in the game we're gonna go ahead and
turn on the draw
yes command so that we can be frames per
second we're getting here as we can see
in this map I'm gonna eighty in a map or
in the menu system I should say so
it's gonna get here in the game in state
we got if I can't kill some noobs here
so we just spiked over 100 frames per
second there for a second I just showed
that new person's response am dead and
150 hundred sixty two frames per second
right there good lord
ah didn't see that guy sitting there
hundred sixty-six frames per second Wow
okay well my you guys are wondering why
I don't have a GTX 780 yet okay my lion
hundred seven hundred ninety two hundred
forty point of the wall do you want it
frames per se yeah I can cut you pull it
of a different conversation here but you
tell me why on your GTX 780 so she guys
were talking I'm having a 680 JZ
disrepair daddy's GPU yeah go get me
started on a rant about those you guys
you know nothing about hardware
whatsoever trying to give me a hard time
about what I use don't even go there
sister don't even go there
I'm getting 60 frames per second so
you're dead what's gonna get mark around
him with rockets
let's kill these guys let me tell you
what's on there I'll put it aside you
can see well over a hundred miles per
second I mean let me take 150 the thumbs
and this is a 64 man in Memphis you can
see like every five and reviving a
looking into a puddle cutting he did
ah I'm good okay so there you go I 7
right there 130 160 s 64 playin that
explosion
okay so that was with all settings on
ultra we were sitting up in the 100's in
the menu I'm getting 162 frames per
second
epic menu frames so yeah anyway let's go
enter this thing into an i-5 and see
what happens guys we are back and now we
have turned once again my i7 into an i-5
you can see it right there right in 4
cores 4 threads turbo speed right now it
slowed down but it is maxed out at there
it is 3.8 gigahertz it's not showing
anything because it's not running any
load but anyway we're at stock speeds
take my word for 3.8 gigahertz is where
we are and there are the four core
showing over there with four threads
only so let's go ahead and load up some
more battlefield here and let's see what
happens when you turn an i7 into an i-5
and let's see if you get them that their
bottlenecking
as everybody likes to say bottle necking
sounds like a sound like a dirty makeout
term hey baby do you want a bottleneck
yeah okay the game has loaded so once
again let's go ahead and turn on our why
did it go one earth all right get out of
windowed mode please there we go let's
go ahead and turn on our draw FPS
draw FPS there we go FPS has turned on
as you can see in the menu we're sitting
at 70 frames per second this is a
different map but it shouldn't really
make too much of a difference here
important thing to note is let's take a
look at CPU usage as you can see right
there it is running at 3.8 gigahertz as
I mentioned 4 cores 4 threads and we are
sitting at about 75% CPU usage so we
will kind of we'll come back and revisit
that as we're playing the game and see
what happens to that number so let's go
ahead and get the game going you can see
the phrase you can see the shape the
frames per second right there in the
corner so keep your eye on that as we do
our thing here once again as I mentioned
64 players in this bad boy
and let's go see what happens here let's
go kill some noobs
whoa I died I was boobie no way I killed
him I soaked killed him hmm Ian price
per second they're looking pretty good
were sitting in the 80s sometimes pop up
into the 90s I got there in the hundreds
silly guy looking at a wall I'm sitting
at 100 110 there yeah let's get camping
we're gonna eat up their necks pretty
pretty crow yeah frames per second as
you can see drop down a little bit not a
lot a couple frames per second but I
mean that could be a little bit of
variance there in the map but for the
most part you don't want your frames per
second to be greater than the refresh
rate of your monitor anyway that's going
to create screen tearing which in my
opinion is worse than this whole
bottlenecking concept but let's go ahead
and start to see let's let's look now at
slowing this down and see where we start
to truly create a bottleneck because as
I bring up the second camera here and
show you the history on the GPU here
while we were playing look at that it
was still pegged at 100% the entire time
so those little those little dips there
where you see it go down that's
basically where I died and when it goes
into the menu it's not really rendering
much so bottlenecking is going to be
when this GPU usage is no longer being
fully utilized where the GPU says I have
to slow down because the cpu can't keep
up
so let's find where that mark starts to
happen shall we okay tech addicts we're
back and we've got this AI 7 turned into
an i3 3220 CPU I went ahead and one with
the 32 20 on this game test instead of
the 32 17 you because that's a mobile
processor this here is now more commonly
which you find people asking 30 to 20 or
you know low-end I 5 and as you can see
we've got 2 cores 4 threads running at
it says 1.6 but this 3
point three turbo boost and there you go
there's your four threads and core one
or core zero and core one proving it is
a dual core now okay so the game is
loaded up let's go ahead and do our
whoops our draw FPS on here as you can
see the menu we're now getting 46 to 60
frames per second dish let's go ahead
and deploy as you can see our face for
second half dropped down a little bit
here into the 30s and 40s it looks like
especially all these explosions it's not
entirely choppy but it does start to
feel a little bit jittery and clearly it
does feel like there's something being
held back here but it's sitting in the
sixties anymore right there 100 frames
per second again whoa I'm getting good
story my life engine died everybody died
oh my god double kill though with my 93
are a pistol it's a pistol now take a
look at the frames per second here you
can see they clearly are playable when
you were sitting between the 70s 50s we
do get some below spice into the 30s
which is definitely a little bit less
than desirable but it's still very
playable okay guys so I've loaded up
another 64 player map right here as you
can see as I'm getting shot and I'm
dying but this is what bottlenecking
looks like in terms of specs guys do you
see how the CPU usage right there in
those green bars it's completely pegged
out it's sitting at ninety four point
four frames or 94 percent utilized and
you see how the GPU is just sitting
there bouncing up and down going okay
whenever you're ready it's going to hop
into the game here and you're going to
see once again this GPU usage is going
to drop down slightly
especially as I start moving around
which is a lot difficult this is hard to
do with one hand but look at that GPU
usage how did I not die there was a ok
well anyway GPU usage is sitting there
in the 50 CPU usage is sitting there in
the 90s guys that's a bottleneck now
let's go ahead and talk about what we've
learned in this video
there you go guys bottlenecking as best
as J's two cents can bring it to you in
real-world scenario where you can see
exactly what bottlenecking is and what
bottlenecking isn't so guys here you go
I hope you take this information I hope
you use it you've enjoyed this video hit
the like button if you know somebody who
is just horribly misusing the term
bottlenecking
please show them this video and share
this video with anyone that you think it
may help when it comes to building their
PC and together we can educate people on
the proper terminology of building your
own PC and when it comes to bottleneck
remember guys it's hardware miss
optimization or whatever it was I said
I'm getting poor Hardware optimization
there you go guys I'll see you next time
it's been Jase descents</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
