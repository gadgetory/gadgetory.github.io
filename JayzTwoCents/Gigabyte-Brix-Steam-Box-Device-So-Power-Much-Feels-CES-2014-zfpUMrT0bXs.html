Jays two cents on YouTube we're here in
Las Vegas Nevada and Jay has promised
that he is going to follow us around the
entire time filming behind-the-scenes
footage of our coverage of CES 2014
really grateful he said he's going to
give us all the footage to put on our
own YouTube channel and then and there
they're doing liquid nitrogen over there
it's kind of distracting
oh why thank you or not vote for me
thank you cheers the Jays two cents
welcome to Jay's two cents exclusive
insider coverage of CES 2014 archeron
this year's brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strapped in with j's two cents as he
takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys Jays two cents here bring
any more exclusive insider coverage here
of CES 2014 and i'm currently at
gigabyte suite here and i have colin is
going to show us some really interesting
new technology in fact it's so new i
don't know anything about it so i'm
literally going to hand the mic to him
and let him talk Colin it's yours thanks
Jason these little guys here these are
our new bricks devices we launched our
bricks small form factor pc these are
baylor bone kits basically it has
everything but the msata drive and the
memory so it's kind of a DIY pc kit but
the difference for this is that they
actually have very powerful cpu and
graphics performance these guys here are
running Haswell intel haswell so this is
8 series this is fourth-generation core
processor the difference of these that
we're launching here is that they're
actually running iris pro graphics so
this is Intel's new graphics core that
offers much more higher graphics
performance than before these devices
here I'm showing two of them in this
live display this one here is running
battlefield and this one's running a 4k
video content on this 4k display so very
powerful graphics Intel is quite excited
actually there was a press conference at
six o'clock tonight they actually showed
at a valve press conference they're
actually launching this new bricks pro
as a steam OS device so many different
applications you
gaming on them you can do video
processing on them a lot of different
things in a very small compact form
factor they're so portable now a couple
questions for you were quick what kind
of graphic settings are you able to use
on battlefield 4 with this type of setup
so I think this one's running medium
settings obviously different depends on
what game you're playing and for the
record guys medium on a PC is not like
console trust me it still looks a lot
better than a console all you can see
here right sorry quickly change over our
mouths gear change so definitely very
smooth you know very playbook I mean the
FPS the camera's not going to pick it up
like the human eye but I'm not it looks
very playable and so those are the iris
pro graphics from Intel obviously that's
an Intel platform but we're doing some
other things with our bricks devices
like adding discrete graphics in that
small of a form factor yep so this guy
right here this one we're launching and
maybe a couple months this one has
inside you can actually see I don't know
if you can zoom in enough but the top
here is actually the motherboard so
you've got the wireless module the msata
drive the CPU of there and then below
that is the discrete graphics so this is
on this so it's real quick that's on a
hinge so your hint you're hinging that
away so this is not on a hinge it's
basically resting on a sort of locked in
place there you can see the two heat
sinks hook up together so it actually
provides cooling for for both the
graphics card and the CP right so one
cooling solution for both components
which is how they're able to get such a
small package that's really interesting
and so we have different platforms
obviously we've got AMD CPUs this one
here
this is an 8 device and this is running
AMD 88 90 graphics and this one's an
Intel Haswell and that's running 88 90
as well okay so that I mean that's
really impressive i know we've seen some
modular small form-factor pcs you know
the last couple of CES but it looks like
things have really matured when it comes
to the graphics power in especially with
the Intel's new generation core I see
right here i see a mechanical drive now
you mentioned these these have are these
configurable I mean what are the
configuration options so we have a
couple of standard bricks devices let me
show you right here this guy is our
standard bricks so this is a very low
profile device this has spot for EM SATA
Drive but not a hard drive so basically
msata depending on what your your gig
sizes but very ultra small compact this
guy you can do vesa mount so it mounted
on the back of a monitor perfect small
form-factor media pc that you can mount
to the back of your TV as he mentioned
with vesa mount and you don't even see
the thing that's amazing and they come
in multiple different cpu configurations
this goes up to core i7 so core i7 I
five I three and celeron as well well
guys there you have it call them with
gigabyte showing you just what gigabytes
doing to bring you the new steamos as
well as their new bricks device you know
we've seen this trend over time where
things are getting smaller and smaller
and i've mentioned it before we're doing
it now with less compromise to power so
call and thank you very much for showing
that to me awesome device i can't wait
to see more guys make sure you follow us
on twitter for more of your CES 2014
coverage here at the gigabyte OC event
and i hope you guys will follow us and
make sure you check us out for all of
your CES 2014 news this stuff is just
too cool to cram it all in and I I'm a
total geek here right now and I thanks
for having me I appreciate it guys as
always I'll see you in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
