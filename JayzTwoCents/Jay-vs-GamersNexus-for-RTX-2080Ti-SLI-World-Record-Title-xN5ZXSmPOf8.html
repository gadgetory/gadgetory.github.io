we're kind of continuing on this
overclocking battle between gamers Nexus
and I Paul has apparently decided to
delayed his 79-80 XE so that is
something that is gonna be coming in the
near future he's jumping into this my
goal today is to get so far ahead to go
so far past the current scores that
we've already loaded up on the 3d mark
site that everyone just gives up
well between Paul and Kyle and Steve of
course there the real overclockers
they're coming soon we know they're
coming so I want to show you guys
something because Steve is banking on
the fact that my CPU is degraded because
that's what I said online and that's
partially true but what the internet
doesn't know well I've said it a bunch
of time so the internet doesn't really
listen is I've got my overclocks back
baby
this this ain't over EVGA offers a full
range of components including video
cards motherboards power supplies cases
and peripherals regardless of your needs
EVGA sure to have you covered to see
what EVGA can do for your next build
head to EVGA dot-com
so what has changed since my last video
if you guys haven't seen the last one go
ahead I custom-made a block for our EVGA
XE ultra made just use my cheap GPU
block I made a vrn block for it and then
I've water-cooled another 20 80 TI that
ones using a supremacy or ek supremacy
Evo no vrm cooling on it still just
using that heat plate that's sort of on
there but it's not going to be a problem
because the main card the one that has
the display hooked up to it that's the
one that gets hottest in terms of higher
voltages and power draw so we seem to be
getting away with it alright but let's
take a look at my settings here these
are the CPU settings I've actually got
and the reason why I'm sharing this in
this video is because I don't think I'm
gonna be able to push this much farther
without deleting and doing crazy cooling
options which I'm just not prepared to
do today so I'm gonna kind of go for
broke put it all out there with my best
scores and see what we get because I
will tell you this these score that
Steve put up recently the fourth or
third or 14400 something would have beat
my fourteen thousand six six eight or
fourteen thousand four six eight but
right before he was able to upload his
score as I upload the better score so
he's still in second place
otherwise you'd be sitting at first
right now and we're gonna beat my own
scores today because yeah because
reasons so here's where I'm currently at
we've got 4.9 gigahertz going right now
on my CPU it's a 449 ratio on there on
all my cores as you can see my mesh
ratio whoops my mesh ratio is at 33 and
our ABX offset is set to 0 you want zero
because whatever number is in there is
going to reduce from the multiplier so
if we're running a 49 multiplier and
we've got a 3 mesh ratio which is
default it will drop our correlate our
core ratio down to 4.6 gigahertz from
4.9 if it's seeing an AV X instruction
now the 3dmark time spy cpu test is an
AV X test so we do not want that
negative off setting otherwise it's
gonna slow down our CP during that test
so we also are going to be running here
2.1 is fine it sets a 2.1 it's a little
bit more to point one three five two
point one four eight
that's our cpu VIN or a voltage in
that's the total amount of voltage going
into the CPU that then has to be able to
power both the V Corps which I have set
to one point four six five it's so high
because because well hot not a golden
sample it needs a lot of voltage and
because I'm not deleted so because I'm
not deleted I have temperatures are
obviously an issue so I've got to keep
temperatures and voltages very much in
check Steve is running of deleted CPU so
he's got an advantage there as always
he's always kind of got an advantage
he's kind of like Samson I'm pretty sure
his power is driven his hair so if I
actually lose I'm gonna fly to North
Carolina I'm gonna break in and I'm
going to take clippers to him while he
sleeps and then that's not creepy at all
but it's totally worth it to win this
battle whatever so my mesh is set to one
point three five veces VSA our system
agent is set to one point three as well
as our VCC i/o so to one point three and
our uncor voltage offset is a 450 plus
offset those are for memory overclocking
speaking of memory I'm running out 3,800
megahertz this is corsair dominator
platinum special edition i'm running one
point six volts that's a lot of volts
but it could take it and I've tightened
up the timing to 15 15 15 30 I'm not
touching any of the sub timings
if you in case you're curious the XMP
profile on this as a 24 34:47 with a
1618 1836 timing so we've tightened all
of that up and of course I've got all
the fans and stuff on the VRMs running
pretty much full speed because we're
asking a lot of power of that so I'm
gonna do right now is I'm gonna rotate
this computer back around so it's
actually clean my graphics cards again
because I forgot I had this cold air
that's coming through the a/c actually
blowing on the cards so that as you can
see I don't have a water block on the
VRMs on this card you can see I can
touch it and stuff it's no problem
but I wanted to actively cool it with
the cool air that is coming through the
AC unit and by me turning it did myself
sort of a disservice there now because I
do have both of my graphics card water
cooled you can see my temperatures are
amazing these are my these are my clocks
that I'm sort of at right now these
aren't my max clots but this is how high
I've gotten it so far 15 see on the
second card 15 see on the first card but
I've got a plus 1180 overclock on the
RAM on both cards as you can see and a
plus 160 on the core now I can actually
push that core a little bit higher but
for now we're just gonna run it like
this and we're gonna see sort of where
it lands so to further understand how
important this is today Steve did his
live stream where he beat me live and
did like a fourteen thousand three
hundred something score and out of
14,000 like 68 it was really low and
Steve was very excited he beat me on
live stream and then I came in in the
studio and degraded my CPU now I've got
it back like I said we just got a
fourteen thousand eight hundred
eighty-five so as you can see he spent
all weekend to beat the old score that's
now four hundred points lower than the
score we just uploaded and we're not
done no no no we're not done we're gonna
play around this for a little bit and
we're gonna see how much more we can
truly truly get out of this
told you we're not done fourteen
thousand eight hundred and ninety-four
Steve what were you saying about my
degraded CPU eleven thousand six ninety
that's six hundred points higher than my
previous I think gara graphics score to
a fifteen thousand six hundred and
fifty-one I told you I gotta put this
away I don't have time I know time to
screw around with this we got real work
to do so what I change and you guys
can't actually see I don't think it
still says four point eight nine I
haven't messed with my B clock yet I did
I did learn that this CPU likes a
mixture of B clock as well as multiplier
so I'm still just on the multiplier at
four point nine gigahertz but I did bump
up the memory just a little bit to
eleven ninety still at plus 160 o'clock
on both so there's that Lee's
temperatures though both of them a
fifteen see that is amazing so that's
what got us are fourteen thousand eight
ninety four so why don't we do this
let's just see what happens at twelve
hundred on the memory which is Sun
that's up this is insane I've never had
memory go this far
so G DDR six is definitely loving the
overclock
so all right let's just see what happens
with that so twelve hundred megahertz
overclock on the clock still in the same
core that bumped us up to fourteen
thousand eight hundred ninety eight so
close so close to the fifteen thousand I
can taste it
graphic scored at fifteen thousand six
five nine so why don't we do this now
why don't we go ahead and bump our core
clock till one seventy leave the memory
where it's at the amazing thing is I
didn't have any sort of artifacting
which is absolutely an unheard of at
this clock speed so yeah let's just see
what that does that's ten more megahertz
on the core it's not going to be an
exact tense give me more like twelve
it's gonna step it up to the next piece
date so let's see what that gets
14090 to look at it well would you just
look at it
that's that graphics score just keeps
going up and up and up this is where
we're gaining you can see our cpu score
is still around the eleven thousand six
hundred range because we haven't we
haven't touched our CPU yet fifteen
thousand six ninety seven on the video
in the fourteen thousand nine two two on
the graphics look at it but look at me
look at it that's the star that's the
star right there okay here's we're gonna
do we're gonna go for broke I'm gonna go
+ 180 on the core but what I'm gonna do
right now is I'm also gonna step up our
core clock to five gigs are now core
clocks our CPU we're gonna get the CP at
five gigs I'm gonna do it by adding two
to the beat clock so 102 which is 49
times two so technically would be four
point nine eight nine nine eight close
enough to five gigs right that is five
gigahertz okay I know it doesn't show a
five it's five rounding math Common Core
all that stuff and just to show you that
we're actually in the OS with this here
it is we're at four point nine nine
fluctuating so five gigs there's our 49
multiplier and our 102 base clock right
there DRAM frequency is at nineteen
thirty seven so that times two right
that's getting us just under four
gigahertz but that's because the B clock
also applies to the memory frequency as
well so I mean I think we've already
kind of achieved what we wanted to
achieve today I'd love to see a fifteen
thousand not entirely convinced that's
gonna happen today
but yeah it's possible I don't know okay
so after lots of trial and error lots of
crashes we are literally at the limit
right now fourteen thousand nine five
eight is my score funny enough though
even though we increased the base clock
and it brought up the RAM speed a little
bit and the CPU a little bit eleven
thousand six eight one is still our max
on the CPU we can't get that over eleven
thousand seven hundred didn't really
change with the faster CPU so clearly
there's other things that need to happen
to make that score go up but our GPU
look at that because we ran the twelve
hundred memory in the one eighty core
fifteen thousand seven thirty eight now
what's starting to happen here at least
for us and our current limitations is
the card is running very cool but we're
still hitting power limit
and even though we have the very
unofficial not recognized BIOS that we
have obtained through the overclocking
community we still hit that power limit
in fact we were spiking like a stupid
amount of power draw which means that
the core clocks do suffer because of
that so temp is out of the equation
power draw is still a problem
so Steve with his shunt mods and once
he's on water might be able to beat this
but this is pretty much all I could do
so 14,000 9 5 8 guys somebody beat me to
15000 that's not kingpin so Steve once
again the ball is in your court have at
it man I passed the hard hat to you so
anyway thanks for watching guys and as
always we'll see you in the net one five
zero zero zero oh look at the CPU score
eleven thousand eight hundred ninety one
okay connector so fill this literally in
the middle of editing this video that
you guys are watching right now so I my
vest is over here I put this on good do
that so anyway we were filming that or
he was editing that and I was like you
know what we can get five gigs so you
saw the four point nine nine eight that
we did but what I did was instead of
running 15 15 15 thirty on the timing on
the memory I went 15 16 16 31 I loosened
it just a little bit and jumped it up a
whole nother multiplier to 4000 and then
when you take our B clock into account
which is still at 102 it's above 4000 so
if we look at CPU Z here real quick you
can see that the memory is actually
running 2039 or we were actually running
4d or 4,000 80 megahertz on the memory
but that still shows 15 15 15 31 holy
crap so maybe my 16 16 16 didn't apply
who cares
we got 15,000 in the Canadian J's two
cents and yeah I mean I'm done
maybe you can go farther maybe it'll be
another video I don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
