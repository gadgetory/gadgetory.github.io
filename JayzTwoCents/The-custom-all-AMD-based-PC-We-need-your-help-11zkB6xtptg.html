that I was going to do an AMD themed
build around the Radeon seven very
similar to how I did with the Titan RT X
and the last like themed AMD build I've
done was actually thread Ripper would
you still see mmm it's still back there
that was a showpiece man we put a lot of
time and effort into that I don't know
if I'm gonna go quite as extravagant
with this one but I want you guys to be
a part of this I kind of want some of
the inspiration behind what you guys
would do cuz I'm not the most creative
person believe it or not most of the
things that you see happen around here
happened by accident or just because I'm
stupid and didn't really think about it
and it worked out in the end so that's
why I need your guys's help now today's
sponsor is cable mod and their new
website builds GG we'll be taking this
and kind of putting it up on there so
basically builds GG if you're not aware
is a new website where you can upload
pictures of your build you can list out
all the parts you can go and check out
other people's builds and see what their
inspiration and stuff is I mean this
it's not the first web site of its kind
but it's the first one for cable mod and
the interesting part is they have
regular competitions worried just by
having systems up there and being
registered user you can qualify for
various cash prizes parts sponsored
giveaways all sorts of stuff so it's
free to sign up there's a link down the
description below you guys can go and
sign up and also follow along with this
build because I'm gonna be taking the
progress of this and putting it up there
because each build also has its own
comment section you can actually go in
and make comments on the build
so rather than commenting on this video
with build ideas because as I said I'm
gonna be reaching out and asking you
guys what you would like to see this
kind of turn into over time this is
gonna be a multi-part er put the
comments on the profile for this build
not this video so it all stays in one
neat orderly place so yeah well kind of
I'm also putting skunk works up there we
actually put the black or the gold and
white build up there as well that was
kind of like me testing it out and it's
pretty cool it's also important to get
as many people signed up on there as
possible because the database will grow
as more people enter parts and if their
parts are not in the database you can
add it and they'll verify it and all
sorts of stuff so it it's kind of like a
crowd-sourced AI only it's not
artificial it's like actual intelligence
now aesthetics aluminium it's hard to
find bare aluminum pieces I mentioned it
in another video I am a sucker for raw
materials raw metal raw gold look raw
aluminum wrought I just like the look of
raw unrefined and unpolished and that's
kind of what you sort of have here
although it's sort of a bead blast on
this cooler it's not brushed but you
have some camford polished edges here or
chamfered however they're called but
cases that's hard because everyone's use
a steel and they powder coat yeah so
we've actually had this case sitting
here in the studio for months
coolermaster is pretty pissed I didn't
use it so this is the perfect
opportunity because this is an aluminum
case okay so this is gonna be a little
bit of a mini review on the SL 600 I
have this thing like I don't like
reviewing cases stand alone
we are going to be reviewing a some
cases around here like a new mesh fi
we're gonna be taking a look at mesh my
cue additives but I like to do builds
with cases because that's how you truly
get a sense of what's what that's how
you truly figure out where the
shortcomings are I mean we can look at
it theoretically and be like yeah this
and yeah that been tastes are building
in it you may not find where the
shortcomings are so tell me this wasn't
the right case for this now you might be
looking at this going but J solid panels
and solid cases are terrible for airflow
not when you got to 200 millimeter fans
pulling an air from the bottom folks
look at that so the design in terms of
the cooling on this it's very similar to
how heat rises right so you got two 200
millimeter fans on the bottom pulling
air or pushing air up which is a natural
rise of heat to go out the top which is
why the top of this is nothing but one
big vent you can take these 200
millimeter fans out if you want and then
you can replace them obviously with fans
on the bottom and put the radiator on
this side so not that I want to use this
guy because I think it's gonna be too
big but yeah and the motherboard still
fits
maybe we'll use this guy so I think I'm
gonna be using the X 470 crosshair hero
motherboard
I was really debating do I want to do
thread Ripper or not and I think to
truly showcase like where the value has
always been is the rise n is what really
forced Intel's hand at bringing more
cores to mainstream going with rise in
mainstream on the X 470 would just kind
of be like paying respects to that
achievement that AMD got so no AMD
sponsor on this this is on me I swear
I'm saying this out of my own B own my
own little soft spot for AMD remember I
started this channel with an AMD build
so we're gonna be using this I think so
if you want to know the full specs and
stuff of this you're gonna have to go to
the build GG website so you can see all
of that rather than me listening it down
here you can go there and check it out
would you just look at it alright so
let's just sort of start to get a little
bit of a preliminary look at how it's
gonna be alright so see if this looks
like what's new let's take this in there
like and that's before I've even really
done anything so that could even mount
like along the bottom that's kind of
like a dope and like I said I could go
with a thinner radiator still to give me
more room here and with the power supply
cuz the power supply mounts right here
there's also a pump mount right there
pump Mel here pump Mountain there so I
could go with another like pump mounted
I'm excited about the idea of doing a
horizontal pump and reservoir like this
I've never really done a horizontal one
I've always kind of wanted to I've seen
people do builds and I think they look
really good when they're done I've just
never personally done one of those so I
think this is gonna look really good I'm
probably gonna end up going also with a
slim 360 for the top and the bottom so
I'm just seeing like how much room I
would have like if I'd mounted
everything on the inside but I don't
want to cover up like the vrm and stuff
we still need some airflow over those so
we don't want to necessarily like
insulate them you know you mean so yeah
I can take because I was gonna use these
RGB Vardar fans because they move such a
good amount of air and they're still
fairly quiet so the fans will go up top
radiator will go underneath which is
good because we like I said we can't
really pass
the fittings through on this anyway
because if I tilt this and show you
there's no way to get the tubes through
there so the fans have to go on the top
side which kind of sucks cuz then the
RGB aspect of the fans won't really be
seen directly but they will kind of have
some glow on the top because we're
thinking red is the accident color we
need with this black silver and red so
I've had this velocity water block this
AMD one because for whatever reason they
sell them independently a Intel and AMD
so I think I want to use this one I've
not seen like a bare metal one
not to mention would we wouldn't find an
aluminum one anyway like they do have a
full nickel but it's too shiny for this
like I don't think that would work so
well so one of the things that you can
do to really tie a bill together
obviously is custom sleeves now that's
kind of how cable mods sort of started
cable mine it's in their name most of
the bills you see me do over the last
year year and a half have been using
their sleeves the gold built was cable
bought the gold turned out absolutely
beautiful so I don't have any others
cables yeah I sell to order them samples
we got samples right here ladies and
gentlemen you want your samples we got
two samples no it's not about the sample
that they gave me here is they actually
have the pro cord underneath it I don't
you know this the color of the cable
underneath will affect the way this
leaving looks if it's a black cable it
will look very different than if it's a
white one like this and the pro light
they use white cables I believe it much
thicker gauge yeah but silver and red
for sure the letters army guns or to
make up for that right silver in red and
then we'll play around with it on the
configurator cable mod also has their
online configurator and that's how I
make all of my cables I go in there and
I use their you tell it which cables you
want 24 pin eight and EPS for feeding so
this one's got an eight pin and a four
pin so I've got to do both of those so
yeah we'll play rather than on the
configurator and then the cables that we
create are the ones they make and ship
to us so I think I'm gonna go ahead and
install the block though I'd love to go
farther on this build tonight today too
but I can't because I don't have the
radiators I need remember we went
through that with the other one and then
I ordered the wrong one again
yep story of my life
so I started kind of putting some of the
aluminum pieces back together the nice
thing about the tinted side panel is
when you turn it off it kind of blacks
out and then when you turn it on of
course it'll light up so we'll be adding
RGB lighting and stuff to this obviously
there's some things I need to do this
build I know you guys hate multi-part
errs but I had no choice on this one I
want you guys to be involved in it so
please do me a favor go to the link in
description below I mention it multiple
times this is going up on builds GG and
that's where the comments should be on
ideas on how we should do this this
particular bill now we have a pump mount
here and a pump amount here nowhere is
it big enough for the radiator or the
reservoir so it's gonna have to go
horizontal like this pretty sure I'm
gonna get I'm gonna ditch this this is a
50 or 60 mil something like that I'm
gonna go with the thin because I want to
do one up top and one on the bottom so
that'll give me two 360 rads which would
be more than f cooling for a single rise
n and our already on seven part of that
too is I need to fill this area here
with some tubing obviously this is this
looks very bottom heavy which is good I
mean that's gonna make it much more
balanced and I'm glad I have the shorter
reservoir for this guy here because it
fits here perfectly I'm gonna also see
if maybe simulated computers will send
me one of their silver covers for the
pump and I don't think I'd there's a way
I can make an aluminum cover for this I
kind of like they did with the wood one
we did for post Malone I don't know what
to see I know some people that make some
custom stuff Joe I know you're watching
text me I know more than one Joe so I'm
probably get a few texts but anyway for
the ramp - I think I'm gonna go with the
Dominator series again because they have
the silver tops that will all tie in
we'll have some more silver right here
and then of course with the custom cable
mod cables the silver with red accent
for sure maybe a single black I don't
know mate Phil made a good point the
black just disappears in here because
it's so black with all of the black
parts in here it'll just look like gaps
rather than I think actually being able
to tell that's some sort of a cable
alright enough rambling you guys kind of
saw the thought process that goes into
when we do these builds and I'm really
looking forward to seeing what ideas you
guys have because I look at some of your
user feedback and I look at some of your
builds and it's like
you guys give me credit of like this was
my first attempt and you gave me the
courage and a look at your build and
it's like dude you're better than me
what the hell the hell and of course
once again a huge thank you to cable mod
for sponsoring today's video and we will
obviously document the process as we go
on this and or even asked no it's not a
giveaway this one's mine giving away
that NZXT computer we talked about I won
with the 28th ETI lightning Z in there
that one dude when did we get a lake
across the street that entire like
construction lot is like water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
