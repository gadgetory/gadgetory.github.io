to spinning chairs oh my goodness
what's up guys Jase $0.02 hereness the
holiday season which always puts me in a
damn good mood but you know what's put
me in a really good mood lately
you guys ever since we had that little
chat
things have been so much better in the
comments section that I said I wasn't
gonna do this giveaway but you know what
screw it I want to show my appreciation
for you guys so we're doing it anyways
I've teamed up with EDG a on this one
because they have also been hugely
supportive of my channel so guys make
sure you go and check out ebj stuff it
they have been absolutely instrumental
allowing me to do some of the epic
builds that you guys have seen in the
past so that's why I have teamed up with
EDG a.m. this one they have become more
than just a brand affiliate of mine they
have actually become friends I think it
might shed a tear now this giveaway is
leading up to an epic giveaway that will
be taking place at a million subscribers
trust me you don't want to miss that
can't wait till we get there but that's
a future discussion because we're not
there yet just a little teaser but
today's giveaway I will be picking three
winners a third second and first place
third place will be winning a GTX 1060
super clock from EVGA second place will
be winning a 1070 superclocked from EVGA
and first place will be winning a 1080
super cloth from EVGA
but again guys this is just my way of
giving back I wish I could give all of
you graphics card I swear I wish I could
buy eight hundred and twelve or thirteen
thousand graphics cards is kind of
expensive just a little bit now the
other thing you have to do is you have
to do the legwork you've got to go down
to the description you got to click the
link to the gleam page which is where
I'm hosting this giveaway because it
keeps things just fair it keeps track of
everything nothing gets lost that way
and read all of the rules and
regulations on how to enter I'm keeping
it simple I promise there's not a
bajillion ways to enter but don't come
at me and ask me when does it end who is
the winner
when is the winner going to be announced
because all that information is down
there you just have to read and I won't
be answering any of those comments
because it's all right here in front of
you
anyway guys time to go thanks for
watching I can't wait for the 1 million
subscriber giveaway we are so close
we're getting there
we're eight hundred and thirteen
thousand as of making this video and
that's because you guys are freaking
awesome
and that's why three of you are getting
Greg
but once again I want to give a huge
shout out and thank you to EVGA for
supporting me on this one because they
have been instrumental in supporting me
throughout the years and that allows me
to help make amazing videos for you guys
so that's time to go I'm all full of
Thanksgiving food you guys should be
tuned if you're doing Black Friday
shopping good luck with some good deals
out there hope you all find something
that you need but that said guys I'm
going to go and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
