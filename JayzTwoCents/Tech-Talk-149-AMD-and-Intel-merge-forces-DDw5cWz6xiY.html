I'm living in my and my mom's upstairs
room like I look like this looks like
you are I never had a room this nice you
kidding dude I wish had a picture of my
room to show you but we were too poor to
even afford a Polaroid camera to take a
picture my room was never this nice like
those you could see the floor first of
all is that full of like dirty underwear
gym socks
all right oh you know what I'm gonna
tell ya about my room I could fix that I
would throw some socks back there
dirty it up there yeah you guys know I
can't see what Jay is doing cuz he
doesn't have a secondary cam yet there
I'm gonna force him to do that in the
next show you can see one sock the other
one missed it didn't like land on camp
my room growing up was so bad that the
the floor in the corner of the room tore
away from the walls and was drooping
down about six inches and you can
actually see the dirt outside that
through the foundation Wow and on that
I'm gonna roll the intro
Jerry is poor Jerry is poor missed the
perfect stream there you like Nigeria is
poor Jerry is poor good night it is not
as much as was before
Jerry I've got a full circle my friend
they could be a new state column right
there man let's have everyone TechTalk
number 149 I feel like we need to
restart it and just say Tech Talk - Tech
Talks number two this is Tech Talk
number two you starting over
well I hate my background looks at
different yours looks the same no it's
true it's like it's like Stargate
Atlantis dude you gotta you gotta start
over it's a whole new series it says
like Tech Talk
Tech Talk sp1 this is a Tech Talk of
Lana's let me go ahead and poop out my
chat there we go I like to pop it out
and then stretch it out you know I'm
saying that way you can see it okay
already tweet out the stream it kind of
does it automatically it's that
generically I started a live stream I
need to get what I see it already could
I need to be able to go out there and
like change that like for insulin you'd
be able to change the default like auto
tweet if you know I'm saying you know
what I'm thinking about doing as a code
gasm project cuz I've been studying all
of the different API interfaces for like
if-then than that
and Twitter and Facebook and everything
it'd be it'd be pretty simple to write a
program they just have plug-ins for each
social network so basically just used to
add little plugins to it then you can
select them all and just say schedule
this to go out to every single Network
and like you could just keep adding
networks to it as long as there's a way
to screen scrape it or even just in put
it through a browser I could tie it in
and make it work technically since I was
just writing a little open-source thing
it could violate all the rules for those
platforms and like nobody can do
anything about it I just I just tweeted
out my friend if you want to share that
alright guys so uh MJ's do sense if
you're following me from Jerry's side
and that's Jerry aka barnacle is if you
guys have never heard of him before
aka rapey stache it's what I'm calling
him the rest of November hey hey hey
pedo pornstache okay I think rapey
sounds a little bit less like I don't
know see pedo porn I mean you kind of
well that gets me killed in prison so
you're right that's probably a little
bit worse yeah it's like yeah pedos
don't make it very well in prison so
it's for free candy BAM that I was
driving earlier I returned to Hertz
immediately after I figured out that was
the case pup Shepard donated $34.99 not
look at us do not leave this profiles
why not this profile guy's also a little
pup Shepard but not that way cup pup
scheppers a long time listener a long
time color information about donations
is in the description below please make
sure you guys check that out so we are
we are sticking to our format loosely I
mean we still need to kind of ease our
way into the format we can't just lose
easy
I can't just Ram it in there if you
don't I'm saying we'll never we will
never stick to it if we if we try and do
it too quickly so what we're gonna do we
have a couple topics we want to talk
about we have some segments that I like
today like for instance rant of the week
where we just talk and I'm trying really
hard not to kick my power cord and the
stream because it's like read by my feet
don't do it man that had that happened
to PD excellent for me when the guy
right opposite of me on the table just
like unplugged my entire power strip
he's like yeah yeah but at least you can
do it yourself
that's true uh my goodness um so
headline will just get right into the
headline news because there's a couple
different segues here um so raja Kotori
who you guys know is the leader of
Radeon technologies group or AMD it
makes fashion bags you got one of them
their new Raja dewy handbag
mmm-hmm movie The Times report people
seriously anyway he was hired by AMD two
years ago to head up the RTG which is
when AMD kind of separated Radeon from
the sister for the parent company of AMD
and Raja has been at the helm ever said
so the whole rx series as you know it
400 series and 500 series and then Vega
was with him at the helm now he went on
sabbatical back in September
so Vega launched you know lots of around
the around-the-clock type of nights and
working hard so he took a sabbatical
exactly forty days actually at which
time he was supposed to come back to the
company in December
if he hasn't no sabbatical means it's
basically like a long time it's a long
paid vacation
basically yep and so what what he was
was come back in December he end up
sending a letter internally to the
company explaining that he's he's very
proud of what the team has done he's
very proud of what they've accomplished
and the trajectory which the Radeon
group is headed but that he has decided
that he is going to be stepping away
from AMD and gay you know and they gave
all of the usual fluff of like you know
all the Pat's on the back and all that
stuff on the same day that Intel
announced that they are teaming up with
AMD to bring vage I still don't believe
by the way I know it's true but I goes
AMD and Intel have confirmed this that
they are teaming up to battle in videos
notebook market to bring ultra powerful
ultra thin notebooks their complaint is
that notebook sure there are powerful
notebooks out there but look what you
sacrifice okay they might have heat and
the amount of size and the amount of
power draw
you need sighting you know notebooks of
24 inches or 20 to 24 just stick 24
millimeters thick that's why I have this
piece of shit but imagine so what what
AMD and Intel are planning to do is
bring a laptop that is that form factor
but without sacrificing any performance
so what they're going to be doing is
teaming up for radeon apu levels of
performance and intel's better compute
performance and bringing the two
together which is kind of maybe that's
why we haven't seen a lot of rise and
based notebooks coming out so there's a
rumor and guys this is a rumor i am i'm
report
on a rumor so please take this with face
value is the rumor is that the timing
looks an awful lot like Raja might be
going to Intel also - there's another
rumor because of course stuff like this
really churns the rumor mill right
you're not listening to me
we talked about this no I'm Leslie you
know mom smack it down somebody for
saying I'm not listening to you okay
focus this is in our contract mister
that's a little too focused alright so
we're in the mid so now we have to think
about this from business perspective if
you're used to competing with AMD and
you have and if let's say someone like
Raja did actually move to Intel you
would think there'd be some sort of a
non-compete disclosure right
there'd have to be you'd think there'd
have to be so while again if it's true
that he's possibly moving to Intel that
would have to mean one of two things
either Intel paid him enough to just
like walk away and then and and deal
with the non-compete suit that would
come of it
yeah like likely fighting legal money
right or or potentially there's a merger
taking place that's what I believe is
happening that's more that's where my
money is
yeah they can free cuz the other thing
too is is technically like if he's
moving did this is the part this is this
where it blows my mind oh wait hold on
hold on hold on hold on
they say that Raja has already confirmed
he's at Intel Oh done deal so that's
gotta mean over in my opinion that means
a mergers coming because it's got to be
there's got to be because you know
there's gonna be a non-compete dude
there is no way the int like like the
AMD wouldn't sue that ever living shit
out of Intel for for sniping an employee
at that level like it's got to be in his
contract
yeah there's a no-compete for at least
like three years or this actually makes
me happy do you know why because intel
has the money to actually make this
happen and by this I mean actually
bringing a fight to Nvidia Intel said
five years ago 2012 Intel made an
announcement that they wanted to create
graphics to compete with Nvidia and
what's funny about this is there was a
rumor that there was a rumor that Intel
actually tried to try to team up with
Nvidia
to do this very thing and NVIDIA
basically shot them down in Intel
basically was like okay fine we'll get
you where we can get you just you just
be ready kind of a thing that was like
five six years ago yep
wouldn't this be awesome to see NVIDIA
for once get the Intel infect which is
basically where you got so complacent
and so just so comfortable with where
you are that some up finally something
comes around like Rison and thread
Ripper to I should shake the tree if you
guys don't know X 299 which launched
back in May was supposed to be launching
now this fall like just about now so
that means they pulled it in six months
because of the pressure they felt from
AMD right maybe they can do it to Nvidia
I can see that happening but but the
interesting thing too is like you said
it's kind of like that
the Intel bump you have a company with
so many resources and a company that was
predominantly know for being in bed with
Nvidia at least to some extent right uh
and now they're using subsidiary of AMD
or like one of their daughter companies
basically Radeon right like you said
there is a degree of separation there
but they are for all intensive purposes
owned by AMD intel's chief competitor
everyone's saying non-compete is illegal
in California AMD is in Texas guys it
wouldn't do any good
so compete the compete contracts like I
had when I had one with Microsoft had a
non-compete that said that I couldn't go
work for any other technical company in
the same capacity that I worked for
Microsoft which means if I went to
another company I would have had to be a
developer in something that I wasn't an
expert at Microsoft I can still be a
developer but I couldn't say like go be
an expert at sequel Microsoft sequel
server or something like that at Google
do you remember when we first were about
three years ago we were talking about
this potential merger between AMD and
Samsung and do you remember how we were
hoping that as Samsung would get dump
money into the into the Rd to be able to
actually make things happen
I firmly believe that AMD's lack of
power efficiency improvements on radiant
vega specifically just due to the amount
of money they don't have to spend on R&amp;amp;D
now the argument always was but look
they have all the consoles all the
consoles rumor has it they broke even
and or lost money on every console cell
it was just about getting market share
and which looks good to investors so if
you can go to your investors and say
we've got market share and a good
investor would be like well it looks
like you're losing money but it's about
investing in the future
what if now they have the money like
what if Intel's like you've got a five
billion dollar over the next 36 months
to invest in R&amp;amp;D do you think do you
think AMD can actually then make
something happen because they have the
capital needed oh absolutely I think I
think AMD sprint like you said their
principle limiting factor is just the
revenue because now that they worked
really hard to bring like rise in the
market and then thread Ripper and it's
gonna take a long time before they see a
huge return on that investment
yeah like the R&amp;amp;D that when it
everything so I'm pretty sure they
pretty much blew their whole wad
building that up so it's like they've
got very little spread around but if you
got Intel writing a blank check I think
they have the skills I think they've
proven they have the skills and the
technology to do it they just don't have
the money the resources and the time
yeah and Intel's kind of buying them
that now another thing is Intel's got
our Nvidia has got to be getting worried
because Intel has always kind of had a
good relationship with Nvidia publicly
anyways right I don't know what goes on
around this Heath but even working at
Microsoft I saw how clear there was a
relationship between Intel and NVIDIA
it's just kind of weird to see Nvidia
playing with the enemy now maybe AMD and
Intel AMD and Intel seeing those two
play together and the other thing is how
are they gonna do that without creating
any kind of competition to AMD itself
because think about it I mean they are
putting graphics on chip and the
capacity of an APU which is something
AMD is already doing so even though
they're working with a Radeon division
to do this they are directly competing
with AMD APU now correct I feel like
this is successful yeah well we've we've
all been waiting for rise in Pro right
and or not necessary resident pro but
rise n does mobile compute graphic or I
can talk mobile computing like laptops
and stuff we saw a couple at Computex
we've seen a couple sense in like I had
one I was supposed to review an Asus one
that just never came about or whatever I
think that's because this this was
happening so I think AMD might have put
put the brakes on a lot of the the atom
partners for like the notebooks and
stuff like whoa whoa well pump the
brakes hold on we got something coming
just hold off because a lot of these
were like being custom-built right by
the many fighters so I think I'd be
perfectly okay with seeing AMD kind of
get just completely enveloped by the
Intel corporate umbrella are not
necessary AMD the Radeon graphics
division
I am okay with seeing Radeon graphics
subsidy subsidiary of AMD be consumed by
Intel I'm okay with that because AMD
will still compete on their CPU side of
things but I desperately want to see I
desperately want to see Nvidia and Jen's
sons like smirk wiped off the face you
know what else might happen here - this
might be a little bit of a stretch but
think about it this way it would be
illegal for Intel to acquire AMD
technically it would make momen awfully
in the cpu division so they couldn't
straight up and I'm talking about real
talk about acquiring the chip
manufacturer AMD but remember they're
two separate companies they're only
dealing with radio know right right but
my point being is because Radeon is a
subsidiary of AMD and it gives them
access and they're gonna be using
similar APO technology and everything
what if this is a grab it kind of a
legal loophole to work through Radeon to
have direct control over AMD and even
though they remain separate companies
they start literally working together to
make the rival chips and then they start
price fixing the market and they control
both markets how is that any different
that was it has it any different though
between what iPhone or Apple and Samsung
have been doing yeah the only difference
being is that like Apple and Samsung
aren't direct they're not directly embed
together right I mean they use some of
the same components and stuff like that
but you don't have one person driving
both companies from behind the scenes
right there so there's a lot of
unanswered questions I mean it's just is
there we remember where'd you think of
that remember we're talking about a
rumor right Roger going to Intel doesn't
mean Intel it's going to acquire am
AMD's Radeon technologies division we
are we are hypothetically speaking here
but III obviously don't know enough what
the legal aspect of the fault it is
confirmed that they are gonna work on
them with it with like an APU capacity
like combat that is confirmed but what
we are now doing is we're putting
together the pieces of Raja moving there
and now them teaming up for it on
graphics or on chip graphics with Intel
based CPUs makes it look like this could
be the the foundation for a merger you
know the other thing too is that could
have been in and I've seen this happen
before to at high-level deals it could
have been a part of the actual deal the
the merger between Intel will not merger
but the deal between Intel and Radeon
graphics basically to acquire him
because he could run the show better on
that side and it would look better to
the investors overall
right if he was working it from that
side because we give investors
confidence because he's like the dude
that works on all that now he's sitting
in a position to control both the Intel
and the Radeon site one position what's
happened to AMD stock today won't you
take a look let's go take a look that's
actually a good question because I'd
imagine there's something big like this
would shock it into some some direction
AMD needs to stand on its own is what
ignition Chet said down five down five
percent hold on here at eleven dollars
and twelve cents let me look at the
trend hold on for the week I still think
that's normal for an announcement like
this it had a pretty sizable jump almost
a dollar so almost ten percent on the
six and then it climbed up to about a
twelve dollar and then it started coming
off and then I had a huge drop yesterday
right and now it's holding steady again
which I think could potentially be the
right time to buy no the right time to
buy would have been when it was one
dollar and we were joking about it
right even now I'd say honestly I'm
tempted to actually just go buy some
myself imagine around what ten it's at
eleven dollars right now so when it was
when it was a dollar and we were like oh
my god they're out to drop below a
dollar maybe we had spent if we just put
$10,000 into it which is which would be
very feasible a very doable investment
right two years ago we could have seen
11x growth in two years on that so would
be cashing out a hundred and ten
thousand dollars before all of your
taxes and stuff but man or you could
have just bought a shitload of Bitcoin
like last year when it was down at like
a hundred and fifty dollars after the
crash or whatever and I was like seven
thousand dollars a coin which i think is
probably a reasonable thing to say which
is more risky AMD or Bitcoin based on
the trend obviously we know the answer
to that question now but if I was
looking at it back then I didn't know I
would always say that the cryptocurrency
would have been the riskier market but
holy crap it whoa okay but there's all
kinds of risk involved right so why
don't you talk about your topic oh yeah
so this is funny so how many people in
chat have heard that aetherium 300
roughly 300 million dollars of aetherium
has gone missing three hundred million
dollars three hundred million dollars
worth of etherium we're talking about a
joto currency that's only worth about
$300
per unit versus Bitcoin which is like
7,000 now uh now what had happened was a
company called let me see if I could
pull him up here I want to see which
company it was okay so so anyways to see
it it was accidentally lost first of all
this wasn't an attack this wasn't
anything anything intentional this was
something that accidently happened but
it was an online wallet that did it and
it was some tournament let me find the
name of the online wallet
it's like proxy or parousia why the hell
don't they have in this article so
anyway it's an online wallet so it says
more than 300 million dollars of
cryptocurrency has been lost after a
series of bugs and the popular digital
wallet service led one curious developer
to accidentally take control of them
then lock up the funds according to
reports I'm trying to find then the OL
parity that's what it is the parity
wallet so if you guys use the parity
online wallet kind of like the online
wall it's like coinbase you'd use for
Bitcoin in etherion well parity this
online wallet service one of their
developers and his infinite wisdom he
goes by the name DevOps $1.99 uh
basically wrote a piece of code that
took all of the wallets cuz remember as
an online wallet they have access to
everybody's wallets they basically
manage your wallet just like a bank
would manage your bank account well he
wrote a piece of code that basically
went through and moved everybody's
wallet funds into one wallet like one
master wallet essentially it's a little
bit more complicated than that
but then when he realized the error of
his mistake because it was completely
accidental he didn't mean to do this
he moved everything in there he deleted
the transaction instead of moving and
refunding all the money back to those
wallets and as soon as he deleted the
transaction it basically went into the
blockchain which is the ledger that
keeps track of everything and
disconnected the wallet from being
accessible so the wallet is now lost
forever with 300 million dollars sitting
in it now the only way to fix this is
because because the way cryptocurrency
works is it's kind of a democracy if
whoever all the nodes that run out on
the net on the cryptocurrency Network
all run a certain version of the
software and if one of them changes the
version of the software the other ones
basically ignore it unless the majority
are running the app version so you need
51% of everybody to be running a certain
code base otherwise it doesn't get
accepted the only way to fix this now
they're saying is to get 51% of the
network and keep keep in mind there's
thousands of these notes right tens of
thousands of these nodes out there they
have to get 51% of them to agree to a
code change that would undo this error
but
this is like something that's never
happened before nobody's gonna go for
this yeah if it doesn't happen this gets
orphan forever this money could never be
accessed again well I mean if you're the
guy that's got like fractions of an
aetherium and on the line here then you
just kind of like whatever but if you're
the guys that have like big big amounts
of ethereum in there yeah you probably
would want to go for it cuz what's I
mean what's the what's the ramifications
long-term of this code change if they go
in and they accept the code change
across the board to basically undo this
transact this specific transaction the
ramifications is that other people are
gonna come forward because there's a
president set for it and then they're
gonna want their transactions undone
also I say and then you get in this huge
voting war where you have people
bringing up thousands and thousands of
nodes that try to corner the market and
become the 51% share of the network yeah
so so it can be a bad thing I mean in
all honesty it's probably better to let
the 300 million remain orphan than to
try to allow a code change to be
accepted now usually the way that the
code changes work like in the Bitcoin
network and stuff is everybody accepts a
code change that helps make the
blockchain smaller or makes it more
efficient and more and more efficient on
network bandwidth and power consumption
and stuff like that usually the entire
network accepts those openly and they
propagate throughout the network and
then you have the next version of
Bitcoin in this case they would actually
be propagating a change for the purpose
of recovering lost currency now even
though it was a mistake the currency was
lost through a legitimate action be at
the wrong action somebody who had access
to those wallace was them able to bring
all those funds together and then orphan
the wallet which is something that's
completely you know normal and you're
able to do that within the network but
it's something that should have never
happened you know the guy literally just
panicked this is a guy that panicked and
he was like oh shit I stole everybody's
wallets they're gonna fucking get mad
and then he instead of him refund going
through and refunding each transaction
he quickly wrote a piece of code that
went in and deleted the wallet thinking
that deleting it would undo all the
transactions but by deleting the wallet
all he did was just orphan it lose all
the money how or does one guy have this
much power because the wallet they were
the wallet so it's basically like the
bank like if you were that if you ran
your credit union for instance right you
could walk in and presumably open up the
vault adjust to empty everything out and
put it in a truck pour gasoline on it
light it on fire and it except for if
we're using as an analogy there's a ton
of safeguards there's a security guard
there's a security gate you know
bulletproof glass of punch code
thumbprint code it's like tons of things
to keep someone from being able to do
that so this
one guy through is through haste 300
million dollars I mean this is this way
mr. Kerbel makes us commit suicide over
this oh yeah yeah no no no I'm sure
thing is is I'm sure that some of those
wallets were huge high-dollar wallets
like it wasn't like a million little
wallets they had like 50 bucks in them
this was probably a couple of wallets in
there to add people's life savings
invested I feel like I feel like this is
the kind of thing that like regulatory
boards like to use as ammunition of why
something like this needs to be
government regulated and they will they
absolutely will because just like you
know banks are like FDIC insurance some
dude goes and shoots up the place you
don't lose your money it gets given back
cryptocurrency has no such safeguards I
mean this company I mean they can get
sued right everybody can see the shit
out of the parity wallet for losing
their money but that's a civil case
that's not a federal case so these
people aren't gonna get their money it's
a guy who deleted Trump's Twitter was
that real the Trump's Twitter really get
deleted
yes it's 11 minutes right that would've
been awesome though I did see some
tweets going around of like that Twitter
account doesn't exist for the at real
Donald Trump yeah I was like what I
thought that was just like a Photoshop I
never I'd never bother looking into it
I'm sorry but Trump and any search
doesn't usually cross my bar apparently
it was a ha it was an employee that had
access to delete Twitter account any
Twitter account right they were like I'm
an enforcement team and it was their
last day there and on their way out the
door they decided to do that and
apparently Twitter now is looking into
actually prosecuting the person for
malicious use of the system and stuff
like that you know you try I'm sure
Trump is being a dick about this and
like instead of fixing like the flooding
in some country or something he's
probably more focused on just getting
the guy punished delete this Twitter
account for 11 minutes cuz I just kind
of dude he is yeah well hmm well that
guy's gonna be dead we're gonna we're in
here on the news that that dude like
drowned in his bathtub or something both
of them the etherium guy and this I'm
telling you right now man this is this
is the divulged his name dude the user
DevOps $1.99 so everybody knows and you
just voted to Thanks well I mean it's in
every single article at least lets
people do the legwork to fill in IRS I
gotta go see this this guy has a Twitter
though no sorry I have to go see if he
has a Twitter cryptocurrency is just
fake money you keep in someone else's
pocket but then so is actual money
that's true there's a there's a you know
I can I can actually prove that that's
not true well vice actually did a really
good video about actual like physically
Bank back to currency or gold-backed
currency whatever versus the actual cash
that is in the world and how how digital
currency compounds but it's not actually
backed by enough cash in the world to
actually back the amount of paper /
digital currency we have floating around
so it's like if everyone called in every
debt ever there wouldn't be enough money
in the world to cover it like not even a
fraction yeah yeah it's pretty it was
pretty an interesting really makes you
think about why cold hard current not
currency but the actual like precious
metals and stuff that currency is based
on is so valuable yeah the other thing
that I would like to add to what that
one person said about putting your money
in somebody else's wallet ultimately
they have control that's actually one of
the things that cryptocurrency protects
you against is if you have a bank
account right you put your money into
the bank account that bank account for
whatever folds or the US government
freezes your assets whatever you no
longer have access to that money right
well the nice thing about cryptocurrency
is you actually can replicate the
blockchain to your local computer and
keep your own ledger in your own copy of
the ledger and as long as 51% of the
network doesn't vote that ledger out
which like we said just doesn't happen
right if that doesn't happen then you
own that and there's no way you go
anywhere in the world at any time and
come on and transact in and out of that
blockchain yeah and with nobody else
having their hands on you would just
propagate the change through the network
and I would see it cuz everybody has a
copy of it any transaction you do on the
network it's not one person as your
money it's everybody that's ever done
anything with the currency has a
reference to that money and proof that
it's there right so it's actually quite
safe a lot of people don't think it's a
it is as long as you're not using an
online wallet if you but then it's just
like a bank right if they fold or fuck
up they take your money I mean it comes
out it just comes all the way down to
the risk you're willing to take though
on a volatile market yep yeah it is it
and that's exactly what is it's no
different than the stock market it can
go up and go down it's controlled by
supply and demand and you know it's just
that's how it is yeah nobody can predict
the shit I know people that have been in
cryptocurrency for years this swore to
God that you know a Bitcoin was gonna
crash 80 times and one of them even
convinced me to sell all mine last year
like 300 dollars a coin and now today
both of us are kicking ourselves in the
teeth cuz I mean I'm sure he sold like
5000 aren't they north of like 6,000
dollars a corner now 7200 less
and the last time you showed me it was
6000 some when you were down here no no
when I when I was down there I think was
5000 we were saying wow that's the
highest it's ever been it's gone up like
another 2 grand this is like this is
like a housing bubble it can't sustain
it can't sustain no no it has to crash
at some point but the thing is wind
right it could go up another 7,000
dollars before it finally crashes but
when it does can take a lot a lot of
people with it okay I am gonna ask you a
very basic question regarding
cryptocurrency that I think a lot of
people are probably asking themselves
out there sure what okay cryptocurrency
currently alright so Bitcoin has a value
of over 7,000 dollars per coin right
mm-hmm
what's actually backing that coin to
give it its value nothing just the fact
that people will can spend it and people
are accepting it all you need to be a
currency is something I can trade you
that's making you willing to give me
something in return for it that's all
that makes it a currency right yeah
justjust just like any fiat currency the
dollar bill that's in your wallet that
used to be back isn't backed anymore and
it's not even you know it's worth the
paper it's written on but there's no
guarantee that's always gonna be the
right the only the only worth that money
has is what worth is put on it by us as
a people like for instance with crypto
currencies they all they all vary right
aetherium could gobble that coin goes
down and vice versa and what it all
comes down to us how many people are
accepting it how many transactions are
happening on the network how much
currency is coming in versus how much
currency is being acquired and spend and
transacted all those factors are what
dictate that the cost but at the end of
the day it's whatever people pay for it
right now so there's only five coins in
8,000 people want those five coins it's
gonna be 7,000 dollars a coin right yeah
well it's just it's one of the things
I'm I just I'm so I guess I'm so
old-fashioned in my mind am i it's gonna
be something behind it given its drive
but I guess just tape electrons I guess
if you want to get down to a J it's
electron currency backed by the
electricity that was used to mine it
well I mean I guess it's I guess it's
very true like the which is why it'd be
penny and the United States is so
obsolete because it cost more than
opinion to make a penny yeah right
in fact it's getting to the point to
where the same that nickel is actually
more expensive to manufacture than the
nickel cost there is worth yep and
they've been trying to phase out the
penny for a long time but the problem is
our economic system works in so many
fractions of a dollar and a cent and
there's so many uneven numbers it's like
how do you get by without a penny I mean
pretty soon they're gonna just stop
making them out of I think right now
they don't even make them
we had a copper anymore do they know
they haven't done that in forever yeah
it's like the original ones were all
copper now they're like what tin with
copper plated tin or something it's like
some alloy but pretty soon it won't even
be that pretty soon it's gonna be like
paper mache dipped in like Plasti Dip or
something like I mean they're gonna have
to keep you in Cheaper cheaper to
manufacture J no major currency has it
backing we already talked about that we
talked about that earlier so I mean I'm
not naive enough to think that like
there's enough gold in the world gold
and silver to actually back the paper
currency even we were talking about that
I was saying that's why actually having
gold and silver is probably the best
investment you can have in terms of
physically owning something I think the
best way that I would explain it is if
we were at war like if a war broke out
tomorrow and everything would shoot each
other and stealing each other's food and
clothes and stuff you're not gonna walk
into a store and offer them a hundred
dollar bill for like a can of beans
they're not gonna take it right because
that money has absolutely no worth and
now the beans is worth a billion dollars
well think of Zombieland right they were
like wiping their nose and you know
using two $100 bills this toilet paper
and stuff because it meant nothing but
and that's exactly what would happen
right the only reason money means
anything is we make it mean something
that's it same thing with cryptocurrency
like cryptocurrency is just this magical
thing the only so much if it gets
distributed every so many minutes or so
many hours then that gets distributed a
couple of people if there's more people
that want the currency than what
currency is available the cost goes
through the roof that's just how it
works I'm seeing it's a bronze alloy
it's a tin alloy a zinc it doesn't
really matter at the bottom lines
adamantium unicorn the bottom line is it
cost more to make it than it's actually
worth it's one of those things like when
I went to Taiwan for the first time
earlier this year for Computex
of course I did get money exchange and
pull money out you know so I had local
currency to use for the places that
didn't take visa or whatever yeah so
they have what's called the new
Taiwanese dollar and it was kind of
interesting because they don't have
cents right it's just dollars
everything's dollars but of course if it
everything seems super expensive right
so this this this veinte caramel
macchiato in Taiwan cost $200 right but
it's really it's it and it's funny it's
like oh I made the comment to Paul
Paul's hardware actually which was we he
made a very good point I was like oh
that's kind of cool that they don't have
sense this stuff here is like yeah but
everything's so expensive and once you
once you look at how much things cost
and each dollar becomes the cent right
so it's like yeah one hundred and fifty
five dollars so you walk around with
like a hundred thousand dollar note
it's like three bucks it's like not a
lot right stop a bunch of the Taiwanese
money which I actually brought back to
the states with me but it was under ten
thousand dollars in value so it was
perfectly legal but it was just funny
ouch so their coins of course are our
dollars so it's like a fifty dollar coin
you know yeah it's like similar to yen
right I've heard like in Japan you go
and it's like you buy a car it's like
1.5 billion yen or something for like a
Honda Civic or some shit yeah I was on I
was on Ray's website the other night
looking up the replacement stickers for
my wheels and of course it was like it
was like 2500 yen for the sticker you
know what I mean yeah it's like super
duper at least what it's like the
currencies just lots of it to make a
little but anyway crazy
so speaking of Nvidia and all that stuff
there was another announcement that was
made while we were on our way to PDX
land and that was that of the new titan
collector's edition have you seen it
Jerry I have not once you go look it up
real quick so you can see it we're about
to talk about here
I received a teaser email from Nvidia
that was a link to a YouTube video where
they were teasing the new Titan XP
collector's edition it's another one of
those bullshit swear it's like nothing
new it just looks different what they've
done is they've jumped on the Star Wars
train where they've got two different
collector's editions they have a they
have a Rebel Alliance and like you know
dark order whatever it is right the red
oh they're like a themed okay right so
as a red one and a green one and it's
it's all custom based on Star Wars so
they're trying to jump on that I have no
idea what the cost is because I haven't
seen it in terms of cost but as somebody
that's getting a new system built
tomorrow you were saying um what do you
even care about this custom I want to
pull the audience - do you guys even
care about these custom themed coolers
not even remotely I mean they're neat
looking but it's like how much longer
can you milk Pascal at this point well
here's the thing it doesn't look at
their RG either either red or green plus
your build is themed red or green you're
kind of you're kind of fucked well I
mean it's based on right light side dark
side oh yeah I don't know I get that but
it's like at least put some RGB in it or
some shit so you can make it match
whatever color your kit people are
saying it's the same price now let me
ask you this you're getting to Titan xpz
already have two tekneqs peas in your
system so yeah I'm actually trading them
out of William into the new one just
because we don't want to go get two more
Titan X fees if this was fresh and you
never put the original type next piece
in there for the same price which you've
gotten one of these themed ones in that
case yes I would
which one would you get and why oh I get
the Jedi cuz I just like Star Wars and I
like the Jedi it's not like green which
one would I get you'd get the red why
because you're evil as shit and all your
shits usually red actually I very rarely
use red oh really
yeah I've never actually had a red fluid
PC well I've had one red fluid PC back
in late 2012 2011 hmm which color would
you go with in well the green ones would
match like skunkworks now it's green see
that is true but but if I put them in
skunk works and the coolers come off
anyway so you know you know what I do
like about it though is I liked it at
least the design of the card is slightly
different like the window is bigger on
the green card than the red card the
shape in accents are a little bit so
it's not like they just change the
lighting and put a different thing on it
right you know one's kind of rounded
once kind of square so it does give you
a little bit more options as far as
aesthetics go but if you're not doing a
Star Wars themed build it seems a little
weird to have a Star Wars themed
graphics card either that many Star Wars
fanatics currently shopping for Titan X
piece you know what there's a lot of
Star Wars fanatics but I don't know how
many of them are gonna be the hardcore
gamers build the PCs they want that to
be the theme what I kind of love though
is is the audience will say stuff like
it's overpriced it's stupid no one's
buying this if you go to PDX land Titan
X's or as common as like soda pop right
there are titles everywhere so I mean
obvious that the enthusiasts which is
exactly why these products exist it's
the same price right your same price
twelve twelve hundred bucks so if it's
the same price I don't know why anybody
would be now the one thing I could be
seeing happening though is what what
quantities are they building these
things in oh I don't know now I don't
know if there's a limit per customer I
couldn't tell I think it might be a
limit to per customer because I'm
wondering if this is gonna be one of
those situations where they don't make
and everybody just buys them and then
just creates the secondary markets on
them for like three and four or five
thousand dollars like PC building
enthusiasts and who the hell would pay
that there's a lot of idiots we knew
people that like bought paid like three
thousand dollars to buy a goddamn Titan
back in the day that's true well at
least you got two GPUs on it for the
Titan Z but then it was true but that
was one of those times where like one
plus one equals three
and as remember my video my rant I was
just like how does one
one equal because it was like two $999
GPUs placed on one PCB with an
additional 50% cost added to it it's
like what the hell you know what this
kind of interesting now that I think
about it though is how can they offer
these at the exact same price is the non
themed Titan XP when they have to pay
licensing to Disney maybe they're not
paying it I don't know video if videos
out of business tomorrow oh that's
that's route that's actually kind of
really weird to think about it because
you'd think that just just what the
licensing alone that they depth up the
price on a significant you think this is
just a cash grab though instead of
creating a better Titan XP they're just
like oh we're just gonna rebrand the
Titan and sell it all over again i
hasn't Nvidia already kind of proven
they're all in it for the cash grab for
the last couple you have pretty much
pretty much I still like their shit
though that's the problem they make
really good hardware but it's kind of
like the Apple effect right you can hate
the company but you can't deny their
products are powerful and their work
yeah they're good and unless somebody
else rivals them they rarely move right
it wasn't until which Radeon started
producing good GPUs that were really
starting to rival them that all sudden
we saw like TI's this and Ti that yeah
but I think I think the problem is
radiata left too much room left too much
performance on the table with their
power draw versus what you got for the
performance where which is why the
justification for the 1070 TI was even
there but that's why I go full circle
and saying we need we we need the Intel
a.m. Radeon thing to actually put Nvidia
a little bit of a sweaty position to
make something happen because I mean
this is the pet if Volta doesn't come
out until GDC which is in the spring
then that that will make Pascale a 2
year a 2 year lifecycle we have never
seen a 2 year lifecycle from a video
since inception
it's been 12 to 18 months at the most
and if we don't see Volta until until
May that's two years Pascale sat around
why because there was no reason to spend
the money to make it faster right right
and I mean he Intel's honestly guilty of
the same exact thing - I like you said
they only they only rushed up X 299 cuz
it proved it was ready right I mean they
rushed it because they had and they
pulled coffee Lake in six months as well
coffee Lake was yes to be next year and
it came out when X 299 was supposed to
come out so everything
in six plus months on Intel side because
of the quote unquote pressure they
claimed they weren't feeling when
horizon and burst launched mmm well then
look right and it but that put a lot of
stress on the board partners too because
remember Intel doesn't make the
motherboards the motherboards are all
manufactured by Foxconn and gigabyte and
all those guys so it's like suddenly
they have to ramp up all their
production and what happens when you
pull in date and ramped up production
problems yeah yeah love way way less QC
uh I wonder I wonder if like you said
Intel working with Radeon now I wonder
if AMD is gonna or the Radeon division
is gonna benefit from that work with
Intel and a capacity of building a
better standalone GPU versus just an APU
I don't know like like I wonder if
Intel's money and infusion that comes to
the tables they're gonna feel not only
the development of a better APU on a
processor but rather a more
energy-efficient and faster GPU which
would then give them something that
would push Nvidia again to step off this
freakin Titan XP and create the Titan X
- little P well there's a good way hoax
a hoax mash and chest says maybe the
tech is hitting its limit there's been a
lot of schedule ah there's been a
discussion on lately about Moore's law
Jensen himself said Moore's law is dead
but he said it more in a way that he was
trying to say we're moving faster than
the rate at double you know annual
double increase at y 2x increase
annually so I've read that - that we're
actually outpacing it yeah so does that
all this gen Suns law now I don't know
well I think I think Moore's law
directly like like kind of indirectly
focuses on the theoretical top speed
that you can basically achieve in
computing I don't think it takes into
account that you can eventually hit that
limit then just chase other limits right
right there's an infinite number of
other limits you can chase because like
once you hit the top you know we're
saying 5 gigahertz in that ballpark is
about as fast as you know you're gonna
transact electrons across silica or
whatever so now what's the next big you
know superconducting metal that's coming
down that's gonna change that if it
doesn't why don't we just create more
threads more cores right that's what
everything's doing now that's why the
freaking CPU I'm getting tomorrow has 14
physical cores and 28 logical cores is
is because that now now what happens
when you take it a step further and now
it's like well now let's change the
instructions the CPU can only cycle so
fast but we can add or remove
instructions to make it even quicker or
we can optimize those instructions or we
can
software that's more optimized that runs
across those courses faster I mean
there's always another way that you can
optimize and keep going faster I think
we are a long ways away from hitting all
of the limit Moore's laws and tells
pricing scheme its licking its lick like
ninja that you get credit for that one
in chat yeah I don't know I mean
everyone likes to peg us fanboys but I'm
just as fed up as everyone else you know
I don't message me he said Moore's law
is as it applies to a single stream not
multi proc so that that actually makes
sense and I do believe Moore's Law is
being observed as far as how fast you
can push in terms of a single thread
base in terms of silicon and all that I
mean you know a transact electron so
fast right you start you start running
up against the physical limitations of
something but then you find you know
hacks if you will to work around it
there's a good question again it's from
slick the same guy that mentioned
Intel's more law Moore's law he says do
you think we'll ever see 128-bit OS what
do you have to say to that
ah God well yes the answer is absolutely
we we will at some point but I think
it'll be a very very very way because
reason 2 28 bit OS would be for memory
addressing and right now no computer on
earth even as close to as much memory as
you can address with 64 bits hmm so will
it happen yes but probably in like
thirty thousand years when everything's
like holographic matrices to take up
like a billion petabytes 30,000 30,000
years though how about you how about you
look at where we've come compared to
8-bit though no that's true but it's
it's a it's exponential so so like you
can only address four gigabytes of
memory with 32 bits but with 64 bits you
can it's like a factor of whole lotta
news here
let's see here 60 for addressing
limits coding 1 I think 20 years I said
20 years okay here so how much memory
can a 64-bit machine address ok it's
it's literally given in formulaic form
because the number would be so generous
so chances are we probably will never
see so yeah I'd be 16 exabytes a
physical Ram
ok but what if the entire compute
platform which we know what changes then
that's probably more likely than
actually hitting on in 28 bit you think
in the truth isn't the fact they've
tried to say like things are 128 bit in
the past where they've used to 64-bit
processors
for 32-bit processors like back like
that target Jaguar days in the OG oh and
all that shit they'd be that was their
workaround but they have a truly 128 bit
processor would mean that the processor
each instruction could address 828
that's a memory and honestly that would
slow it down that would not speed it up
a 64-bit processor is actually slower
than the 32-bit processor because I
asked to address more memory Jerry's
voice is coming out randomly yeah I know
discord is doing that and I can't do
anything about it sorry guys sorry about
that guys no it's not you it's just the
connectional so I don't so honestly I
don't think you know in our lifetimes
we're not gonna see a true hundred and
twenty eight bit because it doesn't
there's no real benefit to it that's the
big thing is remember the the the number
of bits that you have accessible to the
processor is directly proportionate to
the memory that you're addressing that's
really the only significant thing and
it's slower because you're having to
address more memory which means all the
mathematical computations don't have to
be of a larger factor and take longer to
run I have to imagine that we had we
cannot possibly in this be in a
situation where this is the only way
that computing can be done in the
history of mankind and future and Donuts
quantum computing already are already
exists and that's like I don't even
understand that shit it's so different
right ok so we've been streaming out for
45 minutes and we've talked about a lot
of topics and stuff the only other
segment I really want to do is rant of
the week do you have anything you feel
like ranting about I just want to rant
about the iPhone X cuz I hear everybody
just seriously like just drill in and
jizan all over their pants about it and
I'm not I'm not that impressed at all
and and full disclosure you and I both
have daily driven iPhones and I still do
ID I still do my daily drivers and
iPhone 7 plus I've got an iPhone 7 plus
myself I also have an iPhone 8 plus on
the way in that I'm not I didn't buy it
it's part of a video thing I'm doing but
this is the first iPhone I've used
iPhone for its simplicity and I've
always been a dual phone carrier right
guys if people have noticed in my in
some of the backgrounds of my pictures
and videos I also have an axon ZTE phone
which is a which is kind of like a
boutique type of Android phone um but I
carry I carry one plus three a lot of
people don't see this but that's my
second phone and it does have an actual
card to end an IMEI so this is like a
paid for line this isn't just a piece of
hardware yeah I really like my ex on
phone there's just a couple things I
don't like about that exact exon pro is
ET pro those
but anyway I digress you know what I
digress sometimes I forget where I was
going oh okay so ever since the iPhone 4
landed on Verizon and CDMA network I
have always used whatever the latest
phone was and this is the first time I
truly don't give two cents I don't come
in the same here same boat same about
when it comes to the X I mean like that
and even like looking at the the iPhone
8 right because you know they have that
they have the iPhone 8 if you don't want
to go the whole iPhone X option and I
looked at it and like the specs and the
camera and everything it's like nothing
on it really is pulling hmm yeah I said
the over said maybe getting one is
because it's being sent to me and I mean
he moved away from dual lens too right
it's only a single lens camera now
though I believe it's still dual lens it
just goes up and sideways so it is yeah
and that's gotta suck for case
manufactures right it's like the only
thing that's physically different is the
cameras oriented differently so now we
have to read to lore cases just to go up
and down since I decide oh I swear to
God Apple does that on purpose though
yeah okay yeah no it's that the iPhone
ain't normal one only has one plus has
the to the tutor but that was the case
for the 7 as well right right so they
haven't changed much in that department
right but like you said yeah changing
the orientation of things just to fuck
with case manufacturers I mean get out
your dremel but ya know the iPhone X the
thing the thing okay so my rant with
iPhone X is one it's stupid expensive to
even with Apple care it still costs like
a ridiculous amount of money to replace
the screen if you don't have Apple
carrots it's five hundred and some odd
dollars and you are gonna replace that
screen I'm sorry but that thing is like
a bar of soap
you are gonna drop that damn thing
unless you put it in a really expensive
case in which case if you put it in a
case you're kind of defeating the whole
purpose anyways of having a phone where
the entire front of screen is a screen I
want I want to talk to the price there
real quick
yeah see all this hate about thousand
dollars per phone thousand dollars for a
phone it's a lot of thousand-dollar
phones bill but that's the thing phones
have cost a thousand dollars for a long
time well Deborah just used to paying is
network subsidized pricing because they
want act because they want you to come
to their network so they cut the price
of the phone big time the difference is
there's no subsidized pricing on the
iPhone X so you're paying what the
actual phone cost but don't get caught
up on the whole thousand-dollar phone
that's what it's oh that's what a lot of
these phones have always cost so with
that argument out of the way I'm really
sick I like my feed I'm really mad at my
two
right now because my twitter feed is
full of all these like these phone
reviewers and stuff and it's like taking
on the iPhone X taking on the iPhone X
selfie on the iPhone next you know blah
blah blah portrait mode check I don't
care oh my god an app I did not
subscribe to photo feeds so I've
actually started muting a lot of the
people I follow lately until we're past
like the actual craze I know I'm see I'm
seeing the same thing from like my
friends they have the iPhone extra like
oh my god it's so revolutionary and it's
got a screen that's like half as bright
is the competitors screen when you watch
a video on it has to be in a letterbox
mode because it's a weird fucking form
factor and it has to stay within the
weird little little chunk in the bottom
and if you do make it fullscreen it's
like the shits covered by your earpiece
cut out at the top it's like you have a
square screen for a reason because
content is designed to play on a square
street well it's like it seems like the
only thing people can really talk about
especially the reviewers the only thing
they seem to really be talking about is
the display or color shift and what
selfies are like it's like that's what
is that where we've evolved to where the
actual and they see and these videos are
getting millions of views right millions
of views because they're talking to the
average ibrid cellphone pleb out there
everywhere all they care about it's how
well they can take their selfies and
this is my rant obviously the power of
gimmicks right it's like how well does
this phone take a picture at this flower
how well does it take a picture of my
face and blur the background
artificially took I don't care it's like
if if a thousand dollar phone the only
thing you can show me is what the screen
looks like and how well it could take a
picture of your ugly face I'm sorry
we've reached a low point as far as
mobile tech goes as far as I'm concerned
now to counter you just a little bit on
that one though I do primarily use or
fights for taking pictures yeah no
that's fine but it makes me feel like of
all the texts that you actually are
cramming into your phone if you're true
if you are a true tech enthusiast you
care about more than what your phone can
do than just how well of a mobile camera
is it that can make phone calls Oh fair
enough in Android is always cornered the
market by pushing their phone not as a
not as a portable camera like iPhone ass
but as a computer I mean and that's
that's that's both its strength and its
weakness the biggest weakness I would
say of Android is that it is too
configurable it does have too many
options it does have too many
settings and it gets to the point where
certain applications of the marketplace
because of the level of options that are
available it's hard for them to rein in
the quality on those apps in the end
kind of the continuity across all the
apps whereas with iPhone you have much
more continuity between applications how
you share photos how you ingest photos
how you move them between applications
you don't have the same breadth of
options but our depth of options but you
have the options that you need to get it
done quickly that's why I've like the
iPhone kind of cuz it's the Dumber phone
it's that it was like well why would you
want that when you're a software
developer because you can use it when
you're drunk right and my phone is not
my computer I need my phone to be the
thing that I can use when I'm incapable
using the computer my phone is my
communication device primarily either
it's posting the social media stuff
yesterday I had to switch my Google
account on my axon phone my ZTE and it
felt like the most painful thing in the
world to try and do because the minute
you leave it the Android menu system and
here's the thing this is gonna trigger
people because daily Android users
because I don't use my Android as much
so use my iPhone so to me it's asked
backwards from what I'm used to it's
just like jumping on Mac OS versus
Windows
so this is gonna trigger people who are
like no I know how to use Android soup
it easy to me I'm too I'm too damned
simple-minded with my phones too it took
me like 15 minutes and a lot of cussing
and yelling and getting angry at the
phone to figure out how to switch my
Google account dude I've seen you how
much he used like your iPhone like when
I was with you you're literally your
brain is like physically tethered to
that thing and you have to do a thousand
operations a second like if you had to
do that on Android every murder yourself
oh yeah I maybe want to just yesterday
with what I was doing with it um okay so
a good discussion has been taking place
in chat that I think that's impossible
on your channel well we're talking about
phones right so this is probably the
first Android has probably been the
closest thing you have to being the
computer geeks phone right absolutely
but what about the razor phone I do feel
it's a bit gimmicky but it's a bit but
but allow me to devil's advocate here
for a second my channel is about PC Tech
and PCs and and all kinds of tech we're
in car Tech lately and as much as the
audience is pushing back I'm just gonna
keep shoving my my anti crowd defense in
their face so I'm gonna show you what I
want to show you so deal with it or get
out but that
said I think I kind of want to buy a
razor phone just to be like okay is is
this is this a device actually made for
computer folk from computer folk or is
it a gimmick let me ask you that's not
gonna working system is running I don't
even know I've not looked into I've
totally not cared Bryan Bryan is the one
that came to me and was like hey we
should do something with the razor phone
I'm like why my audience would freaking
chew out my spine and and and wave it
above their heads if I did something
about the razor phone is like it's got
to be Android he's like if it sucks then
say it sucks like of course I'm gonna
say that but at just the fact that I'm
even reviewing the razor phone's gonna
trigger people he's like so let it be
triggered so it got me it's it's Android
so what is it just UI it's just yeah and
that's what most phones are mostly
that's another thing that I hate about
Android you can have five different
phones that look and act completely
different that are all running on top of
the Android kernel so what is the
Android or is the rice raisin phone oh
there was the next one the rise in phone
right now so what is the razor phone
actually giving you so the rate okay so
the razor phone oh no I'm looking at it
right now let me guess it's green
accents yelled on here so that's okay
it's it's pros are less he has an
attractive slim lightweight design okay
whatever it's water repellent and
scratch resistant they say repellant so
it's not waterproof
yeah he's an ip67 repellent normally to
say resistant yep as a fantastic 4.3
inch super AM L o le D screams what's an
AMOLED okay okay which I believe is
actually fairly old technology yeah a
1.2 gigahertz a dual-core processor
that's that's pretty standard so nothing
fancy yeah plenty of multimedia features
corporate and government grade security
whatever webtop functionality and decent
battery life okay what's the bad the
Motorola Droid a razor a large size
might feel awkward and small hands we so
it just say singe razor droid it's it's
literally just ask Indian so it's motor
oil
it's a Motorola phone yes it is press
one in chat if you think I should buy
this phone just to shit on it hold on
let me see here so razor no hold on let
me make sure I was looking at the right
thing because that I think that was
called the Droid Razr yeah the motor
does it have a little Razer logo and
everything RAZR no no what's wrong
wasn't the razor phone okay hold on bro
hold on Holsey what happens when you
have two phones from two different
companies or ones don't hit one you
our zer yeah this like the company razor
it makes like the mice and the
peripherals yeah all right I found it
okay no no sorry I was looking at the
wrong thing smartphone for gamers okay
hold on hold on this we just triggered
everybody in there goes all the ones
guys hold your one is wait till we
actually hold your one simmer down okay
okay this looks radically different okay
hold on a second oh my goodness okay so
ultra motion technology delivers refresh
rates up 120 Hertz okay that is thatis
unique is shit okay so it's a hundred
and twenty Hertz screen zero leg quad HD
okay hold on here so I don't know why
they can't just say 4k if I get
true-to-life cinematic audio whatever
it's got Dolby Atmos performance
optimized wait whoa what how the hell is
a phone had that mos
dude dude this is such a fucking joke
and you know this because you had like
the single sound bar at most shit a
house is just the seven but it can be
simulated at most absolutely done from
two speakers I have a video I have a
video going out about Atmos but the at
most thing isn't moving
is this two speakers at the top of the
phone firing over your head no no this
thing literally looks like it just has
the two speakers one on each side and
they're using the Atmos codec to
simulate the sound coming from different
places well that's exactly how the sound
bars work and I guess I have a video
about that and and the sound bar works
if you're in the right environment but I
still don't understand how that how
that's gonna work with a phone because
all they're gonna do is just shift it
they're gonna do that same thing that
was at a razer what does it Razer
synapse how does anybody use Razer
synapse before I have it but I've never
used it for headphones so if you use it
on headphones you can actually
distinctly tell the sound coming from in
front of you or behind you with two
speakers and it does it by like phase
shifting the audio and I'd imagine the
probably is doing something different
this with that most codecs you can even
do it in Windows now if you install the
new fall creators update and go in and
apply the at most codec for 14 bucks and
all your windows have you ever actually
sat and listened to like the the Atmos
mbar not the ammo sambhar no but I've
listened to a full Atmos system with
like the the firings because because I
know I know that Kevlar condom has that
but look right the sound bar next time
you're down here you have to experience
this it's actually pretty damn
convincing now that's not the one that's
sitting on your desk upstairs at the
studio right no no no this is a much
bigger it's a much bigger LG bar and
almost except the one that comes with
the wallpaper TV
okay yeah it's actually pretty damn
convincing I've had it for a while now
that videos going live pretty soon all
right hold on looking at the specs okay
they still haven't listed the operating
system that's running on it but it looks
like it has so yeah it's got that it's
got the Atmos code at Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 at the 8 gig of ram so
it's got a decent amount of ram 12
megapixel camera 4000 mAh battery that's
all pretty standard
they actually market the a gigabyte its
dual channel lpddr4 1866 megahertz
that's okay so the specs are pretty
incredible but so it seems like it's we
haven't pretty damn goods back we
haven't kind of no s yet no that's the
weird thing they don't they don't show
that less on here at all which is very
concerning see selfies cell processing
in chat just says the audio has to
bounce off space does it not that's
exactly how Atmos works that's why I
understand the gimmick of putting Atmos
in a phone it's like it probably has a
thing on it where it's like only an
Atmos if you're sitting just perfect on
the toilet and reflects off the ceiling
behind you
it's like Atmos enabled that was
disabled that wasn't able that yeah
seriously oh my the the Atmos down bar
that I have is upstairs in my upstairs
loft because remember up there I always
had just the TV speakers if you sit on
that couch and you just close your eyes
and listen to it you would swear to god
there was like a five points around
going on in there yeah you know what it
has to be Android because how in the
house would they have how in the hell
would they have a market place they're
saying that runs all these little great
shit there's no way their life
everyone's saying it's nugget Android
nugget alright that makes sense I mean
there are only two OS is for a phone
right yeah I mean well no three Windows
Windows Phone ball did yeah so I go back
to my original statement yeah exactly
exactly I guess I guess yeah no you're
right I shouldn't even mentioned it okay
so we've been screaming for an hour now
we are now moving out of tech this is
this is the part of the show I think
Jerry and I live for yeah we're talk
about whatever whatever you want so I'm
just gonna pull the chef interesting top
all right talk about just to else you
might get one of these I'm sorry but I
did now you gotta be looking at this
thing I'm like this is actually kind of
cool yeah Bryan Bryan was gonna reach
out to them to buy to get one for a
review unit I think I'm just gonna buy
it
her industrial design is so good that's
what I don't like is a lot of people
complain about quality issues I guess
their laptop had a lot of QC issues but
God their shit just looks and feels so
good
it's 7.1.2
alright alright I'm closing the tabs
Temptations getting me symbian for the
Winkies version the Symbian phone
Symbian phone
yeah the Symbian recipient the Symbian
phones so that you're so red right now
oh my god I'm sorry I just had a visual
of you talking on your Symbian phone
it's like we could understand you what's
that noise in the background uh I'm at a
racetrack it's good Dolby Atmos as MOS
as well you know what though I the best
part would be the sibian phone has a
ninety seven point or ninety two point
seven percent female purchasing reading
it's like well I want to know about the
other like six and a half percent oh my
goodness greetings from Poland what's up
Adri Adri was a creep factor alright
whatever happened to that phone os
Samsung was working on I don't who knows
oh my goodness Nissan 370z phones have
come and gone like some sort of like
like I mean Microsoft probably being
like the best attempt at least but
remember the was the other one that
Microsoft bought they just completely
flopped the Kin remember the Kin oh geez
that ran like its own operating system
that was completely proprietary as shit
in that oh my god I only think I think
was alive for two weeks on the market I
think I think the Jitterbug had a better
chance of being a better OS than the
Windows Phone Jitterbug I've never even
heard of that over the Jitterbug that
was like the old Google's it was at the
old people's phone the Jitterbug phone I
gotta see this no look at the size of
the buttons and they still have a flip
phone - yes and the little ediload tune
to read about god it was basically a
foam marketed for old people with bad
eyesight and couldn't touch the little
buttons and like their little
infomercial was like showing like an old
person trying like an elderly woman
trying to type them like the old razor
flip phone and they were just like
frustrated with it and then this phone
makes them happy because now they can
call their grandkids
dude this is hilarious it's like
rubberized
they just see how I cut your face open
accidents case it looks like it was made
by fisher-price it does and there's like
20 of them to like they made a whole
bunch of different ones yeah
can you still buy it now does it still
work yeah yeah they're still for sale
I'm looking at him right now hundred and
twelve dollars for like the one that's
got the iPhone looking screen but giant
buttons on it and then for the one that
has the physical buttons it's like $25
at Walmart I think I want to buy one for
Nick for Christmas you should get a get
him a jitterbug and give it to him say
you can't use any other phone this is
your corporate phone it's your company
phone that'd be fantastic oh my god yeah
oh yeah the old bun to phone we've read
about that one that never really
wouldn't you wear though no and what
ever happened to the phone that had the
modules you guys remember the modular
phone reflective snaps on the camera
that was that like mod yeah that was
like a pre Kickstarter thing I don't
think it ever wouldn't you wear it never
win anywhere but I thought it was a
really good idea actually I mean from
like an industrial design perspective I
thought it was cool that you could just
buy the modules if you wanted like five
different cameras on your phone you
could do it
Jay the mighty karma guys are making
over a 350z
I've been tweeted that and messaged that
and emailed that so much I mean that's
cool but I really don't care I mean they
could be doing a Mustang for all I care
and out of the same level of interest in
it I mean it's just I'm not like out
there like yeah 370z fan 350z fan BQ fam
it's like whatever I like my car and
that's all there is to it
I mean I like your car - how are you
digging the wheels now I feel like I'm
cheating on my te 37 s with these gram
lights cuz I like them just as much Nick
every time shit Nick gets an opportunity
now he goes we're hork like he's called
me a wheel whore now dude you you had a
boner to get those like 12 year old
wheels down there like II definitely
that was that was your unicorn the the
tes yeah but you didn't see them in
person though now that they're done no
no I didn't I didn't see him now that
they're done how's that cubby yet
working out for you either I'm glad you
got your phone stuck in there oh so that
was that's my excellent phone now you
said is like a logger in my car right
okay
fits perfectly yeah no it's pretty neat
like I was like worried that I was meant
to glue it in there cuz it it fits in
the little like the lip perfectly but
then I'm like but it doesn't fit in
there snug enough to not fall down but
they printed it like they designed it
perfectly to fit flush on the like the
the hump underneath the deck underneath
the center console perfectly so once you
put it in and you snap it down in place
it fits against both like top and
so it doesn't move it's perfect you know
what else we could do is a project if
you want is if you tell me the the width
of the phone like the actual width of
the phone I could make like a Brockie
you know those those little cup holder
things that they have for your cell
phone where you put it down the cup
holder and it holds your cell phone yeah
I could make one of those that's the
exact dimensions of that pocket like 3d
model into the pocket and print it and
then on the top of that have a mass that
comes up with the thing that holds the
phone so that the phone would be like
literally up out of the hole and you'd
literally just drop it in there like a
cup and it would snap into place yeah
the problem is if I raise it high like
that it's in the way of my shifter then
oh that's true I forgot yeah your
shifter your shifter is right in front
of that as yeah as it is right now when
it's sticking out it gets in the way of
like six gear in Reverse big time got it
and the wife just texted me and said it
was the Moto phone has the projector
attachment and the Hasselblad thing they
still make it that do you remember that
projector phone I do remember a phone
that had a pico projector in it I
thought that was actually kind of a
pretty common thing I thought there was
a couple Android phones either that or
the wife is drunk she said hustle
Florida's Hasselblad a real word or is
she misspelled Hasselhoff I think I
think Hasselblad is the guys that make
the really high-end audio speakers right
if he said if she knows that and I don't
write no because I don't I'm so not an
audiophile we've been so there's lots of
Android pico projectors but I don't see
one built into a phone let's hear phone
is he your smartphone projector let's
say we can find on the phone yeah these
are all these are just projectors you
connect them I don't see a phone with a
projector in it yes maybe somebody in
chat knows which one it is I see a lot
of pico projectors that just plug into
the bottom of the phone and they're
roughly the same size as the phone but I
don't know of a phone that actually has
a pico projector built into it now I did
now I have seen one before from North
Korea it was one of the candy bar phones
from North Korea that had a projector
built in nope no no no I remember this
is I mean this is Austin Evans had one
he showed it to us we were at dinner
with him when we're doing the day of
refinement thing with yep earlier the
year or last year whatever it was it's
the Moto Z force because it has those
attachments that go on the back of the
phone also was an attachment the
projector yeah basically it was like the
whole back half of the phone like as
magnetic and it pops off and you can
switch them with like a full camera or a
projector or whatever yeah it's got its
got like an array of sixteen pogo pins
down
the bottom right put the attachment on
there okay I see that was actually
pretty damn cool and in my opinion
that's the kind of stuff that would make
me like consider going back to Android
having a modular phone I think would be
a really cool thing I mean they already
kind of do it with the lenses on some of
the phones like the cases and stuff but
I think having a truly modular phone
where it's like I want to just you know
snap a thing on it get more storage
drawing a snap a thing on it have like a
fucking you know different modem or a
different radio band or something like
that yeah I think that I think would be
pretty cool and that's why I like that
modular design of the Kickstarter
project but the problem of that one is
you drop it and it like Legos I bet you
drew cry bus and like 13 different
pieces and you're like I've I feel I
feel ashamed that my wife knew more
about this than I did maybe that's
because it just goes to show how much
I've just not been into that into mobile
tech all that much so I just didn't
follow any of it all Hospital has a
camera manufacturer okay
yeah there was a fool there was a full
screen camp or like a full-size camera
he put on the back of it that was like
like it was like beyond point-and-shoot
level is like close to DSLR level got
you who was so who's the company that
made that weird camera that you could do
the focus you could do the focus after
taking the picture oh um
Austin did a review of it I cameras come
out like ray it was uh was it like
change they were around for a very short
period of time and then they went out of
business
Jay look at the red phone I don't know
if I could afford a red phone no the red
phone I looked at that too and it's like
the red phones just like the red can
everything's an attachment for it so
that's cool that it's an attachment it's
too expensive
what like buying costs on that ah I
think it was gonna be like $1,200 for
the phone if remember is either 800 but
with the with them camera module was way
more than that and of course you have to
have the camera module Apple makes $1000
phone tech heads lose their shit around
the world red makes his $1200 phone
photographers rejoice this year so
they're in it honestly didn't look like
it was that great it was just red red
cashing in right red though this might
probably everyone's saying a light row
where that why this thing by true
something you were looking for light
room ly CRO
oh I was he
want to see if this is it yeah the light
field cameras yeah uh this actually
looks like a different company doing the
same thing though the one the one that I
was looking at was different than this
but yeah it's the same thing it's like
it's a it's a special type of camera
where you take the picture and it saves
all the data from the sensor to the
camera but without focus taken into
effect so you can actually you can move
the focus right it's it's really really
weird how it works but they're called
light light field cameras and they work
complete oh I found hold I found a
picture one it's uh let's see what is
this thing called it is no it is it's
just you know there right it's the light
row ileum and it's just a really weird
ass looking camera but it focuses zero
millimeters to infinity on every shot
you take you can literally like set a
penny on the lens and take a picture of
it and it be in full focus or you can
focus on something a mile away and then
when you take the picture in the
software you tell it what you want the
focal let just take like a this just
take like a such a high-speed burst of
images at all these different focal
links then you just kind of choose
between them in the software or what
that's kind of what I think it does
because it doesn't use it but it does
use up a lot of space the picture the
picture size is very large and ef-2 used
their proprietary software they're like
redid it and process it created but it
never it never really went anywhere like
they had I remember they had a store and
my mall in the Bellevue mall they had a
store that was selling these but there's
like never more than like one person in
the store like they they definitely went
under mm-hmm
but uh but ya know it's interesting
concept though and then there was
another company that made a a portable
phone that was about the size of a big
cell phone that had like 12 lenses on it
did you ever see that one hmm no in
basically you take a picture and it uses
all of the lenses to gather a bunch of
data and then you again you make the
photo and post like you just point and
click and then you got like massive
amounts of zoom that you can do and
everything like that it's really crazy
like gold on your multi land smartphone
camera where is its oh here I think I
found it it's uh oh here I found that
modular phone well Abe Lincoln and Chet
glad to see that Abraham Lincoln is
still around and kickin he said to
studying done by software and it takes
like 20 images that's the only way I
could see it does it yeah oh here I
found it it's called the light it's it's
the light camera and it's got one two
three four five six seven eight
in 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 lenses and when
you take a picture it uses all of them
Jay can't the note 8 do that I don't
know I tend to stay away from incendiary
devices it's really good yeah if you
look go look up a light camera just like
you probably find a million things they
should have called us on another to
light camera but it basically looks like
a cell phone with 16 cameras on the back
of the house odd I thought it's not
light just Li gh T oh geez just do a
surgeon to search for light camera put
16 on man because it's got 16 lenses
it's comical when you look at first
thing you think of yeah you look at it
you think it's like a or something it
looks like it got wet yeah but it's like
they apparently you just take a picture
with this they said it rivals uh rivals
like even the best DSLR camera I'm so
sick of that I'm so sick of every time
someone comes up with some gimmick like
this it's always like better than G SLR
it's like if ever you know what as a
consumer this is why I've always looked
at it everybody compares blah blah blah
to DSLR this is berrin DSLR that's
really DSLR this is it makes me want to
buy a DSLR if that's the thing
everyone's benchmarking against yep a
night and I came from DSLR I should move
away from it because there's more to
shooting video than just image quality
yeah well you know that you shoot you
shoot on Sony
actually wish I had know what's what's
kind of funny is until it until I got
into dedicated video I never even
considered Sony I never considered it I
never considered the a7 I never
considered certainly not FS 5 + FS 7 but
I just never thought about it until I
really started doing research on Sony's
video products and and moving to a
dedicated video camera and getting off
DSLR where I really got excited about
video oh and other than the build
quality I'm so glad that I moved like
that Sony FD R X 53 cuz it's really
small it's lighter weight and smaller
than the DSLR was with the lens it gives
me more focal length right out of the
box than the lenses that I had granted
you have more options of DSLR that's
money right that's a lot of money uh it
gives me that ability very simple to use
records in definitely a record like six
hours on one battery where's the DSLR
was much more heavy on the processing at
least on my 5 5d Mark 3 right um there
was just so many pluses to just using a
video camera
over the photography DSLR but granted if
you had the right lens at the right
focal length on the right lighting
situation the DSLR did look moderately
better but across the entire range and
the freedom that it gives me these
little cameras they're way better
overall that's why I don't think people
that just about image quality in specs
that's that's part of it but that's not
all of it
you know what's frustrating is people
like lethal lightning in chat they'll
make a they'll make a statement like
Sony is garbage but then they give no
argument or they they have no
information or any argument to support
their claim so yeah when that's the
problem with the Internet today
bla bla bla is garbage because they're a
fanboy of something else admittedly
they're probably they're probably a
Canon fanboy they're a Nikon fanboy or
something I mean I've done to myself
right I was always a Canon so when I had
my Canon 5d Mark to mark three I was a
Canon snob and fuck Nikon and know I've
been there i I can I can say that I've
the frustrating part though is they they
they took the time to type it because
they want someone to see it and consider
their thought that Sony is garbage but
they couldn't take the time to actually
explain why they say it's garbage and
more than likely they don't have any
experience with anything other than some
low-end point-and-shoots or maybe some
mid-range point-and-shoots with video
capability and they're speaking to it in
terms of what Sony does in the high-end
space which is where I reside so yeah
their comment has no weight no validity
and really just makes it seem like they
should probably be playing with a Speak
and Spell because that's probably more
their speed because if you can't tell
guys if you're gonna make a statement
like something's garbage support it if
you want any sort of respects towards
your comment no that that I agree with
you get a lot of people they're like no
that's stupid and there's like nothing
to back at Apple back adapt doesn't any
of the reasons as to why you said you
liked the product right you know it's
like when you're like man I really love
the video quality on this and it's like
oh but it's got the you know our b TQ
pixel window and the other cameras got
the better pixel window and more higher
bit rates and everything I'm like but
but I'm not talking about that I'm not
talking about the physical specs on
paper I'm talking about the end process
result what it looks like with my
capability net man says Jay please stick
foot-and-mouth about your no date
comment no you stick your Wang in your
mouth I don't care if the no date has
the same problem as the note 7 because
the notes that you wouldn't reach but
because of the note 7 I don't want to
even consider a note 8 the no date is
pretty tits though I'd like to have a no
date but to be fair an iPhone
eight had swelling battery issues too so
I don't want a cell phone at all so is
the iPhone fucking what are they saying
the iPhone it's either the X or they
what I just said he had a couple yea the
eight was swelling and it was a catch
not catching fire but it was actually
the battery was swelling so much it was
splitting the case apart yeah you know
when I did that that little unboxing and
like kind of like quasi review of the
read the read Raven right Ram guy
everybody's like you should get a read
you should get a read they're so amazing
and I bought I drink the kool-aid right
I was like I want to read because under
the right situation with the right
skills and the right lens and lighting
and everything you can do an amazing
shot like he did some shots of the Viper
during the Viper shoot that I didn't
think we're possible like in the
lighting everything they looked amazing
but the second that I held that camera
and I fucked with the menu system and I
saw how slow the menu system was how
slow it was to react how long it took to
boot it up that camera would not work
practically for anything that I do right
like for my workflow that camera would
be absolutely worthless commit like like
the Sony I flipped the thing open it's
ready to go I shoot the video and
imports right into premiere without any
massaging I don't have to do any of the
log on off to do any of the application
of color filters and shit like that it's
very straightforward and for my workflow
and what I do that works really really
great and even though the red overall
has the the more top-end capability you
you have to deal with a lot of shit to
get that right and it's the same thing
with your Sony's and everything like
that the certain extent it's like once
you get used to them but it's like a lot
more manual stuff you you're definitely
more involved in the process which you
like to be but without the knowledge if
you were just in a quick situation you
were like running down the street and
something was happening would you reach
for your your Sony fs5 that yeah like
boot up and fuck with all the settings
are you gonna grab the thing you just
flip open hit record and it's going into
second I'm gonna go for my Sony FS 5 ok
well that's you my Soniya FS 5 boots up
in about five seconds and it's ready to
record ok that's impressive the red
takes like a minute yeah they say in the
main you system like you push down and
it's like down down down it's like I
don't know why their menu system is so
slow yes but but the problem is you just
you just took a problem with one brand
and applied it to another as a blanket
statement and that's what the internet
does as a whole and it really irks me
because though five seconds is still a
lot if I need to shoot something that's
only three seconds long five seconds is
a long time it's just it's not as much
but I think my argument still stands as
far as if something can immediately be
ready to go like your cell phone for
instance if you can push one button on
your cell phone it's instantly
recording video and something Crazy's
going on you want to capture that moment
versus having to boot up for five
seconds on something and presumably
because it's big you have to pick it up
or possibly change the lens and stuff
like that it's like I would still go
maybe you wouldn't but I would go for
the option that allowed me to capture
the moment versus how how often have you
found yourself in that situation one
you're not a field reporter or freelance
PhD that's like every ten minutes for me
okay like Xander is a squirrel man you
don't want to even know how I've almost
missed the Xander's done in you having
kids will you pray at all you don't you
don't record a lot of stuff I don't
think your kids do like for like the
internet or whatever but I recorded some
I said does I just don't put it on the
internet you don't put on the internet
but I'm just saying like for me like the
stuff I do was the and Ernie's telling
jokes and stuff I have to move really
quick because he loses interest like
that like I would never have a hope of
trying to record him with like my DSLR I
don't use my DSLR for family photos
anyway like for family for failure I'm
sorry my-my fs5 and stuff yeah I never
use that for family stuff we I have a
well just sighs first of all I'm not
gonna carry with me on the mall and
stuff no fair enough but that's but
that's my point is I'm just saying it's
the camera that you have right it's the
camera that's gonna do whatever you need
to do at that moment in time right I'm
never I'm not gonna build my business
off of a point-and-shoot or a an iPhone
or a samsung camera or anything like
that but I mean I saw a comment float by
a while ago that was like but Sony has
memory problems like I have no idea what
the hell they're talking about yes I
know this is different kind of memory
first of all first of all like the fo7
uses XD cards which is this guy right
here which looks like let's women
playing with this whole EP it looks like
an overgrown super-fat SD card but it's
not it's XD card it's got a read write
of like 300 megabytes a second that's
the one that's got the 8 pins on instead
of the 4 right I don't like the little
contact points I don't when you put it
in the reader there's a lot of them yeah
there's a ton of them there's a whole
bunch of contact points in there but
anyway I guess I haven't used those um
and they I've been shooting with fs5 now
for over a year and I machine with fs7
for about three months now and not one
time we ever experienced some so-called
memory issue or menu issue or anything
it's always been turning on it's ready
to go it's never failed us is that a
Sony memory card or key by third-party
memory cards this one's uh Lexar yes
that's my point is if you're saying
tony has terrible memory you're talking
about Sony's memory card you're not
talking about the hole all the other
memory cards they can use I have no idea
I mean I I like Lexar and Samsung all
those memory cards are like really
really good they would work equally well
on your camera right this is not compact
flash my god
it's executed like nothing bigs compact
flash anymore
some do something I can still do like
the new ones I don't know if they're new
but I know that there's newer cameras
that still use compact flash nickels
little really clean of this anyway so I
just I guess I hate fanboy ISM I hate
family ism and all sorts of fanboys we
we they exist they're everywhere they're
always gonna be there but God did they
Eric me I like I'm an Nvidia fanboy
though an Intel fanboy exciting I don't
I don't want to rise in system one intel
says them 99 how much Titans I don't
want radians I think you're a fan for
whatever you can get for free that's
true that's fair enough
and you know what for anyone in this
chat that bitches are wines that Jerry
gets sponsored or I get sponsored
there's not a single person in this chat
that self-righteous enough to turn down
a sponsorship if one came your way you
know you take it like that so she's are
the only people that bitch about that
shit are the people they can't get it
not as single Nick just said compact
flash is still a thing for high-end
icons wow I wonder I wonder if it's they
they have some feature or something that
the newer memory cards don't hella
faster than SD yeah like I said this XD
card when I it's four hundred and forty
megabytes per second on this XD card
yeah I was gonna say there's no way I've
never had a Compaq flat card that was
anything over like one night yeah I mean
x DS that is a new thing for f of 7 and
then the SD cards that go into the FS 5
of them going to restore it internally I
mean they're a max of what ATS 80 mega
biomega bytes per second right and then
I can read them at about 80 megabytes
per second when I'm transferring but of
course if we really want to take it to
the next level then we just use our SD
SSDs and our animos field recorder
interesting I think it might just be
stored just straight-up storage because
the the read/write speed looks like it's
only 90 mega second which is like really
slow compared to
even some of the Asti cards yeah well I
think s DS I think SD is is never gonna
go anywhere because of the
point-and-shoot craze and and they might
have a met have little cameras and stuff
that use them but in the professional
space man is it expensive for storage
like this 128 gigabyte execute or XQD
card yeah is like 120 150 dollars but
yet the equivalent for red is like 900
300 I know you're top of the minimax and
that's yeah that's different entirely I
mean the cool thing about our Atmos is
our so I've added to a demos ninja
infernos and the inferno is pretty neat
because it just uses caddies that you
screw standard SSDs into and you've got
a list of compatibility so we're running
850 Evo's and I can go out by 500 while
used to be able buy a 500 gigabyte SSD
for like two hundred and seven dollars
but everything's gone up lately but I
went out and bought two 500 gigabyte
SSDs at the time for like a hundred and
fifty dollars each so for 300 bucks I
had a terabyte of SSD storage for at
most for a demo i actually yeah and I
like the idea of using the SSD too
because they're still relatively small
but they got a shitload of storage
really high read/write speed even if you
connect them through like USB 3 or or if
you and if you haven't I can eat SATA
connector on your computer you can just
connect it right up to eSATA connector
you get full speed what I love about the
Atomos though is the fact that it's big
and heavy you saw it right yeah they're
awesome
I love but they're heavy and they're
large and you put the batteries on there
that we have it takes dual batteries and
you put the SSD on there it's weighty
but what I like about it is the fact
that uses Sdn or SDI input so we can
actually mount like Nick could wear it
on his waist if he wanted if he liked it
like I in a pouch or whatever and if he
didn't want to
I'd say huh hook that way doesn't
overheat but if then we could run video
output from that into a field monitor
still on the FS 5 keep the weight on his
hook on his waist and then when he hits
record because it has a communication
between the camera over HDMI or even SDI
yeah we hit record on the camera it also
hits record in the Atmos so oh it did
like sends the command over the SDI
cable it's the control over the SDI
cable that's really cool so yeah it's
pretty neat we've been playing around
stuff like
that but we also have this guy right
here this is actually one of our
favorite rigs this is our sony a7s -
don't ask me why i what with the seven
over the r there's a great articles out
there about which is what and why you
would like it better this mike is kind
of silly up here we've been using this
foot this is our this is our field rig
this also has an eighteen to thirty-five
sigma lens on their buttons of lenses
it's got this handle on here this is the
tilt a cage Nick or Jarius Cena's use
this we absolutely love this camera of
the that's literally the only DSLR that
I would even be remotely interested in
going back to as far as my primary
camera and the 3 and the 3 mark 3 is out
now - what does that give you no idea ok
I haven't been looking because I don't
feel like buying something I just like
how small the body is on it like that's
actually a small package like anybody's
learned a 5d Mark 3 was insane and that
can all be powered off like USB power
break and everything - right so what you
have right here is this is one of those
like like Amazon battery pack seller
blah blah blahs we could warm with the
lipstick one because it's a it's a
cylinder like this yep so we just got we
just Jimmy jerry-rigged our own little
mount fort right here onto our cage and
then we actually just run this cable
right here from the battery pack to the
cameras micro SD input' and then this
will actually power our camera for like
more than an entire day as long as
there's a battery inside the camera it
will take the power from the external
battery so if you want to take like your
20 thousand milliamp you know external
battery and yep and put it on this cage
you got a bunch of weight but you'd
probably power the thing for like a week
see that's awesome does it uh does it
use the autofocus of the lenses and
everything to it can if you have a lens
on there that communicates autofocus oh
yeah we use a meta bones adapter for our
canon glass cuz I can there's still way
more Canon lenses than any other brand
and it can communicate with the latest
software update but it's slow and it
hurts a lot
it's always hunting so we just use
manual focus for everything got it
because that's one of the things that I
rely on a lot in my operation is the
autofocus which I know you don't and
well yeah and Nick is starting to get a
lot better at it in the beginning we had
a lot of complaints about oh my god the
whoever's like autofocus sucks autofocus
sucks and it's like little dude
no there wasn't autofocus it was Nick
trying to find focus but he's getting a
lot better at it now so I was just it's
a it's an art all right yeah it's only
you give a guy a new piece of equipment
and he's got to learn it like anything
else growing pains
anyway I agree so we've got five minutes
left here what do you wanna talk about I
want to talk about my new computer is
getting built tomorrow what do you think
about it and how part be able to your
audio is cutting out you say game new
computer tomorrow you I talked about how
far you can overclock it yeah yeah I
want to tell you what the specs are on
it and get your thoughts on like what
you think I could potentially overclock
it to on air okay so so let's go through
it so the specs on tomorrow's bill that
I'm doing over at Puget we're gonna be
live-streaming that to by the way you're
getting a size 40 X and of that so it's
got yeah it's got that it's got the
gigabyte yeah the 79 40 X it's gonna be
on the gigabyte X 299 was it rs7 okay
the r7 so it's gonna have 128 gigs of
2666 ddr4 so you're gonna be populating
all eight dims yes okay that's gonna
lower your clocks there oh well okay
well I'd rather have more memory than
though it puts more it puts more stress
than I am see Oh does it really I didn't
know that is that just a whole quad
channel thing or is even more than that
now it just has to do with the the
memory controller I was actually having
a good conversation with kingpin about
this because it's something I've known
about for a long time um it probably
won't limit how far you can go on air
though Oh gotcha it starts just getting
down to the little nitty gritty when
you're right when you're taking it to
the edge the system is gonna have for
Samsung 962 terabyte m2 drives in it Dan
that's expensive yeah that's that's
where most most of the build cost was
the memory in the heart and the storage
yeah
and then it's got a regularly cooling
those in some way oh I'm sure I'm sure
they will that on my old system they put
heat sinks on all of them okay uh but I
was running I don't think I didn't I
wasn't 960 am i holding so is your only
heat your only cooling one side of it
and it's double sided true true so yeah
uh so and then hold on here we're gonna
build it out in the fractal design r5
titanium so delayed it's gonna be a
little bit smaller than my current one
so my current case is massive was it our
two XL - too damn big so so just just
out of curiosity on that foot so the
7940 runs of the stock
clock speed of 3.1 yards how much
Headroom do you think you could get on
that like safely on air not very far not
very far you think that that's probably
running pretty close to it you've got a
lot of course in that 14 of them I know
why are you I've got I've got the 16 in
the 18 core I've got the 18 core running
4.9 on water but I couldn't I would be
able to run 4.9 under like something
like prime95 but in my day-to-day dad
tasks it'll work fine I am running my 79
60 X which is the 16 core on my
rendering slash daily machine at the
studio it's water-cooled at 4.5 and what
was the stock clock on it oh I don't
know I was like 3 some of that's that's
pretty impressive so on air I'd imagine
I could probably get to about 65 or 70
percent you could probably get a solid
like 3.8 3.8 would be sweet
like if I could if I could even get
close well especially the bowl premiere
because premiere really wants to see
course be core clock yeah yeah and that
was the thing that was the reason while
Bach but but you actually did raise an
interesting point about the more memory
putting strain on the control I just
gotta watch the temperatures primarily
right would you would you be willing to
give me some tips and tricks on that
when I'm ready - I'm not gonna overclock
it right of the box I'm gonna use it for
a week or so but when I start doing the
overclocking could you give me some tips
and tricks on how to how to walk that
thing up nice and slowly you haven't
done overclocking and forever no easy
enough but I have to assume they're
gonna be going with a cuppa gas not to a
cooler or something oh yeah they already
they always put naktu or coolers on
these things like at ndnd 14 or
something like that let me see I don't
remember what the name is of the one
that h14 come for the Zeon's but it was
massive I mean it goes all the way out
to the door of the case okay yeah I mean
you can it's not like 120 millimeter fan
on it you could probably easily hit 3.5
23.8 on all course but you can
understand that the heat like
exponentially goes up with voltage on
these chips yeah I figured as much and
this is 165 watch ship so Gareth Tucker
says why not water at X 299 Jerry's
system is all about reliable reliability
and ease of maintaining and there is
nothing simpler than air for maintenance
yeah and the thing is these systems - I
mean unless you run them under full GPU
load they're actually like really quiet
they put the noise dampening stuff on
the inside of the case doors and
everything the the dynamap look ins
yeah so these things like my main system
unless you run the GPUs that over 80%
you don't hear anything it's a dead
silent computer I see so I see Nick
isn't chat and he responded to someone
saying the one you can afford don't hurt
yourself with gear acquiring syndrome
you got I assume he's responding to
somebody asking about what hardware they
should get it's important to note that
Nick Nick came on board and got way in
over his head with the gear that I was
acquiring because I'm a gearhead
I love the gear and I had a lot of time
learning how to use the gear this has
been a long journey of growing pains for
Nick to start getting comfortable with
using our gear but this say this a7s2
right here this is Nick's favorite piece
of equipment that we own really yeah
he's he's the a7 he would reach for that
before any other camera any day it just
has its limitations still being DSLR
with regards to multiple inputs and all
that junk in fact there's something I
still have to buy for this before CES
otherwise we're kind of screwed oh my
god see that's the thing is I'm the next
camera that I'm looking at for me just
to stay within my genre of handycam cuz
I've just done so well with these things
is the new ax 700 which is the one that
has it does HDR it does 120 at 1080p it
does limited log it's not full log like
yours but it does something else like
log S or something like that well
they're all that's log but there's
essence
okay well as whatever the minute it
wasn't like the c1 but it gave you more
it said that it gave you more control
over editing that log it had the dual SD
cards so that you could do them either
in tandem so it writes to one the right
side when were rights to both room
simultaneously so you have a backup but
it was all in the form factor of the ax
53 just a little bit bigger cuz it's got
like a grip that pops up the side right
but otherwise it's it's literally like
the same camera I had a little bit more
of a focal length to it and I just
looked at and I was like it's about
1,800 bucks but I'll so Jerry froze that
oh are you back yeah okay Gavin you
froze for a second there in a really
derpy face if you look at chat you'll
see it it was like stupider anyways I'm
trying to figure out if on my primary
camera I want to go like a DSLR like the
a7 a7r or if I want to go with
the ax 1 or the ax 700 which is the new
the new handicap mm-hmm and it's a tough
decision for me to make because if I go
back to the DSLR route then of course
there is a little bit of a learning
curve there however other route it's not
going to be as good it's not going to be
as bigger of a sensor but it's gonna be
way easier for me to use overall yeah we
just hit 631 and I think that the
Internet is telling us it's time to go
because the call quality between us is T
rating quickly yeah I can see this time
to say bye-bye and prepare next week
yeah all right guys we got some content
coming up Jerry has got a new computer
being built tomorrow obviously and I've
got I don't know whatever wrote the
random crap and decide to do between now
and then of the week so with that said
I'm gonna go guys if you follow Jerry
over chicken man over on Barnard comm if
you've never heard of him before and if
you guys are here you then you already
know who I am so with that said I'm
gonna go thanks for watching when I roll
the outro Jerry take it away all right
thank you for watching Tech Talk come
and tackle Houston who's building my
computer if you just a rough with TV for
Sparky
if you love tech talks like lighting on
there's only 564 likes and there's like
2948 of you you know what to do push the
button before you leave push like if you
think Jerry forgot to build a computer
