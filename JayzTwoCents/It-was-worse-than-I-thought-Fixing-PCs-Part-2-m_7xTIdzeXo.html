remember this computer this thing I did
a video about probably the most common
comment on there was like oh that wiring
and I was like you know I'm just gonna
leave it well we can't do that we can't
we can't leave it but one of the reasons
why I'm gonna go ahead and rewire it is
because I also alluded to a problem that
he had told me about that I just
completely neglected to even really talk
about later on in that video so we're
gonna talk about that as well so we're
gonna go ahead and do one more video
about this particular computer and I'll
tell you guys I don't know stuff about
things and computers so what we usually
do around here the new z10 gaming
keyboard from EVGA features a built-in
two port USB hub volume slider
three-step adjustable wrist rest and an
onboard LCD display allowing you to keep
track of your PC's pxo see stats core
clock and more find out everything that
the z10 gaming keyboard can do by
heading to EVGA calm so the reason why I
have heaven running here is because I
was trying to at least put a load
situation on this this is a Radeon r9
280x not the most demanding of graphics
cards but it is a custom XFX card so
it's got an 8 pin and a 6 pin PCI
Express but it's running fine
temperature-wise were good 62 see it's
not dripping anything so I don't know if
the power supply was actually bad but
once I see that over volt protection I
I'm not comfortable at the power supply
anymore don't want to take a chance on
their computer when I have the ability
to swap it out for them and I'm not
gonna charge them for any of this I just
don't want their computer to die so I'm
gonna be putting in a master watt 550
and the reason for this the wattage is
perfect this is a 46 70 K with a like I
said a 280x not a very demanding system
but we've got all black cables so that's
gonna allow me to go ahead and kind of
clean up this mess most common comment
like I said in the intro was oh my god
that wiring how dare they well we're
gonna go ahead and fix that for them
while we're in there so with all that
said let's go ahead and get to it here's
our s XFX - ATX oh look at the dust in
that yeah we got more cleaning to do on
this definitely something I also want to
mention - about the smart disable on the
other video I disabled it so that I
could get past it to get into the OS
because once you get that error
didn't want to continue past it but I
did
Irene abled smart check and we did not
get a smart check failure which is why a
lot of you got mad like why would you
disable smart guys it was just temporary
and it wasn't smart on the SSD that was
failing it was on their Western Digital
black drive I did indeed tell them you
need to back up this hard drive and
replace it but yeah I'm not showing you
guys the back again because I don't
think anyone wants to see that carnage
what you doing don't show them this no
so you guys saw the long list of issues
this computer had in the other video
something else I'm noticing here is if
you look at this the motherboard is
missing like most of its standoffs you
see that you know I want to talk about
this real quick and I want to talk about
the community for just a second because
I saw a lot of really just unwelcoming
comments from people guys nobody builds
their first computer and does it right
and perfect the first time it's really
wrong for you guys to be as judgmental
as you were regarding this person's
build that's not the kind of community
that we want to condone around here my
whole point with this channel is to
teach people and help people have
confidence in doing these types of
builds and build their first computer
and stuff and there's nothing more
shitty and building your first computer
and being proud that it booted and then
having the community just shit on you
because the wires aren't as pretty or as
clean as you think they should be so you
know what knock that shit off so now
that preacher Jay is done let's go ahead
and take this antic out of here I could
not get it to give me another voltage
warning but like I said once I see them
once I'm not comfortable with leaving it
in there so the reason why this is so
wobbly the there's only two screws
holding in the motherboard the bottom
right and the top left kind of
reminiscent of the way Jerry builds
computers yeah that's a that's a
throwback to is challenge accepted way
of building time build and on top of
that only two standoffs
so I'm starting to wonder if maybe the
voltage issue we were dealing with was
potentially because of the
fact that it could have been groaning
back here because I even see scratches
here because you see how you have these
these solder 's that stick out these are
technically coated to keep from
hopefully causing shorts but if there's
no standoffs and this thing's being
pushed back that could cause the problem
so obviously we're gonna be adding some
standoffs to this now cleaning off this
cooler or a little more which looks like
somebody has spilled something liquid in
this computer at one point - like that
looks like liquid like someone dropped
coke or something in here
another reason why I personally don't
put computers on the floor next to my
desk either the nice thing about having
so many cases and stuff around here and
all the little toolkits and stuff that
come with them is I have tons of
standoffs available so there's that this
was probably a little bit of a rush job
on their part that could have
potentially caused quite a bit of damage
a lot of people were getting mad at me
like Jay you should have you should have
just handled that I'm flying I'm
handling it now get off my nuts
it also has mismatched RAM we have two
different types of ballistics in here so
this is starting to look more and more
like a PC building simulator build I do
that all the time on there to save money
I just kind of put in cheap Ram with
expensive Ram if they want an upgrade
don't ever know the difference
there we go all right so we got all
those standoffs in there now I'm also
gonna be replacing the fans on their
cooler they had some mismatched fans
here one of the zalman fans and this
antique fan this antique fan is not
looking too good there's a lot of
side-to-side movement of this not just
up and down which is normal but
side-to-side this fan will probably go
bad next and I'm putting in two of my
these are the older ek fans these are
the ek silent 120s so we'll be putting
those on there which will obviously
increase the aesthetics of the build a
little bit as well and I'm also gonna be
putting more screws in their hard drive
because there's only one holding that on
there where I'm gonna have my friend
give a talk to their friend remember
this isn't my friend's computer this is
this is one that he was trying to help
out with that he finally was like dude
dude I need you to take over on this one
I was like
the other thing too was on the cpu fans
each family plugged into something else
so they weren't running like the same
steam and so you'd have the fan blowing
harder into the other fan not letting
the air out which was just
counterproductive so ended up taking off
this top fan to have better access to
the 810 EPS power and then these fan
headers because this this case although
a good case is a before they really
started giving thought to having room
for radiators and top fans and you know
room to get your hands in there it's not
got both of those plugged into CPU
optional and CPU main CPU header so now
both of these fans will actually work
together for all those people that gets
really triggered by emblems and stuff
being upside down unfortunately this one
has to be upside down I am so not a fan
of these clips long as I can't see this
other hole haha was much easier that way
holy crabs this is also like kinda
before the era of quick release well
that's not even the right screw either I
wonder why it was like really loose cuz
this is the one that's really fine
thread like you would use on like an SSD
you know this PC was bad when people
were accusing me of staging it if I was
gonna do something for the sake of a
video I would say guys I'm doing this
just to show you I would say it again
before the era of being really well
thought out in terms of cable management
and would you look at that
well what just looked at it and I'll
plugged in at the end I want to break it
what's interesting about this cable is
it's got a floppy to molex and to SATA
on the exact same cable so the only two
things like pre-wired on the power
supply here is 24 pin and a pin EPS and
again I'm not too concerned about this
being 100 watts less I know the hardware
they're using I still don't think the
power supply is going bad but I'd hate
to go through all this work and then
just have it be like
guess what J we got at home and it it
gave us the magic smoke yeah we go see
if I can't get this actually go up
through here the problem is they didn't
make a very big hole you know I mean I
should just change out this top fan to
at night this is a 2400 rpm pin
this is going to be really fast but they
didn't really seem to care about the
noise to begin with so I'm not gonna
worry about the noise this ended up
being like a complete teardown which was
not what I was expecting I expected to
come in today and just do wiring so that
the internet would just shut up I'm glad
I did though you found again just so
much more wrong now this one I've got
the wire hanging down here because I'm
just gonna go ahead and plug this one in
to the chassis header so graphics card
another comment was why they why are
they using a PCIe network card when they
have one built in I don't know I plugged
I plugged my Ethernet into the one on
the motherboard and it didn't detect so
maybe it's bad maybe then install the
drivers I don't know this is way it came
in so that's the way it's going back so
as a front side looking a little bit
more presentable Internet do you want to
throw up in your mouth a little less now
and we've ready to fire it up and make
sure it all works because now that I
took it all apart knowing my luck
something probably isn't gonna work now
that's all just part of the fun that's
what it is fun is having we're having so
much fun around here okay moment of
truth okay everything's turning all the
fans are blowing the right way from fins
are going all the fans are go you can
hear them and it started preparing okay
so we have to probably reset our BIOS
SATA boot order because I replug
everything in I probably didn't plug
everything back into the same port that
originally came out of so we're just
gonna set that all I'm gonna do right
now is boot override to make sure it
works and I'm gonna rearrange the ports
to see if I can't get to show up there
goes so simple enough
this isn't plug it into a different port
and we'll be up and running guys are you
happy now hmm are you happy is this
better is this acceptable for the PCMR
does this fix your OCD there's this
unwritten cringe you I hope so
cuz that's it I'm done with this one
alright guys thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one
where I'll probably be making you cringe
again
so with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
