asked all the time about loop order and
loop preparation and all that stuff
because I tell you guys a lot about
radiators and pumps and this and that
but I don't think I've actually done any
sort of video where I specifically talk
about loop preparation and where to put
your parts and how to kind of plan for
it I've showed you build logs where it's
kind of buried in there but today we're
gonna use my new build here this is my
personal rig breathe it's gonna be bring
into the house so I figured it's a
perfect opportunity to show you how I
kind of prepare for things that way I
try and limit the amount of surprises I
get along the way but inevitably a
surprise will appear guaranteed do you
want to be cooler you want to be more
desirable well you're in luck because
right now you can own your very own Jase
to scent swag and immediately be the
cool kid on the block max out your sex
appeal by following the link down below
so when I'm preparing for my loop it's
important to make sure that I have kind
of the main components in there so I
sort of know where things are going to
line up because you can't trust your
eyeballs so you can't just look at it
eyeball it and be like oh yeah that's
where it's gonna line up so at the very
least we have to get GPU GPUs in there
and motherboards now for this build I'm
gonna be using my X 299 rampage 6
extreme extremely overkill honestly for
what we're doing but you know that's
okay not may the decision actually go
with X 299 on this and not Z 370 like I
originally planned because I'm probably
gonna have to nvme SSDs in here and just
the PCIe limitation with two graphics
cards wanting 16x in both of those for
Gen 3 PCIe I don't want to go through
PCH I want all of my stuff to be
communicating directly with the CPU I'm
sure the difference is negligible when
you're dealing with PCH PCH lanes but I
just figured why not so we're gonna go
and put our rampage in here now this is
a it says not an inverted case like you
see usually you see either like this or
like this but in this case it's actually
sideways
like that but because we are gonna have
a radiator on both the bottom and the
front we need to get our components in
here so we can at least start to measure
distances because I'm gonna be running
the PE series radiators from ek water
blocks and these are 40 mil rads so
they're a little bit thinner than
standard 45 which is nice as a standard
it's usually 30 45 60 kind of 15
millimeter increments but this is a 40
mil which is gonna give us a little bit
more clearance once you put that on
there once you get fans front and rear
you can see it starts to fill up really
quickly now I'm not gonna be using a 240
I'm gonna do two 360s but let's go ahead
and get things prepped and then we'll
start kind of planting where things are
going to go so here's the motherboard
and the graphics cards in place and
actually they go a lot farther down than
I was expecting so I am gonna be running
to Titan XPS in this system right here
not Titan Voltas if you guys want to
know why check out my last video and
like I said I'm not waiting for any new
graphics cards if no one's come great
otherwise here it is but as you can see
it goes down much lower than I had
initially anticipated that it was going
to do which meant that with the 40 mil
rad right here initially what I wanted
to do was I was gonna have one
horizontal it's gonna be a 360 going the
length right and I thought that maybe I
could then use the bracket here and do a
horizontal pump which I hadn't done in a
while but as you can see there is just
not enough clearance for that the sad
part is if I was using a slim rad like a
30 mil there probably would have been
enough and I'm not gonna sacrifice
cooling capacity for the sake of
mounting this horizontal so that's a
little bit disappointing I could
probably come up with a custom bracket
nope that won't clear the glass so
that's a perfect example of why we do
this now something else I'm gonna do
here in terms of prepping this and also
- I don't have all my parts of this I
don't have the monoblock yet for this
board I'm doing a monoblock so we were
replacing this heatsink with a single
block that does both steep
you and the vrm delivery obviously
remove water cooling the graphics cards
but I'm doing two 360s and the problem
with the front right here you can see it
split and my first complaint about this
case is although it has all of these
different adjustable points I got all
these screw holes so you can move them
in you can move them out same thing with
this we can slide it forward and
backwards because there's several
different mounting points they should
have just given you two 360 brackets
like this because this split right here
means that I can't actually mount fans
on this side of the bracket and then the
radiator on this side giving me more
clearance this way you can with this one
fortunately though is you can swap them
the other thing that kind of stinks I
was working with this anodized surface
you can see it like grabs your skin and
little micro scratches they always buff
out but because this is a sandblasted
dusted anodized finish it's easy to
scratch and so you want to be careful so
these two come out same with this one
here although this is a single piece so
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
move this one up front because it's a
single bracket I can mount the fans on
one side of this and the radiator on the
other and sandwich them together through
the screws and we can actually mount it
ended this way because I want the fans
on this side and because you've got
these different holes like I said we can
move it in and out so if you wanted to
move this bracket in and go with a fat
rat on the front and then have less you
know space right here you can do that
that's what I love about this case is
everything is just so well thought out
in terms of adjustability I just wish
they had given us two of these because
the way now that you have to make it
mount as I'll show you how you have to
do it on the bottom it to space it and
because of what I have to do now is why
I don't have enough clearance to
actually make it work like I wanted so
that'll go right there what we can do
now is we take these two brackets and we
need to flip them over upside down
because again because we can't mount our
fans on this side because you'll see you
never had that space in the middle we
flip it over so it's flat like this one
was and then we go ahead and line it up
with where we need it so this one I
think right here was where it was even
the hardware on this case is premium you
got these spring-loaded thumb screws
with your
tend to have a retention system so they
don't fall out or anything like that
yeah we go I think that's how it needs
to go so we take our 360 right here you
can see now the holes will line up so we
can get four holes per bracket but we
can't slide it any farther forward even
though we have a screw right there
because then we'll interfere over here
so that's exactly why we are doing this
test run now so I know exactly what I
can fit in here now obviously the 40 mil
will fit with these fans but there was
no chance whatsoever of getting the
horizontal mounting there now if we take
my to my 240 here which represents my
360 because of the thickness we can
actually mount this here like this
because we know the fans are gonna go on
this side but now we have to do a test
fit of whether or not this is gonna fit
how I want with the height and I don't
think it's going to I don't think that's
gonna work at all I'll show you why all
right so we take into account the height
that we have to clear here remember
there's still another 5 millimeters on
top of this that has to be cleared I'm
gonna put this little guy on here just
for good measure so he can be like
that's the height we have to clear right
there and as you can see because of this
this is kind of a terrible bracket in II
case I don't like this bracket because
look how much higher it mounts a mounts
and almost in the middle of the 200 to
120 millimetres spot right there so if
it was mounted low like this then I
could net I could probably mount it on
the second fan slot and have it fit but
as you can see if we line this up right
so obviously it's not gonna clear down
that way
like not even close and I can't bring
the bracket up any higher we're already
on the top slot so if I line this up and
say let's pretend that was the middle
slot as you see it's just a little bit
taller than it needs to be and I don't
want this to protrude out the top I mean
maybe if we were going for that diesel
car look and it would look like a
smokestack but that's not what we want
so I have two options here go with a
shorter tube which I think would look
really dumb with how high this is raised
up right because you would have a real
short reservoir tube right here but then
you have all this weird space and
bracketry happening so I don't like that
I don't like that at all so what I think
I'm going to do
is I'm gonna test mount this radiator to
this and I'm gonna see if I have enough
room to actually mount it on this wall
right here which I would I think would
be neat mounted to the radiator but they
just have it's such a terrible this
bracket is terrible I mean I get that
it's Universal and it's mean to have a
bunch of different things that can mount
to it DeeDee sees and and whatnot but
the fact that they force this to be
mounted horizontally I don't like it I
don't like I haven't this is the first
time it's actually become a problem so
it's like we actually have just enough
width right here to be able to actually
mount this to the back wall and still
have it be fairly even with the
motherboard cuz what I like to do is I
kind of like what doesn't matter whether
it's turned 90 or vertical the normal
way is I like to kind of Center the
reservoir and the pump on the
motherboard it's one of those
asymmetrical things that just it really
bothers me if it's not but then what I'm
noticing is that puts this reservoir
right in the path of this tube right
here
so height wide this height wise this is
going to work with why is this is going
to work but I think now what I have to
do is I meant to flip this red over so
the fittings are on the bottom which is
not ideal in terms of bleeding air out
of the system it's better to have them
on top the way the air can actually
travel out it's not impossible but what
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna flip this
over because I think I could 90 degree
fitting out and then have it Bend going
over the top of this rad running to over
here the idea to is I'm gonna have one
these tubes coming out and going right
in to the block right here for the
graphics card so it's all gonna line up
really well but I think that's what I'm
gonna end up having to do here and
that's ultimately what the layout is
gonna end up looking like and then for
something like the radiator is they're
not all the same sizes right would you
ever want to have like a smaller
radiator in there or no no because I'm
running two graphics cards I need to
have as much as much as I can get which
is why I'm running this thickness right
so this one's this one's gonna know talk
to me about the thickness now you guys
know how I got this on my lip no good
tell me about this if I flip this
radiator over and I do ninety two you
know ninety degrees
fittings coming out of it well just
enough height to come up and across this
way and one can go from the from the
pump right the out actually it's in so
I'll probably reverse it will flow
backwards see that's that's the stuff
you gotta think about that makes us kind
of tough
it's amazing how fast this case fills up
with spelling people get mad they call
it a case it's a chassis yes it's a
chassis is not a case fucking canvas I'm
a kind of experimenting for a little
while here first I tried to flip the
radiator over and put it on the bracket
side to push it this way to get more
room the problem is it doesn't have
enough overhang to wear the fitting
actually cleared the bracket so the
adapter that goes into the radiator
right here actually impacted on this I
actually thought about because these are
just bent over actually thought about
putting this in a vise and bending that
back to me more clearance but I can't
because of the the retention screws and
these are pressed into the metal the the
sleeve for this is pressed into the
metal and trust me on the terry crews
build because we had the extra sleds if
you notice I took the sleds out for the
hard drives nvme SSDs only in this build
so I'm not going to need any state of
power or say the cables for any of that
I want to be clean they don't come out
very easy I tried with pliers and advice
and everything I could not get it to
come out because it's a it's pressed in
there good so that wasn't it wasn't an
option I also tried seeing if I maybe
flip this bracket around this way and
see if I could mount it on the bottom
rail you know fan right here but as you
can see it still it still impacts we're
off by about a good four millimeters
there so that's not gonna work I think
mounting it on the back wall is
definitely gonna be an option one of the
things that kind of sucks though about
in a build like this is there's only so
many ways you can really make it work
without doing custom fabrication of
sorts and so it starts to look like
other builds that are out there there's
a really clean black and yellow build
out there I'll put some links below to
pictures of it that although good for
inspiration and a fantastic build I'm
trying to avoid it looking too much like
that one the problem is reducing almost
identical parts in that build and so I
just don't want to I don't want to fall
into that trap where it just looks like
someone else's build but that's the
problem is on something like this you
forced into kind of a certain fit now he
actually found a way to mount this lower
and I couldn't see in those pictures how
he ended up doing it I think he might
have made a custom bracket but I still
think the back wall is the way that I'm
gonna do it which is how I did it with
Terry Crews is build as well
I'm also toying around with some custom
ideas here about disassembling this
entirely taking the back motherboard
tray off here and wrapping this in
carbon fiber the like the 3m die knock
like the matte carbon fiber because
again this is meant to be an automotive
theme I could do it with like this piece
right here just some accents and stuff
because I feel like this has a very I
don't know sort of a Koenigsegg feel
although Koenigsegg isn't made out of
steel I'm also gonna probably do green
fittings because the green anodized
fittings from primo chill that
compression fittings I like to use match
the hardware perfectly so I think I want
to do that now I've seen some builds
where people will actually put the
reservoir on the front the problem is
going with a tall res like this again I
like the tall reservoirs I really want
the long one makes it yeah and if I
let's put this right here with this
stupid bracket as you can see it just
simply is not gonna clear so I feel like
we're exhausting our options here and
it's still just looking an awful lot
like mounting it to the back wall is
going to be necessary but that's what
I'm gonna end it because I think that
that's how I'm gonna have to do this
here is I'm going to mount it like this
I'm gonna have the fittings on the
bottom of this red and it's probably
gonna come up and go over top because I
want them to be visible I could totally
run it underneath but I want the
fittings and the tubing to be visible
haven't decided yet exactly what fluid
I'm gonna run I might do the view I
might do Mayhem's I don't know I'm I'm
gonna kind of decide that as I go but I
want a lot of this space to be filled
with tubing and stuff so I'm gonna go
guys thanks for watching let me know if
you have any suggestions for this
because I want this done I'd like it to
be done in December don't see any reason
why it can't be nothing incredibly
custom on this except for the cables
damn cables cables are gonna be hard
alright guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching
and as always I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
