bringing this some more aces goodness
here you guys have complained that
there's none of us enough aces products
on the channel and I think we've solved
that here with the x99 product lunch so
now we're going to dive in here with the
x99 deluxe we're going to talk a wool
pretty much all about this motherboard
and I'm not an AI or auto-tune or
whatever you want to call it overclocker
I like to get down and dirty and play
with all the specs myself but at the end
of this video we're also going to do
some Auto tuning here with the
overclocking and the 59 60 X we're going
to see how well this thing can perform
so obviously we have a motherboard here
but there's some other things on the
table so take it away JJ and what are we
looking at so we're looking at the
deluxe I mean this is pretty much you
know our our highest end version of a
mainstream motherboard that we're going
to offer on the x99 platform I love the
sideways battery by the way thank you
you know you got to try to have a little
bit of easy access right because of
course if you have the GPU LG another
water-cooled man yeah it's it's it's a
pain right but I mean historically
shouldn't be an issue because I mean the
battery should at least be lasting you
three to five years right on average um
but we will actually have a total of
three mainstream SKUs they'll be the
deluxe they'll be a pro and then they'll
be a - a so that follows pretty much the
traditional trend of what we have on the
mainstream line up for the Z series
chipset with the deluxe you're pretty
much getting the absolute best of the
best in terms of all the things that you
would want on a really high-end border
here so of course all the x99 spec is a
given so we're not going to cover the
fact that it supports all three of the
CPUs its ddr4 that's a given so what
really are going to be the
distinguishing points well first and
foremost you're going to have a ton of
just PCIe expansion as you can see we've
got one two three four five a total of
physical by 16 slots and then we have a
by four there as well the board is
really well suited for two-way and
three-way GPU configurations and that
actually ties in with a really cool
feature that we've introduced right here
which is a selectable switch that will
illuminate LEDs that are on the board
that will let you know what's the
preferred layout recommendation for
two-way or three wage values that in
itself is really cool
because the every motherboard layout is
different
and when it comes to trying to figure
out what's the optimize you know two-way
or 3-way configuration with this vending
PCI slot you kind of sometimes we're
left going okay which one kind of has
the same amount of gap you know you'd
let it guessing but sometimes that's not
the correct configuration right and it
depends because a lot of times of course
lanes might be associated in one way and
they might be associated in another way
so you're looking for that optimal mix
so we've already gone ahead and laid
that out for you now outside of that the
board of course has all the storage
connections that you would expect so
we've got serial ata
we have SATA Express and we have m2 so
when we take a look here and we just
reference some of the searle ata we've
got 2 4 6 8 10 12 so 12 total SATA 6 g
parts on the board that's just a monster
motor direction but of course if we take
a look right there we've got a coarse
SATA Express so each SATA Express port
will of course work independently as two
SATA 6 g parts so you're good to go and
right here we've got the m2 so all the
way around pretty much any storage
device that's currently on the market
you're going to be able to go ahead and
interface with this board and be able to
take advantage of which is already like
kind of one of the blaring improvements
of the x99 platform over x79 for sure in
addition to that though the deluxe also
does come included with this guy right
here which is the hyper m 2 by 4 m dot 2
expansion card so if you don't want to
use that maybe you just want to simply
go ahead and put it on here you can go
ahead and do that if you want to be
really crazy you could buy 2 m2 SSDs and
you could do a software raid and have
some really crazy throughput because
you're only limited by the PCI Express
throughput right a lot of users don't
realize that when they try to do these
crazy big raid arrays on the local
chipset the local chips that actually is
what's called DMI bandwidth limited I
really only can do about 1.6 gigabytes
of total throughput so once you get to
about like a third or fourth SSD it
pretty much scales off it doesn't scale
anymore because there's not enough
throughput is collection size you
express as much as I hate to use the
term bottleneck it's truly a bottleneck
yeah so that is just kind of a reality
the way the storage array configuration
works so this is another option outside
of course rate controllers or PCI
Express based solutions now the deluxe
also still features a fully isolated
audio design there's an integrated audio
amplifier on here and we also have our
niche econ audio capacitors one of the
really cool things that we've also got
900
created here is we have a deep pop
filter so that means that when you
restart your system you don't get this
pop that would come out of your system
which is a nice icon that's really
annoying when you have a subwoofer yeah
exactly yeah you hear that big old pop
of course you've got the front headphone
here and then you have the line level
outputs so that's entirely available to
you and that detection technology that
we have that's built in to allow you to
go ahead and map to that can work for
both the front headphone as well as the
line out and we can auto switch in and
out between those two um we also of
course maintain DTS Connect for guys
that want to sometimes take their audio
and multi-channel audio out put it
through a digital connection to like a
sound bar like a receiver or something
like that especially for high
entertainment pcs for the likely we're
living room area you get a lot of people
that want to be able to have that and
speaking here on the back IO you can see
the board is pretty well stacked right
so you've got you have two intel gigabit
ethernet ports that are built onto the
board we've got 2 4 6 8 10 10 USB 3
ports they also feature our USB 3 boost
technology so that always get a quick
charge smartphones and tablets even if
the systems off you got USB 3 boost
which is a way to optimize storage
devices and give them either better
performance you got classic 2 USB to
ports on there for legacy
interoperability and compatibility so
for like some keyboards some I some
devices sometimes they may not always
100% be I know some people have wondered
well if USB 3.0 is backwards compatible
why do you have to point oh but there
are some really old legacy devices that
may not actually work on a point you
also on this board have the world's
first motherboard that has full 82mm an
AC 3 by 3 this is pretty monstrous that
you can have real-world throughput
that's going to be in the vicinity of
you know three to four and a half times
the speed of 10100 Ethernet alright
pretty nuts along with that it fully
supports what's called beamforming in
turbo clamp and you get bluetooth so
pretty awesome so when you take a look
at that all the way around you're pretty
much packed to the gills and in terms of
also the networking we have what's
called our turbo LAN
packet priority software the big
difference as opposed to something like
the killer solution is that our packet
priority software can work on any one of
the network ports as well as the
wireless and on any ad in device that
you were ever to put on this board so
it's not limited to a specific
connection whereas in killer if you were
using let's say Wi-Fi you can't
prioritize your packet priority for
whether it's gaming for downloading brow
or whatever might be so you've got a lot
more flexibility in this type of
solution now in terms of the rest of the
board the board is packed in terms of
fan connectivity we've got six on board
fan headers they're all four pin but
they all fully support DC and PWM output
control and that brings us to this
little guy right here generally much
about we we talked about off Cameron
this is really awesome because you guys
know my systems tend to run an awful lot
of fans because I'm a die-hard water
cooler yeah I mean the system behind me
right here is 18 bits I'm sorry not 18
because I couldn't go push-pull but
we're still north of 1314 fans so which
leads the question of how do you control
all those fans if we were like me and
you don't want to go with a dedicated
fan controller so explain this so the
great thing is one is that having true
PWM output control not just on the CPU
but on every single fan header means
that we could just go ahead and buy like
a cheap PWM fan splitter cable you know
for five bucks goes one goes into the
fan header and then you could have three
or four outputs and then on those three
or four outputs you connect the fans and
just power those by the power supply
right but all those can still be
controlled within the actual UEFI or
within the operating system so that's a
great degree of flexibility but this
little fan extension module though we
natively take the six fan headers and
give you nine fan headers the cool thing
is this is entirely transparent the
moment you plug this in it looks like
they're just another set of fan headers
on the motherboard so you have nine
fitters so does it like on some fan
controllers may only see it as one fan
but it's just kind of dummy splitting
off to other fans the motherboard will
see each fan connected to this
independently correct so you have true
nine actual individual fan headers that
all have DC PWM and even fan calibration
so we offer the ability that we can
automatically calibrate all your fans
that's still available to you on this on
top of that one of the really awesome
things as well as we have full
temperature input mapping to all those
fan headers that's something that most
users don't even realize they have the
ability because they might not realize
the level of fan control that we're
offering but what that means is that the
chassis fan header can respond to any
one of these three temperature inputs
another optional temperature input
that's on the motherboard as well as
outside of the CPU the BRM the PCH or
the motherboard temperature so you can
have your fans literally respond to your
system in the most specific conditional
way and that's awesome because I don't
I'm not a fan of fan controllers because
I just don't want to add another
level of a device to fail yeah and the
motherboard seems like the most logical
place to let the control happen anyway
yeah okay so obviously we do have a
thunderbolt device here which is pretty
self-explanatory it's not really new to
this platform correct it's just uh but
you won't probably see it on most x99
platform so it actually is pretty
special but we offer Thunderbolt II X
support on all our X nominating boards
including the deluxe so you can go ahead
and just easily add that in there and
you're good to go in the same way that
we are also still offering and if sea
express support on this board where you
can just go ahead and connect it and you
have a whole bunch of awesome functions
you can do with NFC device right device
to transfer devices for mobile devices
or transferred files from mobile devices
you can transfer them in here they can
system login all kinds of really really
cool stuff that's built into that so the
last probably really special part to the
deluxe is really our AI Suite 3 platform
and we do have this right now running in
the system behind JJ this is a 59 60 X
yeah with the X 99 deluxe and so what
we're going to go ahead and do there is
we're actually going to go through the
process of actually showing you guys
quickly what a little bit of the
interface looks like what are some of
new functions and then what an
auto-tuned environment looks like but
the great thing we really that we have
with AI Suite 3 is it's the full system
utility we can do monitoring we do
tweaking we can do tuning we do fan
calibration and we can do Auto
overclocking and the auto overclocking
is really the unique part so with that
let's go and I'm most interested in that
because like I've said I've been very
vocal against AI tuning not just aces
but anybody's notice I'm all about learn
the ventures which but a AI tuning and
Paul made a very good point
yeah Paul's hardware is here hi Paul hi
he made a very good point to that ai
tuning in the very least gives you a
very good baseline to start at for your
manual overclocking as well and actually
I would say that it actually does what
you're going to even do manually there's
as a bold statement so let's see how it
does yes I definitely think that okay
but but your make a very good point is
that regardless it's also one of the
best ways that you can take literally
the thousands of man-hours that we've
had and cumulative lis in a very short
period of time be able to have a
baseline and understanding of what your
system specific to your CPU your memory
your cooling your power supply can
produces as far as a result and then if
you want to take it further you can
definitely do that so I think
let's take a closer look at it
transition so as we see right here we've
got a couple of options we've got all
core overclocking but I prefer to go
with our default which is per core just
means that we're going to dynamically
tune each individual core so that we get
the best maximum performance versus
fixing the processor to run at the same
frequency across the board but then you
can only overclock as far as the worst
core correct yes as opposed to
maximizing better course directly below
that we have different tuning parameters
so you can start from what's referred to
as our optimal ratio just means it will
start auto overclocking from kind of
predetermined value that we've seen from
the majority CPUs if you want to be the
absolute safest though you can go from
the pure default so tuning from the
absolute pure stock so continuing on
from where we have the actual default
ratio you can also manually assign it so
if you want to kind of shoot for a
specific target then you can go ahead
and find that target and we'll attempt
to automatically tune to that designated
target frequency now a new option that
we've also introduced is going to be
this one right here which is going to be
OC tolerance which essentially just
gives us the granularity of ensuring
that we tune for the maximum potential
on higher course a higher frequency
capable course versus limiting the total
overclock once again to all course so
this allow us to maybe say institute a
certain situation you could have four
cores operate at four point six but then
the rest of the course would only be
able to operate four point three we can
maintain that type of overclock scenario
and then directly below that other new
additions is we have voltage tuning so
by default we have a built-in hard rule
that will limit it to 1.3 volts but for
this generation users can go ahead and
see that if they have the cooling
capability to handle greater than 1.3
volts but that's going to probably be
for the majority users where you really
want it to sit and that's what the
default is but you go in there you can
see we could go in and we could define
that you could just simply you know set
that to whatever you feel comfortable
with right suppose you've run a you know
custom water cooling loop or something
like that you can go in there and just
say I'm comfortable with 1.35 yeah
exactly and you could make potentially
get even a little bit higher result
right directly below once again you've
got the tuning frequency option that's
available to you right here and then we
also even have temperature based
targeting which is really cool if you're
somebody that just it's kinda like GPU
boost for your CPU yeah if you just want
to say hey I I want you to get me to
whatever I can but always I still want
to operate less than ADC then just go
ahead and target that as new perfect
for people that live in a hot climate
yeah where they could say okay I'm
comfortable with you know 80 85 give
themself enough thermal Headroom from TJ
Maxx and then just let the rest work
itself out yeah and then we've also
incorporated a full a multi-threaded
memory stress testing the reason why
that's important is because sometimes
you can have a purely stable CPU
frequency but the memory divider at that
frequency may not be stable so actually
tuning both of these at the same time
sometimes brings down the hold of value
but actually insurance much land much
better stability correct and then
speaking of stability this is a really
big one we've now included AVX
instructions that support so for users
that are maybe content creation guys but
also gamers our general productivity
this is the same like running like
handbrake or rip BOTS or Adobe Premiere
and that's huge for a guy like me
because there's plenty of times the
synthetic benchmarks won't hit these
types of instruction sets so that I
think I have a really strong overclock
or really stable overclock in a 264
prime95 and I get into Vegas or I get
into Premiere and I start crashing yeah
so this is this is huge so I'm just
going to pretty much leave it at its
default values I'm not going to pretty
much modify anything right out of box
type of configure yeah and we'll go
ahead and do it the CPI Evan here is
actually really not that great of a CPU
but we're going to go ahead and run it
and then we'll come back to see its
results now all I'm doing is I'm
unchecking the other portions of the
five optimization just because we're
just targeting showing you this guy as
an example so and I think I'm think we
mentioned it beginning the video in case
we didn't this is the 59 60 X the 8 core
16 thread CPU which he says is not a
great overclocker so let's go ahead and
show the audience here what a not great
overclocker actually does sure let's
let's go ahead and we'll start off and
we'll see what the results are
collecting I'm excited so at that point
it's going to go ahead and just start
the tuning process and we'll come back
to it in a little bit and we'll see what
it shows ok ok so obviously this thing
failed and it found it it's it's stable
overclocked soiled it rolled it back
slightly to because I believe it failed
at what four point six attempt I believe
so yes correct right so 36 percent
overclocked 4.5 gigahertz on a three
gigahertz base clock on the eighth core
16 threads right 16 threads of 4.5
gigahertz and this is a poor overclocker
in your experience yes yes well when we
consider also that if we
would have incorporated the AVX which
would have been a heavier load it would
have been lower so overall I consider it
a little bit of a poor overclock but I
think the thing that overall highlights
is that you know we've we've done a huge
amount of work that manually even if
you're a manual tuner to do this same
thing would have literally cost you and
if you were skilled it would cost you at
least probably two and a half to four
and a half hours and you would have to
have information immediately available
to you on how to tune the platform as
opposed to somebody that Megan I know
anything where it could take you
literally tens of hours and rain even a
couple of days what I love is that it
shows individual clock speed on there we
have some cores at four point five and
some at four point four correct so as
you can see what we've done is we've
tuned cores from one to four up to 45
and then for the remainder of all core
frequency when it's under all load it's
going to be at forty four right a
maximum temperature with 69 degrees
Celsius and for that as you were
mentioning you know the multiple temp
probe locations yeah that's a kind of a
kind of a package temp in a sense
correct but you can also monitor if so
if you go back and look in the reporting
tool or if you were looking at it was
actively looking we do also report the
pure DTS temperature so you get both
temperatures that are reported to you
the other thing I think is the other
thing I really like about this is it
does show you the the wattage draw but
it doesn't for most people overclocking
they really don't care about that they
have PSCs that can handle that they have
coolers that can handle it
but it shows you realistically how much
power you're really drawing so from 140
watt based TPU up to 132 point three is
what it's showing its yeah that that the
TDP jumped quite a bit as a TPU thermal
protection you know TDP well the main
the main thing is like you said is a lot
of people don't conjugate it just to
keep in mind how much power draw make
change but we think it's an important
metric because sometimes people don't
maybe always have the best power
supplies and this helps you to
understand how much maybe you're looking
at total power consumption but all the
way around the great thing is that it's
a simple solution to be able to give you
an overclock so that if you put together
a really cool build you've got great
quality Hardware it's an easy way to
effectively actually leverage it okay so
we're talking four point five gigahertz
overclocked through auto-tuning it's 1.5
gigahertz overclocking auto-tuning so
let's say 1.3 if we want to be
conservative and know that
of ABX enabled we might have crashed
slightly sooner than that correct
so even assuming it would've crashed
Schumer let's say thirteen hundred
megahertz of extra power through
clicking a button letting it go took
what five minutes if that makes total
time I would say is generally going to
be between about nine to twelve minutes
for the audio tuning process how much
time a manual yes you do know but do you
guys know how much time a manual
overclock of testing individual
perimeters could take to get to this no
but what did it do with memory in terms
of XMP profile so what it is actually so
that's a great question we don't leave
memory by itself but memory is a little
bit variable the memory controller
that's built into the CPU even when you
buy XMP memory that's validated that
speed the memory controller may not
always be able to run at that speed so
what we do is we automatically enable an
XMP profile up to 2400 speeds if it's
greater than that that memory speed
won't be leveraged or won't be utilized
you would have to manually manually
enable it that's a really good point I
think a lot of people fail to realize
that XMP profile is an overclock of the
memory cradle yes it's the base clock of
the memory here is 2133 yeah but the XMP
is actually overclock profile for the
memory so it's not guaranteed speeds
well the memory is guaranteed to run out
that speed not necessarily with your CPU
right o'clock when the memory vendor
qualifies the memory they're doing it
with a CPU that actually operates at
that speed right an advertised speed of
3.0 to 3 points so you always kind of
look at it from the condition if your
CPU can run at that speed this memory
can run at that speed alright yeah what
out-of-the-box best correct so from our
perspective we tried to target an X and
P value that we feel almost all CPUs
even under an overclocked configuration
we'll be able to leverage but you can
also further test all of this by
enabling those options that we discussed
well guys I hope you've enjoyed our our
review here of the x99 deluxe here from
Asus dual intelligent processors 5/5 way
optimization I actually recommend this
software it's very rare that I recommend
a piece of software to do what I love to
do is an enthusiast manually I think
it's going to be a great solution for a
lot of people out there who just kind of
want to set it and forget it and JJ once
