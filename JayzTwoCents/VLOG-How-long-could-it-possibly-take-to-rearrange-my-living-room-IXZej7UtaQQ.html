so in true JS $0.02 fashion I'm outside
my cluttered backyard because what
turned into a simple 65 inch OLED l GD l
GD LG ola oled TV review turned into now
me completely redoing the living room so
I've got Dish Network in my living room
and I want to flip the living room
around in the way it's laid out I'll
show you that in a second so what we're
out here doing now as my air-conditioner
kicks on we're taking a look at the
control box for the DISH Network and get
ready to rewire all of this because
we're going to be kind of flipping
things around at the same time I'm
realizing this house has had cable up on
cable up on cable like rewired along the
outside of it so many times it's
terrible but hey I don't own the house I
mean I rent it so I'm not gonna pay to
undo all the stuff that's here before us
but anyway let's go look at the living
room okay so as you can see behind me
the wall looks completely trashed and
the reason for that is when I pulled my
vizio 4k TV off the wall with its
hanging bracket most of it like stuck to
the bracket and then did that to the
wall although that's kind of my fault
since I used really cheap like Walmart
paint so here is the LG OLED TV I'm sure
people are already freaking out because
it's face down but don't worry it's a
really soft ottoman and the reason why
all this is going down is because you
have to use LG's proprietary bracket
which you have to purchase separately by
the way she's really kind of messed up
you pay five grand for a TV you'd kind
of expect it to have its wall mounting
mechanism built in so anyway the thing
is if you if you look at the way that
couch is set up and my camera has
cameraman has come over here we've
always had this house sort of setup
partitioned where the living rooms kind
of cut in half and we use this couch to
cordon off like a sitting area when we
lose like a third of the living rooms
length and I want to flip this room back
around the other way so the TV and
entertainment center are on that wall
but the problem with that is if you look
over there
wherever by my son no sub that is where
all of the wires come in here and rather
than run wires along the wall or along
the floor in front of the sliding window
which would look terrible we are going
you have to rerun those cables outside
like I was just showing you so what
started off as a TV review is now
turning into a wall repair a new TV
hanging a wreak a bowling of the cable
and a rearranging of the furniture so
now we're gonna go to Home Depot I've
got to get sanding blocks and sanding
paper wall filler because not only did
it pull the paint off the wall it
actually pulled off all the paint layers
that were under it cuz that this house
is built in 63 it's had a lot of
different times that's been painted
maybe that's been sanded down and had
layers and layers of paint it pulled off
the primer and it pulled off the top
layer of the sheetrock so it is it was
really stuck but anyway I need to get
that and you get coaxial cable you need
to get butt connectors coaxial ends this
crimper like I said of sanding blocks
and stuff I want to get some like accent
lighting because I wanted to do some
good lighting in the living room I've
seen about putting the lighting behind
the TV so it kind of shines on the wall
yeah we're gonna we're gonna hipster
this living room up a bit read a stud
finder but alas
found something for you Jerry spackle
its back of the my pants once when I had
that burrito in order to fill the hole
the first hole
I don't feel like cleaning all my old
painting supplies so I would rather buy
some more BB supplies to throw away when
I'm done so we're not done yet we still
have to find and I need a bunch of these
on my hello
although Blackwood's and those myself
actually the darker
nice girl take all the ones I have left
they would have the tool other than this
tool they would have the tool somewhere
nearby it seems really close to all
those very wide angle lens huh
did you throw all these in here these
extra ones
seriously
she said something you did see if I can
paper things I don't necessarily need
that cuts an all-in-one tool crimper
cutter splitter or stripper what they
call cut strip terminate or as I like to
call it my last date and now we need to
get a showerhead because while I was on
my way out here the wife was like Oh
give me a new shower head what we have
massaging ones here's something that has
like real monstrous and vibrating
believe Lily made shower heads out a
pizza in
we talk about the technologies that are
in these showers ooh that was me
you
so confused it has two different
mounting location I like choice
five straight massage Henschel okay
we're good
best purchase of all with the vibrator
Charlie there's thing about coming to
Lowe's that I like is going home there's
a brand new freshly paved freshly
smoothed out 270 degree on-ramp so we'll
get hopefully there will be no traffic
in front of us when we reach it
we've all dr. Arun is rated 60
right on the edge
we
man like 65
all right we're back now
now all the fun gets to begin this is
probably gonna take me a couple days to
get this done I'm not gonna time-lapse
it because I'm not the ability to do
time-lapse like Paul's hardware does but
anyway we're going to start out siding
at the cables situated
all right so all I'm doing right now
it's unhooking this because I'm gonna be
cutting it so we don't want to cut on a
live circuit you know it's low volt so
that so that traces out here I
desperately need to clean this back here
at my goodness so I can cut this wire
here no more TV ha ha ha wifey I don't
really watch TV I would do away with the
dish altogether I don't watch TV again
don't pay attention my messy backyard or
the neighbor's dog so this black cable
coming down here next to the fireplace
is already going into my office and my
office right here
shares a wall with the living room that
I'm gonna be putting the TV against so
I'm just gonna use that cable through
the wall so I don't have to run another
one all the way over here that makes
sense that's funny that cutters right
here in my bike stands
huh you but I'm in a meeting probably
some stepping stool yeah that's me go
that way so now I want to go over here
disconnect from the splitter the one
that doesn't some I office you guys know
anything about the area I live in I have
to be very mindful of black widows
because they are everywhere
part of living in the desert and
although I'm tall I'm not tall enough
for that I'm good I got yes cool
actually it's a bladder prototype will
tell you here that when you live in the
desert this is something you gotta be
used to ain't it black widows
everywhere that seems sturdy the other
thing that's always up here too is wasps
nest so you can see some spider eggs
right there hey don't knock this down
that's actually like old though I think
they're not
yeah I dropped it like here and it was
like BAM they didn't break look at me
like that I've got this under control
shut up bunny damn it it's a little
funny a drop so is this the one going
into the house or are you gonna this is
the one that's connected to the one
going office got Ken and this is
connected to the one that was going into
the living room God so I extended it
here at this rate you won't have any
more excess slanted loop up dad did not
found out the tailpipes of that Lex is
pulling out the driveway oh no jeez that
was loud
I told me to get extras next next
let's fight words like whoa whoa whoa
buddy I don't know you whoa
all right so the house is completely
discombobulated now focus this
completely stopped working there we go
so yeah I still to repair that wall but
I've already got the cable run into
where it needs to go it's coming out
right there in the wall I sell quick
wall plate in there why are you not
focusing there we go so I do wall plate
and stuff yeah this has turned into a
complete full-scale discombobulated mess
the office on the other hand because the
wires are coming in through the office
it's also a mess it's like snowball just
terrible stuff all right well the 65
inch LG OLED is mounted on the wall over
there and we've got quite the mess over
here so this gives me an opportunity to
do some fall cleaning and get things all
orderly when it comes to the wiring
because the wiring is always been a mess
it's Little J thing I say hi all right
so we got stuff getting hooked up on the
TV over there we got some images and I
just put the spackle on the wall there
to fill in the spots that pulled off
sanded down ready to go
I still got a huge mess in here though
man and the wife's just chilling in
there yeah blurry as can be hello my bad
this now what time we start 11
well it alleged some editing let's say
noon there's about 12 we left it's now
like 10 10 o'clock 10 o'clock at night
it's only been at this 10 hours already
and everyone is still a disaster but the
walls patched so now there's got to wash
off the dust and then bust out the paint
I always keep a spare paint and I feel
like I'm doing a home improvement or
something wipe off all this dust paint
this once the paint dries which won't
take too long pretty quick drying paint
then we can flip the furniture around a
good thing time to clean up this mess on
the floor Leola debris from the sanding
down there but it's getting closer you
know this all start from itself because
of a TV review coming up and this is all
stuff that I wanted to do in here anyway
and I kind of just took this opportunity
I guess to get it done that yeah never
ask anything done around here because I
tend to maybe be a little bit on things
and get a little worked up over simple
things ordains later pretty cutie cutie
kitty kitty
smile she hurt oh yeah crooked I was
chewing on it okay
so I started this on Tuesday and today
is Sunday and we are pretty much done so
alright yeah Saturday see I don't even
know what day today is Halloween
hi hi down there there's the girls all
right so the goal of me rearranging this
room was to have more family space and
as you can see I think we've achieved
that the camera doesn't really show how
much bigger this room really is let's do
this actually come over here with the TV
is there's some perspective that big
giant couch this is JC sense over there
the kids crawling around hey you're
gonna tear your dress there your butt
out of this guy gosh anyway so there's a
TV over there a lot of time that's
obviously passed since I started this
project because I ended up having to do
the work we got a box of stuff there to
still figure out what to do with the
cat's bed my solo sub something else I
also did was I added to the rear so no
so that way we can get the surround back
in here for movie night there's a 65
inch OLED LG TV entertainment center all
done had to rewire all the entertainment
center stuff so look at all this room
plus room for activities here and you
love the camera don't you hi hey you are
too freaking so that wall is super bear
because the wife is getting free rein to
do family portraits and stuff up there
ring actually getting new family
portraits made in November and are you
doing patty cake patty cake sorry the
baby's very distracting and this is
gonna double as like family home videos
patty cake
but anyway the wife is gonna make that
wall back they're all done with art and
painting paintings but a family
portraits in things the cool thing about
this couch and I love this couch there's
no cat over there right
no cat back okay move your cut is you
can take this big giant Ottomans here
and you can shove it all the way over to
the couch in the corner and make like a
giant bed so you can have big family
movie nights in here little Jake and me
and Nick and coconut monkey Nick and we
already had movie night in here the
other night we watched Jurassic world
yeah and then mrs. Jay and I later that
night we watched a ki Miri Make a Porno
got some got some good ideas it's done
you guys can tell me what you guys think
but I wanted a big family room I wanted
to start using the fireplace again I've
got to get a fireplace cleaning done get
the bricks cleaned and then this is the
kids this is actually the kids room
doubles as the second family room here
this was actually first I did this room
first up this couch got a killer deal on
that couch 280 bucks brand-new over at
living spaces we'll use I'm gonna shove
a sock in your mouth I swear I'll smile
at me I'm being serious it's a serious
YouTube business anyway that's it for
this blog look for the review of this TV
going up probably within the next week
and we're supposed to be here a few
weeks ago but LG was running behind
