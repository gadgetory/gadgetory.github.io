I'm preparing for the skunkworks update
which I've been preparing for forever
now it seems god I'm getting slow with
these builds but as you may or may not
know I have three gtx titan x maxwell
cards currently in my system and i'm
going to be cutting one of those out and
replacing the other two with gtx titan x
pascal cards Oh has I almost dropped the
dang thing so what I want to do today is
kind of a preparation for that build
before I water cool these things I want
to see how far they will overclock in
SLI so I figured why not do a little bit
of video about this about some extreme
overkill gaming in 4k
I don't even game in 4k on the system
behind me it's a 34 40 by 1440 X 30 for
predator monitor but I figured why not
have some fun with these and see exactly
how far they'll go in SLI in 4k never
miss another upload on my channel by
enabling email notifications one of the
problems with YouTube is their sub box
and notifications are terrible so if
you've been missing some uploads you can
easily make sure that you never miss one
in the future by going to the
notification button and making sure that
emails are enabled and with that you
will never miss the awesomeness that is
my channel or the epic fails whatever
reason you stick around but never miss
another upload by using that easy trick
okay so I'm going to point out here real
quick I am using EVGA precision OC
because it does support the Titan XP now
so I'm gonna max everything right now
I'm gonna bump up the fan speed quite a
bit to because of the fact that I'm
gonna be running these on water so I
don't want obviously don't care about
the temperatures right now that's not
going to be an issue moving forward so
I'm only going to do a 120 percent on
the power target right now 90 C as a
temperature target means it won't start
throttling until 90 C and I mean like
hard core throttling it's still gonna be
some fluctuation because it's on air and
I'm not only doing a 100 mega Hertz
offset right now so that is putting us
at oh yeah that's I'm like those that
FPS seems awfully low it's 118 119 fps
there's only one graphics card running
right now huh yeah I forgot to actually
enable SLI derp while my lights are
dimming holy crap okay so that's 1911
beggars my softbox then you guys can't
really see it my softbox is right now
while this is going are like flickering
that's how much how are the things are
actually drawing Wow alright but as you
can see we're at 1918 hundred ninety
eight megahertz both of the FPS holy
hell man alright so I'm gonna try and
push these just a tiny bit farther let's
go ahead and do 130 offset I'm a bump up
the memory 250 not a lot I just want to
see if we're even like remotely stable
at all in heaven right now and then 1949
and no it's going to start to slow down
a little bit because the main card is at
65 66 67 68 and the fan is actually
running at like 75% right now we're just
hit 70 so yeah I mean it's these Titans
hope they do get toasty holy hell do
they get toasty all right here's what I
do I'm gonna go ahead and run a 3d mark
benchmark here in 4k and the ultra
almost actually you know what screw it
we'll do all three well dope it we're
doing live benchmarking here it's all
good let's go ahead and run um a regular
benchmark here regular fire strike fire
strike normal see if it even passes all
right it passed the first part of the
test let's see usually if I deal with a
crash of some sort and fire
it happens here like when the sparks and
supper coming up so let's see look at
FPS right here 200 200 FPS right here
that's insane 200 300 FPS what the
I never saw anywhere near these numbers
with three tight next Maxwell cards holy
 man
Wow and the fact that it's like not
crashing so far is amazing to me
holy hell alright we'll come back with
the score a graphic score of 53,000 46
53,000 46 what the hell man that is so
much faster than I ever got like to put
it into perspective all anything on the
screens I came here the exact number but
I'm pretty sure skunkworks is at like
46,000 graphics for with three
overclocked tight next maxwell cards on
water three graphics cards is being
stomped by two graphics cards that makes
me want to push the overclock it's a
tiny bit farther you know what yeah
we'll try it we'll try it
we're gonna go to 500 on the memory
there we go let's see it
let's see if this even works this is the
game for me like playing games on it's
fun but this this is my game
look at that math of 14 fpf though Fath
FPS rub fire there we go let's see we
get let's see is gonna crash mmm yet
well my goodness
ermahgerd 300 300 wait 300 % 200 I don't
believe this
this is fun alright I'll be I'll be back
we'll see if it passes fifty-four
thousand one hundred and ninety one
fifty four thousand oh no did we
throttle no well we bounced around a
little bit between nineteen fifty thread
there were in nineteen seventy-four 1961
Wow
most of that jumped us from the memory
okay work we're gonna leave right there
let's go ahead and do fib fifty four
thousand one hundred ninety one okay so
for studying servers what we're gonna do
we're going to turn on everything FXAA
is on ms a really get 2x vsync is off
I'm not going to turn on invidious TxAA
that's NVIDIA proprietary stuff but
anyway let's just see here directness
versions 11 advanced graphics save those
alright long shadows on high resolution
shadows on high detailed streaming while
flying on extended distance drawing all
the way out frames scaling mode don't
even know if that means I real I don't
know if that means we'll put it on the
max whatever that is and okay yeah cuz
that it's going to apply those changes
and I'm going to just run the benchmark
test on here see how that looks because
the benchmark on here is pretty good
about keeping it real when it comes to
the game engine holy
then this is 4k all settings maxed as
you saw look at the FPS how is this
possible I mean okay look look at this
4k all settings maxed I made 2x msaa but
still this is this is 4k you don't need
that much the benchmarks are going by so
fast because it's rendering the images
so quickly it's taking longer to load
the benchmark than the scene is taking
to play
all right that's just insane that's
crazy 120 Hertz 4k monitor here I come I
don't know maybe someday 187 FPS on the
pier 190 for a second there that's
that's just crazy yep this FPS in 4k is
nothing short of amazing we just ran
that guy over okay Wow
I I don't even want to try it in 1080
because it might break this it might
break the world the guy just killed him
over there
part of me feels like this might be an
irresponsible level of of graphics power
but I don't hear her at all so anyway
this video wasn't really about like
benchmarking the SLI Titan XPS
that's going to be happening once there
on water because that's what I care
about but I just kind of cared about
what some of the preliminary results
would be like before I really got to
optimize them get them on the water
blocks get them nice and cool and see
how far we can really push this thing
now like I said 3-way Titan X Maxwell
cards on water overclocked in skunkworks
was hitting 46,000 ish I'm gonna put it
on the screen I came here the exact
number it's in my spreadsheet but it so
it's just over 46,000
and to 1080 s was getting really close
to the score of skunk works when
overclocked on air founder's cards so I
knew that to Titan XPS was going to have
to be pretty damn fast I wasn't
expecting it to be 54,000 graphics core
that's just insane you guys saw I can
handle 4k no problem now once it once
skunkworks is done then I will do the
same benchmarks like I normally do with
all my graphics cards where I do all my
charts and stuff but this was just to
kind of like test and see how far the
cards could go initially make sure
everything's working okay make sure the
high bandwidth bridge is working okay
even though I'm going with an e EBG a19
in video 1 but I just wanted to kind of
see what some of the results were going
to be like and what to expect with just
two of them because part of me was
worried like man I'm gonna go with three
graphics cards I'm gonna go down to two
and that's just gonna be sucky um ya
know clearly I was very very very wrong
on just how powerful two of these are
gonna be I'm glad I'm doing it you know
I know I said I wasn't going to but I'm
glad I'm doing it cuz skunk worry you
guys I'm actually did this specifically
because you guys said I should when I
said that I was only going to go with
two or three 1080s I know you can so
light and he's actually yes you can you
can 3-way SLI them and believe it or not
it is working in games and I'm going to
do a video about that where although and
video was supposed to have locked that
out it is working in all the titles just
as if it were a 90
so anyway I'll do a video on that
because I do have lots of 1080s hang
around anyway time ago guys want to take
you on this little journey where I do
some preliminary overclocking and some
testing on the Pascal Titan cards to see
how they perform it oh my god oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
