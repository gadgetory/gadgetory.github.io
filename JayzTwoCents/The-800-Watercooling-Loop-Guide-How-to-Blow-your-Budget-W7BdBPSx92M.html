cents and you've been asking me all year
long to do a new how to completely water
cool a computer guide this is going to
be a complete tutorial on everything you
need to know to water cool your computer
and we're going to do it together so
let's get started
okay guys when it comes to water cooling
of your computer you are going to need
some basic parts you're going to need
fluid today we're using distilled water
you're going to need a radiator you're
going to need a reservoir to hold your
fluid you're going to need fans to cool
your radiator you're going to need
tubing to carry your fluid to your
different components you're going to
need a water cooling block for your CPU
and optionally you can include your
graphics card in your loop today we're
going to be doing that you're going to
need fittings to connect your components
together to a tubing this is a basic
barb fitting right here and we do also
have some premium compression and 45
degree angle fittings which we're going
to be using in this build and you're
also going to need a water cooling pump
you don't see the pump on the table
because we're reusing a pump that's
currently in the build for this build
but you're going to need a water cooling
pump to move all of your fluid and
lastly there's a couple of tools that
you're going to need you're going to
need that basic screwdriver that
multi-tool bit that I use optionally you
can just use a big and a small
screwdriver and you're going to need
something to cut the tubing I use an
actual tubing cutter for this you don't
have to get this tool if you don't want
to because you probably aren't going to
be doing this very often because I do
water cooling builds all the time it's
just a lot easier you could use a big
pair of scissors or you could use a
really sharp razor blade I prefer the
cutter because it makes a clean straight
cut and it makes it just a lot cleaner
in the end fluid is one of the things
that I'm asked most commonly about when
it comes to water cooling some people
tell me that they've heard distilled
waters bad they've heard distilled water
is the best they don't know whether or
not they should go with a nano fluid
should they put coloring in their fluid
here's the bottom line when it comes to
fluid number one distilled water is the
purest fluid that you can put inside of
your loop and it's going to have the
best reaction to your metals now you may
be using different kinds of metals in
your gloop you may have nickel copper
hopefully there's not aluminum most
water coolers don't really approve of
aluminum but distilled water is the
purest product that you can put in there
and it's not going to have any abnormal
effects with your water cooling loop now
for added safety you can put a kill coil
in there or it's just a it's a little
piece of silver that you can roll up and
stick inside your reservoir or something
I've
ever used one in the ten years I've been
water cooling and I've never had any
sort of a corrosion issue the bottom
line is if you keep your fluid clean
you're not going to have to worry about
corrosion issues now when it comes to
distilled water though you may have to
use this product in fact you need to use
this product here this particular
product is a Anti algae it's a this is
PT nuke just two or three drops per
gallon or per liter of this is all you
need to keep their from being any sort
of growth inside of your loop the last
thing you want is having a nice colony
of algae growing inside of your computer
now the other question I'm asked most
commonly about fluid is about non
conductive fluids and whether or not
they're worth the thirty to forty dollar
per liter price tag that they tend to
carry here's my answer on that non
conductive fluids are good if you're a
new builder and you're concerned about
leaks however the reality of
non-conductive fluid is over time if you
let them run in your system for a couple
of years they pick up ions from the
metals that they touch and they become
conductive over time so if you were to
have a leak two or three years in the
future because you didn't maintain your
system and you didn't do any sort of
flushing chances are you would still end
up doing damage on your components
because they became conductive because
they're touching metal all day long and
those metals do break down slightly
microscopically over time and they get
moved around inside the fluid and that's
what makes them conductive so personally
I would say just use distilled water and
Pt Nuuk you can use a nano fluid like I
am I'm using mayhem sunset yellow fluid
in my computer has nothing to do with
being anti corrosion or being non
conductive it just looked really cool
that's the third thing I want to talk
about when it comes to fluid is whether
or not color or dye is bad now the
yellow and my fluid is dye but what's
actually dyed in the fluid is the
nanoparticles themselves not the fluid
if you were to let that sit over time
they would actually separate and you
would see a separation of color when it
comes to the Nano fluid now the last
thing I want to talk about with fluid
people commonly asked me is whether or
not it's okay to have died inside of
your fluid first things first
I've seen people say I just put food
coloring inside of your water cooling
fluid and then it will work fine you
don't want to do that food coloring is
almost pure sugar and pure sugar over
time will turn to a gel it will gunk up
inside of your blood
 bad news trust me do not put do
not put food coloring in your loop under
any circumstance not to mention it is it
consider it is a product for consumption
which means bacteria also want to eat it
and it just it's very bad it actually
promotes growth inside of your loop when
it comes to organisms don't do it now
when it comes to fluids that already
have dye added to them they are the
correct formula of dye to not cause that
problem unfortunately though a lot of
dyes will gunk up again just like the
food coloring inside of the tiny
passages in the water blocks over time
which could start to reduce water flow
and sometimes it can build up in your
pump and cause damage to your pump
generally it's not a good idea but the
worst dye color for this period is red
for some reason red just likes to gunk
up the most not to mention it stains
everything and that's the last thing I
want to mention when it comes to do
dyeing fluid is you do end up dying your
parts over time acrylic over time will
absorb some of that and even if it looks
like it's clean if you add clear fluid
back to it after using say a red fluid
it's going to have a pinkish tint to
that you guys have been following me on
Twitter you know back a couple of months
ago I was going through hell trying to
clean the red dye out of my old system
it was so bad I ended up replacing the
entire system so just stay away from
dyes if you are at all concerned about
there being any sort of literally add I
now when it comes to fittings people ask
me all the time well what kind of
fittings do I need you only need a barb
fitting this is the bare minimum as a
barb fitting on some sort of a clamp you
can use an automotive hose clamp what
you screw down or you can go as ghetto
as zip ties I've used it ties in fact
the computer we're getting ready to
replace all the water cooling in for
this build is being held together with
zip ties it's been together for a year
and a half no problems whatsoever
usually a barb is more than enough
retention for a hose the zip ties aren't
for sealing or the clamps aren't for
sealing the clamps are for holding it on
there just in case for some reason it
wanted to pop off if you're having the
clamp something down to keep it from
leaking you do not have parts that fit
together properly that's the bottom line
now with Barb's being the bare minimum
you could go a little bit more premium
by using different types of compression
fittings and bends like this but keep in
mind and you could even come up with
some sort of a funky I mean look at this
says I don't even know what this is I
just put a bunch of bends together it
swivels and this is what I got if you
take a look at my 900 D build in order
to get the two radiators at the bottom
plumbed together properly and to get my
my pump routed down there I've had to
use quite a bit of these to get a really
weird contraption going and they can
make it very easy to put together tight
components rather than bending the tube
because tubing only bends so far before
it kinks you don't want that keep in
mind though fittings is one of the
fastest ways to send your budget for
your water cooling build all the way to
the sky because fittings can easily add
up to as much as the rest of the
components in your build you can have a
barb that costs four dollars or you can
have a bend an eye a 45 degree swivel
Bend with a compression fitting that
cost $14 a piece so keep that in mind
when buying your fittings now when
putting together your water cooling loop
clearly you have to have a way to get
the fluid to all of your components I've
got here some just a couple of pieces of
different tubing that I've used over the
past and one thing I want to point out
is that not all tubing is created equal
both of these tubes here are bar are
from primal chill they are the same
exact manufacturer they're advertises
the exact same specs the exact same line
of primal chill product same size same
everything but I would like to
demonstrate to you first is that they're
not always the same size well here's
what I mean by that I have here a piece
of half inch inner diameter 3/4 inch
outer diameter tubing for water cooling
loops this is one of the biggest tubing
that you can get by the way there's
different sizes people are going to ask
me do I need 1/2 inch 20 3/8 doesn't
matter anywhere from quarter inch all
the way up to 1/2 inch is going to
perform pretty much the same the only
thing that's going to change is the flow
rate of your your components doesn't
matter you can go with 3/8 to have a
cleaner tighter Bend loop
got half-inch like I have that way you
can say yeah I've got huge tubing inside
of my computer it's awesome you mad bro
so getting back to what I was talking
about being not equal this right here is
a three inch three-quarter inch outer
diameter half inch inner diameter
compression fitting with a little Bend
fitting on there this slides over it
exactly as intended so that when you put
your tube inside your fitting
you can then tighten down your
compression fitting and everything fits
just fine and though I don't recommend
using tools by the way to tighten this
down you just want to go hand tight
because it is squeezing on there and as
you can see now it took that much force
to pull this out okay that is a good
fitting if it wasn't tightened all the
way down like people think they have to
tighten it all the way down or it's
going to come out no like you go until
it can't turn anymore doesn't have to be
all the way down same exact line of
product same exact size advertised half
inch inner diameter three inch or three
quarter inch outer diameter but I want
you to notice the fitting it doesn't fit
why it does not fit literally does not
fit over this tube so this tubing if you
would purchase this tubing trying to put
together your loop you have been awfully
disappointed that it doesn't fit I don't
know if this was just a defective piece
of tube from primal chill but it's a lot
bigger than advertised so in order to
use this tubing you would have to go
with a barb and then use a clamp on it
there's nothing wrong with that it's
just there is variances in size I just
want to make you guys aware of that
unfortunately may be thinking to
yourself now well how do you know if
it's going to fit before you buy it
read the reviews honestly you will find
a lot of reviews on this and you will
you will see if a tubing is not at the
size it's advertised as and people are
going to complain like I did so keep
that in mind with tubing as I mentioned
you can go with any size tubing you want
just make sure that if you go
compression fittings you get the size
that matches your tubing and vice versa
make sure you get the
tubing that matches your compression
fitting people generally when they're
new to water cooling are a little bit
confused about how much radiator space
they really need
they don't know if they should go with a
120 millimeter a 240 a 360 or 480 like
in my case I have a 360 and of 480
that's 7 times 120 millimeters of
cooling it's entirely overkill rule of
thumb if you're using a radiator similar
to the Alpha cool here and I definitely
recommend the optical products not just
because they are a huge supporter of
Jays two cents but because alpha cool is
a very strong name in the water cooling
industry all of the major water cooling
builders you'll see at some point have
used and recommended alpha cool products
they are full brass are soothing I take
that back they are full copper radiators
and copper is the best product that you
can use the best metal you can use for
dissipating Heat one thing I want to
show you though is there's more to a
radiator than just the side the length
of the radiator or the size of the fan
that's going on there one of the most
important factors to a radiator is its
thickness and as you can see here this
is a 45 millimeter thick radiator and
this is pretty much alpha cools like
main flagship radiator here which is the
Nexus X T 45 45 millimeter thick
radiator you can get them as thin as 30
mils and you can get them as big as 80
mil which is nearly double this
thickness and it's called the monster
rat and it's literally a monster these
thicker the radiator the more static
pressure you're going to need to push
air through the radiator unless you have
a nice wide fin design like this one I
mean I can look right through the fins
here and I can see my cameraman standing
over there because we have a nice wide
fin design which gives us lower static
pressure needed to push the air through
there and because we have a thicker
radiator more cooling space means better
cooling so when you're shopping for a
radiator whatever brand it may be keep
in mind that thickness matters but don't
go too thick I wouldn't I wouldn't go
putting a 80 mil monster rad on a simple
CPU cooling
solution for something that's not even
overclocked we use the 45 millimeters
because I find that they are the best
middle ground when it comes to cooling
gives you more space more volume surface
area for cooling with enough fin spacing
this is only ten fins per inch so that
we don't have to use extremely high
pressure high speed fans that keeps us
having a nice quiet build so keep that
in mind when searching for your radiator
the last thing I want to mention before
we start putting this together regarding
radiators is if you're using a 45
millimeter thick red like this I
recommend that you have at least a 120
millimeter per component size so if you
are using just a CPU you could easily
use a 45 thick radiator like this with
only one 120 millimetres so half of this
having this be the size of your rat now
that would handle up to a mild overclock
the more you overclock and the more heat
you put in your system the more wattage
worth of heat you have to dissipate
which means you need more space so I
would recommend if you're overclocking
having at least a double 120 millimeter
like this for your CPU the more parts
you add the more cooling that you're
going to need now this particular
radiator build we are putting two
radiators in a triple and a dual because
we are dealing with an overclocked CPU
and an overclock graphics card in the
desert that gets extremely hot in the
summer so we are going with more than
that standard recommended 120 millimeter
per component or 240 per overclock
component because we're trying to make
up for the fact that ambient
temperatures for the space that this
computer is going to be in does get
pretty warm in the summer so where you
live matters as much as what you buy ok
so now that we've unboxed - all of our
parts there's a couple of things that we
need to do to get ready to do our build
you have to prep your system so take out
all of your parts get them all nice and
laid out in the table get a nice open
workspace because water cooling
definitely requires a lot of space when
putting the items together because you
have almost 100% guaranteed to be
pulling off some sort of a stock cooler
or maybe an aftermarket cooler your
going to have to get your your
processor ready to go and with that
you're going to have to use at least 75%
or higher isopropyl isopropyl isopropyl
alcohol so yeah it's basically rubbing
alcohol this is 91% put it on a lip
gloss toilet papers fine even for that
and wipe it down nice and good and then
just to make sure you don't have any
fibers left on there use some canned air
if you have it to blow it out or
microfiber cloth that won't leave
anything behind now here are the parts
that we're going to be using for this
build as I mentioned we are going with a
water-cooled gtx 680 in this build this
was already you know applied so this
video is not going to include that but
the same process to installing your
block applies to this this is an
optional feature that is a little more
advanced the reservoir the pump right
here the first thing you want to do is
now have your parts laid out is you want
to start planning your water cooling
build now one of the most difficult
things people have when it comes to
planning the routing of their tubing is
where to place the pump how to mount the
pump and where to place the reservoir as
you can see this is a pretty big
reservoir but what we're doing here is
if you take a look at the pump this is
an alpha cool D 5 pump so it has this
aftermarket block on there we have
multiple options on this block on where
we can put various fittings and if you
look here you can see that I have a
fitting installed on here that is a male
to male so basically be used to connect
two pieces together and I'm going to be
using this outlet on the bottom
technically it's the top we're going to
be using the bottom here and screwing
that on to the top of our pump making
these become basically one component so
we now have a pump reservoir combo
that'll be a lot easier for us to mount
so since I know that that's the way that
I'm going to be doing the pump and
reservoir I can now consciously plan the
routing of my tubing now the tubing that
we're using here we are reusing the
tubing from this build because it has
it's more than enough tubing and were
the goal of this build is to reduce the
amount of tubing that we have for a nice
clean look now when it comes to planning
the component order
a very common question that people have
is what order do the parts you need to
go in if you have a graphics card does
it have to go to the CPU then the
graphics card or a common myth that I
hear is well if you put your graphics
card before your CPU you're going to be
putting hot water to your CPU which
means you're not going to cool as well
guys here's the way that water cooling
works the entire system whether it be
after all of the parts that are going to
be generating heat your CPU your
graphics card maybe your motherboard if
it's included in your loop or if you
measure temperature after the radiators
which is theoretically where the
temperature would be the coolest you're
going to find you may only have a one to
two degrees Celsius difference between
the hottest point of your loop and the
coolest point of your loop because this
isn't like a car where you're dealing
with extreme temperatures where you can
see easily a 50 degree Celsius
difference or 50 degree fahrenheit
difference in a car between inlet and
outlet on radiator the entire system is
going to want to equalize when it comes
to temperatures so as a whole the
radiators will keep the average
temperature or the all of the fluid in
your system at one steady temperature
how low that temperature gets depends on
how much radiator space you have now so
with that because of that debunking that
myth letting you know right now the only
order that matters is that you have your
pump your reservoir directly feeding
your pump now if your reservoir wasn't
going to be attached to your pump like
this let's say they had to be in two
separate locations your reservoir outlet
needs to be feeding the inlet of your
pump either in this case the front or
the top whichever the inlet is and the
reservoir needs to be higher than the
pump that way when you're filling the
system gravity will take over and it
will push the fluid into the pump the
fastest way to murder your pump is to
run it dry and a lot of people when
they're filling their system they'll
just turn it on and then the fluid
starts to come down and then it stops
and they'll just leave the pump running
if the fluids not moving there's air in
the pump and that is the fastest way to
kill it the fluid is actually what
lubricates the pump and if you run it
dry and you start to hear that area
sound stop you're killing your pump
is you I can't even stress that enough
so that's the only thing that's
important reservoir feeds the pump
reservoir be higher than the pump and as
you can see here clearly the reservoir
is higher than the pump and I think this
is kind of a neat looking combo here
which more people did this where you
take a reservoir a tube reservoir and
you feed it inside of a directly to a
pump and this is a swivel fitting so as
you can see here there's a little bit of
play in it not much just a little bit
but once we get the fitting on the top
with the hose feeding into it it's going
to be nice and secure and it's not going
anywhere so now that you've got your
routing planned and you have a rough
idea of where you want to put your parts
the next thing I would do is I would get
your radiators and some of your other
components ready to go I would take your
compression fittings or your Bend
fittings or your barbs whatever you've
got and I would put them on each of your
components and then I would mount the
fans to your radiators now when it comes
to mounting the fans to the radiator
another common question people ask is
well should I go push configuration
which is let's say you have your
radiator on the top of the case like
that
should you have your fan pushing as I
almost throw the radiator everywhere
should you have the fans pushing air
through the radiator or should you have
the fans pulling air through the
radiator or should you go push-pull
which means you have a fan feeding the
bottom and the fan on the top pulling
the air out when it comes to radiator
optimized fans which these fans are and
hire static pressure push-pull becomes a
little less important not to mention it
takes up a lot of space when you have
that much thickness of a fan on the top
and the bottom I personally prefer push
because you have an unobstructed source
of air pushing into the fan and pushing
the air out of the radiator but that
doesn't mean that pool is going to be
any less optimized typically you'll see
that there's a couple of degrees
difference at most one or two degrees
difference between pull or push I
honestly feel that you should go with
with whatever is easiest to install in
your case I personally don't even run
push pool because I run high static
pressure fans which makes things a lot
more simple okay so as you can see here
we've started to do some of our routing
I've got the lower contraption built
here on what I'm doing with this compute
or what I mean by lower contraption is
because we're limited on space in this
case believe it or not is a full tower
case we're slightly limited on space
I've got the pump the reservoir and the
radiator all mounted together using you
know alpha cools mounting bracket for
the pump an alpha cool d5 pump and the
res connected with the this fitting here
which I showed earlier which is a double
male fitting or just has threads on both
sides so I connected those together
together I mean I connect those together
to make one unit now I've already
started figuring out how I'm going to
route this and the routing order I have
for this is reservoir into pump pump
into the bottom radiator out of the
bottom radiator into the GPU out of the
Jeep GPU we're going to go into the
socket CPU or the socket block then
we're going to go up into the upper rad
and then out of that radiator into the
top of the reservoir here I might change
that order slightly where I may put this
radiator between the block and the CPU
so it goes from here out into the CPU
the upper radiator and then into the CPU
and out into the rest that order doesn't
really matter it's just going to be
whichever looks clean and this is why
you start to test fit some of your parts
before you start cutting your tubing
you'll notice the only tube I have cut
is this little one right here that
connects the pump in the radiator
because that only had one way to go so
you you want to be very diligent in the
way that you plan your routing that way
you only cut your tube once you measure
twice cut once that's how it works with
anything that you cut metal wood or
tubing for your water cooling system
here so what we're going to do now is
we're going to take our CPU block and
we're going to install this that way we
can figure out exactly how we want to
route this tubing and see how it fits
and the installation of the CPU block is
going to be the same as any fan control
of any custom fan or aftermarket fan
that you've installed only difference is
you're going to have Springs and a
little bit longer retaining screws so
the installation is going to depend
entirely on your block so you're going
to need to look at your instructions and
figure out what the assembly is on for
that is for your particular block so
let's
put that in will get the upper radiator
in and then we'll come back and take a
look at what our final plans are with
tubing well tube it up fill it up and
then we'll get going
okay we're back now and what we've done
is we've added all of our fittings to
all of our different components here our
graphics card our lower radiator our
reservoir our CPU block and our upper
radiator you can see we have the upper
radiator installed and this is how we've
I've decided that I'm going to go ahead
and route this tubing we go from
reservoir into pump pump into the lower
rate radiator lower radiator out to the
graphics card graphics card out to the
upper radiator upper radiator into the
CPU out of the CPU into the reservoir so
what that allows us to do is have nearly
straight pieces of tubing between each
component so we don't have any crazy
bends or anything also what I've opted
to do in this build is to give the the
client plenty of options for filling and
draining his system one thing that a lot
of people tend to leave out of their
systems that they don't think far enough
in advance about is how they're going to
get the coolant out in a situation that
they have to drain their system so what
we've done here if you look down on the
bottom is I've got this ninety degree
swivel here with a little extension
piece and a plug when it's time to drain
this if you lay this system on its back
all of the air goes to the highest point
in the system which at that point would
become this system so all the air
because there's going to be air in the
system no matter what there'll be some
air in the reservoir it will travel
through the system and it will settle
here on the top which will allow him to
undo this plug he can then install a
barb or a compression fitting a barb
works fine he could take a piece of
tubing screw it into there and if he
actually does like I do I have a plug
that I don't know where it said I should
have a just a brass fitting that goes in
here and it plugs this tube off so he
can screw that on there set it back up
and now we'll have the fluid start to
capture down here because it's the
lowest point of the loop and up here on
the top we actually have a drain port
take that back not drain port a bleed
port so once you open up this plug on
the very top of the upper radiator air
can enter the system and allow
everything to drain out there will be a
little bit of residual left down
but because of the way that the the
Alpha cool radiators have a tapered
Inlet and outlet by simply tilting the
case like this I'll be able to get all
of the fluid out of the case pretty
effortlessly so this is a bit of an
advanced build here when it comes to the
water cooling but just keep that in mind
you are going to want a way to be able
to fill and drain your system because
maintenance is part of water cooling so
we're going to do next we're going to go
ahead and tube up these particular
pieces of components here so you can see
how the tubing routes and then the only
thing left to do after that is fill it
up and test it out okay we're back and
we've got the tubing all installed here
and we've got a fill tube here if you're
wondering why this is hanging out we'll
get back to that in a minute we did this
build with this minimal tubing as
possible I decided to put the radiator
in between these two because if we
hadn't we would have had lions cross
which just aesthetically doesn't really
please a lot of people and the person
who owns this computer wanted to be as
clean and as streamlined as possible and
as you can see all the tubing seems to
kind of generally go in the same
direction and since this is NZXT and the
case is curved like that the case window
it actually looks really really good you
can see how all of our fittings and all
the elbows were pre-planned and that
goes back to the beginning of the video
where I said you have to have a general
idea of how you want to route your
tubing and where things are going to fit
as you can see based on where the pump
mounts we this fit perfectly it was
almost more luck than anything else but
it fit perfectly right in between the
drive cages and the graphics card and
that's because of the alpha coil
mounting plate for this alpha cool pump
which gave us a lot of different
mounting options which you know this is
what happens to when you go with a lot
of matched parts rather than kind of
picking from one brand and another it
mix matching you get good compatibility
like this so what's next to do now is to
leak test or fill and leak test this
system and for leak testing you want to
take a roll of paper towels break off a
bunch of plies of this paper towel and
you want to set them around each one of
your fittings so because we have
graphics card right here we'll put one
down here on top of the power supply in
case anything drips from there it'll
come down on to there we want to also
get some here on top of the graphics
card in case we get something that drips
out of our CPU block and you want to get
all of your fittings basically
surrounded with a paper towel that way
you can monitor if they start to get wet
it becomes obvious when a paper towel is
wet ok so now that we've got everything
together we've got our jumper set for
our power supply and we can power on the
system we need to start filling up our
system and because we have a tubular
reservoir here and by tubular I don't
mean cool I mean that it's a cylindrical
shape it's going to make things a bit
easier for our filling and bleeding
because we have a lot more supply going
into the pump if you have a smaller
reservoir this process may take a lot
longer and because we have multiple
ports on the top of this reservoir it
means that we are able to have our
system fully set up and still have a
separate independent fill port like this
so just slowly start filling your system
if I can get my chair and hooked from me
using just simply distilled water and if
you have multiple ports like this it's
easier if you undo a bleed port I have a
bleed pour over here on top of the
radiator and I wouldn't do not turn the
pump on with the bleed port off please
under any circumstances because you will
end up with a geyser inside the middle
of your room I know because I've done it
so just slowly start to fill and the
moment you start to put fluid inside of
your system you want to check for leaks
because if there's leaks in the lower
part it's going to become apparent
immediately
and you're going to notice it's very
thirsty especially with a setup like
this with a lower radiator we won't even
see this level start to rise until we
get the entire lower radiator filled up
and down she goes okay so as you can see
now and it may be a little bit difficult
on camera because it's a clear fluid we
have now gotten to the point to where
our lower system is entirely filled and
we're starting to fill up inside the
reservoir what you want to do now before
you bleed the pump is you or you prime
the pump you want to fill this reservoir
as far as you can now if you're not
using a bleed port on the very top like
I have here if you've unscrewed one of
the ports on your cylindrical rez this
is the time where you need to be careful
because if you overfill and you reach
the top of this it's going to pour out
the top so be very careful where you
stop and you need to account for the
fluid that's still sitting inside the
tube because as you can see it's slowly
pouring back in there now is the time
when I want to fill my or plug my upper
bleed port off and probably remove one
of the ports here on my tubular
reservoir okay so we've filled the
reservoir now as far up as we can safely
go so which means the bottom part of our
loop here is entirely filled now with
distilled water so this is the part
where you want to turn on the pump for
only a second or two at a time until
this level reaches the very bottom of
the reservoir and then you're just going
to repeat the process so now it's safe
to plug your pump back up to your power
cable and when we flip on that switch
the pumps going to turn on and it's
going to pull the water level down
okay so the level started to get kind of
low so now is one I want to fill it up
and then just do it again and you're
going to repeat that process until the
system is entirely filled one thing I'd
like to point out if you do have a
variable-speed pump like I do in this
system put the pump on its lowest
setting it's going to make it so that
it's a lot less turbulent that bubbles
will actually move a bit easier and once
the system is fully primed then you can
start turning the speed up and down to
help move the air bubbles out of the
system but when doing your initial
filling it's very important that you put
the pump on the lowest setting
okay now we started to get actual flow
of water this is the first time that
we've started to get water flowing back
out of the reservoir or into the
reservoir but as you can see the flow
does not fill the tube so that tells us
that we have you know obviously a lot of
air inside of our system so now at this
point
fill the water level up above the tube
and then we'll start playing with the
speed of the pump okay so now that we've
got the system pretty much primed the
next thing we want to do before we start
running any components in here when it
comes to CPU motherboard or graphics
card is we want to get all of the air
out of there and the whole time we're
doing this we're keeping an eye on our
paper towels and we're doing some actual
touching to see if we have any leaks
anywhere and so far looks like we're
doing pretty good we don't have any
leaks showing up anywhere on our paper
towels so now we can take our
screwdriver and we can start playing
with the speed of the pump now you'll
notice as I sped that pump up just for a
second look how much more water fluid or
how much more we actually move the water
level if we turn it up a little more you
can see we are actually pulling the
water level down and now the pump is
that absolute maximum speed it's okay to
run the pump at max speed when you're
filling it because it promotes the
movement of the air bubbles and such as
long as the water level doesn't drop
down to the pump itself this remains
having some water in the reservoir
you're good to go to leave it running
like this so now we're going to fill it
up again and at that point we'll show
you how to start moving some of those
air bubbles out of the system you want
to start tilting the case in different
directions now if you have a tubular
reservoir like this and you still have
the port on the top open or this tube
coming out the top don't tilt it too far
you're going to leak all over the place
just a few inches in either direction
can promote the movement of air in this
system
as you can see we got some air moving
out right there by simply tilting it
this way now if we tilt it forward a
little bit as you can see we got a
little more air moving out there and
this is a process that can take anywhere
from a half hour there's a whole bunch
more air to a couple of hours depending
on how complicated your loop is because
we have the reservoir in the middle of
two radiators to take a little longer to
believe this system normally if the
reservoir is at the very top of the loop
it'll bleed very fast because air
naturally wants to go to the highest
point in the in a loop and that would be
the radiator or the reservoir and if you
take off the top plug the air just goes
right out into the atmosphere one thing
you can do to to also help promote the
movement of the air is to cycle the
power supply on and off you can also do
what I was doing earlier which is speed
up the pump and slow it down speed it up
and slow it down and all of that is
going to make a huge difference now your
pump may start maybe making like a kind
of a gurgling sound that's very normal
because the pump is the highest port
because the pump is the highest portion
of turbulence inside the loop air gets
trapped in there and will start going
around and around and around with the
impeller and it will get stuck but over
time it will start to quiet down in fact
since I started saying that sentence
it's already quite a down by at least
50%
now when you turn off the system and you
turn it back on you may hear the bubbles
again okay and we're done with our build
here it is completely finished
as you can see we have a nice
streamlined look here to the to the loop
it's not crisscross e doesn't look like
intestines and it doesn't look like the
Los Angeles freeway we have a nice
smooth flow between our reservoir or
pump our radiator up through a graphics
card through the top radiator back to
the CPU and out of the reservoir again
because of this we have a very open
space inside the case so it doesn't look
overly crammed and cluttered so when
you're building your water cooling
system it's really important to make
sure that you plan out ahead of time
where you want your components to go
putting them together is not difficult
the most difficult part of the entire
process of water cooling is just
planning out what you want to do so guys
