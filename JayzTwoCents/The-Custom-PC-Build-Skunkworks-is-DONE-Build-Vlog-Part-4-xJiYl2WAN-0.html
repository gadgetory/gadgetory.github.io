there's been three videos put up so I'm
going to assume we're on four things are
starting off a little bit weird there
was a fly buzzing around in here and I'm
swat net and I'm practically knocking
everything off the shelves and I'm
trying to get it and like a screw it
I'll start the video and I start to
record and then in the computer over
there I hear near the flight flew into
the CPU fan so I guess that just kind of
sort of worked itself out all right guys
day four project redness today I'm going
to try and get the acrylic tubing done
and I'm going to try get the pumps
installed down the bottom and get that
all plumbed up and ready to go it's not
a whole lot left to do the last thing I
may be pulling out of the 900 E is my
power supply and getting that in here
but that will be on the very last day
because of the fact that that system is
still running in fact that is how I've
been doing the builds for you guys or
the videos for you guys on this so one
other thing to note my GTO mega racing
chair came as you can see right there we
doing a review on this bad boy it's
pretty much a racing seat turned into a
chair so that's kind of cool but anyway
I'm gonna go get on my hard line tubing
stuff and then we're gonna where to
start getting that ready to go and I'll
show you guys how the tubing is gonna
look affect I think you're really gonna
like it so I'm listening to some Last
Comic Standing while I'm doing this and
Roseanne Barr is a judge uh I thought
this was Comic Standing anyway so here's
my piece of acrylic tubing right here
and I've already cut it I wanted to go
over the tools real quick and these
actually belong to the owner of red mist
he's letting me use these for my build
and I'm going to give him back his tools
but it's a monsoon kit this is just a
standard hacksaw comes with a couple
blades it's got the little thing here
that you stick the acrylic tubing in
there you can use that to make solid
cuts across like that and this is a
reamer I guess you could say it's sort
of like a deburr it does outside and
inside so you put it on the outside
like that to do the outside put that on
the inside to deburr the inside this is
a piece of silicone tube that goes
inside for when you do your bends you
have to put something in there when you
bend it otherwise it will crush and then
that's like oh yeah there's a heat gun
you need to heat all this but that's in
the other room so these are the tools
you use when you're working with acrylic
and here's the heat gun just a basic
Wagner heat gun so this Bend that I'm
doing right now is we pretty simple it's
gonna be going from the CPU down to this
fitting right here it's just a simple 90
degree Bend the one that's gonna
actually be hard is a to get perfect
it's going to be that one to the
radiator so that'll be kind of rough but
we'll get it we'll get this done I think
that's we're going to do tonight
all right so we got the CPU return line
done there it is right there running
parallel with the GPU loops and this is
all that's going to be visible right
there for the CPU line except for what
goes up there stuff to make these two
tubes started test-fitting the reservoir
tubes so as you can see the reservoirs
are going to only have these two tubes
and that's it that's all you're going to
see in there we already loop it's gonna
be very open very minimalist hope it's
going to look good once we have fluid in
it all right so there's what it looks
like with the reservoir installed and
both of the acrylic tubes and the
revolver fittings I just need to get the
other two in before I can do the other
one but the tubes are already cut they
are right here ready to go some of the
fittings there now I just got to do the
two here for the graphics cards and then
well so to bend that you guys can
probably tell by now I've been holding
off on bending that one I'm not looking
forward to bending that but whatever
let's just keep going all right we got
the bend finally out of the way the one
I was dreading the most and I was
dreading it for good reason because
these that you see down here were failed
attempts at making that Bend it's not
easy to make it really tight 90-degree
angles so close together remember not
only that's come out of here but it has
to perfectly line up both distance and
depth with that fitting and and that
fitting so it's not easy but the work
was definitely well worth that I
actually spent probably an hour and a
half
getting that been taken care of so there
we go I it's really starting to look
nice and clean normally I like a lot of
tubing to show in my builds but as you
can see I am going the minimalist route
on this one all right there we go all
the hard line tubing is done and now you
can see the way that this was routed how
there's no tubes going sideways
well except for that little bit right
there it's all up and down so I think
this looks really good you can see the
fittings through there I'm very happy
with the way this turned out this is my
first time kind of going with a minimal
tubing
so as you can see I'm still waiting on
those two fittings so I am done for the
night we'll go and pick this video up
tomorrow with getting the pumps and
stuff down the bottom and I hope you
guys are enjoying I'm gonna go to bed
but you guys will see the next part here
in just a couple of seconds through the
magic of editing all right it's the next
day I don't even know how many days I've
been doing this thing now I'm kind of
sick of this build I'm kind of sick of
vlogging it I just want to be done so
today I'm finally gonna try to get the
lower pumps installed I wouldn't picked
up a couple of three gallons of
distilled water that way I can flush out
the rate of the new radiator and I can
leak tests and all that stuff and you
got I got to thinking about how
fortunate I am that I can just go to the
store and pick up distilled water
because I know a lot of you guys where
you live you can't do that you have to
actually get distilled water shipped
into you which I guess is just
mind-boggling to me I don't understand
that just goes to show how different
things are all around the world so I
definitely know how good I've got it
here so yeah I don't even know what I'm
gonna do next and I'm still waiting on
those stupid fittings and that's just
really holding me up I'm not going to
take the power supply out of there until
I'm ready at the very last minute that
you can see that computer still on have
been rendering videos on that setup
while it's in its temporary format oh
yeah let's go ahead and get the lower
pumps installed get the soft tubing done
down there because I can finish all that
without those fittings and that's
nothing hold me up there and I think I
can get at least one of the loops filled
and bled tonight so that's our goal
you get one loop fat filled and bled and
ready to go okay so the next I'm gonna
do is I'm going to get my pumps ready to
go here for the drain system these are
just some fittings I'm using for that
Junction block here Aquitania it's an
alpha cool we're bauble fittings and
then these are pretty much just fill
ports and I'm going to be using as drain
ports they're getting drilled in
anything they're pretty much just going
to rest at the bottom of the case with
the slack of tubing on there coming off
of these tee blocks that way I can just
route them outside the case and drain
when I need to drain so nothing entirely
too extravagant but these are the
fittings of them be using for that and
you'll see the way this is all going to
work
once they're all together alright so the
CPU loop is done as you can see here
like I said it feeds down into the pump
this goes out from that Junction block
that I showed you earlier all the way up
to the top and then I still have to do
the actual fitting on here that goes to
the bleed but that's how it's going to
bleed right there and then there is all
of the other tubing so now I have to do
the GPU loop and then we'll be all
plumbed up and ready to go all right
there we go guys it is 100% plumbed up
we've got two pumps here obviously this
is the pump for the graphics card and
this is the pump for the CPU and there's
quite a bit going on down here I mean
this is a bit of an extreme oh I
wouldn't say extreme but this is a bit
of an advanced cooling loop down here
I've got so much going on this is
probably quite confusing if you guys
figure it out but just know that it all
works now you guys are always asking me
about J how do you drain your loops well
I've got as I mentioned earlier this tee
block right there which you can see both
of these pumps have coming off of the
outlet this adds a little bit of
restriction because it's got to make a
sharp 90 but these pumps are very very
powerful these D playing d5 pumps are
absolutely behemoths when it comes to
power fact I keep them pretty much set
to speed too at all times so when it
comes to draining I've got coming off of
the T block these two tubes right here
that I can pretty much just yank out of
the case and then these are just pretty
much fill ports that I'm going to use as
you know you just unthread that and it
all come right out so we've got
independent ones for each each loop
there and I just keep these out of the
way guy up there and actually like this
that guy nope okay member how I did my
own loop you areö that guy goes up
there man damn it there we go so I've
got this one that just kind of
back there and then this one is just
resting right there so those are out of
the way and not bothering anybody when
they're not being used so there's the
lower loop loops I should say yeah not
too complicated it's just it's got a lot
going on down there
now we just take a look at the mess here
to get all this done I mean I've got a
box of fittings right here that I
already have some of these guys I've got
an empty box of fittings they're falling
out everywhere I've got more fittings on
the floor down there ever being used
I've got you know leftover tubing and
stuff down there so yeah I mean the
amount of fittings are in this thing are
pretty insane I've got 22 of the rigid
compression fittings for the acrylic
loop I've got probably another 20 or 25
thinnings total between the soft tubing
compressions and the elbows and the
blogs and the yes I've got at least 45
fittings in this thing and we're talking
several hundred dollars with the
fittings that's actually kind of
depressing alright so a lot of you guys
have asked what coolant I'm going to be
going with and I am using the mayhem
it's pastel sunset yellow concentrate
right here I have two bottles it for two
litres I actually have a third bottle on
the way
two liters actually is not enough I
brain farted when I ordered these so
when I ordered the fittings that I'm was
short I also ordered another bottle this
so I have total of 3 litres it just
mixes two distilled water here which I
mentioned earlier you know I can just go
to the store and pick up distilled water
because I'm really fortunate so I'm
gonna go ahead and mix this up and then
we are going to go ahead and fill the
GPU loop tonight that way I feel like I
actually got some but none okay so I've
got this ready to go I've got my
distilled water here with exactly one
and a half litres of water give the rest
to my dog because this actually is
better than drinking water I have three
gallons of this I've got more than
enough now why a litre and a half
well that's because this is 250
milliliters that concentrates out to one
liter so 750 milliliters or
three-quarters of a liter times two one
and a half litres so two bottles of this
makes up the
one half of a liter so they're going to
pour this in and you guys will see the
color that we're going with on this make
sure you shake this up really really
good too so yeah you got to shake it
alright there it is just to put it into
perspective this is the new fluid the
nice pest Mayhem's pastel and this is my
old fluid here this is some of the
dragon ice that was mixed with orange
and yellow and yeah I did a really bad
mixed job on this believe it or not so
that's the old fluid we're getting rid
of that bad boy as you can see the new
color actually goes really really good
with this build I think this is gonna
look hot or like really bright orange
juice
button take too long the GPU loop is
filled it's now bleeding you can see
right there there's still a little air
and that tube see right there it takes a
while for all this to bleed so I'm going
to leave this running for a while
starting stopping it a little bit and
the way I'm powering the pump is I've
just got my jumper right there which you
can hopefully see there it's just a CPU
jumper on my test rig and I've got my
molex power running to that one over to
the pump down there so now you can kind
of see which one was the GPU loop and
which one was a CPU loop so you can get
get an idea of how it's retro dude there
for the GPU and obviously all the other
stuff is going to be the CPU so these
fittings might arrive tomorrow I hope
they do if they do then we're going to
be done pretty soon but that's pretty
much all we wrote for tonight guys I am
going to go ahead and hit the hay yeah
I'm getting kind of tired these types of
bills take a lot out of you I have a bad
sciatic nerve in my back so these bit
these builds take a lot out of me that's
why I've got a lot less energy now the
one I'm started so I'm gonna go ahead
and go and take a break kind of chill a
little bit let my back rest and we will
see you guys tomorrow hopefully
hey guys blog time yep we're gonna be
working on the computer tonight this is
like vlog ception we're actually
preparing for Tech Talk being hosted on
Jerry's Channel and for that I can't
actually hear you because I'm wearing
headphones see I'm wearing headphones so
anyway yeah we're setting up for that
look what arrived today oh I don't want
my pad my address look whatever look
what I did is my address
yeah like the package we needed to
finish up that guy came today so after
I'm done dealing with that guy in tech
dog like that that is like a weird it's
like a weird vlog ception thing going on
does the webcam showing me holding the
camera showing the webcam showing me
hold the camera yeah so Jerry says I
came with your vlogging with a giant SLR
you should see where I'm doing it like
this I'm like hi
huh yeah anyway I can't wait to finish
this bill tonight and since I'm off
tomorrow because I get to go talk to
some high school and college kids at the
University I get to stay up all night
playing with the new computer so since
you made it into a build blog you guys
will go ahead and wait by the you guys
are on TV I think so yeah uh this is
kind of weird now because I'm actually
recording this which is going to be
ending up in part 4 I think run part 4
whatever on that guy yeah oh yeah what's
funny is this all gonna be a minute
later so let's see what were the most
recent comments here why is there
pop-ups in my screen less porn less porn
that's my advice there we go guys cuz
you got the baggage from frozen CTU
after the post office lost it for a
little while so another bottle of the
coolant which I said I wanted so now
I've got three and these two little guys
you believe these two little guys are
what we were waiting on to finish this
piece of crap alright let's go and talk
about this sli bridge for a minute I put
this rigid one on there because and even
though it's a triple slot it still works
for SLI because it's rigid it gives it
more stability and structural integrity
when it comes to the to the cards but
you guys feel it's ugly I agree it's
kind of ugly and a lot of you guys have
said to use EVGA Pro bridge and I'm not
the SLI Pro bridge I'm not a huge fan of
it but EVGA actually contacted me today
and said hey we know you don't like the
way our Pro bridge looks but it comes
apart really easy you can actually
modify it if you want to paint it
customize it so there overnighting me
one it's gonna be here tomorrow and be
modding it to put something cool in
there that'll match now one of the
things that was pointed out my last
video one of my followers said hey you
got this thing in slot 1 and slot 4
apparently there's an issue where slot 1
will only go in a txt lot for we're
going 16x I immediately contacted EVGA
and said hey what's the deal is that
true they said yes it's true slot 1 has
a direct path to the CPU slot 4 goes to
the plx bridge and I said well what
should i do should I drain my loop and
should I move
slot one down to slot two or what he
said in his opinion that he would leave
it just like this because slot four is
going through the plx bridge anyway and
that they actually ran specific tests
with this configuration to see what the
performance loss was and they said that
it was negligible meaning it was in the
margin of error and that they saw no
performance gain going from slot one to
slot two so it's 16 X + 16 X versus 8 X
CPU 16 X px so we're just going to leave
it like this
alright so we going to get these two
guys installed right there get the
reservoir on there and then we can we
can fill up the CPU loop to do some leak
testing and filming on that then I've
got to do all the front panel
connections the PCI Express cables and
get the power supply and everything
installed but we're actually getting
pretty close to the end and I'm excited
because I'm ready to start playing some
games again all right there we go both
loops are full both of the pumps are at
full speed right now what I think is
funny is that the GPU loop apparently
has a lot more restriction in it than
the CPU loop because you can see a lot
more churning in there than in there
which is funny because we're in a
parallel config so as you can see the
CPU loop clearly has a lot less
resistance in it than the GPU because of
the way that's bubbling up both these
pumps are on the exact same speed right
now so I'm bleeding out the CPU loop
right now and I'll let this go for a
little bit and then we're going to start
wiring it up get the hard drives
installed and I'm thinking we're going
to get a first boot tonight and when all
this is said and done and put together
I'm probably going to end up wiping the
operating system and starting all from
scratch fresh fresh installation but I
think this is turning out pretty damn
nice if you ask me what I think is cool
is the way you can see the reservoirs
through the front fan grille and do the
fans so that's pretty neat looking ooh
glamour shots the amber is okay
something else I seem to get asked a lot
even though I covered it with redness is
how do the hard drives mount well here
is a hard drive cage it's got these
rubber grommets with screws that go
through and mount on there just like
that just like pretty much any other
hard drive cage and then it actually
mounts on the back right there
horizontally and there's the SS 3d cage
which had the cables going through it
now and that one
so they mount on the backside of the
motherboard and given how much room
thinner is back here that's pretty much
the most appropriate place place for it
because then you have all the air flow
without being obstructed by the hard
drives that's one of the major case
manufacturing design flaws that you can
see right here at the 900 E and just
about every other case is they put the
hard drives in the front and block all
of the airflow it just doesn't make any
sense
so I really do like this design a whole
lot better this is actually the part I
hate the most absolutely hate wiring it
up I don't spend a lot of time trying to
make this all super pretty because it
doesn't show anyway anyway you can see
all the loot row customs extension
cables I've got my fan headers one up
there this one up here is actually going
to be controlled by this splitter thing
I made right here with some of the
cables that they gave me and this is
coming off the CPU fan hitters this is
the one right here that's controlling
all the front fans the bottom fans are
also being controlled by this guy right
here that's also running up to the CPU -
fan header and it's going all the way
down into there so it's going to be
controlling the bottom rads and then
this one here I don't know we're gonna
plug this one in yet but anyway that's
the rear exhaust fan but a lot of you
guys may be wondering how can you run so
many fans off one hitter well CPU
headers actually hooked directly up to
the PWM circuit so they can handle a
higher wattage load sometimes 30 watts
or more these fans are very low wattage
a very low amperage so there's not gonna
be any problems to the controlling the
fan speeds using those so we're getting
there slowly but surely but man do I
hate the wiring part it's pretty ugly
from this angle but from the front it
looks fantastic alright so uh why is it
half torn apart and there's cables
hanging out of it well I went to boot it
up and then the PC would go click click
and click click is usually bad thing
that usually means there's a current
protection usually that's happen to have
a short wire or you don't have the CPU
power plugged in something funky like
that so it was also doing something
weird with I click the CMOS button three
times it would power on and then it
would power off and then pushing the
power button would do nothing so I got
on the horn with EVGA
midnight that's I guess this what
happens when you have numbers and stuff
and they're awake
so I call them and they say yeah you
know what power supply using I said I'm
using the B 1200 they're like yeah we
notice that we had some issues with that
power supply something to do with
overcurrent protection in the PSU and
timings have an issue with the
motherboard and so it was potentially a
problem with the power supply while I
pulled my supernovae out of my test rig
and it works fine so I'm kind of sad I
don't get to use the 1200 watt PSU
because it would have meant more
efficient you know keeping it down in
the efficiency curve a little better but
thousand watts is more than enough and
now that I have well an EVGA motherboard
and EVGA graphics cards might as well go
with the he BGA power supply so now I
get to put it all back together and the
sad part is I drained the GPU loop
thinking the GPU was shorting against
that little plate that that wasn't I
wasn't it at all all right let's put it
back together it's only 12:30 so early
well guys it's done it was a labor of
love there were some snags along the way
but skunkworks is done let's take a look
now this wasn't without its fair share
of snags one thing we discovered late
last night actually called Jacob with EB
GA emailed him at 12:30 in the morning
he responded I said hey can I call you
he said sure so we called and got a
couple of snags along the way one my
court Corsair my coolermaster v 1200
power supply is not compatible with this
motherboard now that could be because
it's an engineering sample was not a
retail model of the power supply which I
showed you earlier in the video
it just kept triggering an immediate
over current protection so the computer
would click on and click off like
immediately
not good and then today when I was
messing around with it I noticed that
every time I booted the computer it
would hang for about 30 seconds on the
BIOS flash screen that it would restart
and they would boot just fine well come
to find out that my Mayflower o Dec
objective - oh dang amp combo plugged
into USB was actually the problem so
they are going to research that and I'm
going to loan them my O DAC if they need
it and they're going to see if they can
figure out why that's happening and fix
that in a current BIOS update but
overall this is actually a pretty solid
board I'm very happy with it a lot of
features very happy with the computer
build what's funny is when I do these
builds I get pretty damn sick of them
like right now I'm really sick of
looking at this computer I turn around
and I look at it and it's just like oh
so sick of this thing that's because I
sent spent a solid week on this all my
spare time went into this all my video
productions and all the blogging
everything I'm just sick of it
so it's it's time to move forward now
get on to bigger and better things
so guys Magesty cents project skunkworks
hope you guys have enjoyed it there is a
PC part pick or link in the description
open that little box believe it or not
it folds down there's there's things in
there I know a lot of viewers tend to
forget that there's actually things down
there yeah you gotta you gotta look down
there well not down there down below the
video down below the video yeah alright
guys I'm gonna get the hell on out of
here
it's time to get away from this computer
for a while follow on Twitter you guys
an Instagram you guys can see some
pictures of this thing from along the
way
and as always guys I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
