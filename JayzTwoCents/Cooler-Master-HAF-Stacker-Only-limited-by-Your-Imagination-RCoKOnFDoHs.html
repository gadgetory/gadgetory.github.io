launched a case that's really unique and
is really aiming at giving the customer
some serious versatility when it comes
to meeting your needs without you having
to buy a whole lot of extra equipment to
fitment fitment I think that's a word
fit minute case or outfit a case to your
needs
so instead they're trying to give you an
option of something you can buy that may
fit any possible scenario that you find
yourself in and any given time and that
case is the 1/2 stacker and you guys
have been asked me to do a review of the
1/2 stacker and that's exactly what
we're gonna do today so this is the way
that it ships right here you get the 905
R and the R stands for rear mounted PSU
there's also the 911 5 F which is a
front mounted PSU and these do also
support ITX motherboards in there we'll
get more to that in a minute and the 9 3
5 which is the mid tower portion so you
do get for one price the top and the
bottom piece now we're going to talk
real quick about the mid tower case on
this it's got a huge side panel window
that I really like shows off everything
inside your case it's smoked it looks
really good it's pretty rigid
and I have no complaints about that and
all of a sudden I now have like a runny
nose so bear with me but when you look
at the inside here you get six harddrive
cages here our two harddrive cages with
three hard drive sleds per cage three
five and a quarter drives an SSD mount
on the back of the motherboard tray and
you also have all black sleeve cables
here now I don't want to spend a whole
lot of time talking about the case
itself when it comes to the mid Tower or
the 9/11 5 individually because this
really comes with everything that you
would expect from a cooler master case I
mean it's no different you've got your
toolless locks you dis LEDs you know pop
out really easily you just push this
button and they come apart put your hard
drive in there put it in slides right in
there's really nothing groundbreaking or
unique about
that so instead of spending time on that
let's go ahead and talk about what is
unique about this case the fact that
it's called the stacker is just that you
can stack components on to this or more
9 1 5s if you want you can put one on
the bottom or the top so what we're
gonna do today I've got a second 9 1 5
right here and this is a 9 1 5f we're
gonna go ahead and talk briefly what the
differences are between these two cases
and then we're gonna show you how they
go together and come apart and then I'm
gonna throw a bunch of parts in here
we've got some alpha cool radiators here
we've got four hard drives and we're
just going to kind of show you what you
can do with this case and that really
the only thing limiting you is your
imagination
ok so looking at the 911 5r which is
what comes shipped with the 935 or the
stacker you have the side panel more
start here it does have native three
times 120 millimeter mounts or two times
140 millimeter mounts that are filtered
unfortunately the filter is not a pop
out or a magnet it does have these four
screws so it's a little bit difficult to
take out if you need in terms of just
the fans already mounted you have to
remove the fans a little bit of a
drawback but hey it's there this is also
how you would mount your radiator we'll
get to that in a moment
inside the 905 the one that comes with
the stacker anyway you have another hard
drive cage here with three sleds five
and a quarter two lists plenty of
options here for routing cables through
grommets a giant grommet here
motherboard cutout on the back io shield
and the PSU mounting in the rear so you
could put a second system on top of your
main system if you wanted to do like a
stream PCE or a guest PC or whatever you
can do that with this case you could
also remove these two hard drive cages
and put them in the top and have a full
data bank here or NASA set up or a light
coining rig or whatever you want to do
with that or you could customize this as
a water box so it's very very
customizable and before we show that off
I just want to show you how simple it is
to disassemble this there are four
screws in the top here front and rear
I've already taken those out you can
access the top by simply sliding this
really nice meshed top panel here it's
very attractive which you can see then
gives you practically full access
unobstructed access to the top and if
you remove the rear you get even more
access to this box so that you can
completely customize this the front
cover literally pops right off giving
you access to the single 100 or excuse
me the single 92 millimeter fan in the
front it's a little bit lacking but hey
you know it is pretty small and then
there is the top panel completely gutted
now if you're like me and you want to
use this as some sort of a rad box take
out the four screws that are in here
again just like the top screw in the
front and the back on each side slide
this back pull it up and it comes right
off exposing the bottom and the top of
the 9:35 which as you can see also
supports three times 120 millimeter fans
or two times 140 millimeter fans so
that's really cool there now what if you
want to put this on the bottom well no
different then the way the feet are the
bottom comes off or the top comes off of
a 911 five you have four screws on the
bottom you guessed it the feet slide
right off you can put them on the bottom
of this one here which essentially in
the end ends up looking like this guy
here which has the feet on there already
as you can see now let's go ahead and
roll briefly talk about the difference
about the 9 1 5 F which is as you can
tell by the model number there a
front-mounted power supply unit for a
micro ITX build our mini ITX build I
keep seeing micro mini ITX build you've
got an extension cable here so that your
power supply cable can run to the rear
of the case so that's the way they come
apart that's the way that they mount oh
and also to the 905 F does have the USB
3.0 audio input and output and power
switch on there
whereas the 905 our that comes with the
case as you can see right here does not
because this comes with the case you
already have those buttons on the case
there you go
so when it comes to applications what
can you do with this why would you want
this and why would you almost knock it
off the desk like I just did well maybe
you're the kind of person that thinks
more is more maybe you want to have all
kinds of hard drives in the top water
cooling set up in the bottom and a nice
clean build in the middle maybe you want
to stack these all the way to the
ceiling because you could continue to
stack these infinitely kind of like the
Tower of Babel I guess if you're
biblical but anyway I'm gonna go ahead
and outfit this kind of with some
uniqueness and we'll come back we'll
take a look at what I did why I did it
and it's just an example of what you
could do with a versatile case like this
okay so here we go this is kind of an
extreme build out if you will we've got
a lot going on here we took the extra
nine one five we stuck it up on top and
we put all of the harddrive cages here
in the top giving us a total of nine
hard drives that we could potentially
have up here including a tenth that
could be mounted here in the five and a
quarter drive so you have like an entire
data rack going on up here on the top
for all your raid setups and things if
you need that much data storage in the
middle here we've got nice open air flow
I've even mounted a 240 millimeter rad
right here in the front
got a reservoir here full sized ATX
board could go there and power supply
could still stay right here in the
middle now on the bottom I opted to turn
it into a water box for a radiator
there's a couple of things I want to
show you one when it comes to radiator
support you can see we could fit a 240
in the front as well as two 360s in the
bottom giving us a lot of surface area
for water cooling now it mounts to the
side panel here which I'm not a fan of
I'm honest I'm not a fan of the way that
that mounts but it is doable where you
could put the Redbox all together first
and then put the top piece on otherwise
you have no way of getting in there to
hook up all of your hoses and fittings
and radiator power the pump and and all
of that so I would suggest building the
red box on the bottom first then putting
the piece on top and lock-in it now
so as you can see here it mounts right
here on this side panel just like this
so there it is we've got the three sixty
millimeter rad and we've got three alpha
cool fans on there but what I want to
show you is that this case also offers
something - modders if you're a modder
and you'd like to modify cases and if
you're like me you want the most
radiator space that you can get you
probably would be disappointed that this
does not natively support four hundred
and eighty millimeter rats
however with minimal modding effort you
could fit a four hundred and eighty
millimeter in the bottom I mean if you
look I have one sitting down in here
right now and as you can see there is
more than enough room for four hundred
and eighty millimeter red in the bottom
as well as having room for your end
tanks and your fittings in there in fact
you have room for two of them but what's
going to be required to do that is
you're gonna have to get yourself one of
those radiator mounts they're just like
an l-shaped bracket radiator mounts to
that and you screw it to the bottom you
can fit a for ID in there with no
problem you would want to enlarge the
hole though you would want to take this
to a machine shop or something and get
this hole opened up maybe put a nice
billet cover on there otherwise you're
gonna restrict the airflow just because
of the opening limitation to this but
that if you're a case motor is a very
simple very easy and cheap mod to do so
I just wanted to show you that you could
natively do two 360 Reds in the bottom
with the 240 in the front you could
technically if you have the extra nine
one five do four I'm all you can do for
you can do for three hundred and sixty
millimeter adds to in the top two in the
bottom if you wanted or if you were me
mod it for two four hundred and eighty
millimeter Reds in the bottom which
would for me be the best way to go this
has everything you would expect plus
more I mean you have ample room in the
back for a case of wire management you
have a nice thick cutouts right here for
your cables to go through and they even
indent it in slightly to give you about
a full inch right here for your cables
to run through has a native SSD mount on
the back of the motherboard 140
millimeter fan included does not come
with any front fans on there which I
kind of found surprising but you can put
two
hundred are to 120 millimeter fans in
their accessories let's talk about that
real quick because you are potentially
dealing with a long run from the power
supply unit if it were in the bottom to
the top they include this SATA power
adapter that is very long now this is an
extension from the point at which you
could plug it in from the length of your
power supply so you could you could have
like a 10-foot cable if you needed it
and they're already spaced perfectly for
the three hard drives right there so you
have a nice extension cable comes with
one of those included all of your
mounting hardware here for your hard
drives and your motherboard standoffs as
well as your fan screws some zip ties
but the most important thing is if you
kind of look at the back here you can
see that you have some open holes that
wouldn't be used now it does come with
one PSU or power supply unit block out
plate and it does come with one
motherboard IO shield block out plate
which you could use to plug up those
holes so there it is guys the half
stacker from cooler master it's a pretty
awesome case in fact the only thing
you're really limited by on this is your
imagination I mean what would you do
with this case I think it's a really
cool design
I like case modding and this honestly
takes a lot of the modding effort out of
it and you have to really try to figure
out something to mod on this case
because they've really thought of a lot
of it
the only complaint I really have about
this case two things I would love to see
480 millimeter rad support because you
can see the case size supports it it
fits in there you can easily fit two in
there
the second thing is because the grommets
are right in the middle right here your
cable management has to come through
these grommets they can't flow behind
the motherboard so you can't go from top
to bottom behind the motherboard and
hide them away that's so but if you're
good with cable management it may not be
that big of a deal that's honestly all I
can come up with that I found to be any
sort of a downside to this case but
there it is guys half stack er tell me
what you think about it what would you
do with this case and for the price that
you pay for this case at the time of
recording 169 bucks for the 93
nine one five art there it is I think
it's pretty awesome tell me what you
think so JC since if you liked this
