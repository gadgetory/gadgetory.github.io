two cents in this week I've been asked a
million times about how much RAM you
really need on your graphics card and
that's exactly what we're going to talk
about in this episode of a little bita
Tech it's no joke people I think a lot
of people are really confused about how
much RAM they really need on their video
card what i'm doing here is i'm running
Haven benchmark this is a synthetic
benchmark where it runs a bunch of loops
in it turns on tessellation and DirectX
11 and such and if we look at MSI
Afterburner here you can see really
using 800 megabytes at 1080p resolution
the most we've ever used in this
benchmark here was 817 megabytes as you
can see right there in the red font so I
went ahead and let this run a few times
just to see how much we can absolutely
maxed out the memory usage settings were
put as high as they would possibly go
and you can see again we're sitting
right about the 800 megabyte mark that
is nowhere near the two gigabytes that
this gtx 680 has and i went ahead and
ran the 3d mark 11 benchmark and it was
even less I didn't even bother putting
up a picture of it here because it only
used three hundred and fifty megabytes
but a lot of people will say hey that's
not fair this is a synthetic benchmark
so we went ahead and loaded up the
battlefield 3 and we as you can see here
all settings are on ultra 4 x MSAA
and look at that we are sitting once
again about 961 megabytes of video ram
used you can't see however though that
the usage is going up and down as high
as 1.1 gigabytes of video ram so what
i'm showing you here is what's affecting
that is the MSA a and as i go through
the different settings you can see that
the amount of memory used on the left
goes up and down depending on that
setting same thing with ambient
occlusion which is the type of lighting
effects so to use inside the app so
right off the bat you can see here at
max settings everything put as high as
you can go an anisotropic filter had no
effect on the memory usage whatsoever at
1080p on max settings on battlefield 3
which is one of the more demanding games
that are out on the market we never used
more than 1,100 megabytes of memory so I
went ahead and ran out into the game
this is a 64 player map and I never used
more than fourteen hundred and sixty two
megabytes
of RAM so I went ahead and then next
took the most demanding game that people
could consider right now which is the
Crysis 3 beta and I was a little
surprised here I was using a lot less
RAM that I thought never used more than
1200 may whites alright kids so what did
we learn with today's byte of tech well
right off the bat if you're using a
single monitor for gaming and you're not
doing any sort of a triple monitor setup
to gigabytes is more than enough you can
have as much as 500 megabytes of your
video RAM left over even while gaming at
max settings at 1080p however if you are
going to be using something that's
higher than 1080p 1200 P 14 40 or even
1600 on like a dil UltraSharp you're
gonna definitely want the higher amount
of RAM the four gigabytes are even the
six gigabytes offered on some AMD cards
because the msaa at res higher
resolutions is what's using that amount
of RAM same thing if you're gonna be
gaming with more than one monitor you're
gonna definitely want the higher amount
of VRAM but then again at that if you're
gonna be using more than one monitor for
gaming I definitely recommend more than
one video card as well so that's it for
this first installment of a little bita
tick hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
