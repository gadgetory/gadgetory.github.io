by techno I do mean technology take up
use that joke before that's okay because
there's nothing redundant on YouTube
everything is absolutely original in the
past I've done a couple videos about how
to overclock your graphics card or how
to overclock your cpu both Intel and AMD
and all that good stuff but recently
people have been asking me well what
effect does vram have on your overclock
does increasing your VRAM actually give
you better performance does it give you
better frames per second does it cook
you breakfast in the morning well that
actually depends what's an AMD or an
nvidia card but I digress so we're going
to talk about today is the correlation
of VRAM and how it affects your
performance and obviously we're going to
be using my envy surround set up behind
me with my 780 s in sli 2-way SLI now
the configuration behind me is running
in 57 60 by 1080p so what that's going
to allow us to do is not only check how
vram effects you know the overall
performance and frames per second of
those monitors but it's also going to
allow us to see how close we're getting
to the vram cap because the two things
that you constantly hear about with vram
is one you have to have a whole bunch of
it if you're gonna run a high resolution
and two that you need to have super fast
vram when you're doing ultimate gaming
or a high resolution gaming now I'm
really going to only be using two
benchmarks for this particular test and
that's going to be both valley benchmark
because it's going to give us a hard
number that we can see both minimum
maximum and average frames per second
over a synthetic benchmark and then
we're going to hop in some battlefield 4
and we're going to look at average frame
rates in there with different settings
on the vram speed and with you guys i'm
going to find out what the actual
results are believe it or not I've done
lots of overclocked benchmarking when it
comes to court but I've never actually
done any standalone Ram tests to see
exactly what the hard differences are so
we're going to learn together and
together it's just the way I like to do
this weird anyways I bet okay guys we're
back now and I have spent the last
couple of hours going over these
benchmarks again and again and again
trying out different things making sure
I get my baselines and trying to bring
you guys the most accurate results that
I could not bear in mind this is my
setup specific to my graphics cards how
they perform my surround setup and you
know your results may vary I mean this
is all based on my GPU my CPU my
motherboard my cooling so your results
may vary so keep in mind these are my
results they're not the definitive you
know all-inclusive for every situation
in the world type of results now for the
first test as I mentioned I did Valley
benchmark which I find to be the most
consistent way of measuring even small
changes when it comes to your system
games like behind me there's a lot of
things that are always happening
explosions at different times different
things being rendered different parts of
the map different player interactions
explosions and jets and choppers and
boats lots of different variables which
can really make the outcome different
every single time so it makes it very
difficult to baseline so that's why we
use valley benchmark to kind of do our
side-by-side comparisons now for valley
benchmark results this is for one
monitor not surround just one monitor
and I found that to be pretty much the
most consistent way to measure the
differences because again with surround
there's going to be a lot of different
changes there now when it comes to the
valley benchmark results there's a lot
of numbers here just kind of look at the
chart and let that be a little bit more
of a visual aid to the numbers I'm going
to give you here now that no overclock
whatsoever on the GPU or the RAM that's
one thousand six megahertz on the GPU
clock and the six thousand effective
megahertz on the RAM three gigabytes of
RAM we are getting a score of forty five
sixty nine an average of 100 9.2 frames
per second with a min max of forty one
point seven in the maximum of one
hundred ninety three now utilized RAM on
that was one thousand three hundred
sixteen megahertz or forty three point
eight seven percent utilized Ram at one
monitor now that's expected results
because we are talking about one screen
with three or one 1080p panel with the
you know 3 gigabytes of RAM that's more
than enough now when you overclock
just the memory and you leave the core
where it's at our score jumps up to a 47
11 that's a jump of about 140 points and
minimum are an average of one hundred
twelve point six frames per second
that's a three frames per second average
jump right there so that's just by
overclocking the RAM 500 megahertz or
one gigahertz effective so going from
six gigs to seven gigs netted us only a
couple of percent of an overclock or
increase in performance there and that's
about three frames per second 3.4 frames
per second average increase by moving
the slider on the RAM one extra
gigahertz and that's utilized percentage
of forty four point five six percent
utilize of the three gates now when we
overclock the GPU and we leave the
memory at stock speeds we were getting a
51 51 score that's a couple hundred
about 400 point jump 140 point jump and
our average FPS jumped from 112 to 123
inside of valley benchmark so you can
see obviously we got the most result by
overclocking our GPU even by leaving the
RAM stock now if we go ahead and
overclock our VRAM our score jumped from
a 51 51 to a fifty-four forty nine and
an average FPS of 130 point two so
that's adding another 7.1 frames per
second by adding an additional RAM
overclock to the GPU now what's
happening there is your GPU is getting
faster the RAM has to get faster to keep
up with it so that's why we're seeing
kind of these linear increases in
performance by moving those sliders now
let's go and utilize RAM again 1315
megabytes at forty three point eight two
percent utilize that's pretty much
baseline because the synthetic
benchmarks not really changing and we're
only using one panel okay now let's go
ahead and take these exact same scores
and bring them over to battlefield 4 now
the first thing I want to go ahead and
address is at 57 60 by 1080p at ultra
preset which is you know MSAA and
everything on the max we were utilizing
all three gigabytes of our VRAM now I
want to point something out here before
we move forward now this is the part
that I don't really find surprising I
guess I'm a little bit surprised that we
did utilize all three gigahertz or three
MiG's of RAM I didn't think it would cap
out but I think what's happening here is
the utilization of RAM in these graphics
cards has progressed to the point to
where they're very dynamic and the game
will use as much RAM as available to it
if it feels that it needs it but you're
not going to start experiencing crashing
or blue screens or anything like that by
capping out your rim because the entire
time I played I was capped out at three
thousand four megabytes utilized Ram in
battlefield 4 on both GPUs just straight
across the board completely capped but I
wasn't getting stutters I wasn't getting
slowdowns I was getting very smooth
frame rates now if I brought that down
to one screen I was getting about
nineteen hundred and fifty megabytes
used of RAM
now here's the part where I think it's a
little bit surprising is utilizing
battlefields for with my old 680 which
was a two gigabyte card I was easily
utilizing about 1400 megabytes of that
ramp so by going to a faster and more
robust GPU like the 780 the game
recognized hey we've got more potential
here so we're going to utilize more of
the hardware so that's the part that I
found kind of surprising the programming
in these games is a lot more dynamic
where it recognizes what you have and
then goes ahead and increases the
utilized hardware to give you better
performance overall so that's the part I
didn't expect but I can tell you right
now running three screens with three
gigabyte cards they did cap out the RAM
but I did not have any adverse effects
those rumors of cattle if you utilize
all the RAM you're gonna you're going to
add blue screen and you're going to get
kicked out of the game you're going to
get huge spikes and stutters didn't get
any of that guys so it just means that
the memory controllers of these GPUs are
a lot more intelligent that a lot of
people give them credit for okay enough
about that let's go ahead and talk about
the frames per second increase when it
comes to battlefield 4 at base settings
with the sli enabled we were getting an
average of 80 frames per second in ultra
preset when we went ahead and bump that
up to
stocke GPU speed and 1 gigahertz
overclock on the RAM we did gain 3
frames per second average for an 83
bumping up the overclock on the GPU to
13 hundred and 50 megahertz and leaving
the RAM stock at 6 gigahertz
we got a 92 frames per second average in
SLI and 3 screens and then going ahead
and overclocking both to the max 1350
megahertz
7 gigahertz on the RAM we got 95 frames
per second average when it came to both
graphics cards and three screens so
there you go guys these are my results
basically the more vram the better but
if you don't have quite enough as you
can see the game will go ahead and the
graphics cards rather will self manage
the memory and they'll just make best
use of what they have available to them
without kicking out of the game or
crashing or anything like that so there
you go you can see very modest increases
by overclocking your V RAM but obviously
the grunt of all of your performance
gains is going to come from the
overclock ability or the luck of the GPU
lottery that you get when it comes to
overclocking your graphics cards so what
do you got your guys's results what kind
of performance have you seen by moving
those sliders on your graphics card AMD
Nvidia sound off down then just in the
comments down there and let people know
what kind of performance gains you're
getting by tweaking and having some fun
with those graphics cards guys I'm going
on out of here maybe enjoy some games
and as always follow me on Twitter if
you guys want to talk about today's
video take it over to the website Jay's
two cents calm and I will see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
