deal with when building a new computer
is cable management and anything that
comes along that can make that a little
bit easier I am willing to take a look
at so that's why today I'm gonna be
taking a look at EVGA power link which
is designed to relocate where the power
plugs go on your graphics card and they
claim it will make things a whole lot
easier when it comes to cable management
makes them look a whole lot tidy it
becomes a curious part number on this is
600 - BL - 2 8 1 6 - LR what's up the
new define nano s from fractal design
supports full-sized power supplies full
length graphics cards room for a
complete custom water loop and heck even
room for a couple of freeloaders click
the link in the description for more
details track - Josh not included we
should order pizza that's an interesting
part number four something that just
relocates the power plugs but I digress
I was trying to figure out what I was
going to do with this video did actually
want to use them don't want to put them
in a build was I use them on the test
bed you know what here's I'm going to do
I am going to just turn the camera here
we're going to take it out of the box
we're going to show how it's
configurable because you can configure
it obvious there's a lot of different
plug configurations on the market 2 x 4
pins 2 x 6 pins an 8 pin and a 6 pin 6
pin and a 6 pin so I'm going to show you
how this can be configured and then
we're gonna stick it in skunkworks and
see whether or not looks better before
or after I guess that's the best way to
tell alright let's let's do it let's
turn the camera alright so here they are
right here we got it well these are
graphics cards these are the adapters
right here this is referred to as the
power link one of these is already open
there we go so basically it's a really
simple device that simply does nothing
but take a little bracket here that's in
there good Jesus and then it will
essentially just attached to your
graphics card like that it plugs in and
then the plugs are moved to the back of
the card so ideally while the graphics
card is in your case like this instead
of having the plugs come and wrap all
the way around have to make a 180 degree
turn if they're going back to the
motherboard tray they are just gonna be
coming out the back and going into the
motherboard tray a couple things you
want to keep in mind though immediate
Lee is one it's going to add obviously a
bit of length to your graphics card on
top of the plug thickness so you're
going to be adding at least it's about
an inch thick right here to the back of
the graphics card and then of course
there is the plug itself that's in the
radius it's going to add some more
length so if you take an 11 inch card
here kind of like the 980ti
then you're gonna be a making it 12
potentially as much as 12 and a half to
13 inches long ladies okay I couldn't
help it I had to if sorry I had to don't
be mad okay I digress now they guarantee
it will work with all EVGA cards make
sense it's an EVGA product they're going
to make sure it's compatible theirs but
not all PCIe power connectors on
graphics cards are facing the same way
for instance on this MSI 1063 gig right
here the power plug the little prong
that's used to latch the cable for the
PCIe Express power is pointing up so
when this is in your case a little
latches on the top but when you look at
Nvidia graphics cards that are designed
reference and companies that don't flip
the power plug around that little tab is
pointing down so obviously if that was
upside down that's not going to work and
because the power on these rails are
polarized there is a positive and a
negative you cannot just flip the little
plug upside down in there and plug it in
so you're going to want to look right so
something else you get in the box right
here is the 6 pin PCI Express power
that's because it comes pre-installed
with the 2 8 pin power there's also a
manual in here somewhere
shows you the orientation that things
are supposed to go in you should
probably read that actually shows you
how things go there's a little screw in
there to tighten it down we don't need
that because that's what this video is
about gather way and then the last thing
they include is the little allen key
which you need to tighten them down also
too if you're using a 10 Series card or
any card that only has a single PCI
Express power you're going to obviously
be removing one of these as you're only
going to use one so moving forward
here's what you got to do you need to
take your little allen key here and
you've got to remove these little rubber
covers right here that are going to
expose little allen keys if I can get
this in focus here as you can see right
there there are
some little allen keys in there which
are holding those in place so we need to
do now is loosen these up and I'm going
to remove one of these a 8 pin and
replace it obviously with a 6 pin
because that's what the Pascal has the
tight mix it doesn't have to 8 pins also
tube as you can see they do simply have
these little prongs that there's a
little rail in there you can kind of see
that there is a little rail and when you
loosen them up they also can slide on
the rail right there so that you can get
the width set just right now because I
have the 8 pin on the outside and 6 pin
on the inside I need to swap this one to
the other little rail in there take my 6
pin put it in there just like that now I
can go ahead and plug these in and then
once I do that they'll be able to slide
technically I can even do it this way I
can plug this in first like that plug it
in like that and then I can line these
up like this there's that so I now I can
slide as you can see that how I want it
so I'm going to put it flush against the
back of the card and then I'm going to
tighten down this little these little
allen key so they don't slide and I'll
do that on both ends it's actually very
easy this is a very easy install if you
can turn a screwdriver you can install
this bad boy and then when you squeeze
right here is actually a little plastic
piece that pushes down then you can get
them off so that's what it looks like
now when it's set up properly for 980ti
slash tight necks well I thought these
lit up what says EVGA but maybe it
doesn't so we'll be checking it all
right what imma do right now is I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to get
the other one ready to go and then we'll
switch over to skunkworks and we'll do a
before and after and we'll let you guys
be the judge what we will let you guys
be the judge if a device like this
really does change the aesthetics I'm
wondering if the movement you know
rearranging the cables is going to be
offset by this giant thing here now
sitting on the end of your graphics card
so now I guess we're going to find out
one last thing I want to point out since
I did try it real quick just to see what
would happen is if someone was going to
try and flip this over
upside-down accidentally you can't
accidentally flip it upside down because
you can see in here there is the little
rail system and there's a little tab
right there it's not perfectly centered
so it has to make room for the little
latch to go in so it only goes in one
way
so you can't accidentally put it in
upside down and blow up your card
because you have the positive and
negative backwards it simply won't go in
so that's a good thing that's also why
it won't work on cards like this where
the tab is upside down
now I'll be honest even though I'm a
huge EVGA fan I found this to be a
little bit gimmicky when I first saw it
and I'm kind of glad I took a look at it
because I can see that it does have some
practical applications in terms of just
kind of keeping things neat and tidy I
do think it looks tidy or with these on
in skunkworks because the cables for
skunkworks the way they're routed never
really kind of met the aesthetic theme
of the build and because they're black
they do not light up I thought they had
white LEDs in there but they don't they
are it's just very clean but something
you have to keep in mind though is not
only is it clean it's now very long so
you have to make sure that the length is
going to fit overall on a card like this
the total length is about thirteen and a
half inches long when you account for
the the radius of the Bend of the cables
now speaking of cables they're heavy I
have cables here that have been trained
to fit in a certain position so having
to retrain them right now and they're
pushing on that adapter quite a bit and
causing a bit of sag and the only thing
holding this to your card is the power
connectors itself so you don't want to
break the power connectors or the solder
on the PCB for the the connectors so you
want to be very very careful when
plugging these in try and support your
cables as best you can so that the
adapter itself is not supporting the
weight of the cables I would hate to see
broken graphics card PCI Express power
slot or plugs because of you weren't
careful and as you were trying to
manipulate your cables you cracked it or
bent it and then put too much fatigue on
it and then it breaks a solder point so
it's definitely something to keep in
mind but I think it looks pretty good
skunkworks was one of those systems that
was kind of everything a square in
skunkworks and when I had to have those
cables you know kind of a rounded kind
of a swooping look to them it never
really met the aesthetics or the theme
of the build so I do think that this
looks really nice it does also add a
little bit of bulk to it it's kind
they're kind of big so I'm gonna leave
them off a little bit see if I can get
used to him and then we'll go from there
anyway guys that's all for today I hope
you guys have enjoyed this video let me
know let me know what you guys think
remember this is this is a very
subjective type of product so I'm
curious as to what you guys think about
tell me whether you liked it before or
after the install of these adapters and
sound off in the comments make your
voices heard let's hear it is this a
good product to use in terms of cable
management and aesthetics or you guys
think it just kind of
it look worse I'm torn we're gonna see
I'm gonna wait and see if it grows on me
right now I do feel like they're a
little bit bulky in there they do kind
of add up
I don't know it breaks up the lines of
the graphics card a little bit so we're
just going to wait and see if I don't
like it then I can just put it back it
takes a few seconds all right guys
thanks for watching as always I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
