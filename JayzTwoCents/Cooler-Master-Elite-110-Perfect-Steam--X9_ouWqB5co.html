Coolermaster elite 110 as you can see
this thing is extremely tiny and this
would be appealing to you if you're
looking at building some sort of a
really tiny form-factor case or maybe a
home theater PC maybe some sort of a
really inexpensive home server or maybe
a steam box so if you're looking for
something really tiny that you can still
fit some powerful componentry in that
you don't want to miss this
now coolermaster has put a decent amount
of design into this but they've also
made it extremely affordable and I don't
like talking about price but at the time
of shooting this video this is only
$49.99 to make the power supply unit fit
and to give you as much room as possible
you've got this bracket here that kind
of extends out the back of the case as
you can see it extends out about one
inch so it gives you the ability to use
standard size power supplies without
protruding too far into the case taking
up encroaching in the amount of room
that you have in there so this is a
pretty neat design since on the back of
the case it doesn't really matter that
it kind of looks a little bit funky the
way it sticks out but hey you have four
thumb screws here that remove the outer
shell and where you go ahead and remove
that because its face it everything guys
want to know about is on the inside now
when you deal with such a tiny
form-factor he is certainly your number
one concern now they have vent vents on
all three sides of the case so it
doesn't really seem like heat is giving
too much of an issue if you are smart
about the components that you put in
here I mean I obviously wouldn't
recommend going and putting the hottest
components you can find in such a small
case like this now you're going to find
on the top and on the side this is where
you have your brackets for mounting your
hard drives as well as optional 80
millimeter fans on here if you want to
do that you can put 80 millimeter fans
right here to create a little bit of a
cross flow as well now on the top of the
case here being held in by four Phillips
head screwdrivers you have a plate here
for mounting additional accessories you
can mount two SSDs on here you
come out to full-size three and a half
inch hard drives on here as well as you
have some other screws that just kind of
give you the ability to mount other
things that you may find necessary now
removing this plate brings us to full
access of the inside of the case now the
bottom of this case is pretty much going
to be filled in entirely by the eight
ITX
or mini ITX motherboard so you know
you're going to have very limited room
on the bottom there so which is why they
kind of stacked everything up I mean the
power supply as you can see would extend
over the top of the motherboard for the
graphics card it can only fit a 210
millimeter or 8.3 inch
graphic card now that really limits your
choices I mean you're going to end up
having to go with something that small
form-factor like the 760 ITX from msi or
the old-school short PCB 6 70's or
something along that line or maybe a 660
or 650 something that is shorter in
nature what I have right here is my r9
270 gaming Edition here from MSI and as
you can see the cooler extends out quite
a bit past the PCB now had that not been
the case this card would have barely fit
and I mean barely but as it is right now
this card does not fit inside of this
case so that's something you need to be
mindful of so if you guys are hoping to
use like an hour 90 to 90 or 280 X or
yes 780 or even a 770 it's not going to
happen in here unless you go with some
sort of a shorty PCB version which some
of those cards do have but unfortunately
the powerhouse cards typically do not
have a shorty version so definitely keep
that in mind now when it comes to the
power supply it says on here that you
could use 180 millimeter 7.1 inch long
power supply with less cable management
you know friendliness or you could go
with a 142 millimeter 5.6 inch with full
cable management capabilities so
basically the shorter the power supply
or something designed for a small
form-factor like this the easier the
cable management is going to be now when
it comes to front panel on here you do
have two USB 3.0 you have your headphone
you have your microphone jack reset
button and hard drive LED and the power
button is right here on the front which
is actually the Coolermaster logo
that's the button and that illuminates
as well when the power is turned on now
behind the front panel you will also
find a 110 20 millimeter fan
pre-installed for you there it is right
there but it also can accommodate a 140
millimeter fan now when it comes to
cooling options on this if you want to
put a all-in-one cooling unit in here it
has to be a 120 millimeter radiator 140
in here just simply is too big it does
not fit that's what she said now the
maximum heat sink fan height that you
can use on this if you want to go with a
cooling tower is 3 inches or a 76
millimeters so keep that in mind now but
it has all the connectivity right here
with black cabling so it's a lot more
stealth you have your USB 3.0 cable on
there and you also on the side have more
options here for mounting hard drives so
you could potentially mount four hard
drives total in this thing as well as a
small 120 millimeter radiator plus a
short graphics card and ITX well PSU
everything would just fit nicely into
this nice one cubic foot footprint here
now as with all things that I review
nothing is perfect there are some things
that I don't like about this number one
obviously I wish it fit my longer
graphics card I believe the elite 130
does I would have to verify that
information so don't quote me on that
but I think the elite 130 does fit a
longer graphics card in there as well as
maybe a larger radiator now on the
bottom the feet are plastic they're not
rubber which I kind of feel like they
could have just gone ahead and put the
extra few cents in there but then again
when you're looking at a $50 ITX
solution you really can't complain too
much well guys there it is tell me what
you think about the elite 110 I just I
think it's a cool little package that's
that's not what she said no no no but I
think that you could do a lot with this
especially if you were looking at doing
a Kaveri build with something like the
gigabyte f2 a 88 X end ITX motherboard
and using a apu built into this you
could get a lot of power out of this and
have a lot more room in there so guys
there it is tell me what you think what
would you change about this case what do
you like about this case as always I
hope you guys have enjoyed this video
it's helped you become smarter buyers
turning you into prosumers and as always
I will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
