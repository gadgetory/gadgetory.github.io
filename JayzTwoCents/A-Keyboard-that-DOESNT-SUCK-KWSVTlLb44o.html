which really kind of sucks but that's
not gonna stop me from doing a keyboard
review yeah a keyboard review now but
hear me out
I know a lot of you guys are like
keyboards are so boring but when mass
drop reached out and said hey we want to
sponsor a video with the new control
keyboard we currently have a drop on I
was like I don't really do keyboard
reviews they talked me into it and I'm
glad I did because trust me when I say
this keyboard this is premium and this
is one you're gonna want to definitely
take a look at especially if you're any
sort of a keyboard or typing elitist I
don't let the basic packaging fool you
this is a very premium product available
at mass drop so if we open it up right
here we'll do a quick unboxing gives you
some warranty information but also all
of your function keys on a quick
reference card you can leave this in
your drawer wherever you would put an
information piece of information like
this but it gives you quick access to
understand what the function keys are on
the keyboard because this is an RGB
programmable keyboard that you control
on the keyboard itself you don't need
any stand-alone software to make all the
lighting do pretty cool RGB lighting
stuff obviously we have our keyboard
we'll look at this in a second you get a
USB type-c cable we have this very
premium aluminum or aluminium depending
on where you are key cap puller you also
get a switch puller because the switch
is on here our hot swappable they are
very quick to remove in case you need to
replace a switch quick and easy they're
not soldered in they are simply a hot
swab type which is nice and then you've
got a couple of rubber feet right here
for your keyboard which are magnetic so
this is everything you get in the box
and let's take a look at the keyboard
itself very minimalistic different
shades of grey 50 of them probably so as
you can see it's a very minimalistic
design we have a textured silver
aluminum chassis on here it's a it's a
full aluminum build so it's very hefty
it means it's not gonna flex it's not
gonna I want to my thumb is really
jacked up I mean I want to flex this but
I I can't I guess it's a good point
right look at all the rubber feet on the
bottom right here this is not going to
slide all around this this is gonna hold
true wherever you sit so it's it's not
gonna slide as you can see but if you
want to raise it up a little bit that is
where these aluminum feet come in handy
bamm-bamm
and now you've got a little bit more of
an angle for your type now these are
kale silver switches which I mentioned
so they're very similar to like a cherry
red their linear press no tactile bump
no tactile click because that was pretty
nice sound to them no huh if you were in
an office got that nice mechanical feel
but it's not clicky
a little bit of clack in there when the
key pressed bottoms out but not too bad
the weight i've had to guess is probably
right around a 50 gram it feels a lot
like a 50 gram doesn't feel too heavy to
press so let's go and talk about the
switches real quick is as I mentioned
these are hot swappable so if you want
to pull out one of the middle keys like
that's you know got a neighboring key
you could use the key cap puller and use
a scape because it's easy to access
which you take you a little switch
puller right here you find where the two
grooves are and then you can actually as
I mentioned the key caps are cherry MX
style so if you had a favorite set of
key caps you could use them master off
also does key caps and stuff from time
to time so we're keeping an eye out so
you take little brass Berg will call the
grass where you find the two grooves
it's very hard left handed because I am
a right-handed individual and then that
just pulls right out so as you can see
these are just two contacts that press
into place it only goes one way so if
you had a key switch die on you or if
you wanted to replace your switch for
whatever reason you could actually do
that without having to solder or D
solder anything making it very easy you
can also see right there inside the
switch the LED itself because this isn't
RGB keyboard as I mentioned so to
reinstall it's pretty simple you just
line this up with the two pins on the
bottom you have your center shaft huh
ladies push that down put the key cap
back on and you just replace your switch
now let's talk about connectivity cuz
that's a huge feature on this keyboard
you can see you have two USB type C's on
either side of the keyboard that's
obviously because if you have a system
on the right or on the left you could
choose which side it's on to make a more
streamlined cable management path your
USB type-c cord is about a meter long
and as you can see it terminates to a
USB 3.0 but if we plug this in right
here you can see that that frees up the
other side of the keyboard now to be a
free Pasteur's you can use this to
charge a USB type-c device you took this
guy plug this in right here
so this is actually a hub that we use
from time to time it's got two USB 3.0 s
it's got an Ethernet as well as an HDMI
so we got this to actually be sort of a
one piece of device that we could use to
hot-swap a whole system onto like a
laptop and be able to move it around so
you would plug this in to your laptop
and then this would become kind of your
entire pastor so the keyboard itself
sort of becomes your dock which is
perfect for whether or not you're an on
the go working off of a laptop you just
want to unplug one cable from your
laptop and go which like I said if you
live the Apple dongle life you're very
used to that so this device definitely
works for both of those scenarios well
let's go and talk about the lighting and
the actual typing experience on this
because at the end of the day that's
what matters most when it comes to a
keyboard so that's what it looks like
when you first turn it on obviously it's
in a an RGB rainbow demo mode but using
the card right here we can actually
control this so let's go ahead and
change the pattern here so if you push
function and D it goes to the next
pattern so it looks like it's just a
rainbow static ooh that white are the
pink and blue might look white on camera
it's actually more like a peachy pink
color
trust me yellow red green blue the white
looks sick Wow okay I like the white a
lot we've got a little bit of a red
pattern going across there there's the
pattern with no other backlight on it's
off and then back to that mode now we
can also change the brightness and with
W&amp;amp;S so it's pretty easy to remember
function D and a for right and left on
the different modes and then function W
and s is for brightness up and down so
you see we can control the brightness so
you have a scrolling pattern like this
you can actually increase and decrease
the scrolling with the Q and E so we
could speed it up how fast does it go
that's all of it whoa it's like Knight
Rider right there dude so with capslock
you can actually change the direction as
well so a function caps lock it now goes
the other way but I was a huge fan of
just the solid white because that looks
just so clean with all the gray and
stuff right there yeah so the same thing
happens with media keys so function page
up is volume up page down is volume down
mute function mute is print and I mean
people use the hot key for print but
anyway you get the idea you can go
through the card to learn all of those
other functions you can also download
software to do a more in-depth
programming of like individual keys so
that's the customized customizable
firmware you just go to the website
listed on the card to go and download
that and you can get much more in-depth
on the keyboard itself but you know what
that means now it is time for a typing
test and because my thumb is completely
out of commission and I'm not typing too
well I'm gonna go ahead and have Phil do
it all right so let's have some final
thoughts here because I'm not one of
those people that is pretty much a
keyboard snob I can type on just about
anything and I don't really think about
keyboards unless they're annoying me if
something's annoying me then I'm quick
to get rid of it move on to something
else until it annoys me and then I get
rid of it I didn't find very much about
this keyboard that bothers me I mean
granted haven't got to spend a lot of
time with it but it it seemed to be a
pretty quick adaptation or adjustment to
typing on this keyboard I've typed on
kill switches before so that wasn't
really all that weird to me the silver
switch I think has a nice weight to it
it's about a 50 grand that's my guest by
the way the you know the full product
page will tell you what the weight of
the key is I'm sure but I prefer a
tactile bump which is why I prefer
cherry Browns and most of my keyboards
but this didn't really seem to have a
problem there was no miss press like it
seemed to always register the touch it's
not like I didn't push the key down far
enough it wasn't too heavy to push down
the build quality is outstanding metal
keyboards those are just some of the
best feeling keyboards they feel rigid
solid there's no creaking no flexing to
them the lighting in this being inbuilt
to the edge of the keyboard the edge
lighting just looks fantastic but not
everything about this for me is perfect
now let me tell you what I mean by that
I tend to be kind of picky when it comes
to my keyboards what I mean by that is
most of the time I leave them flat but
every now and then depending on my
sitting position I might want to make it
raised or upright so just lifting it up
flipping out some feet and putting it
down as quick and easy having to dig
these out of a drawer or wherever they
may be stashed in the box or in a closet
or whatever would be kind of an
annoyance to go okay I want to set this
up have to get him out now go on there
lift it up line it up stick it on there
and there we go so having some sort of a
cubby or recessed storage location on
the keyboard itself would have been nice
there's plenty of room on the back where
they could have maybe made a magnetic
post there to just stick them on so then
you wouldn't lose them there with the
keyboard not being used but my other
gripe with the feet is I push my
keyboard around all over my desk my
sitting position is always changing
sometimes I'm leaning back in my chair
so I slide it forward sometimes I slide
it off to the side because I'm sitting
sideways and the problem is as soon as
you slide these they just roll right off
because the feet are so grippy and so it
happens is they just roll over on their
side and pop right off the magnet cubby
there are recessed holes that are
holding on to them and that's gonna lead
to scratches all over the bottom of the
keyboard or just constantly being
annoying so having a way to maybe
permanently mount this with a screw or
something that went right through the
middle would have been a nice added
touch and the last thing I kind of want
to gripe about is the actual RGB itself
not the functionality of RGB which a lot
of people look at as a gimmick but
because there's no volatile Ram on this
which means as soon as it loses
connectivity or power then it resets
whether whatever the default is so let's
just say right now we unplug this from
our desktop or plugging it into our
keyboard we're going to school or a trip
or whatever when you plug it back in you
can see it goes right back to the RGB
demo mode now if you're leaving this
plugged in on a desktop and you're not
unplugging it then that's not gonna be a
problem because the cable does receive
power even when the system is in standby
or shutdown it's as soon as it's
completely detached that it resets like
this so if you are going to be traveling
around with it and putting it on a you
know on laptops and moving it around
this is something that you would have to
deal with so it's worth mentioning but
again kind of a minor gripe depending on
how you look at it because I can go
right back to the mode I was in just a
matter of seconds with the function key
so there's that so anyway we're gonna go
guys thanks for watching if you wanna
know more about this keyboard look at
the description below you will find a
link to mass drop they have sold over
2000 of these it's a very popular
keyboard that they are constantly being
asked to bring on sale so check out the
description below you guys can learn
more about it and again a huge thank you
to mass drop for sponsoring today's
video I told them i don't like keyboards
and stuff I don't really like to do
videos on them but this one pleasantly
surprised me
it's an eighty-percent keyboard or 10
keyless keyboard that I would have no
problems running as a daily driver all
right I'm gonna go thanks for watching
tell me what you guys think in the
comments below and as always I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
