Jays two cents and I wish that I were
coming to you under better circumstances
but unfortunately what you were looking
at right here is the face of a douchebag
there's no other way to put it so this
guy right here Adam
orthe is creative director at Microsoft
Studios as you may be aware the Xbox 720
or codename Durango is due to come out
any time right around the corner and
what are the fears that we have as
gamers is that this new console is going
to require an always-on internet
connection so what does that mean that
means if you want to play a
single-player game by yourself you have
to be online now if you live in the
United States like I do this may not
seem like a very big deal to you we're
used to having unlimited data caps now
if you live in other countries
specifically Australia Canada and a few
in Europe you may have to purchase data
blocks it says you only have a certain
amount of data allowed to you per month
so if you want to play your favorite
game by yourself you have to be online
subject to their streaming ads and who
knows what communications going back and
forth eating up your data that you've
paid for to play a game by yourself and
if that's not bad enough I've already
had several people who are subscribed to
me message me a soldier saying that they
brought their Xboxes with them on
deployments and in the evening after
they were done with a long hard day's
work sometimes multiple day's work
before they even get to take a shower
and they want to relax with a game of
madden or maybe some halo campaign or
some Call of Duty campaign or something
but they're no longer gonna be able to
do that because the rumor mill is saying
that the new console is gonna require
always-on internet connection and this
hasn't been confirmed yet so let's go
ahead and back up a little bit here
David orthe
remember that picture I referred to
earlier douchebag 101 this guy creative
manager from Microsoft Studios took it
upon himself to start tweeting with what
some are saying was a friend or a
colleague or maybe some sort of an
industry colleague about the importance
of always-on internet connection and I'm
gonna go ahead and paraphrase a couple
of the tweets here basically he was
saying he fails to see the problem
always on DRM everything we own now has
always on DRM and it's the world we live
in and to deal with it and even had the
nerve to put up this picture of Obama
saying deal with it not know about you
but I can think of only one person worth
linking if you're gonna be using the
phrase deal with it let's just go ahead
and dispel a couple of the myths right
now your smartphone does not require an
internet connection to work your toaster
does not acquire an internet connection
your computer does not require it your
Xbox 360 doesn't require it your ps3
does not require it your iPad doesn't
require it your Kindle your Android none
of this stuff requires an internet
connection to operate if you don't have
an internet connection hooked up to
these devices sure there are features
that you cannot access but it is not
required now let's go ahead and
fast-forward a little bit here one of
his twitter followers asked him well
what if the internet goes out how am I
supposed to play my single-player games
you're like me some of the only times
you ever play the single-player games is
when your internet is out so you go into
a little campaign a battlefield 3 Call
of Duty Halo something anything just to
kill the time because your internet is
out well guess what if always-on
internet as a requirement you're not
gonna be able to do that you're not
gonna be able to sign into your games
and you're not gonna be able to play but
Adam orth here seems to think that
that's not a big deal he went on to be
as arrogant as to say well if the
electricity goes out does that mean I
shouldn't buy a vacuum cleaner hey news
flash here Adam or electricity is
required to use a vacuum cleaner but the
Internet is not required to play games
that don't require the internet mmo's
multiplayer plenty of single-player
campaign games and a plenty of games
don't even have an online mode but
you're gonna require it so that
statement that you said what they're
just made you look like a complete
douchebag
someone said what if you live in a rural
area you've had the opportunity to live
in some of the greatest populations of
the United States Los Angeles San
Francisco currently he's in Seattle so
you've had the luxury of dealing with
great internet connection
try living in someplace out in Kentucky
or Tennessee or Virginia where you live
in the boonies and you don't have access
to high-speed Internet news flash here
Adam worth 40% of the United States does
not currently have access to high-speed
Internet so when someone asked him about
that he says well why would I want to
live there
really really so now you're gonna go as
far as to say that you require an
internet connection but if you live in a
shitty area where the internet
connection just is not that great tough
too bad you can't play your console
because you're not connected to the
Internet
now Microsoft came out today with a
statement saying that Adam orth is not a
PR spokesman for Microsoft that
Microsoft's views and opinions are not
in line with Adam or the any tweets that
he says publicly are his in his own and
do not represent that of Microsoft of
course they declined to talk about
anything with the new Xbox console and
whether or not it would require an
always-on internet connection and stated
that they were no longer interested in
discussing the matter any further now
I've got a little word of the wise for
Microsoft Adam orth has single-handedly
taken the microsoft studios name and
just drag it through the dirt as well as
every other gamer on the face of this
planet this whole situation is trying to
be played down by Adam orth and this one
of the other guys in these tweets saying
that hey hey hey we're friends we were
just trolling each other don't worry
about it guess what if you're a
high-ranking official a large
corporation like Microsoft you are
always under the microscope everything
you say is gonna be taken as gospel and
it's gonna be taken as words that
represent the company you work for
because we as gamers are not gonna
tolerate this
if you think that always-on internet
connection is just that important to you
and as we as consumers should just deal
with it
my name is Jason this is my xbox and
this is my old rusty pokey thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
