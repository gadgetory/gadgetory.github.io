we're gonna have a basic chat just you
and me just all 392,000 of you and one
of me we're gonna talk now all talk at
once for the love of God please don't do
that
BB GA approached me and asked if I
wanted to do a review of their brand new
gtx 980ti kingpin edition and i said
sure but before I do that there's a
video I have to make before this review
makes any sense and that was the fact
that I am going to talk about ASIC
quality what it means why it matters
should it matter and should you even
care whether you're looking for a pump
reservoir custom GPU block or a complete
loop and a box alpha cools wide range of
products can make your next water
cooling adventure an easy one click the
link in the description for more details
now the reason why I'm going to do that
and I told them I was going to do that
before I did this review it's because
EVGA is doing something that I don't
think any other manufacturer has done up
until now which is bending that
particular GPU price point based on ASIC
quality now that's got a lot of people
really confused a lot of people don't
know what it means and if you do a
simple Google search typically all you
find our forums tons and tons of people
arguing with each other about what it
really means and why it matters so today
I'm going to give you my opinion about
it which I'm going to try and load it
with as much facts as possible and keep
as little opinion out if or as much
opinion out as possible
but at the end of the video hopefully
you can determine whether or not it's
something you should even care about
okay so ASIC quality what does a sixth
and four and we're not talking about the
shoes here we're talking about ASIC a s
IC or application-specific integrated
circuit basically anything with any sort
of a processor in it - whether it be big
small if not it basically isn't it is an
ASIC it is an application-specific in
this case a graphics processor unit or a
CPU being a CPU or a microprocessor
inside of a TV or hell even if you have
a smart toaster it could have an ASIC
quality basically it means it is a
specific application with an integrated
circuit so if it's electronic it applies
with ASIC but people get really caught
up on that simply because of the fact
that GPU quality and ASIC quality over
the last couple
years has been something that's been on
people's minds because gpu-z
which is a program that will tell you
all about your GP you included a little
button that lets you scan your ASIC
quality and it will tell you exactly
what your quality is that's got people
kind of freaked out by oh my god mine's
only fifty eight percent what does that
mean now the folks are going haha I've
got a 79 percent ASIC quality so clearly
my GPU is superior it's one of those
things where unfortunately the
Internet's being the internet is full of
misinformation so today we're going to
try and do the best we can to iron some
of this out so you guys can understand
the review that I'm going to do soon
about this card because inevitably
there's gonna be tons of questions about
the ASIC quality now GPUs and CPUs and
anything with the processor is made out
of a silicon wafer which is basically
really fine sand and it's a little bit
more complex than that anyway it's a
very intricate piece of material that
gets cut up into lots of little pieces
it's one big circle that gets cut into a
ton of little circles and those little
circles become your GPU die or your CPU
die or whatever and each one of those
have imperfections there is no such
thing as a perfect silicon wafer and all
of them have different unique
imperfections kind of like fingerprints
so what happens is you're going to have
varying qualities of perfection now ASIC
quality is not applying to the entire
GPU and that seems to be what gets
people freaked out they think the entire
graphics processing unit which is made
up of a die it's made up of traces it's
made up of VRAM VRAM chips or HBM now
you've got your VRMs in there you've got
your chokes capacitors you've got a lot
going on in this thing now the entire
package here is called a GPU but the
only thing ASIC quality really applies
to is the dye or the silicon that makes
up the actual processing unit inside the
core of the GPU so don't think ASA
quality means that your GPU as a whole
is going to overclock better that's myth
number one we've got to throw right out
the window
now ASIC quality basically is saying
that the dye itself is performing at a
certain percentage level of what would
be considered perfect now we already
know there's no such thing as perfect
wafer because I already said that and
this is on the internet so it has to be
true
now every time a wafer is cut into those
tiny little dyes that make their ways
into our GPUs they are given an ASIC
value now that value tends to freak
people out because if you look up the
basic definition of ASIC wala T it's
going to tell you a percentage of
performance based on what's considered
ideal now does that mean that if you
have a 75% ASIC quality in your GPU that
you're only getting 75% of the
performance that you should get out of
that GPU absolutely not because
obviously as these things are
manufactured they are going to be their
performance values for the GPUs are
going to be placed well below where a
hundred percent would be because as I
said there's no such thing as a hundred
percent perfect piece of silicon now
we're going to take the focus simply on
two GPUs because as I said gpu-z is what
caused all of this discussion in the
first place now that number that
percentage number does not mean
percentage of performance in terms of
overclocking not at all people seem to
think if they have a higher ASIC quality
graphics card that that means they have
much more overclocking Headroom or
they're going to overclock better than
say a card that's at 65% or 71% that's
not the case and that's the confusion I
think a lot of people have with EBG A's
ASIC binning thinking that oh well the
80% plus is going to clearly overclock
better not at all the only thing you
really need to be concerned with with
ASIC quality on GPUs is the fact that
it's going to have to do with
temperatures and voltages they're all
going to pretty much achieve right
around the same core clock in fact an
80% plus may not even overclock as far
as something that's say a 70% plus
because there's more factors involved
with this now I don't know exactly why
EVGA did the ASIC bidding process I'm
fairly certain it has nothing to do with
overclocking potential because they also
know that ASIC quality has nothing to do
with overclocking it has to do with the
efficiency of the GPU because a card
that has a higher ASIC quality is going
to achieve the same clocks as one that
has a lower ASIC quality at much lower
voltages because you're going to have
less voltage leaking lower ASIC quality
GPUs tend to have more voltage leaks
which means that you're going to have to
bump up the voltage higher to achieve
the same level of performance
a card that has a higher ASA quality
that does not mean they're going to
overclock farther at all in fact if you
have a high ASIC quality card most of
the time it's better to do your
overclocking leaving the voltage of
stock because if you bump up that
voltage even small increments it tends
to freak out the core a little bit more
because it's getting a lot more voltage
bump than say a card that has a lower
voltage or lower basic quality now I
know that may not make a whole lot of
sense especially when you'll hear things
like things that are 70% plus are better
for air cooling and things that are
under 70% Plus are better for water
cooling now is that to say that you
shouldn't water cool an ASIC card that's
above 70% absolutely not you're still
going to get even better temperatures on
water cooling a card above 70
considering the fact that it's going to
be using less voltage so the benefits of
getting a card with a higher ASIC
quality is going to come all the way
down pretty much to efficiency and
temperatures lower voltages required on
your GPUs especially if you have
multiples of them it's going to be
easier on your power supply unit it's
going to easier on your system with less
temperature and it's going to be easier
on the core itself and the air cooler
built onto the card because there's
going to be less voltage in heat and TDP
to have to dissipate when it comes to
that cooler I think the only caveat to
what I've said though is that Vince aka
kingpin the guy who you know actually is
names on the Cardinal would say that
when it comes to ln2 overclocking and
super high voltages and ASIC quality
matters more and that might be true
because as you bump up higher voltages
the more leaks there are the more bleed
over and frequency talk there's going to
be across componentry which can
definitely affect the max over clocks so
if you were going for a super high
overclock 2 volts or 2 point one volts
or however far he's taken his cards then
the amount of leaking at a lower ASIC
quality card could affect like I said
crosstalk between components so a higher
ASIC quality at that level might matter
but for you or me or the average guy
that's not going on and going out and
soldering you know custom v RMS and ln2
cooling our stuff it's really not going
to matter a whole lot
so in conclusion and hopefully this puts
some of this to bed at least of the
thousands of people that have watched
this video compared to the millions of
people out there that on the forums that
are just kind of read
hating things they've heard and have no
idea what they're even talking about is
the fact that ace equality really has to
do with lower temperatures and same
performance
now with GPU boost 2.0 you might find a
card with higher ASIC quality getting a
little bit better boost which tends to
lead people to thinking the overclock
better simply because lower voltages and
lower temperatures would lead GPU boost
to have a little bit more Headroom than
say a card with lower ASIC quality
reaching a lower clock at the same
temperature so there you go guys that's
pretty much it I hope this has helped I
know this wasn't too fancy of a video
but it was a discussion worth having and
one that I told EVGA I had to have with
you guys just you and me before we even
went into that video because of the fact
that the point of discussion I think is
going to get lost on the performance of
this card and it's going to be all about
the ASIC quality binning maybe we'll see
more companies doing that in the future
I don't know but there's no way of
knowing what your ASIC quality is going
to be even from EVGA because member
they're brackets
it's like 71 to 74 or whatever it might
be when you buy cards from other
manufacturers you never know what you're
going to get and if you have multiple
GPUs like I do I got lucky with a 72 73
and 74 if I had say a 67 a 75 and a 79
then I would have had to have
overclocked all three of them
independently instead of having a one
overclock applied to all three of them
because the voltages and frequencies
would have varied between all three of
them too drastically with ASIC qualities
that far apart
I hope this videos made sense I hope I
didn't confuse you further I have a
tendency of doing that sometimes people
they might come up to me and be like hey
Jay I love your videos and I'm like cool
and they want to chat and then they
asked me about overclocking or something
and then by the time we're done talking
they're like he said words and stuff I'm
making on out of here guys will see this
review coming soon of the 980ti kingpin
Edition and as always thank you for
watching we'll see you next
