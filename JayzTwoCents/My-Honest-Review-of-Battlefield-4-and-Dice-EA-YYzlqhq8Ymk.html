ahead and get right into it
you're watching the gameplay that I use
for some of the bugs I showed in the bug
video that you guys really seem to
either love or hate which is perfectly
fine I'm not really too concerned about
how you feel about that video the video
was mostly a joke some you took it
serious and well shame on you but anyway
let's go ahead and talk about my honest
feelings on battlefield 4 let's go ahead
and just say I absolutely love the
Battlefield franchise I've been playing
Battlefield since 1942 ten years ago and
I have played every iteration of
Battlefield including every expansion
pack that's ever been seen in this
franchise in ten years so for you to say
I don't like Battlefield it's just
ludicrous and asinine I and I'm gonna
just throw that out there if you hear
anything other than I love Battlefield
then you simply are not listening now
there's a lot of things I really do like
about Battlefield 4 I do like the
killcam that you can see right here I
don't really care that they're glowing
orange like this it seems very left for
deadish to me I'm not too much into that
I do like the integration of the map for
second monitors or iPads or whatever I
love the fact that they brought
commander mode back commander was really
fun in battlefield 2 and and the other
iterations of battlefield that used
commander mode it was really kind of fun
I do like the weapons changes that
they've made there seems to be a lot
that are balanced going on they had you
know all of battlefield 3 to figure that
one out
I don't like the fact that there was you
know pretty much day 1 dlc if you
pre-ordered and we'll talk about
pre-ordering again in a minute here
there there is really good things about
the game if you're into vehicles there's
even more vehicles there's brand new
really weird-looking jets but new jets
new choppers and if the fact you have a
three-way battle now going on you have a
Chinese the Russians and the Americans
that's really cool I like the fact that
there's kind of a trifecta going on
there I do like how they made the game
feel fairly balanced
off the start I mean I had a hard time
using some of the starting weapons but
you know that changes throughout the
game now let's go ahead and talk about
oh and the graphics I don't know why
some of you said I thought the graphics
sucked in the other game what I said was
or in the other video what I said was
they don't really look that much better
to me than battlefield 3 which already
looks freakin amazing I love the
graphics in battlefield I'm a graphics
whore and it's what's always drawn me to
the game that and the realism now let's
go ahead and talk about the bugs and
let's talk about what you as gamers
should honestly care about now before
you try to explain to me how software
development works and how software
releases work know this if you've been
following me along enough you know I
work in IT but you may or may not know
that I'm also an sqa which is a senior
Quality Assurance agent for the same
company I do IT for managing releases
and writing off and signing off on code
and PBIS and api's and other proprietary
written software that we sell to
companies that they use for and lease
off of us that end up managing millions
and millions of dollars worth of
transactions on a daily basis if our
software is buggy and doesn't work
it literally means life or death for
various companies I'm not gonna give
their names or the name of my company it
is a big deal software development I
understand it not talking out my ass
here when it comes to software
development now for bugs
one thing I'm about to point out here in
just a moment in this video I'm gonna
try and walk and I'm gonna get stopped
by a cardboard box now in battlefield 3
all the cardboard and the debris on the
ground was interactive you could move it
but as you can see in this video right
here I can't move this box so I get hung
up on it so you find yourself getting
kind of hung up on things in the game
all the time that kind of gets you
killed because you have obstructed
movement because of you know cardboard
nailed to the ground that's a minor
thing but it just makes me wonder why
they went that route cuz clearly they
changed it now I hear a lot of you in
the other videos saying hey just stop
being stupid and say hey the games go
and get fixed later on so stop
complaining like a mama's boy first of
all let's go ahead and talk about the
concept of releasing a broken product
what sense does that make
as a dice developer if I was a dice
developer and I have EA managing my
publish the publication of my software
I want EA to be in my best interest not
pressured me to meet a hard deadline if
you know anything about software
development you know hard deadlines are
rarely hard they are constantly dynamic
and moving based on things that happen
along the software path in the
development timeline there is no such
thing as a definitive set date that
being said the rumor has it that dice
requested another month from EA EA said
no we have to beat Call of Duty we have
to get it out before call of duty and
that really didn't work out too good for
them did it because they ended up
releasing a very buggy product and by
buggy I don't mean there are you know
the guy that got sucked up into the vent
or the fact that I got stucked on a
cardboard box or there's some glitches
with drivers or any of that I'm talking
about serious bugs here people getting
kicked out kicked to desktop after
kicked to desktop after kicked desktop
if you actually played an own
Battlefield 4 on PC you know exactly
what I'm talking about I'm not
complaining about the sound turning off
I'm not complaining about any of them
I'm talking about legitimate kick to
desktop crashes of the game crashes in
both campaign and on multiplayer not
acceptable under any circumstances
because this product should be released
in a I am even willing to say a semi
working state where you're not
constantly being kicked out of the game
the problem is EA wanted to be Call of
Duty and all they ended up beating them
too was the headline of being a buggy
game now if if EA had given dice the
extra month that they requested and
needed to polish the game these are not
huge bugs these are gonna be things
that's easy for them to fix in a hotfix
patch coming out here probably in the
next week or two if they had given them
the extra month that could have been
addressed and taken care of these bugs
are known to have been out all the way
back to the demo back in III have we
forgotten about that did we forget about
the crash demo in III that required them
to restart because there was no sound
come on guys this isn't new stuff the
betta even showed that there was lots of
problems and did anyone really think
that a betta that came out October 1st
was really gonna fix all of these
problems by October 29th in software
development that is not realistic not
speaking out my ass here this is my
real-world career experience speaking
here now if they had given guys the
extra month that they needed Call of
Duty would have beaten them to the
release and they could have given
battlefield the time or diced the time
to polish battlefield so that they could
counter Call of Duty's massively
horrible launch and damaging reputation
now to call of duty for how bad ghosts
have turned out to be they could have
been said look at battlefield look at
how great our product is but instead
they've joined them in the ranks of
shitty software release practices once
again have we forgotten about SimCity
has it been that long that we forgot
what EA is truly doing to these software
development companies I say shame on
dice and I say dice can eat shit because
they even teamed up with EA that to me
was like a death sentence to dice and I
hope to god dice gets the freedom that
they need to make the game right you
can't spend 60 bucks or god forbid some
of you spent 120 dollars or more for
digital deluxe editions and premium and
all of these other add-ons on day one
for buggy software stop pre-ordering
these games and specifically stop
pre-ordering from EA make them earn your
money do not give it to them before they
have even earned it otherwise they have
no reason to do a good job they have
your money before they've even proved to
you that they deserve your money they
don't deserve your money you shouldn't
be grateful that they've released a
buggy game to you you should be mad as
hell and you should demand that this
type of thing not happen EA is
destroying franchises they've destroyed
two games
I absolutely have loved SimCity played
it since the beginning and I've loved
Maxis and battlefield is next on their
list to just have nothing but a
tarnished name because of their really
shitty publication practices I don't
know what it is with EA and I don't know
where over the last couple of years they
made the wrong turn but I pray that they
get it right for the sake of gamers on
any platform if there's any message that
you hear from me tonight let it be that
these developers and these publishers
have to earn your money they don't get
to just say hey guys
guarantee your copy because to them that
really means hey guys guarantee our
income we don't need to make you a great
product on day one we'll fix it later in
patches if you went and bought a car in
the salesman said yeah there's problems
with the engine and there's problems
with the transmission and you know the
this wheel is square it probably should
be round but this wheel is square and
it's brand-new but we'll fix it in a
month with a patch are you gonna say
okay cool
yeah we'll fix it under warranty in a
month are you gonna say yeah give you
that car I'll see you in a month in the
meantime I'll just deal with the issues
or are you gonna say see you later get
it right and maybe I'll be back as
gamers that's what we need to do you
need to send the message with your
dollars because that's all EA cares
about and EA is a plague to gamers let
that be the only message did you hear
tonight for the love of God stick
together on this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
