know what's cool about having such a big
YouTube audience is the fact that you
guys give me an endless supply of
content topics you know when you're an
advanced user like myself sometimes you
realize that you are beyond the basics
and sometimes you forget to start where
the basics are and so I'll do something
and then I get a lot of questions about
why I did it and although it makes
perfect sense to me and more advanced
users those who don't have a lot of
experience with different configurations
are probably scratching her head going
well why did he did that did did due to
that whatever why do you do that
Moz we're gonna talk about today because
you guys have seen me do it multiple
times where I put a power supply in a
case with the fan facing up like this
and that always leads to a ton of
questions about why I did that
with its unique freeform modular system
the new master case maker 5 from cooler
master allows unparalleled flexibility
with the suggestible internal layout and
exterior customization options learn
more about how you can start customizing
your own case by following the link down
in the description it's perfectly
reasonable that you would ask me why I
would mount the power supply with the
fan facing up because most people would
think well you know if you face it down
and you're using the vent in the bottom
of the case like this and when you put
this in here the power supply is going
to become its own little environment
where the air comes into the bottom goes
to the power supply comes out and
nothing that happens inside the case is
going to be affected by what the power
supply is doing because remember air in
has to equal air out otherwise you're
going to have negative pressure if you
have more air coming into the case and
what's going out that's positive
pressure which is actually ideal because
you force air to go out of cracks and
crevices rather than being pulled in
which is going to limit your dust intake
so then it seems perfectly reasonable
that when you do this and you flip the
power supply over you are adding another
exhaust fan effectively to the system
that's gonna be pulling air from in the
case which means you need more intake to
account for that well guys there's a few
situations here where you would want to
mount the power supply up now the first
one being I'm going to reference my
friends bill but I did in my last video
where you guys asked me again for about
the millionth time and I should have
done this video a long time ago I
apologize for taking so long
the reason why I mounted it up was he
tends to put his computers on carpet he
doesn't have a very big desk and he puts
his computer down on carpet he's got
nice thick plush carpet a heavy computer
it squishes down and then this intake
starts to get choked off now he could
have easily done something like got a
piece of wood or a piece of Becca even a
leftover shelf from like IKEA furniture
put that underneath it and then the
carpets no longer a factor since I had
no idea what he was going to be doing
and it was a surprise I went ahead and
counted for the situation I knew existed
now lo and behold since I gave him that
system he thinks it's so pretty he wants
it on display
he has since cleared off a spot on his
desk and now it's on his desk but
fortunately his power supply and a lot
of modern power supplies now are very
very efficient the fans run at a very
slow speed and some guys even like this
1200 master watt here from coolermaster
a lot of EBG a power supply's Corsair
power supplies the fans don't even turn
on unless they exceed a certain
efficiency threshold a power draw which
means they're going to be unaffected by
any of being happening in the system and
they're not going to affect anything
happening in the system unless you're
really pushing your power supply to its
limit so that's another reason why it's
good to get a bigger power supply than
you think you're going to need but
that's a topic for another video another
reason why I would recommend mounting
the power supply up like this if you are
not even mounting it on carpet is if you
only have one exhaust fan a lot of older
cases only have one exhaust fan or maybe
two exhaust fans and it's okay to have a
neutral pressure and I actually
personally go for a neutral pressure I
don't like to have positive pressure
because it could lead to slight fan
noise coming out of correct cracks and
stuff and I like to have neutral
pressure so if I feel like I can balance
out the airflow by letting the power
supply as fan pull some of that air out
then I'll do that not to mention it's
also going to get a much cooler supply
of air pulling it from inside the case
then having it down here on the bottom
because you could end up with this bit
of a loop here where it pulls air into
the bottom exhausts it and then it's
pulled back in and it just cycles
through and it starts to warm up over
time so this is actually the coolest
config both in just kind of looks and
you know pure functionality that was a
joke is a bad one I get it this is
actually one of the cooler methods here
for your power
supply okay so then when would you mount
it down well I think most people by
defaults are going to mount it down but
sometimes you're forced to do that like
in the NZXT case over here where a lot
of cases are now implementing this bit
of a shroud right here to kind of neat
things up so you don't see any of the
wires and such now when you do this
you're pretty much forced to mount it
down because as you can see the intake
is on the bottom there it's filtered and
that's the only place it's going to be
able to really draw cool air from
otherwise the fan is going to be right
up against the bottom of this shelf here
if you will and then it's going to be
kind of kind of getting choked off now a
lot of cases though do have kind of a
stilt system in there where the power
supply sits on some pretty thick feet so
there's a gap before the bottom of the
case and the reason why a lot of
companies do that is if you do put the
case on carpet and it squishes it's not
going to choke off the power supply but
if you have a big enough gap to it means
it's gonna be pulling air from inside
the case anyway so even if it is mounted
down it still could have some effect on
the air pressure inside your case now
lastly that I'm gonna be talking
strictly to the water coolers here if
you are water cooling your system it's
good peace of mind to mount it face down
if you can because if you do accumulate
some sort of a drip or a leak god forbid
it drips inside your power supply while
it's on which could lead to very bad day
very bad day so if you mount it down
it's just a little bit extra peace of
mind that it's gonna drip on a solid
piece of metal and it really has to work
its way in there rather than just going
hey just pour your sugar on me yeah it's
an 80s joke it's an 80s rock band thing
you're probably some of you probably too
young to get it but anyway that's kind
of it it's really that simple a lot of
people want to make a big deal about
mounting it face up going oh my god
you're going to pull in all kinds of
dust you're going to just wreck the air
flow in your system it really depends on
your power supply to how efficient it is
what kind of fan is in it what speed the
fan spins at a lot of these power
supplies just don't spin very fast and
not fast enough to have a big enough
effect on your system and if it does
well then try and balance it out with
fan controllers and make your intake
fans run faster or your exhaust fans run
slower like in the instance of my
friends system where I have the 3 120
millimeter exhaust fans on the
plus the 120 exhaust fan in the rear
plus the fan facing up on the power
supply with only 200 or - 140 millimeter
intakes people were freaking out that I
created a negative pressure situation
which we would be true if I ran all the
fans at 100% but I do balance out
pressures the predator is only running
at about 50% fan speed at max because
it's overkill for the CPU this power
supply fan barely even turns on and I do
have the 140 s running at 100% where the
rear exhaust fan is also running at 50%
so there's some balance there anyway
guys I hope this has clarified some of
that I apologize that sometimes I forget
to start simple and start at the basics
because I've been doing this a long time
and I have to be reminded that sometimes
I have to start at the beginning and
keep it simple and hopefully this video
has helped you understand power supply
orientation not its sexual orientation
thanks for watching
share this video with someone you think
it'll help and as always I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
