it is a beautiful sunny Saturday morning
here in Southern California so I figured
why not take this opportunity to go
ahead and bring you guys a head-to-head
no-holds-barred comparison between two
different water cooling products here to
see which one is can you get 10% off
anything from Coolermaster at the CM
store see the description for details
now as you guys know I recently put the
EKF sea water block on my massively
overclocked GTX 780 now alpha cool who
happens to be one of my sponsors through
the aqua tuning sponsorship said hey why
don't you go ahead and take our water
block technology that you did a video on
a few months back and go ahead and do a
comparison video with the EK FC to see
if what they claim is accurate remember
guys on that video I showed you that
they do spot cooling here with a lot of
little blocks rather than doing a solid
piece of metal in order to cut down
costs now avec ole claims of jail
actually sacrificed any cooling capacity
by doing it this way so that's what
we're gonna find out today we're gonna
put these two blocks head-to-head and
find out just which one is king now a
couple of things I want to let you know
here first we are gonna be doing this in
my gaming rig right here which is my
3770k overclocked as well as my GTX 780
which is BIOS hacked voltage hacked and
overclocked I'm gonna be doing this test
in two ways I'm gonna be doing a stock
speed on this gtx 780 and then we are
gonna do max overclock at 1.3 volts on
the graphics card to pump as much heat
as we can into these blocks and see
whether or not it brings either of these
two blocks to their knees so just to
recap stock speed comparison overclock
speed comparison and then we're gonna go
ahead and take a look at the
temperatures and see just which one is
king now while I'm in there I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid about white tubing as
well it's kind of dated it's getting
stained on the inside and I'm gonna go
ahead and put some black tubing in there
so that we can just go ahead and make
the system look a little bit better I
figured since I have to tear the system
apart twice to do this video I might as
well go ahead and do it while I'm in
there so without further ado let's go
ahead and start
get in our numbers start tearing this
thing apart and we'll come back and find
out exactly which one is king now let's
be honest when it comes to water cooling
your computer the looks of the water
block are very important to most of us
and I think the EK water block is the
clear winner when it comes to aesthetics
now the black alpha cool water block
isn't so bad but the clear one is just
atrocious and I made that very clear in
my review it does have a pretty decent
looking backplate unfortunately it
wasn't compatible with my 784 cooling
we're going with a quad and a triple
radiator from alpha cool so I want to
make that clear so you know what kind of
radiator space that we have now as
mentioned I did run into a compatibility
issue with the backplate and my 780 so
for the purpose of this test it's not
being used however it's just an
aesthetic thing and it doesn't really
affect performance whatsoever also keep
in mind that the back plates are not
going to be included in the price review
when we look at the comparison of price
at the end of this video now when it
came to doing testing I decided to go
ahead and just load up battlefield 4
instead of doing looping synthetic
benchmark testing because this is a more
real world experience now first up we
have the Alpha cool MV XP 780 and idle
temperatures on this we're pretty good
they idled at 26 degrees Celsius and
that is nearly ambient temperature if
you take a look at the graph now when it
comes to low temperatures it loaded out
at 35 degrees Celsius with all stock
settings remember we're testing this
first with stock settings and then we'll
go ahead and bump it all up into my max
overclock to compare now these
temperatures are pretty damn good
considering what the block is made out
of so how did it compare to the EK full
copper water block i mean the entire
water block is metal so idle
temperatures on the EK FC were 24
degrees Celsius that's too less than the
alpha cool and low temperatures here at
stock speeds for the 780 kept out at 33
degrees Celsius so you can see here we
were pretty much a 2 degree Celsius
Delta between both idle and low temps on
the stock speeds 782 degrees Celsius
between these two blocks was actually
kind of surprising I mean I know that
alpha cool is advertised that they were
pretty much comparable when it came to
cooling capacity but I was I'm a firm
believer that a solid piece of metal is
better and wood
better overall so two degrees Celsius
difference between both of these blocks
really did surprise me now how does it
do when we pump 1.3 to 5 volts at it
with my max hacked volt 780 now once
again the idle temperatures was 26
degrees Celsius on the Alpha cool MV XP
and that's pretty much because the clock
at idle turns all the over clocks off so
I expected the temperatures to pretty
much be the same but when it came to 1.3
5 volts at 1385 megahertz we were
capping out at 44 degrees Celsius now
that's pretty amazing for one reason in
particular before we even compare that
to the EK water block is that as roughly
half the temperature of what the air
cooled 780 was doing with the blower
style cooler so already no matter what
you're comparing it to the low
temperatures overclocked
compared to the stock air cooling
already proves it's worth regardless of
what you're comparing it to alright but
enough of the blah blah blah how did it
compare to the full Copper full cover EK
water block well EK idled at 24 degrees
celsius and we already explained why
it's idling at the same template was
prior to overclock but the low
temperatures on the EK were 40 degrees
celsius now that's a 4 degrees celsius
Delta between the NV XP block and the FC
block now I think that could be pretty
much because of the fact that it just
when all of the metal is touching each
other it gives a wider surface area to
just distribute that heat over giving
you better overall cooling and and as
the coolant is flowing through the block
it's touching most of that metal
allowing for better heat transfer now
let's go ahead and talk about the 4
degrees Celsius Delta is that gonna make
any difference in the overclock in your
block absolutely not it's 44 degrees
Celsius really good compared to 40 both
temperatures are great 4 degrees Celsius
cooler is awesome but you're not going
to have any additional length of life
you're not gonna have any additional
overclocking capability with only a 4
degrees difference in the Delta now
let's go ahead and talk about the next
aspect of this test which is just as
important as the temperatures and that
is going to be the cost because you see
the NV XP water block costs 84 dollars
on average here in the United States
now the EKF city water block the nickel
version that I'm using it is about 118
dollars average here in the United
States so you're talking 1/3 extra cost
over the NV XP now which should she
choose and why well personally I'm still
gonna run the e KFC water block has
nothing to do with the fact that it was
sent to me for review I've been buying
ek blocks as long as I've been water
cooling my graphics card but if you're
the kind of guy that cares more about
aesthetics and the way it looks the ek
water block is gonna probably be the
right pick for you and you'd be the kind
of person who'd be willing to spend 40
extra bucks to have something that just
looks as damn awesome as the ek does but
if you're more of a functional reformed
kind of guy and you don't really care
how something looks as long as the
performance is there then you're
probably gonna be more interested in the
Alpha cool NV XP block because it'll
save you 40 bucks that you can put
somewhere else in your system you'll
have temperatures that are still far
better than any air cooling solution
when it comes to your graphics card and
you're gonna be happy in the end and you
know maybe you're being a little bit
more friendly with the environment
considering no I won't even go there but
anyway when it comes to these water
blocks what do you think we're talking
84 bucks versus 118 and only 4 degrees
difference at overclocked settings and 2
degrees difference at stock settings so
sound off down in the comments which
block do you like and why I appreciate
you guys watching this video as always
follow me on Twitter to give me input on
the things that is that you guys want to
see and as always I will see you guys in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
