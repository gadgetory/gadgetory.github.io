Malone parts of with its adjustable pmw
3367 16000 dpi optical sensor for RGB
zones 9 customizable buttons and
offering both wired and wireless
operation are only a few reasons why the
Corsair dark or RGB should be on your
shortlist for your next Mouse purchase
check out its full list of features by
clicking the link in the description
below ok so the post below imparts have
started to roll in as you get as you
guys know the chassis has already been
revealed you guys can check out that
video here if you guys have not seen
that already but it is time post Malone
had his tour it has completed the whole
tour was done before I even started this
thing but whatever he's on his way to
Europe right now I got to go to the
Hollywood Bowl and check out his concert
and I got a lot of really good
motivation out of that but now we can
start building this bitch so obviously
we're doing an X 299 system here asus
has provided the rampage 6 extreme and
the same one I have used in my personal
rig and I like I like it it's a good
board so that's why we're using it lots
of RGB features and stuff we also have
provided by Intel a 79 40 X this is a 14
core 28 thread processor that way he can
do things like his gaming his
live-streaming if he wants to do music
production you can do anything
productivity on this and still kick ass
while gaming a lot of blazing fast SSDs
nvme SSDs provided by a data some really
kick-ass memory we'll take a look at
this here it's gonna match the theme
perfectly from g.skill no it's not the
Royal RGB which I was really hoping for
but they couldn't get the other it's not
manufactured in time these are all of
our custom cables from singularity
designed specifically in this case for
this case to route properly in the
channels this over here is probably one
of the most exciting parts we're gonna
look at today these are the custom wood
built pieces from ek water blocks we
took a look at that at Computex I said I
need it I need it now you're gonna get
it to me and Eddie was like I'll do what
I can and I was like you're gonna do it
no I didn't really go that way but you
know I said can you guys please get this
done it would
the theme perfectly with the curly maple
that is built into the headstock on the
back of the case they stepped up they
got it done and then this over here is
radiators and I've got more odds and
ends now this is gonna be part one
there's going a multiple part bill
because there are still parts I'm
waiting on but the first thing I have to
do is make sure everything works so
we're gonna take the CPU the rim the
motherboard and the Titan XPS and we're
gonna make sure everything works and
once it does we're gonna build it so
this cluster F of mess right here is me
bench testing I've got the new Titan XP
in there this one we've got two of them
obviously but we've used this on a test
bench for a little while now we know
this one works so I'm gonna be testing
that one the RAM unfortunately they sent
me the wrong Ram they sent me the white
sniper X which is not what I ordered it
ordered the black and yellow which
obviously would mix perfectly with this
build so we'll get that replaced but we
can still make sure all the channel
slots work
we got the 79 40 X in there the EVGA
1000-watt platinum - or the 1000 P -
power supply am going to be checking the
cables that were custom-made for this
build fingers crossed that this is going
to work fine it's like I'm gonna do a
quick CMOS clear never hurts it's gonna
get out of the way now all right moment
of truth where the power button does
nothing okay we'll be back so we might
have a pin problem here there might be
some pin egde so I'm gonna test this
with real quick is I'm gonna unplug the
power supply cables for the CPU and see
if it fires on we might have something
going on here with our CPU power nothing
so now we got to tie the 24 pin it's
working with the 24 pin it might be a
graphics card issue last test see eight
pin so we now have it narrowed down to
the eight pin because we know that the
eight pin the six pin works fine so both
of the eight pins are wired may possibly
wired bad but now we're going to check
it with the stock cable to make sure
it's not the graphics card the eight
pins alright so what we determine by
looking at the schematics is the 312
volt on one side is suppose
to reverse what side it's on on the
opposite we just have to switch the two
outer pins here and sometimes these
could be a pain in the ass I don't think
we're gonna have a problem here
famous last words right okay there's one
there we go and okay we're good there
that's going to VGA so we should get a
image in three two one
and there's VGA cool Phil you did it
high five high five it's my routine guys
okay now we can build it after I fix the
other cable
well I think you guys can see my vision
coming together on this clearly we have
a bit more work to do obviously there's
a lot more custom stuff that's going to
go into this we've got some more
surprises some some things that are
still being custom milled and fabricated
as we speak but as you can see we got
the wood blocks put on the cards we got
our system to bench tested and obviously
we didn't get far as I wanted today
because the amount of time it took for
us to figure out what was going wrong
with the cables but we actually started
wiring the cables into the built-in
cable management on this as well now
Daniel a singularity computers is the
one who did the cables for me so a huge
thank you for that they have to be a
very specific length to be able to
handle the the channel routing and it's
turned out pretty damn good and I only
put one power supply set of cables on
the lower GPU for now it said to figure
out the best way to route that to make
it look good but man does the maple look
amazing on here but I was worried it
would be too much wood ladies I was
worried there'd be too much wood and it
would just kind of detract from the
whole sort of a rustic theme of the beer
bongs and Bentley album you guys saw
that when he had his a little teaser
countdown thing he had that barbed wire
machine kind of going and that was sort
of like a very kind of a dirty piece of
like construction equipment had a very
rustic more of a stressed look to it
which kind of got me thinking I thought
about actually maybe distressing this
case a little bit and I thought nope
with everything seeing early computers
put into this they might have work and
money they put into this case I wasn't
gonna do that but I think it could have
looked amazing so obviously we still
have to do the water cooling loop I'm
just glad to know that all the
components work I think before I plumb
up the water cooling for this and that's
where I definitely want to get custom
with this I think I'm going to also
rigged up a soft tubing external loop
just to plug into the parts to get some
cooling to them to make sure everything
works now that they're in the chassis
I'm sure we've all experienced in the
past before if you've built enough
computers it will work on the box and
then it doesn't work in the case and
it's trying to track down those issues
which can be a complete pain in the ass
but yeah this is the way it's coming
together and it's looking exactly like I
wanted it to and you know I want to talk
about something real quick I got to hang
out with post Malone at his Holly
Boal concert on Wednesday June 27th and
I talked to him specifically about this
this piece right here was a huge point
of contention amongst a lot of viewers
in the last video where I basically
debuted this chassis the two things I
made people mad one what are their only
force drinks guerrilla force dreams
the other one is why are the strings
backwards because I guess the thinner
strings should've been on the other side
or whatever one I didn't put this
together but nor would I have known any
better anyway
when I told post Malone that he kind of
giggles again we're more like a ukulele
and I was like yeah some people got
really like pissed about that he shakes
his head and he goes fuck him so you
guys that one's put to bed obviously
when the man himself says fuck it I
think we're fine
so well we'll get all the wiring done on
this soon as you guys saw to I put one
of the adat SSDs underneath the cover
and then obviously the other two are
gonna go on the dim 2 slot up here next
to the memory so he's going to have 3
terabytes of nvme 2500 megabyte per
second plus read/write speed without
raid I'm not gonna raid it I wanted to
be extremely reliable and simple to use
I don't want to deal with a raid array
coming apart on him but you guys tell me
what you think I think I always take a
risk when I do these builds with a ship
with showing you guys the progress in
between in multiple parts because just
like the thread Ripper build a lot of
people hated it absolutely hated
especially with the weird bends I did
and the super twisted and very ugly
bends on purpose until they saw the
final product and they were like oh that
came together so good same with this see
this one through to the end man I'm
telling you there is no other PC on the
planet that's gonna be like this one not
to mention it's going to a gentleman
that there is no one else on this planet
like him either alright guys until the
next one thanks for watching all right
so the part post
but the but that you ready you ready I
am ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
