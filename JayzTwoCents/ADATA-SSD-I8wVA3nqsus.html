this camera is entirely too high hey
guys Jess you sense here one to kick off
2014 with a giveaway with my friend
Timmy tech TV now we're going to be
doing a collaborative giveaway here
where we want to get you involved in
both of our channels now in order to do
that we are going to bribe you with some
hardware and that is really important no
I'm not giving away these headphones or
headset that i'm using right now this is
a little bit of a teaser of a review
that is coming but we are going to be
giving away three items when we pick in
three winners now this is open to the
entire world but there is some caveats
in there where one if you're in the
United States you win the prize itself
if you're outside of the United States
you're going to win an equivalent gift
card to NCIX when it comes to shipping
and the fact that there's six billion
people in the world and there's only two
of us and it's really expensive to ship
we can't cover everybody so we're going
to be doing a gift card for an
equivalent dollar amount to the prize
you would have one here are the prizes
first place gets to win an sx 900 256
gigabyte SSD from a data that's the same
SSD that I did a review on a little bit
earlier in my channel click this video
that's going to pop up somewhere on this
page if you wanna know more about that
if you win the first place prize but you
are not in the United States you are
going to win an NCIX gift card
equivalent to the amount of that SSD
second place and third place are going
to be winning the same prize which is
the a data superior series s102 Pro 16
gigabyte USB 3.0 flash drive so if
you're in the United States you win the
flash drive if you're outside of the
United States you want an NCIX gift card
equivalent to the value of that prize so
here's what you have to do to win guys
you must be subscribed to jay's two
cents you must be subscribed to Timmy
tech TVs links going to pop up right
down
honey this is hard right down there and
you must comment on both this video and
his video so make sure you do that and
I'm gonna be putting an annotation and a
link to his video and his channel in the
description if you happen to be watching
this on a mobile device so guys good
luck I hope you guys win if you guys are
not in the United States hope you guys
can use the NCAA gift card if not sorry
guys it's a big world out there so let's
kick off 2014 right hope you guys win
name to the gift card or the SSD or the
USB flash drives and as always I'll see
you guys in my next video which won't be
that far away make sure you're doing all
the stuff that we said you have to do in
the rules no cheating if you try and
cheat you will be disqualified I've done
it before and we'll do it again guys
