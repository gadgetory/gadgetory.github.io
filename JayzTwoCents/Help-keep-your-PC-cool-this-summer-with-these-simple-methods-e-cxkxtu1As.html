you're fortunate enough to live in an
area that does not get as hot as Satan's
balls in the summertime in this video
might not apply to you for the rest of
us would live in a hot climate
especially Southern California yes I
know there's hotter places on the planet
guys but this is where I live this is
what I deal with today it's
approximately a hundred degrees
Fahrenheit that is 38 feet and by next
week it's supposed to get up to about 42
seen here that's hot
so I got some tips to help keep your
system nice and cool and running optimal
in the summertime and maybe this will
help you know great it's the best part
right here watch it watch it guys it's
me in Celsius s3 at 6:00 from faculty
vine yeah so but do you know what it
does yeah makes things cool yeah
cooler hey guys this is Austin and today
I am super excited to be doing a video
with the one and only next you sent yo I
am excited man so what are we doing
today we're going to view the Celsius s
36 I get that a lot
hey what's up sure I could give you some
workout tips of tomorrow sound awesome
later
and further
the new Celsius s thirty-six can make
almost anything cooler almost so cool
another reason why I'm using this case
right here is it's not a sponsored video
this is not this was not sponsored by
Coolermaster but it's a case that I'm
using is I think it's a perfect example
of where case designers are moving
towards when it comes to modern case
design and how it can definitely affect
you negatively especially in the
summertime now this is the cooler master
master case six it's pretty neat it's
modular I've done every like showed it
in the bill blog how it works but
unfortunately it's got this really nice
smooth solid front panel so that
obviously doesn't exactly promote the
most positive of airflow well you can of
course make a gap just designed to do
that to create a little bit of a gap on
the side the problem is the air has to
come and do the sides and then make
another 90 and go through a fan filter
and then through the fans and then in
this case through a radiator and then
into the rest of the system by the time
the air goes through all of that it's
lost most of its velocity and with that
it's also its pressure so obviously if
you're not using this case this may not
directly apply to you but the concept
we're going to talk about today can
definitely apply to most cases most
cases on the market unfortunately this
one here has a little flip down face
what that allows me to do is open it up
and get all kinds of extra airflow here
well what if this is next to your chair
or it's in a little cubby and you don't
want this hanging out because you don't
want to bump it with your chair and
break it off unfortunately you can
remove this one and a lot of cases are
now offering removable front doors
either swing all the way around
backwards and then you get what looks
like a more traditional case here so if
you don't have one of these cases that
have a door in the front this is kind of
where you start to apply what we've got
right here is three intakes on the front
on a three sixty millimeter radiator
this right here the mesh fan filter
material although it really helps with
dust it also dramatically reduces air
flow and then keeping things cool
especially in the summertime when the
air is already hot and it doesn't have a
lot of capacity left in it to hold out
air hot air and transfer it away you
need as much volume of air as you can to
kind of make up that difference so what
I would do if it were me I would
literally just remove this thing but it
should be common sense obviously this is
a trade-off here I think
stuff into the system at the clean your
system more often and the possibility of
damaging a fan or your finger or your
ego by sticking a hand or a finger or a
cattail in there don't do that
you got any chicken now what about the
top of the case that's just as important
as the front especially if you're going
for neutral pressure equal air in an
equal air out is going to give you the
most airflow that you possibly can
well at least this case here allows
these little pop up here to get a gap
but again it still has to make these
crazy turns to let the air out okay this
one at least also allows for the removal
of the top panel which I've always felt
was kind of weird it's like magnetic you
can see that there's magnetic and it's
got little tabs
obviously when you remove the top cover
though if you don't have fans feel trees
on the top then yeah you have exposed
fan so you could you know again
accidentally drop something in there
your your cat could go to lay on the top
of your PC thinking there's a cover
because that's what it's used to and it
turns into a cat wood chipper that's
terrible that's terrible example but I
think it applies now this case doesn't
actually have a stamp filter on the top
because it's pretty much meant purely as
an exhaust and it has this solid cover
but a lot of cases these days do have a
fan filter on the exhaust side that's
something you should definitely remove
because it can increase the airflow now
let's next one we're going to show here
I think this next we're going to show
here I think we've all tried at least
once I don't want to drop the paid case
off of the table this thing keeps trying
to jump off the table and I want to turn
into a Linus situation now some folks
will just take the side panel off the
case and call it a day the problem with
that is you just removed all promoted
airflow even if your water cooled like I
am here on the CPU there's things on
here that require air to stay cool not
only your GPU but that has fans can't
promote its own air flow but your RAM
your power delivery your chipset your
hard drives other things require air to
keep them cool so you can't just let the
air come out the side of the case and go
and do its own thing the exhaust fans
are going to get most of its air from
right here on the top of the case
because of the fact that just like water
air wants the path of least resistance
so it'll just kind of come in the top
right here and go out the exhaust band
on the back we'll just pull air from
right here and this air coming in the
front will just go out this way
some air make it to the top but most of
it will go this way there was a side
panel it has no choice but to go to
these exhaust fans running across the
components on the way so if you want to
take your side panel off and you want to
do the ghetto mod well this is what we
suggest she hand me that Becky I don't
mod there check this out we got lucky
with this one this was like 15 bucks at
Lowe's if that vitamin 10 or 15 bucks
it's like the exact size of this case
look at that does that I mean could that
possibly fit any better Nick it's pretty
good well obviously if you do this
you're going to have a lot of dust being
shoved into your system if you live in a
dusty area so Nick had this great idea
and we didn't think about it we're doing
this video so we didn't get to
demonstrate it could actually like gaff
tape on here that screen mesh material
like you would get at Lowe's or Home
Depot area in any hardware store that
you would make a home window screen out
of could put it on here and then or
he'll put on the backside that makes
more sense
tape it to the backside that weight
sucked to the grate and doesn't blow out
put that against your system and well
you've got custom extreme air cooling so
much air flow goes through this though
that the top fans and exhaust fans are
actually spinning all the things I've
mentioned so far with the exception of
the fan had been free right open up your
case a lot better airflow stick a fan on
the side if you have one already that's
kind of taken care of but the next
couple of suggestions might actually
cost us some money
that being putting better fans in your
system most fans that come with cases
are cheap they know people are going to
mostly throw those away and get better
fans so they don't put very good fans in
there so I would recommend going with
fans that are meant for the job
depending on where they go so obviously
I have static pressure fans on the front
of this case because we're pushing
directly into a radiator and then we
have airflow fans 140 millimeter fans on
the three exhausts so these are high CFM
fans the bigger the fan blades the more
CFM but look you Julie Lloyd the
pressure but in a case in terms of air
flow it's all about CFM or cubic feet
per minute so optimizing your fan
placement and also the type of fans that
you're using is key the other thing is
making sure that all of the fans
stations on them you on your case are
utilized a lot of people will just go
with one exhaust on the top and one
exhausting the rear when you could fit
three fans on top they'll put one or two
in the front when they could put three
and then balancing your pressures is
also a big deal
so slowing down the fans on the exhaust
if they have more flow than what's
coming in - making sure you get at least
neutral or positive pressure would be
beneficial you could of course run the
exhaust and balls-to-the-wall but that
you might have negative pressure pulling
air in through the crevices and the
cracks and these vents which will
promote extra dust in the system but not
necessarily give you better cooling so
fan balancing that's a whole nother
video topic but it's something we're
talking about now the last one here is
kind of the most expensive and that
being if your case doesn't have very
good design in terms of air flow it
might be time for a better or bigger
case one designed more for air flow in
mind it maybe has a little bit larger
volumetric measurement inside of the
case because the larger volume at least
of the bigger supply of air available to
the components inside which would give
you less radiant heat for the parts and
they're like too deep you in the RAM in
the motherboard heating up the space
around it have a bigger volume of air to
try and help keep things cool that's a
little bit extreme it's up to you to
decide whether or not a new case is in
order so anyway those are just some of
the basic tips I usually use and utilize
between all my friends and family's pcs
every single summer because every single
summer good time to do tune-up on your
system so my question is do you think I
miss anything or do you think there are
some better suggestions if so put them
in the comments of this video consider
subscribing if you're not already and
with that thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one I do like the
Box fan idea I want to do a video where
we actually test that and see how much
the temperatures came down what you
think it like if you want to see that
yeah I pull the line of sealant that
sounds all hunky-dory but what I don't
have money for a case well I'm glad you
asked because right now with tunnel bear
you can
laughs I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
