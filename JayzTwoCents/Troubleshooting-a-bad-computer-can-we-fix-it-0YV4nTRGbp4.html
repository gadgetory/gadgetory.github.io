know what's really popular right now is
PC building simulator a game I played
actually livestream for three hours and
a lot of people watched it but what was
really intriguing about that for a lot
of people to watch was the fact that
it's like hey you're a PC tech who
builds computers and fixes things all
the time and it was really interesting
to see you do it in a video game
unfortunately things are not always as
easy as a video game so that's why I'm
gonna be playing PC simulator or build
simulator in real life by trying to
figure out what is wrong with my
friend's computer the new dg7 series
cases from EVGA offer PC enthusiasts
more of what they love like tempered
glass side panels vertical GPU mount
integrated RGB control board DG tuner
and an awesome three year warranty to
learn more about the DG seven series of
cases from EVGA head to the link in the
description below now this is one of
those situations where basically the
information I got is you cryptic at best
because I got a it doesn't work we're
not getting video when it did work we
got some weird messages the power button
doesn't work so just one of those like I
don't know what's wrong can you fix it
how much will it cost it's like well I
don't miss it the cost is I don't know
what's wrong so I got to fix it or
figure out what's wrong before I can
tell you what cost before I can even fix
it at the end of the day they might not
even want to fix it it might cost too
much so I don't know what to see so but
like I said what I got for out of them
informational wise was that it didn't
turn on the reason why you've seen these
cables is hanging out the front is
because one thing they did know was
wrong was apparently a roommate or
something accidentally pinched and cut a
wire on the front panel connectors by
putting the case back on wrong or
something and they bought this like
cheap China eBay thing that hangs out
the front which is really awful so I'm
gonna repair the stock one so that we
can get rid of this first thing you
gotta do obviously when troubleshooting
computer is at least try and post and
see if it will turn on so I don't know
if any of these buttons okay so I guess
that one was power so we've got power
the PC is turning on there is that I
don't really know what the specs are on
this computer either so I need to take
off the side panel that is not captive
okay good to know
and right off the bat I can see we've
got well we got a graphics card
obviously it's a Radeon card it's an XFX
card one of the power cables is not even
plugged into it though so feel if you
wanna get in here so we could show that
this is an 8 pin what is this oh they're
SSDs just kind of flop in here okay so
first thing I noticed here is that power
to the graphics card is not complete so
let's go ahead and turn this off this
may not even fix the problem because I
did talk to them on the phone and they
removed the GPU and did a few things on
my suggestions this one doesn't even
click in so I think this was just it
didn't get plugged back in after they
put it back this isn't even like
clicking in there
Wow so our power supply here is an ant X
650 continuous power all right see if
that made any difference this fan isn't
turning so there's that but I think we
just got video that's a good sign so
here's here's a thought of mine here I
just mentioned how hard this was to plug
in and I'm thinking that maybe this
power cord didn't get plugged in all the
way cuz this one I can't really get to
click so if it was like that let's see
if it would start one front fan is not
turning one top fan is not turning one
rear fan is not turning but we still
have video I really didn't want to have
to tell them unfortunately your video
cards bad because this is the worst time
to try and fix that one other thing they
did say was happening that initially
started people getting in here and
poking and prodding was that it was not
booting to two windows so let's see what
happens here see if we get two windows
Oh lunch startup repair ok so we'll let
that go and see what happens obviously
we were having some fails one thing they
were saying though is it was booting to
Windows 7 but they had Windows 10
installed so they were like why the heck
is it booting to Windows 7 as you can
see we are not booting to Windows 10
right now so clearly we have two hard
drives that have an OS partition on it
and it sounds to me like we are dealing
with just we're dealing with the BIOS
not booting to the right drive properly
my sister used to used to crack it
because you actually sprayed my ass like
physically now the reason why I'm
thinking maybe there are SanDisk SSD is
not booting Windows 10 is if you come up
here and look carefully this is
the way it was plugged in like barely
hanging on so this wasn't plugged in all
the way so we're gonna go ahead and just
here we go
it still probably wasn't set to the
right drive in the BIOS let's go ahead
and get it to the BIOS see we can see
the boot order is so we just go over
here to boot you can look at what our
boot options are food option one yeah
cp3 boot option two is our sandesh we
want to set boot one to our SanDisk
complete option three to whatever so
obviously we've got three drives in here
because we do have an optical drive
haven't seen one of those in a while but
we got one so that's gonna be the DVD
ROM and then this GE slot 0 400 and then
we've got of course our 114 gigabyte SSD
so port 5 WDC d 102 I don't even see a
Western Digital Drive in here oh here is
right here weather is that so why is it
so now we're getting a SMART status bad
back up and replace f12 run setup so
here we are in the BIOS fortunately I
know the Asus BIOS pretty well even
though it's an older motherboard so we
could go down to advanced we can go down
to our SATA configuration and smart
status check we can simply just disable
that with it's not something that's
really gonna matter on this person's use
and I think that this will be fine we'll
probably be able to boot up now I'm
almost feeling like I should do sort of
a complete sweep of this computer now
check things like the cooler thermal
paste and all that because obviously
we've had we saw have like three fans
that are not even running right now we
got to figure that out but we should see
n there's Windows 10 so that is now
fixed we're just checking them off the
little list right we're getting to the
point where it says place PC by the door
because you know PC building simulator
reference once again and there we go no
way my luck is probably pass worded and
there it is Mickey why you do this to me
Mickey I wonder if it's no I couldn't
possibly beat Mickey Mouse so now we're
gonna go ahead and tackle the fans and
this is what I found in the back in
terms of wiring so you can see we've got
a lot of adapters going on here
so I think what's gonna be easiest here
is to just kind of unplug all of this
and start all over what I did notice
though is this goes to the rear top fan
that wasn't turning right here this is
why I adapted into this which I don't
even know where this goes I think it
goes up oh this is the rear fan right
here that wasn't turning so these two
were connected together but nothing was
plugged into it supplying power so
there's the reason the back to you
weren't going now we gotta figure out
why this bottom one wasn't turning it's
very possible this fan could just be bad
because this is indeed plugged into this
adapter which was plugged into a molex
and not turning so what I'm gonna do
right now is I'm gonna test that bottom
fan with one of my you guys always asked
me why I had these cheap little whoa I
almost dropped one either garbage anyway
okay people always ask me why I use
these cheap little power supplies the
reason for that is because it's perfect
for testing things like water pumps and
fans I would never ever in a million
years power a computer off of this this
is perfectly fine for fans and stuff and
because I want to make sure that those
fans actually work that will save me a
lot of time oh I think I just figured
out why that fan wasn't running it's
getting tight like this the ground the
ground wire wasn't even pushed in so let
me see if I might have been all we need
to do there we clicked in I have a
feeling I might have repaired this whole
PC without costing them a penny but
there's one other little piece of
information they gave me that has me
extremely concerned we'll talk about
that in a second
first let's see if everything else is
working all right moment of truth
I didn't even touch these power switch
yeah
oh I flipped it from on to off okay they
need to put that in PC build simulator
like remember to flip that switch like
they need to add that looks like all of
our fans are turning we've got video
let's see if we get to Windows it's a
good sign okay Mickey
this one's diesel-powered okay clearly
we have a bad fan in there somewhere so
the list goes on
oh this is the video that keeps on
giving so clearly one of these fans have
a bad bearing it's the rear fan so this
one's got a bad bearing so that's what I
do if I hear a bad fan over here a bad
fan sound like that I just stopped them
with my finger to see which one stops
making the sound so now it's time to
replace replace that fan fortunately we
have a box of just stock case fans we'll
throw that in as a bonus but I guess I
never really mentioned the sound because
the fan was never even running so that's
something they didn't even know about PC
building simulator although very fun
trust me it's fun and I play the hell
out of that game it it would be nice if
it had these scenarios where like maybe
you fix something but then something
else kind of goes wrong mid mid fix
which completely jacks up possibly your
profit margin I have the bearing on this
guy but look how dirty and dusty it is
that's why it's important to keep your
fans clean because believe it or not
these fans are fluid lubricated they get
dust in there they get dirty and then
you get here that I'm gonna fix the
front panel wires I got pinched and cut
you can see it right here they severed
this wire and that's obviously why the
front panel wasn't working they said the
button wasn't working clearly that's one
of the actual circuit complete wires
rather than one of the LEDs so we're
gonna fix that so we're not dealing with
this and then we are going to clean the
system where you give it a good cleaning
at least as best I can
that way when we give it back to them
it's in as best a working order as it
could possibly be so you got figure out
which one's reset and which one is power
obviously because resets the smaller one
power is the bigger so this is
repairable though I they don't have to
run these these crappy little plugs that
they're running so I am just going to go
ahead and strip off a little bit of wire
right here normally I would use normal
strippers I'm just using my side cutters
for this I'm gonna go ahead and cut up
see this is like double pinched you see
I was pinched right there as well snip
that so now we're gonna do this is a
much heavier gauge than we need but I'm
just gonna go ahead and make a piece
about yay big
yeah I actually have a quick stripper
but not here
so I'm just gonna cut off a bunch of
this wire they don't need me it's not
like any voltage rip goes through this
thing this is just completing a circuit
so when you push the power button of the
reset button you're completing a circuit
to the motherboard that tells it this
button was pushed or that button was
pushed
but what we're gonna do we're gonna take
heat shrink normally this would be
soldered
I'm not going to solder it because it's
not gonna really be moving we take our
piece of heat shrink I'm just gonna
twist this together like I said if you
wanted to do this one percent legit you
would then solder this but we're just
gonna be holding it together with the
heat shrink this is not a part that's
gonna be moving and we just need the
heat shrink to keep anything from you
know grounding let me just take a
lighter just go over it slowly don't
want to melt anything and then we melt
the heat shrink well you want up the
heat shrink you want met the wire it's
leaving obviously and then we just do
the same thing over here
and this is technically now repaired all
right so we are just gonna tape it down
so we doesn't actually get pulled on or
yanked on okay moment of truth
Oh would you look at that and they light
up so now they don't have to have this
ugly harness which they recently bought
sorry guys but as you can see now we've
got our lights and our LEDs are working
there's our hard drive light as our
power light good to go
let's button it up let's clean it up and
we'll call it a day
so here we go we're going ahead and
booting it up because we want make sure
when you start messing with stuff that
it's gonna work so we make sure we get
over to our OS all I want to check right
now though is what temperatures look
like CPU is idling at 38 C 37 C in the
BIOS which you know puts a small load on
the CPU and motherboard sitting at 29 C
obviously the case is open but all of
our fans are running now lots of air
flow so I'm gonna go ahead and call this
one done but basically you guys have
always asked me about how to
troubleshoot a computer I started take
you along for the ride
on this one given the limited amount of
information that I had but as you saw we
opened up the case the first thing we
saw was one of the power cables for the
mother with the graphics card was not
plugged in but I also know for a fact
when I help troubleshoot this on the
phone with him that I had him unplug the
graphics card and plug it back in and
thought maybe he just forgot to put that
one in so I'm gonna say that was
probably both plugged in when I first
talked to him but regardless it's
working now all we had to do is replace
one fan which obviously I'm not going to
charge them for and it's up and working
and cleaned and ready to go so this one
worked out well but the next time I have
access to a broken computer I don't want
to say I hope it's worse because I don't
want that person to have to deal with
the cost of fixing it but I do want to
be able to shoot videos about
troubleshooting it anyway guys I'm gonna
go thanks for watching subscribe if
you're new around here like this video
if you appreciated it and as always we
will see you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
