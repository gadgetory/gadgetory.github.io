summertime is fast approaching and
that's the time a lot of people tend to
build their new systems because they get
graduation money or they just have the
summer off they want to entertain
themselves and usually they want to do
it by gaming or upgrading their systems
well today we're going to try and head
off some of those purchases by giving
you guys some information that will make
your purchases hopefully smarter and
more intelligent because today we're
going to talk about something that gets
really overlooked and that is our budget
builds actually worth it with its
aluminum bezel solid construction and
adjustable base the vast 35 inch ultra
wide 100 Hertz VA panel for mass drop
offers performance at an affordable
price learn more about this drop by
following the link in the description
below now budgets what are they a lot of
people take the term budget and
immediately just apply that to mean the
cheapest build possible and although
that can be very true
you can have a $5.00 budget you can have
a 5 trillion dollar budget like
countries have so let's go ahead and
just come up with a universal
understanding of the term budget meaning
you don't have a dollar above your set
spending limit that's what a budget
really is a budget just means all of
your money is allocated towards various
things it has a purpose it's meant to go
in certain areas and then your budget is
then basically budgeted but when it
comes to computers most people just have
a total amount but they don't budget it
to X dollar amount for the motherboard X
amount for the graphics card X amount
for the memory which is how a budget
truly would work but most people don't
do that so hopefully today I can get you
guys thinking in that sense so that you
don't take your budget build and make it
entirely not worth it because you sort
of built it for today and not for the
future and then you're stuck later
having to upgrade by changing everything
out because you made poor choices today
so that's what we're trying to avoid
with this video now what I have right
here are some motherboard examples
motherboards like I said are the easiest
way to over spend a lot of time there's
features on here that you may be paying
for that you're not going to use there
may be features on here that you want
and didn't get because you made poor
budgeting decisions so you can have this
basic board right here which is pretty
much the cheapest intel board you can
get for I think it's what it's 11 5 X a
1156 technically you could you've got 4
channels which is actually pretty decent
on here but
there's not many phases to this power
delivery system you so you couldn't
overclock and stuff with it but you
could put in this technically what like
an 8700 K if you wanted or you could do
the very same thing with this empty box
because there's no motherboard in there
wait right we'll just pretend like that
never happened
let's upside down there we go
the point I was trying to make is both
of these motherboards but the point I'm
trying to make here is that you could
spend 500 plus dollars on a motherboard
and stick an i3 in it these both these
motherboards accept the same CPUs should
you put an i3 in this but now that we
talked about how you can really over you
know buy on your motherboard versus your
CPU talk about the features that exist
on motherboards and where it's ok to
save money this right here is an a320 I
would I would never really buy this even
for Rison because every single Rison
chip whether it be the cheapest one -
the most expensive one is overclockable
we ran Intel it might make sense because
you can get a locked chip on Intel which
is very inexpensive and there's no point
in buying an overclocking motherboard or
not overclocking chip but AMD sort of a
different story because every single
chip is unlocked now what you're gonna
notice here on the build quality between
this guy is the MOSFETs are exposed
there's no active cooling on them the
chokes as well there there's no cooling
on those the MOSFETs up here these
little squares that's the power delivery
system when you hear about phase power
like how many power phases there are
that is it specifically what we're
talking about those get very hot that's
still a bring power to the CPU and
stepping down 12 volt and all of that
but the next step up here with the be
350 you can see we do get a heatsink on
our main phase delivery right there our
power phase delivery still none up here
at the top next to the chokes but at
least a little bit of additional cooling
now both these motherboards look very
similar but they're actually quite
different we already talked about the
heatsink design on the power delivery
but if we look now at the PCI Express
slots you can see that the more
mid-range one has a kind of a metal
reinforcement on there which gives it a
little bit more strength and rigidity
they both have two PCI Express One X on
there this one has an additional slot at
the bottom which is kind of useless
these days which is a standard PCI
nobody really you
PCI anymore on any modern capture card
or whether it be MDOT two slots for PCI
Express or whatever now one thing that
worth noting on here though is this is a
more intelligent design in terms of the
spacing they put one of the 1x above the
graphics card to keep it a capture card
or sound card here and then they spaced
out three or two slots down the other
one that way if you put a graphics card
in here which is a standard two slot you
can still utilize that one problem with
this one here is every single graphics
card is at least two slot now so as soon
as you put in a graphics card this one
becomes useless anyway so this one
pretty much pretend it doesn't even
exists this one shouldn't even exist
ironically though the cheaper
motherboard I think has a better layout
in terms of SATA where they all face the
same direction whereas on this guy here
two of them face up and then two of them
face out which i think is kind of
awkward but another sacrifice you make
because these boards come in 50 bucks 60
bucks range just when you have like as
low as like $40 if you shirt if you
really shop for it they only have two
RAM slots so here's what that means in
terms of future compatibility and where
you could start costing yourself money
now let's talk about where you actually
would end up costing yourself some money
in the future if you ever wanted to
upgrade this system when people are
shopping budget systems they tend to
like I said one ago as cheap as possible
and the cheapest ddr4 you can get now is
8 gigabytes or to 4 gigabyte sticks now
a lot of people would do that because
they want to use dual channel rather
than getting a single eight gay now if
you did that you would utilize both
these slots because there's only two
slots on each of these motherboards
meaning if you wanted to up that Ram
capacity later you've got to buy all-new
Ram if you didn't go with the single 8
gig now depending on what you're doing
you can often get away with single
channel Ram and not really notice any
difference when it comes to gaming and
stuff like that by going with a single 8
gig stick so I'd recommend that if you
have a dual slot board like this or a
dual channel board with only one slot
per channel so make the sacrifice of
dual channel down to a single 8 gig
rather than going with 2 4 gigs if you
think you're gonna upgrade later on
otherwise you're buying all new memory
so here's the ax 370 from Ora so this is
obviously has all the features that you
would want its overclocking capable it's
got passive cooling on all of the power
delivery it's even got a bigger chipset
cooler on here it's got 4 Ram slots so
you want to make the same sacrifice as
we mentioned before you can do 8 gigs
and upgrade to eight gigs later with a
total of four sticks three full-size
piece
Express slots so you can use SLI
crossfire multiple 1x yeah so this one
also has extra features like extra fans
slot our fam headers you can plug in
more fans it's got bunch at the bottom
few at the top it's got a i/o cooler on
there it's got you know surface mounted
buttons for start reset and where as you
can get a board that has similar
features to this for around a hundred to
one hundred and fifteen dollars if you
can use the same motherboard for future
upgrades then it makes sense to spend a
little more now to get this than to
spend a lot less now and get this and
then later have to upgrade the
motherboard and the RAM anyway alright
so let's talk about CPUs this is an area
where I think a lot of people just get
really confused on where they should be
spending their money it depends entirely
on what you're doing with your computer
so if you're just gonna be doing gaming
though you don't need as much CPU power
as you might think this isn't a 371
hundred this is what was kind of
considered like the go to budget CPU
back in the 7 Series and then since then
AMD has really stepped up their game
with like the 2200 G which is what we
have right here but it's really easy to
overspend on your CPU like I said
depending on what your use case is so
you wouldn't necessarily need to buy
something crazy like an I $9.99 hundred
K to play games
unless you're starting to push your
frame rates really high with a very
high-end graphics card so here we have
two different graphics cards that live
on the completely opposite end of the
spectrum the roughly 120 dollar GTX 1050
and the $2,500 Titan r-tx
if you pair this card with a terrible
CPU something like a 70 100 that's would
be an absolutely terrible combo because
what's going to happen is the CPU has to
prepare the frames for the graphics card
the graphics card does all the eye candy
and post-processing and stuff and sends
it off to the monitor if the CPU can't
send the information to the card fast
enough the card has to wait which brings
down your frame rates it goes all over
the place which is a terrible experience
so this pairing would be a whole lot
better because this graphics card is not
going to be necessarily slowed down by
an i3 70 100 quick way to waste your
money obviously would be buying a tight
mix or tightening r-tx altogether in
fact some people are even stupid enough
to put two of them in their system
what so a more logical pairing to either
of these because the 1050 is definitely
gonna start showing its age and more
modern titles like things that have come
out since r-tx has sort of been
announced and developed now like over
the last seven months or so games are
starting to want to utilize more of the
modern technologies that are found in
graphics cards so what I would recommend
is kind of throw both of those to the
side and get something more middle
ground like what we have right here is a
gtx 1660 or you could even pair it with
something like an AMD radeon 590 which
is gonna give you very good 1080p gaming
experience it's gonna be forward
compatible with a lot of modern titles
without feeling like your graphics card
is suddenly becoming what's holding you
back and not only that it's it's fun to
buy a more modern graphics card than
buying an older tier one because there
are options that are available in
current generations without completely
breaking the bank now you might have
noticed a bit of a theme here and that
being not buying the cheapest that's
available because in my opinion that is
the quickest way to overspend on your
system but that's not the easiest way to
overspend on your system let me go and
show you what I mean by that I present
to you the quickest way to overspend in
your budget we're talking about RAM what
we've got right here are two different
sets of RAM ballistics and the Trident
0l so I get I chose two very opposite
ends of the spectrum similar to the
Titan r-tx and the 1500 or the 1050 90i
now let's just say for instance here
that these are identical in terms of
capacity this is technically 8 gig kit 2
times 4 this is the 16 2 times 8 but the
capacity in this discussion doesn't
matter so much as speeds and timings I
can pretty much guarantee you that even
someone like myself who is used and
experienced every single piece of
equipment and stuff you see on the shelf
behind me in first-hand experience that
I could not tell you the difference
between two identical systems running 20
400 megahertz CL 19 vs. 32 hundred
megahertz CL 15 of the same capacity I
guarantee you I would not be able to
tell the difference in general workflow
gaming or whatever so save some money by
buying basic Ram but a heatsink or
something on there you know buy one with
the heatsink but don't over spend on
something that's very boutique with like
all of this craze
the RGB and shininess and don't be
fooled by the word gaming trust me
anything that says gaming just take it
as a marketing gimmick because you can
game on anything so the last thing we're
basically left to talk about here is
storage because storage is going to be a
very subjective thing now what we have
right here are two different types of
two-and-a-half-inch storage devices so
this is a solid-state drive right here
from inland professionals the cheapest
you can get we I think we paid like $40
for this 240 gigabyte this is a spinning
drive right here and the only difference
between the two of these is gonna be how
long you're willing to wait for your
computer load in your games to load so
if you're the kind of person that's like
I need to spend the least amount
possible like literally the least amount
possible then I would recommend getting
a hard drive but with prices being what
they are now and stata SSD is really
getting extremely inexpensive because of
the rise of MDOT two drives I still
would usually recommend getting at least
a 120 gigabyte or 128 gigabyte SSD
because you can get it for like $25 now
and then getting a large capacity like 1
terabyte or 2 terabyte hard drive to put
all your games and stuff on and then
just move your favorite game to your SSD
whichever one you're playing through and
then when you're done move it to another
Drive or get rid of it altogether and
then have your OS on here as well then
the last thing obviously is your case
get whatever box you think is prettiest
that fits in your budget I mean there's
so many out there I can't really help
you with that you could spend 20 bucks
you could spend $2,000 on a case so
obviously spend $0 yeah but you might
put it on the box put it in a cardboard
box I mean we should do a cardboard box
case around here anyway guys I wanted to
make this video because I know a lot of
you are going to be doing builds and
upgrades this summer it's a very popular
time for upgrades and I wanted to sort
of head off some of the buying decisions
you guys are gonna make to kind of make
you think a little bit differently
before you go and spend your money
nothing sucks more then buyer's remorse
because you found out you overspent
somewhere and you could have had this
instead that would have been better as a
whole after the fact and returning PC
hardware usually comes with some sort of
a restocking fee or a no return policy
at all once it's been used depending on
where you buy it from so I'm trying to
avoid that happening if you guys have
topics you want us to talk about this
summer make sure you comment down below
or hit me up on twitter we are going to
be taking obviously a lot of subject
matter directly from our audience and
don't forget every single summer I like
to do water cooling month so we're gonna
have a lot of water cooling subjects
coming up here in the very near future
cuz as the weather turns warm so do your
computers and we want to stop that from
happening
alright guys thanks for watching as
always we'll see you in the next one I
asked someone's is a Sasori Seuss and
they said just remember dr. Seuss a
Seuss okay why don't you spell it
ASO OS a Seuss a soon
