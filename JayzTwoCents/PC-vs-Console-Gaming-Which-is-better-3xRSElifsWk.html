today I'm coming at you with some epic
commentary over the top of some very
mediocre gameplay yes that is me playing
some team deathmatch on battlefield 3 in
the canals map and I would not expect
you to be impressed with this gameplay
but that's not why we're here today
folks we are here today to talk about
the common misconception between console
and PC gamers that you have to have a
super expensive computer to play any
game at any reasonable settings and that
is simply not true this is my best
professor voice so I hope it got my
point across that is not true the price
of hardware for computers and the price
of computers themselves have come down
dramatically over the last few years and
you can thank the economic downturn for
that but either way you win because as
luxury items become less and less at the
top of people spending list these
companies need your business and to do
so they have to lower the prices as an
example in 2007 I built a gaming machine
for a friend we used in 8800 GTX ultra
and it was six hundred and ninety nine
dollars seven hundred dollars for one
graphics card and its prices like that
the past that really give that negative
stigma of PC gamers are rich and they
have to have lots of money to play games
and that makes them dorky and we don't
like them because we paid two hundred
and fifty dollars for our console and we
can play the same game yeah I should I
probably shouldn't go there I don't want
to start that battle of PC versus
console but what I am here to tell you
is that mike gtx 680 that i bought this
year cost four hundred and ninety nine
dollars and that is the world's fastest
single GPU card on the planet right now
so we're talking two hundred dollars
difference
doing the fastest then and the fastest
now and that's a $200 downswing if
you're going to build a PC lower prices
or what we all want now that that's the
pricing for the latest and greatest
between then and now but do you need the
latest and greatest to play PC games no
no you don't you don't need the latest
and greatest processor you don't need
the fastest memory and you don't need
the latest and greatest of the graphics
card it's absolutely not necessary to
play games games do not take advantage
of all of the threads available in the
world's fastest CPUs you know the i7 you
know the new Ivy Bridge you know running
you know eight logical threads yadda
yadda yadda I could totally geek out on
the specs but games don't care they use
four of those threads and they only use
the physical cores so what does that
mean that means you could get away
buying a processor that's that's older
or maybe it doesn't have hyper threading
so you don't need it because the games
don't use it anyway what does that mean
means 150 bucks to get yourself an i7
like 2500 K and it does everything you
needed to do for gaming what does
everything you needed to do for
processing - you could even do all of
the video encoding you know you could do
graphics design with that whatever you
want to do the graphics card on the
other hand is probably one of the most
important components when it comes to
computer computer computer gaming uh
yeah it is one of the most important
components when it comes to computer
gaming but you don't need the latest and
greatest you simply don't let me give
you an example example number two if
you're keeping track of the examples
earlier this year a friend of mine said
hey I want to upgrade my computer and oh
hey great cool what's our budget $400 I
know oh no really really what's your
budget he said no really $400 no wait am
I on Punk'd he goes not he goes no
seriously $400 now okay um for a
graphics card I gave you grab eco no no
no that's $400 for
sir motherboard memory graphics card and
I went oh I don't work miracles man and
he said no I serious I want to upgrade
my computer no I'm serious I can't do it
for that price well he was serious and
not only was he serious at the end of
that he says oh by the way I need a
legitimate copy of Windows oh no a $400
budget to buy Windows 7 motherboard
processor memory and graphics card huh
and I did it I did it
what we did was ended up going with a
couple generations old on the graphics
cards he wanted to play battlefield 3
and he wanted to play Diablo 3 and he
wasn't as interested in the highest
settings possible on the game
specifically battlefield 3 Diablo is not
entirely too demanding but he was
interested in having smooth gameplay so
what we did or at least what I did is I
did my research on graphics cards and
the older generation stuff and we
decided to go with the 460 GTX and not
even the TI model just the 460 and you
know what he plays Battlefield at medium
and high settings a mixture of both and
he has absolutely no lag and it's
extremely smooth I was completely amazed
that the computer performed as well as
it did because I really didn't think I
could do it for that price I really
didn't and the cool part about PC gaming
is as the games evolve you can slowly
upgrade your computer and you don't need
to upgrade the moment a new game comes
out you might not be able to run at the
highest settings but I can guarantee you
any of the graphics settings that you
play with on a PC are going to look
better than console whether you're a
die-hard console player or not you have
to agree the graphics on PC are just
miles better than console there's no
other way there's just no way around it
battlefield 3 for instance the lowest
settings on PC with everything just
turned all the way down is roughly the
same as what you expect to see on
console and you know if you don't
necessarily believe me on that
stay tuned for one of my videos coming
up later next week where I actually do a
side-by-side comparison of PC and
console enough of a shameless plug of my
video coming up the point that I got
entirely off track on here that I wanted
to make is that as the games evolve you
can evolve your PC you cannot evolve
your Xbox so what's going to happen new
games are going to come out they're
going to have new engines are going to
have new shader models they're going to
have all sorts of new utilization for
the latest and greatest codecs and you
know other PC jargon that they're going
to have to turn all of that new stuff
off simply because the console cannot
handle it so there's a pro right there -
a PC now I don't want I didn't want to
turn this into a pc vs consoles that we
can do that later or we can have a
discussion in the comments but let's
keep it clean let's keep it friendly it
doesn't matter whether you're a console
gamer or your PC gamer as long as you're
having fun I want to put an end to the
myth that you have to be rich or you
have to have all kinds of money to build
a super expensive computer to play a $60
game it's not true if you want to if you
want to test what I'm saying go to new
AECOM or go to what some of the other
companies out there iBUYPOWER cyber PC
there are pre-built computers Micro
Center is another new egg style company
where you can buy components and parts
and you'll see for yourself that you do
not have to spend a million dollars or
three thousand dollars or even two
thousand dollars or hell even a thousand
dollars to build a mid-range to high-end
gaming PC it's simply not necessary it's
just simply a myth it's not necessary
it's not true but hey regardless of
whether or not you're gaming on a
console or you're gaming on a PC as long
as you're gaming and you're having fun
that's all that matters
well that's all we have time for today
