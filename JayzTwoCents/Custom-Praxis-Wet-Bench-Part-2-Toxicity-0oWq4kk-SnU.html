two parts even though I had a very
embarrassing story to tell you guys I
could have easily broken this out into
three parts and I even said on Twitter I
was running across some issues that was
not going to let anything stop me and I
did it it's done the new z170 classified
motherboard from EVGA features eight
phase-- PWM 4 Way SLI support along with
top notch components to offer gamers and
enthusiasts more of what they want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more so
anyway if you guys have missed part 1
make sure you check that out I'm putting
the link down the description for those
watching on mobile too that way guys has
something to click I know you can't
touch the screen and follow cards and
stuff like that when they pop out I
don't think so it doesn't really matter
check out part 1 if you guys haven't
already this is part 2 here of my build
of the practice web bench from primo
chill they sent this over it was a
sponsored case build but anyway the
words are stuff obviously in this video
are going to be entirely my own
including the I digress and I'm
guaranteed to throw in here somewhere
mostly because it triggers some of you
and that's the best part honestly
so before I start being a Rambler man
I'm going to go ahead and just let you
guys watch the part that I know you're
here to see so we'll go ahead and get on
with it right now
you
you
you
as you guys see the build is done I did
some color mixing for the green checking
out a shade I want to use in skunk works
and just seeing how it holds up before I
do that but anyway I'm calling this
build toxicity obviously because of the
white and the green kind of looks like
toxic sludge in there not only that the
color scheme is the same color scheme I
have going for my phone here yeah I use
an iPhone deal with it but it's green
and white and I've had this case now for
about a year so as you can see it's they
match they're like buddies but anyway
it's just a phone who cares God's happy
now triggered over what phone I use nerd
but building in the Praxis wet bench was
pretty damn easy I mean it's it's open
it's an open test bench everything on
top is accessible it gives you plenty of
room to reach underneath the motherboard
if you need to the standoffs are huge
that's the point of an open air test
bench just to make access really easy
for those that have to do constant
swapping out of parts and stuff and
that's one of the reasons why flex
tubing on this build and not rigid
tubing as much as I wanted to but I need
to be able to get the water block off to
change out CPUs and stuff if I want to
do a CPU swap or a motherboard swap or
whatever it's a lot easier with Flex
tube and than it would be with hard
tubes so that's why I did that it's one
of those things where a hard tube on
this would have been overkill he'll
water cooling of this nature with the
laying DDC on there the the giant alpha
cool reservoir and integrated top triple
e KPE radiator on there vard our fans
it's all such overkill but who cares man
I had the stuff so why the heck not you
guys know how much I love my water
cooling builds and I want to get back to
doing some more of those videos it's
been a while since I've done like real
diehard dedicated water cooling stuff
but we're back we're back to it but
anyway the Praxis wet bench here I don't
really have anything I have a couple
things I want to say that are negative
but things that I would have liked to
have seen a little bit different on
there but the cool thing about this wet
bench is the fact that it's not like
primo Cho just set out to make a test
bench and this is their first runner
though it's not their first rodeo
whatsoever that you can see that this
case is a progression of wet benches
that they've made in the past even had
all acrylic ones which looked fantastic
the problem was a durability of acrylic
as you guys know they can break and
crack and
whatever else that's why you need to
also be careful with the inserts when
you put them in if you bend them they
will crack it's pretty scratch resistant
trust me I've already tried to scratch
it not on purpose but just when you
build things happen and yeah so anyway
this it's pretty scratch resistant very
durable but one thing to keep in mind is
because it is a stamped steel and it is
very rigid it does Bend and flex so you
want to keep that in mind you'll want to
go shoving the graphics cards down on
the motherboard because you can warp and
vote the the actual motherboard tray and
keep that in mind I mean you can see
here it's just flat metal there's
nothing really supporting it underneath
the middle just on the side so you can't
just go shoving stuff down on there and
not expect bad things to happen but as
long as you go into it with that mindset
then you're going to be fine with that
the one thing I would have really really
liked to have seen would have been a
place to mount a motherboard fan and the
reason being is when we're using test
bench we're doing load sessions on
graphics cards or long gaming sessions
to test out whatever or even CPU testing
and overclocking especially overclocking
you have to have air moving over the
motherboard even though it's
water-cooled yessir is the CPUs
water-cooled the VRMs the MOSFETs and
the chipset are not water-cooled they
usually rely on the airflow inside of a
case to take away heat and move air over
them allowing some sort of semi active
cooling if you will but that doesn't
exist on here I'm fortunate I have an
overhead fan in here that does blow
quite a bit of air down on this
motherboard but I'm still going to look
at ways to perhaps mount a fan somewhere
on here that's aesthetically pleasing
won't get in the way and will allow me
to control the airflow over the
motherboard especially when I run my
 overclocked all the time some test
benches actually come with like a
gooseneck fan that's on there that you
can mount a fan to it whatever fan you
want and it's flexible so you can
control where the airflow is move it out
of the way when you're working on the
motherboard move it back when you want
to do some active cooling so I think
that's something I would have liked to
have seen integrated into this case but
other than that it gives you tons and
tons of mounting options I chose to hang
my hard drives underneath rather than
putting them on the top that way I can
access my hard drives right here under
the system without having to try and get
in here or go in the side or whatever if
they were mounted on the top side of the
bottom panel but you it's flexible you
can do it however you want you mount it
on the top you can hang it you can mount
accessories in their pumps wherever you
guys want even optical drives you can
mount underneath here that's hanging
obviously you guys can see I chose to
put a little bit of like JDM underglow
if you will but I love the fact that
this is steel and not aluminum because
it means I can use my magnetic lighting
on there so the fact that that's magnet
I just stick it up there and off we go
that's really cool in fact I can't do
that with skunkworks because it's an
aluminum case magnets don't stick to
aluminum but I love the fact that they
also have integrated handles in here and
even they make it super obvious because
it's got little like finger grooves on
there but I'm glad they did that and
it's making it obvious like hey grab it
here when you move it because as I
showed you what the fact this is
flexible metal you don't want to bend
the thing by trying to pick it up you
know right here or something like that
you will bend the out of it so grab
it where it's meant to be grabbed it
also gives you a pretty decent amount of
access you can get your whole hand back
in there to access anything that you may
put in there in my case I might case it
in my instance here I actually put one
of those swift Tec PWM fan splitters
that you would find unlike weather water
cooling kits like h2 20x to control the
Vardar fans around my radiator but I
also have four additional ports now
available to me so if I want to four
five I have five additional ports
available to me if I want to do some fan
testing or whatever else and PWM control
over them as well and there's lots of
access to it so I love the fact that
it's kind of its kind of like a trunk if
you will you put all kinds of junk in
there and I think putting some lighting
in there would have been cool but I only
had this one green light and I want to
do white but that's not really all that
important anyway yeah the water cooling
loop on here definitely is overkill but
that's kind of the point of it was a wet
bench so I thought I might as well do
something custom with it the green fluid
on here it's kind of funny I put the
pictures up on Instagram and Twitter and
I got a lot of questions of why green
well why green well but I think it's
kind of silly question why any color why
red why blue it's just it's just a
preference thing I'm also testing this
fluid like I said for skunk works
but one of the reasons why did green I
love green I love green fluid especially
the pastel it looks amazing I've avoided
green for years especially on the
YouTube channel because I didn't want
people being like he's only doing green
because he's such an Nvidia fanboy bla
bla bla bla I could've been doing a
Razer theme but still if it's green
people automatically just assume you're
an Nvidia fanboy well I wanted to avoid
all that everyone calls me a fanboy now
anyway so I figured why the hell not
might as well at least go with the green
so now I'm gonna have a green test bench
and I'm gonna have a green main system
deal with it like I said in part one I
didn't use any of the front panel
buttons on here because there's no point
since I went back to the EVGA x99
classified it's got motherboard mounted
start and reset button or power and
reset button so there's no point it'd be
really redundant to run those cables
have to worry about wiring those what
I'm I can just touch it right here on
the motherboard but the two 980ti is on
there
just because really there's no it's a
test bench
there's no point putting us-ally on
there I will be doing SLI testing though
in fact these are on here because you
guys were asking how to 980ti is versus
like a 1080 or a Titan X would do so
we're gonna be doing that obviously I
said on Twitter today that something
happened that actually set me back and
to where this video almost didn't get
done today and I want to talk about that
real quick and in fact has nothing to do
with the test bench a wet bench
whatsoever actually is everything to do
with the power supply as you guys know
again in part one I showed you I'm using
the gigabyte 1200 watt gaming extreme
yes guys they've made a power supply
with the name gaming on it but anyway
it's a fully modular power supply and
I'm used to power supplies that are very
very diligent on the way that the
modular plugs are keyed so that they
only go in certain ports I'm sure you
guys can really tell where this is going
in the hustle and bustle of building a
system like this and trying to get it
done I wasn't paying attention and I
plugged one of the EPS eight pin power
plugs into the PCI Express 6 plus to
power on the back of the mother of the
power supply that should have never been
allowed I've never had a case come in
here that allowed me to take an EPS 8
pin and plug it into a PCI Express
because the reason for that is the 12
volt and the ground on
are reversed they are different and when
you reverse polarity something like
ground and 12-volt on a power supply
with components you typically get magic
blue smoke fortunately I didn't get that
when I turned it on and immediately trip
the internal breaker inside the power
supply which won't reset until you
unplug power tried to turn it on two or
three times it kept tripping I finally
traced all my wires thinking something
got pinched or whatever by a process of
elimination of unplugging things and
trying to start it after about trying to
start at six or seven more times
apparently me trying to kill my system I
eventually realized that one of my EPS
eight pins because I'm running to one
here was plugged into a six plus two PCI
Express should have never been a lab so
the moral here guys if you have a
modular power supply
make sure and double check that you guys
don't have it plugged into the wrong
port because a really good power supply
manufacturer would never allow that to
happen obviously some do allow that to
happen
so you definitely want to make sure that
you don't do that that's actually how I
killed an open EMD system once yeah I
share my mistakes with you guys that way
you can learn from my mistakes and we
can all laugh at me because I'm
fortunate enough to where if I blow this
up I have spares and I can keep moving
forward I remember when I drilled holes
in a motherboard anybody remember that
thought I was doing something custom
turns out all I was doing was make
forcing you guys all to watch me murder
components but anyway I'm fortunate to
where I could move on but I thought I
actually blew up my 92t eyes and it's
funny because I couldn't get the system
to post after I fixed corrected my
problem thought I killed the graphics
card and one ends up and wind up
happening is about 15 to 20 attempts to
post the system later I finally got it
to turn on most people would have
thought they killed their system and
tried to are amazing or just assumed it
was bad because you I was getting boot
loops I was getting no video error I was
getting every light on the motherboard
to light up like a Christmas tree all
signs pointed to dead CPU or graphics
card or both but through a particular
technique that I know to get dead
hardware to kind of reset itself I was
able to get it back alive and there was
one point where I got one 980
to work and not the other one obviously
now I've got both of them working as you
guys can see I would have loved to have
made a video about it I was in too much
of a pinch to make a separate video
about that and it's not the kind of
thing that I can force to happen to show
you my methods for reviving dead
hardware I promise if it happens again
in the future I will do a video on it
but yeah it ended up taking me a couple
of hours to get the system back alive
which really kind of slept and then
windows didn't want to boot after that
obviously we are we are past that
because as you guys can see the system
is is completely booted but anyway I
digress guys the last you want to talk
about here real quick is some folks ask
me how I feel about this being used as
like a daily driver case the only
concern I would have are two things one
of them I already touched on is the fact
that there is no motherboard airflow
whatsoever because it's an open air test
bed so unless you have some sort of a
stand fan next to it or something
blowing air on it too I would be
concerned about long gaming sessions
long rendering sessions and stuff
without the VRMs MOSFETs and the the
chipset being cooled in some way the
other thing is there's no dust control
so you need to keep that in mind in a
case you have fan filters you can do
positive pressure there's things you can
do to minimize the amount of dust this
here is just sitting here saying please
dust rain on me just cover me with your
filth anyway guys time to go thanks for
watching my new test bed is up and
running about lots of graphics cards I
got to check out I've got the RX 470
there RX 4 60 I've got the 1080
classified I don't know what else I I'm
sure there's more out there I've
forgotten but I've got lots of to
get done in little time to do it so it's
time to go thanks for watching guys give
this video a like if you liked it
dislike it if you didn't like it feel
free to call me Nvidia fanboy because of
all the green I don't really care shoot
green was around long before Nvidia
unless Jen's son invented green too then
as I mean razor has to pay in video
royalties on green
these questions have to be answered I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it I guess
we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
