thought about doing just a regular old
you know cut-and-dry review of the
fractal design nano s I thought one of
the best ways to really review the thing
considering I'm a die-hard water cooler
it's just to go ahead and do a build in
it so that's we're going to do today
we're do it kind of vlog e style only
using the better camera not the ax 33 to
try and get you guys at least something
you know worth looking at and then come
on this face in HD does it really get
much better than this whether you're
looking for a pump reservoir custom GPU
block or a complete loop and a box alpha
cools wide range of products can make
your next water cooling adventure an
easy one click the link in the
description for more details so there it
is right there you can see it truly is
just a really shrunk down version of the
defined s it's got a lot of the same
functions it's got the exact same
aesthetic on the front on the top it's
got the side window on the side so it's
going to be able to show off all of your
components inside it's got the exact
same mounting mechanism on the wall so
that you can have a place to put your
reservoirs cutout tray there for the
back of the motherboard which is really
nice get access to your coolers and
remember this one is designed to be a
mini ITX capable of water cooling so
that's what my focus is really going to
be on today is just how much water
cooling we can actually fit into here
comfortably so a little better lighting
now this is what the guts look like here
you can fit a single which appears to be
a 140 millimeter fan on the front or two
120 millimeter fans on the front so you
can do a front mounted rad same thing on
the top here you could do a dual 120
millimeter radiator up top so that's
what we're going to be trying to fit in
there you got a lot of your grommet
pass-throughs right here on the side
just like the defined s it's all the
exact same concepts here just literally
just shrunk down on the back of the
motherboard cutout you have a place so
you can mount your hard drive or SSDs
and then you've also got one right here
on the bottom the floor of the case
where you can also mount an SSD or a
hard drive or a water pump so you
fractals really thought about putting a
lot of stuff in this case
or Mini ITX but Jay I don't get it to
fit all that stuff inside a case
wouldn't been better just to make it a
micro ATX or something like that well
that's not really what this case is
designed to be now on camera it's really
hard to actually translate how small it
really is and as I'm looking at this
going okay I've got to account for the
thickness of radiators and pump and
tubing it's actually going to be a
little bit of a challenge but they've
really set you up to have a lot of
options to be able to get this done and
get it done right so I'm going to do the
best that I can here but I'm gonna be
fitting in here a water-cooled GTX 970
gigabyte g1 gaming version maybe putting
on the EVGA z97 stinger with a 4790k the
exact same one I used in the node 202
build I pulled that out and I'm gonna be
putting it in here haven't decided yet
if I want to do soft tubing or rigid
tubing I kind of like to do rigid I love
doing rigid
I love to do rigid tubing it just looks
so clean and it's shiny but I'm gonna go
ahead and see exactly what we can fit
inside this bad boy yeah I'm bad I never
cleaned this block out fortunately I
think I want to do blue blue inside of
this build and I'm probably going to be
doing
believe it or not like a pastel I'm
going to be trying out their super
pastel and see how that works out but
this is going to be kind of a showpiece
as well we'll talk about that a little
bit in the future but this is probably
going to be on display somewhere
now just like it's bigger brother it
does also feature the mod you vent
design which literally just pops out
once you pop it out you can see you've
got your offset mounting here for either
your 120 millimeter fans or your 140
millimeter fans right there so you can
do dual 140 s or dual 120 s you just
have to keep in mind though that it's
not guaranteed to support 140 offset
here for water cooling radiators because
it does start to get really close to the
motherboard so it's going to really
depend on the thickness of the hardware
that you're putting in here but I do
recommend on a on a build like this to
go with 30 millimeter radiators at the
thickest and then you know standard 25
millimeter thick fans again just like
its Big Brothers it's got the giant
filter that actually runs the entire
length of the case so you can get power
supply filter and many bottomed fans
that you might have mounted they're all
filtered and you can access it from the
front so it makes cleaning really easy
if this is under your desk or in a
cabinet chances are a case this small
would be in some sort of a cabinet so
that works really well and then just
like it's bigger brother it has the
magnet for the front magnet closing vent
and filter for the front fans really
easy to get to really easy to pop off
and finishing up the walk-around of the
case on the back you can see you've got
a harddrive mounting tray right there
and then there's the other side of the
one I showed you that's behind the
motherboard tray so that you can mount
your SSDs you know and other things to
that so they've really got that really
nicely figured out and then of course
just like every other fractal case
that's been built in the last couple of
years
velcro straps to keep your cables nice
and tidy and nice channeling to keep
things as orderly as you possibly can
the biggest challenge when building in a
small form-factor case is getting the
power supply cables in check so that's
that's always the challenge and make
sure you have plenty of room
tuck those away but if you look at the
thickness right here on the bottom of
the case you can see you've got a pretty
decent amount of thickness there for
keeping things nice and we need to say
come on focus there we go we've got
about that much thickness there when it
comes to cable depth I know I should
have just grabbed a measuring tape
I don't have one readily available and
I'm being lazy so that's that's just
what we're doing I'm gonna show you guys
something here that I really AM nerding
out about this case I absolutely love is
that little notch right there in the
frame of the case because these screws
even though they are thumb screws are
typically tightened at the factory to
where you can't get them off with your
fingers so you've got to use a
screwdriver so instead of having to go
in there like some funky angle because
the case is in the way they've made that
little notch you can actually go
straight with your screwdriver I don't
know why that that's something that's so
simple but I absolutely love that I
didn't even know that was there until
right now freaking sick all right so
I've been sitting here for a while
contemplating this in fact longer than
you guys even know because I saw this
case and like the press material for it
long before it was actually launched I'm
really late to the party when it comes
to getting this review done but I want
to do a build not just a review and the
part that I saw on paper that concerned
me was the amount of room right here as
you can see I don't even mention this to
fractal design I said you know I'm
curious to see how well I can work past
the card length and have room here for a
front radiator and fans and still have
room for a pump and reservoir which
technically I could use like this is a
knock over my my pump here this is
really hard you guys are seeing this in
like first-person perspective this is
Jay's first-person view what if I wore a
body cam some day and built a computer
would that be weird I don't know anyway
you can use a tiny little reg like this
guy here and it'll mount up here no
problem but then you have some funky
routing of tubes to try and make it all
tie in together
now the problem is you only have so much
room right here between the end of the
card and where the radiator will go
right here I personally would mount the
fans on the filter side ditch the filter
put the fans on this side between the
backing of the front and then put the
radiator on the inside to have easy
access the tubes this isn't a problem
though it's just a you have to make a
compromise here where you either have to
deal with going with a small res like
this and mounting it
there and then putting the pump separate
down there and this thing does slide by
the way I moved it all the way to the
front you can slide it on these tracks
in position this where you want it and
what I'm thinking about doing is taking
this mounting it on the front right here
and using my long reservoir so it's you
know fills up that space and then only
going with a top 240 millimeter red
which would more than enough to cool the
970 I have here and the radiator that
would go on top we met in the 4790k
that'd be more than enough cooling for
that so yeah this is how it would look
with the longer reservoir and I think
that that actually looks better it fills
up that space more in fact I wish I had
a little bit taller one but that's
actually going to be just fine as
remember we have to account for the
thickness of the radiator that's going
to go up top I think this is going to
look better ultimately I'm not going to
be front radiator in here which I would
have really liked to have the other
thing is I know some folks are saying
why don't you just put a 120 right there
on the back well I tried that the
problem is it's a very tight space right
there and the radiators don't actually
fit in that space right there yeah it
doesn't actually fit so that's
unfortunate you know there is room to
put this guy in the bottom but then I've
got another issue when it comes to
mounting this guy I mean I could have it
floating on the back wall I guess I
could do it that way but I don't know
how well see that's that's the point of
why I want to do this review as a build
because then you can see the different
options in a way of thinking you've got
to go through when it comes to
installing this well I just learned that
there is barely and I do mean barely
enough room for me to be able to put the
pump there in between and the reservoir
in between the GPU it is actually
touching the GPU backplate right there
and the fans right here and again it is
touching the fans it's all just kind of
sandwiched in there really not sure if I
just want to do if I want to do that and
try and do the radiator on the inside
because I also learned if you look right
there that the fittings fit perfectly
between the gaps with it's almost like
they thought of this huh yeah it's
almost like they thought of this but
anyway yeah so I could technically do
that and have a dual read but it's not I
don't think it's necessary
for this build and I do think it's going
to become a point where it looks really
cluttered it can easily look too
cluttered in a case this size and I do
think that that's ending up the case
right here
with these fans having to be sandwiched
on the inside here it's actually
touching down here against the pump is a
little extra room here with the rez
versus the pump as you can see it sticks
out a little bit right there Wow sounds
like I'm in a jungle doesn't it anyway
yeah I'm just so torn on this all right
so that's what I ended up going with I'm
not going to do a front mounted radiator
just fans so we can get good airflow in
the case and then the as you can see the
reservoir is right there now I know a
lot of folks are going to ask me what
pump and stuff that this is this is just
a laying DDC pump with an ek Chrome or
nickel plated cover a heat sink cover
there on the bottom it's the bits power
reservoir combo for the top of it but as
you can see it's got to push down tube
inside right there so that we can return
the fluid from the top it's going to
pull the fluid in and it's going to push
it out this fitting here and it's going
to go right to the graphics card and
then through the loop so that's the way
that this loop is going to go so flute
border is going to go reservoir pump GPU
CPU radiator and then back into the
reservoir and I know some folks we go
shouldn't you go GPU to radiator back to
CPU so you're not putting hot coolant
into the CPU well the entire loop is
going to equalize when it comes to
temperature based on how much thermal
dissipation the radiator can do so it
doesn't mean I'm going to be heating up
the CPU by having a GPU under load it
just doesn't work that way and I'm gonna
have to do a video with temperature
sensors throughout the loop so people
can see it just doesn't work that way
anyway back on topic here let's continue
with the build so I spent enough time
talking about radiators and pump
installs and reservoirs and stuff I'm
going to go ahead and build this thing
and through the magic of editing you
guys will get to see the final results
right about
well guys here she is I hope you like it
yeah this was actually a really fun
build to do the define are the fine Nano
s I want to call it the finest because
it looks obviously so much like it you
really can't tell how small this case is
on camera but here's my hand I mean if
that gives you any kind of indication
you can see that the graphics card
length is it it goes all the way to the
reservoir right there now here's what I
want to do I want to talk about a couple
things with this a couple things to be
in mind you know to watch out for when
you're building in this case fractal
design is done a great job at designing
this case to be able to accommodate a
lot of different things a 240 rad up top
a 280 rad is not going to work up top at
all that's going to be specifically for
air cooling and the reason being for
that is if you look at the top down on
here let's see if I can do this and get
it in focus if you look at the top down
when you move the radiator from the
offset like it is right now how it's all
the way to the side more in the middle
it's going to interfere with motherboard
components and in fact the 240 as it
sits is pretty close to making some
contact with the memory right here in
fact I had to make sure I got low
profile memory and something that
doesn't have memory heat sinks that
stick up because it would literally
interfere with the fans the fan does
push down with a standard 25 millimeter
rate or 30 millimeter radiator and 25
millimeter fans like you can see right
there it does hang down over the RAM by
about 4 to 5 millimeters depending on
you know how thick the actual radiator
is and it will it will impact on this if
you try and use a 280 rad it's not going
to work period the 8 pin bps power is
like way back in there so I had to
thread that in basically I had to take
the whole loop out and plug that in and
then put it build everything around it
so there's no unplugging that with this
loop filled the power supply here is an
EVGA 650 g2 supernova it's 80 plus gold
as you can see lots of room here for
cables this is their custom cable set
that you can get to go along with it I
went with white because I thought that
it was a good pop and I I wanted to kind
of incorporate the fractal colors here I
did mix up some pastel coolant
to match the blue that's on the fans
right there as you can see I wanted it
to match the the fractal blue so it's
kind of a very fractal theme but you
could even go with a longer power supply
and still have some room right here I
did obviously use the built-in pump
bracket down there it is on a track so
you can slide it so that's how I was
able to make it you know clear the
graphics card and I'm really happy with
the way that turned out now I said on
Twitter that I did something with this
build that I've never done before and
some folks were like oh it's obvious
that you didn't bend the tubes well no
these are the exact same 90s that I used
with the parvum build I just took all
those out when I took the case apart
they've been sitting in my parts bin and
my fittings bin and I reuse those for
this but this tubing I did not Bend
because it is glass this is glass tubing
this was actually sent to be my Mayhem's
this is a twelve millimeter OD by nine
millimeter ID I believe inner diameter
it's actually a smaller diameter than
the PE TG but I wanted to do something
different so I actually cut this and I I
did I looked at tutorials on how to cut
glass and I got a glass score this guy
right here and then I literally took the
glass tubing I chucked it into my drill
and then spun the drill while using this
to score the glass you squeeze that down
and scores the glass and then you
literally just snap the glass and then I
use files to smooth it out and then
that's how I got the glass cut to link
I've actually had this glass tubing for
a while this was one of the things
mayhem sent over after the whole fiasco
with them when they were like hey man
we're sorry do you want to check out
some stuff and I was a yeah sure send it
over and they sent over different
diameters of the glass tubing I barely
had enough but I think it looks great
and that brings me to a point some folks
on Twitter and Instagram were very
judgmental to be like why aren't you
bending your tubes that just lazy blah
blah blah and making some very ignorant
comments it's obvious here there's a
reason why I didn't bend these and
rather than making an asinine comment on
social media why don't you just wait and
find out why someone did something if a
reviewer does their job well or a
builder does her job well they will
explain why they did certain things and
ignorant comments like that just really
aren't necessary I mean I know it's the
internet and all but if you had just
simply waited
because now you know they're glass tubes
and that's why it's not been now you can
bend glass but it takes a lot of heat
and it's amazing how rigid the glass
actually is so this is ptg right here on
the left and then this is glass right
here on the right and you can see just
how much thicker the wall is for the
glass and this is really I mean it's
really robust it's tre stronger than I
thought it would be I have no
reservations about using glass and a
build like this it's very very strong
and I will show you guys in a tutorial
on how to cut glass I was really easy I
was it's the first time I ever did it I
don't know who did the glass tubing
first I don't really care who did glass
tubing first I'm not saying I'm the
first person to ever do glass tubing I
am saying it's the first time I ever did
glass tubing and it's a lot easier than
I thought it would be so if what I like
about it is the fact that there's not
gonna be any clouding whatsoever
it's got fingerprints and stuff all over
right now but compared to you know the
plastic tube I mean you can see in the
plastic right there it's just scratched
and marred and the glass isn't going to
do that so that's why we want glass so
all in all I'm really happy with the way
the bill turned out if you're curious
about performance well I'm not going to
do performance numbers on this simply
because it's a 970 I've already reviewed
and a 4790k that I've already reviewed
and the performance numbers are going to
be no different it's just a different
case and it has water cooling in it but
this case does easily accommodate all in
one water coolers and as you can see it
can accommodate a pretty hefty custom
loop in here as well so it's something
that it's it's an ITX case of mini ITX
case and some folks would be like well
it should be bigger so you can go ATX
well then that would be an ATX case or
it should be smaller well they already
have smaller cases they got the note
series and you should be checking that
out but I think that this case is a
perfect footprint for home theater pcs
I'm going to actually use this in my
living room it's so nice I want this to
be seen and I'm really happy with the
way that it turned out it was really
easy to build in and one of the things
too that I did with this loop that kind
of want to show you here is the way that
I routed these tubes here is it allows
me to be able to actually actually get
my hands in there as you see I could
have filled this area with tubes backing
my hand in there and I can can touch
stuff I don't really need to necessarily
touch things but I can touch them I
can't get the
ran out though without taking the
radiator out so everything is kind of
threaded in there fortunately all the
hardware was already tested so I knew
everything worked but yeah I think I
think it turned out fantastic
so anyway if you guys like the build you
know what to do mash that like button if
you guys didn't like it well feel free
to tell me why you didn't like it what
would you have done differently and tell
me what you guys think about the glass
tubes if you want me to do a glass
tubing tutorial please put it in the
comments like the video or tell me on
social media please Jay do a glass
cutting tutorial that would be I think
more people should be using glass and
it's not that much more expensive but it
is very very unforgiving what I mean by
that is there's no doing small trims if
you make it a little too long and you've
got to be very precise and it's it's
actually not that hard i mocked the
whole thing up with PE TG and then use
the PE TG tubes as my templates for how
long the cuts should be and then it was
very very easy so I'll do that video
soon I'll show you guys how to do glass
cutting tutorial regardless whether you
guys say now we don't care about it I'm
still going to do it
anyway guys thanks for watching today's
video I hope you've enjoyed it tell me
what you guys also thought about this
vlog ear Aviv loggy review I think it
worked out really well this was more
like a vlog II build review it's kind of
like the three favorite thing is all
mixed into one anyway guys I'm gonna get
out of here I'm rambling now thanks for
watching and as always I will see you in
the next video these builds are possible
without you so huge thank you for your
support thanks again guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
