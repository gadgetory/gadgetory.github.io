we're gonna kick off 2017 2017 we went
backwards Nick oh so we're kicking off
2018 here with our CES coverage my fifth
year attending I think we finally got
things under control in terms of what to
bring and what's useless and what extras
we need and stuff so for fifth year is
the charm but we've obviously been
trying to scale down and be a little bit
more portable before we get into what's
in our bag here huge shout out to EVGA
who has sponsored our CES 2018 coverage
so guys make sure you check them out at
EVGA comm we will have some more
direction on what to do and and what
they're showcasing at 2018 and once the
show actually begins but here's what we
got right here as you can see we've got
a theme of batteries obvious there's a
lot of batteries let's talk about the
camera though this is obviously what is
going to be shot through this lens and
processed and into the computer and up
to the Internet for you guys to see we
can hold this with one hand and maneuver
this around this was kind of the theme
with this we needed more portability
because all the fs5 is nice this is much
more friendly when it comes to
portability so this is a sony a7s 2 and
obviously we're not getting to the
discussion of a 7r2 versus s to some
great coverage on why one would choose
one over the other but I digress this is
the a7s2
with the tilt to cage on here which we
have the optional handle installed you
can actually adjust the angle of this
handle too depending on how you want it
is a little knob right here but that
gives us something to attach all of our
attachments to because shooting DSLR by
itself it's kind of a pain when you're
trying to do video so we have to have
some attachments to get us to where we
need to be now for glass I am using a
Canon L Series this is a 24 to 105 image
stabilized lens it is a full frame lens
to go with our full-frame sensor body so
that's why we have this but the image
stabilization that's the most important
part because that tradeshows is a lot of
moving around a lot of elbowing people
and stuff so we want to make it as it's
non throw up inducing as we can but
that's up to NIC if it's too shaky blame
him that's why he's here but yeah that
huge zoom range of 24 to 105 means we
have one lens that can pretty much get
everything
need without having a switch lenses will
probably bring a backup just in case
that probably one of our Sigma lenses
but yeah this is our primary lens right
here and it's an f4 I wish it was lower
that we would get that nice bokeh and
depth of field and and whatnot but this
is a trade show this ain't no didn't
this ain't no glamor show so this will
get the job done for audio though now
it's being made it to the camera here
with our meta bones smart adapter this
is not a speed booster which would have
been nice because of the f4 but this is
how we're connecting obviously our Canon
glass to our sony body now for audio
we've got our sony XLR a 1m which is a
dual XLR input it's got its preamps and
stuff but it connects to the a7 via a
hot shoe so it gets power and it
communicates with the camera through the
hot shoe mount which you can see right
here so there's no extra batteries to
worry about no interface to worry about
it just the canon or the the camera
automatically recognizes that it's a
Sony product plugged in and then just
works which is great so we've got our
Sennheiser AVX wireless system here that
goes with our wireless lav then we've
got a Audio Technica 4053 be
hyper-cardioid shotgun mic which is
going to be used obviously for on-camera
scratchy audio but yeah this is our
setup right here now in terms of
batteries and keeping this thing running
of course it's got its tiny little
battery and that's the problem with
these that's this thing it'll last us
very long this will last us like 35
minutes of shooting will be doing 1080p
videos at CES just for the sake of
upload - or and we stuck with hotel and
cellular uploads so 1080p but even
shooting 1080p that battery would go
fast
so here's we've got we've got an army of
battery banks because guess what the
sony the a7 s - as long as you have a
battery in the camera you can actually
power your camera off of external
batteries so we've got like oh I don't
know 55,000 milliamps worth of battery
right here between these three they all
have multiple outputs for charging which
means we can charge our ABX system if we
need to we can charge well I guess
that's about it
we can charge a camera - obviously and
then of course we have an extra Sony
battery for that as well we
got our Sony chargers we have our light
chargers as well as our batteries for
our lights because we are going to be
bringing this guy right here this is the
this is I can light I don't even know
the model number to be honest with you
it's a o YB 2 4 0 whatever this is a bi
LED light that puts out a ton of light
that we're gonna be bringing because
some of the Suites are extremely under
lit this is versatile so that we can
mount it on the camera if we need to we
can mount it on a tripod we can stick it
in the corner we can handhold it even
has a little like handle and this is
gonna be running off of these batteries
right here so that's gonna be our light
situation obviously we've got a plethora
of USB cables we also have some micro
HDMI cables for all our small HD field
monitor here which is also going to be
on the a7 giving Nick another thing to
help him focus because the the built-in
viewfinder on that is it speaking kind
of sucks
versus like an actual field monitor so
that's why we're bringing that as a just
another reference point for keeping
focus we have also got this is the ABX
wireless lab I'm obviously not talking
on that right now I'm talking on the the
standard one this will be doing our
vocals with I've also got my handheld
ABX in case I need it for like the trade
show and stuff we're gonna use this in
forever it's a little dirty we have to
charge all this too obviously we who
else we got here battery charger our
battery case for my phone so I can stay
nice and connected while I'm there for
tweets and instagrams and loud squeaky
bus breaks whatever that's not broken I
swear if it is a whatever here are
sticks so we've got the bin row this is
the tid 37c this is carbon fiber it's
nice and light it's got a hook on it so
you can hook it on your backpack or
whatever and it's it's not heavy at all
so we can travel with that easily it's
gonna work when we need sticks for the
camera or we need a mount for the light
obviously but this is we're gonna be
using mostly for our our shots at CES
and this what Nick will be using this is
our monopod got this off Amazon actual
I'll put a link to this down below it's
a king joy and it's also got our
Manfrotto 502 head on there which is
what we'll be connecting the camera now
because I'm tall we also needed a
monopod that went nice and high now this
is higher than we actually need it I
think but the thing is that we actually
have
the ability to go nice and high in I
level if Nick wanted to so this is how
that's going to be but because we have
the Tilton panhead Nick can still get
some really smooth shots when we're on
the showroom floor and stuff so this is
what's gonna kind of look like when
we're out there at the trade show or at
least what Nick's gonna look like while
we're doing this so yeah so this is
Nick's camera bag right here this is
where all this gear is gonna be kind of
shoved it is this the one that I bought
that I gave you oh I thought so I was
like that looks familiar
Nick's camera bag will be putting all
the batteries and stuff in I'll have a
can of the backpack
Brian while the backpacks will have a
lot of backs helping carry this up we're
like team husky we're the big guys of
YouTube and I don't mean by channel size
I mean big look at me in terms of audio
though Nick will be monitoring
everything on his emu Purple Hearts
these are nice wood closed back
headphones but they're super lightweight
that's why these were coming their
clothes back sound oscillation but
they're super light light is obviously
the key word here I might notice there's
no laptop or anything here it's like Jay
how the heck you plan out editing these
videos I'm glad you asked
it's kind of ironic that I said that we
wanted to pack light because I built a
desktop to do all my editing and I have
used powerful laptops and trust me there
are some very powerful laptops out there
but I have just decided that I want to
go through the content as quickly as I
can
so that's why I built myself a micro ATX
rig right here that's fairly temporary I
don't know if this will stay together
I've done this before I did this one
other year you could find an old video
in fact I'll link it you guys want to
see an old retro J video where i built a
mini ITX system that i took with me to
do editing within the hotel this is an
Intel 7900 X 10 cores 20 threads
overclocked to 4.5 do does nobody do
breaks around here I'm opening up a
brake shop Nick we're gonna make a mint
yeah 32 gigs of corsair dominator ddr4
32 hundred megahertz it's got a gtx 1080
Ti in there
it's water-cooled with a Kraken X 52
it's sitting inside of a NZXT th400 it's
got a EVGA X 299 micro motherboard on
there it's got all SSD storage that are
squibs pacific scratch drive just for
editing Adobe loves speed and I don't
mean drugs I mean it likes
megahertz it likes core speed so that's
why it made sense for me to go with
Intel and attend courts one
thread that's overclocked far because I
actually get better results than going
with a higher thread count Intel CPU and
the same reason why it was two reasons I
think Oh thread Ripper one then I have a
micro ATX board available and I don't if
they do I don't have it and then to the
same reason all those cores would go to
waste because I can only go about 4.0
gigahertz out of that and so going with
the higher frequency made more sense
then we'll be bringing a mouse and
keyboard IPS panel set that up in the
hotel and just churning out videos as
fast as we can as keeping the quality up
hopefully hopefully you guys will watch
it anyway that's what's in our bag guys
thanks for watching and we'll see you
well by the time you guys watch this
will already be at CES we hope you guys
would check out our coverage we're gonna
do the best we can to keep it
interesting and like I said there will
be some automotive high end automotive
performance stuff I mean smart cars and
electric cars those are cool but we care
about tired burning gas guzzling fast
cars and that's we're gonna be taking a
look at while we're there as well anyway
we're gonna go again huge tank an EVGA
for sponsoring our trip we will see you
guys at CES 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
