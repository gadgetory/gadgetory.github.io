gonna take a look today at the new arc
90 not to be confused with the old arc
90 I don't know if there isn't regular
arc 90 but this is the new arc 90 from
gamer storm this is actually a case
designed by deep cool where they took
the water cooling loop and built it
directly into the case the new cooler
master H 500 p mesh white provides
maximum air flow sleek design and
elegant tempered glass giving you the
ultimate platform to show off your next
build
learn more about the new H 500 P by
heading to Coolermaster calm this is
probably one of the better packed cases
I've seen in a long time it actually
comes with this soft cell foam that is
cardboard reinforced so even if the case
gets dropped or mishandled by the lovely
folks over at FedEx UPS and DHL and of
course your local Postal Service then
it's gonna be pretty well protected they
also included this gamer mat I think
this comes with every single case but
check that out this is a wide gaming mat
that you can put your keyboard in your
mouse on gotta let it lay flat for a
while to get some of the rolled kink out
of there but this is kind of neat I
don't recall the last time I've seen a
gamer mat come with a case and it's
something else that made this a pretty
easy unboxing experience even for a
dullard like me who's very bad at taking
things out of a box it has this strap
that's wrapped around the case you can
easily pull it out of the box so it
already tells us that this is a fairly
premium product from a company that's
taking a lot of pride into this so but
you know obviously the most important
part is build quality what is the loop
like and then we'll talk about some of
the features of this case as soon as I
get this all apart alright first peel
incoming alright right off the bat I can
see we have got tempered glass yes and
forget the front man see piano finish on
plastic is a terrible thing because it
always looks scratched when you try and
clean it or dusty you wipe it down to
try and clean it you scratch it but
obviously tempered glass is not going to
give you that experience because it is
very very resistant to scratches so this
is one of those side mounted radiators
what actually goes on the back panel of
the case and not the front or the top
and remember this is a built-in water
cooling loop unfortunately there is a
and blade completely missing from one of
one of the 280 millimeter fins so you
can see the fan hub and everything right
here even the LEDs obviously they're
supposed to be a fan right there now it
looks like we have a triple fan radiator
but we actually don't down here with a
bottom fan as there is no radiator it's
just a 280 so that means there's two 140
millimeter fans here in here or in this
case one and a half but you can see the
hub where the fan was the LEDs that
light up the fan and everything even the
even the copper coil right there to make
the fan turn thinking maybe it fell out
in transit maybe I got dropped during
shipping which could have knocked it out
which you know would have kind of
absorbed deep cool of any issue with
that so it looks like we have
quarter-inch rubber tubing running from
our radiator over to our pump this is
basically the same pump you'll find in
there captain series a iOS and the way
they get around the a Sutekh patent is
the fact that they bring the fluid
outside of the pump and then back in on
top making this not an all
self-contained unit which is how they
kind of get away with not having to deal
with a Sutekh which in my opinion is a
good thing because we need more options
besides ASA tech you can see on the back
right here though this is where it
exhausts the air from inside the case
this is an exhaust so it is pulling
fresh air from inside the case and
blowing it out the backside right here
kind of becoming a thing a lot more case
manufacturers are doing now kind of
utilizing this space on the back of the
case to not not a captive thumb screw
keep that in mind but they're kind of
utilizing that space to keep the more
open interior and I've not done any
testing though whether or not that kind
of a 90 degree Bend the air has to make
in that open space could actually affect
cooling but oh okay there it is found it
but as I was saying I've never actually
done a test to see if a radiator mounted
on the side like this having to kind of
pull air from the main compartment like
this is more efficient or not obviously
we have a more open configuration our
hard drive cages go down here in the
bottom and then you can put front side
fans on there if you want but obviously
there is no intake fans whatsoever on
this case and only one exhaust fan in
the back now we need to see if we can't
pop this guy back on hey there we go
good as new we'll just chalk that up to
the shipping company so here's a 280
millimeter radiator right here don't
confuse this with a standard AC textile
radiator because this is a cross flow
and not a double pass so the water comes
in the top
right here flows through all the rows at
the same time and it collects down here
at the outlet where it's actually routed
to the front of the case where we have a
very thin tube style reservoir with LED
lighting behind it RGB lighting of
course to light up the fluid on the
front of the case this is purely an
aesthetic it's not something you can
actually open up and service we'll take
a look at that closer in a second though
but that's probably why we also don't
have a 420 radiator version unless they
switch this over to a double pass
because you have to have room for this
fitting right here on the bottom so even
if you had a 90 right here there still
wouldn't be enough room on the bottom of
the case before impacts on the floor
well they might be asking yourself Jay
if there's nothing down here to cool no
radiator why is there this fan
well this fan is actually pulling air
through where the hard drive cages are
so this is giving you some active
airflow over your storage but on the
back of the case you have two SSD trays
there of ample opening here for a large
power supply if you need it plenty of
room right here for your wire management
to be able to pass through lots of
rubber grommets making it easy to route
cables away you need them too and then
of course we have a lot of LED and fan
controller functionality pre plugged in
on this case so you provide SATA power
to it and then you can actually power
your LEDs and your fans off of this
cable now the front of this is not
coming apart nearly as easy as I had
hoped
there's some tabs here on the inside
that hook on to where the fan is or the
fans would go and the metal is just kind
of flexing around in there and not
unhooking like you want like it wants to
so it's there we go pull it from the
bottom so the plexi or the plexiglass
the tempered glass is actually attached
to this solid panel now if you're gonna
be putting on front fans right here keep
in mind the only place it's gonna be
getting air it through is through an
opening at the top right here these very
restrictive slits on the side and this
little bit of a cutout on the bottom
otherwise you could actually put one two
three three 120 millimeter fans right
here I don't see any mounting holes for
140s so only 120 s are gonna fit in the
front and then kind of the same thing on
the top the problem is the metal just
wants to flex where these are but it
looks like these are obviously identical
pieces for the top and the bottom so you
got three hot-swap drives right here
which is kind of funny there hot-swap on
the front but you actually have to
remove
these three screws from the side in
order to get the hot-swap portions to
actually come out there and they're
really tight right now though because
all the case accessories are sitting in
there like this box right here and this
guy right here which is making them not
slide too easily but once you take those
out obviously any hot swaps are pretty
easy to get in and out so in this black
box here we've got a few things looks
like we've got a mounting mechanism for
our cooler we've got a thermal paste and
of course our instruction manual now
this big grey piece right here doesn't
actually stay with the pump it's mounted
down to the motherboard tray and the
pump is mounted to it just to keep it
safe during transport but this part gets
removed you replace the pieces obviously
using the manual the mounting bracket
for your socket type and then you can
obviously mount this down to your
motherboard so you can see the block is
full copper right here so it's a perfect
size for stuff like a m4 until not going
to be very good in my opinion for
something like thread Ripper I don't
even think this supports thread Ripper
according to the manual nope it doesn't
but it supports all your standard Intel
and AMD sockets too small for thread
refer though so the mounting plates
pretty straightforward you've got these
standoffs you push through based on the
type of socket you're installing in so
obviously use your manual for that RTFM
push it through the backside and then
you've got these retainer nuts that
actually have a rubber washer on them to
keep from grounding anything on your
motherboard and these lock down to hold
that into place so you take the
crossbars mount these down on the
standoffs that you just placed using the
shorter screws you can rotate the
fittings kind of up and out of the way
and then you just mount the actual pump
down on to those crossbars and you can't
really screw it down too tight you
basically go until the threads stop it
is spring-loaded obviously you put down
your thermal paste in this instance I'm
just showing you the way it mounts so
you can just screw this down and so it
pretty much comes to a rest the spring
will make sure that there's proper
tension on there you can bottom out the
threads just go until they stop don't
over tighten just once the threads stop
you're done then your pump is installed
so you've got a complete water-cooled
system now that's pre built into the
case that's pretty neat one of the thing
worth mentioning is it does have a
vertical mount option for the graphics
card you can see we got some standoffs
here pre-installed for that option but
the actual riser card meant for this
case is an optional piece so it doesn't
come with the case
something you have to buy separately so
the case rotated on its front now to
show you the top I oh this is a 2 USB
3.0 headphone microphone jack power
button but also your LED controller and
your fan controller are on these little
buttons right here on the side here's
the 3 fan installation points on the top
of the case that I mentioned so you can
have 3 on the front 3 on the top for a
total of 6 plus the 3 140 millimeters on
the side plus the 120 or 140 millimeter
exhaust on the backs there's a lot of
fan options on this case question is
whether or not those panels actually
reduce the airflow so as mentioned all
the fans have built in RGB there's even
a little glowing RGB gamer storm logo
right here rear fan and the front
reservoir as mentioned also has RGB on
there so definitely keeping with the RGB
craze yeah so you can control the
brightness of it you can control the fan
speed as well on here but obviously the
fans aren't turning and you can control
the different modes with this button
right here so they're pretty basic it'll
cycle through the different colors it'll
either give you a solid color and you
can control the brightness of it but you
get the idea you've all seen RGB and you
know how it works so anyway that has
been my first look here at the new arc
90 from gamers storm like I said I don't
know if it's actually new that's just
the name they call it the new arc 90
built-in water cooling loop taking a lot
of the guesswork out of cooling your CPU
again it's probably as good as any other
AIO we do plan on testing this in the
future we do a full build in here I just
don't have the parts available to do
this build right now but we will circle
back I expect the results to be as good
as any other 280 millimeter aao which
means it's gonna be able to cool your
eyes and chips be able to cool your case
cute Intel chips all the way up to X 299
giving you some mild overclocking
available depending on which chip you go
with all your mainstream stuff you
should be able to overclock with no
problems as long as case airflow is good
enough and that's what I plan on testing
I'm still a little concerned that the
front panels on this case are a bit
restrictive not allowing enough intake
into the case which can obviously affect
the cooling because the cooler is
pulling directly from the volume inside
the case and not through the air being
pulled in through the front or exhausted
through the top like a traditional
format so because it's mounted to this
back wall it's dependent entirely of the
air that is being brought into the case
already which as I mentioned in the
beginning this video is already a little
bit flawed because there are no intake
fans whatsoever on this case
it is so relying on these 140 millimeter
fans that are mounted 90 degrees
perpendicular to the rest of the intake
and exhaust on this case I think that's
asking a lot of work so we will be
testing that in the future but at least
we got a chance to open it up and take a
look at it a lot of you asked me to take
a look at this case so when deep cool
reached out and asked if I wanted to
look at it I was like absolutely a case
has water cooling built in why what
night you guys tell me your initial
thoughts on this and what kind of
testing you want to see obviously we're
gonna test things like thermals and
acoustic we're gonna test it and it's as
shipped format just like this but the
case fans oriented as they are and then
we'll add some fans to this and see how
much of a difference it makes
maybe guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching as always I'll see you in the
next room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
