two cents here and I will be the first
to admit that I'm a little bit late to
this party and so I've just been a
little bit backed up and I apologize for
being late to this review but hey at
least it's not you know one of those
ones that was spam to your inbox so it's
kind of out here by itself for a little
while now the Quickfire rapid I what
exactly is the Quickfire rapid I mean
we've already had the Quickfire rapid
out basically the Quickfire rapid eye is
just an intelligent version of the rapid
that's what the ice hands for
intelligent I believe intelligence or it
could stand for indigestion I'm not
entirely sure but doesn't really apply
in this situation so I'm pretty sure
intelligence is the right act the right
word for the eye in there okay so
without drawing this out making a really
long review of a keyboard because it's
kind of hard for you guys to really
grasp what I'm feeling and experiencing
with the keyboard so let's go ahead talk
about features I'll do a quick typing
test and tell you guys what I think
Coolermaster is using the Cherry MX
browns on this particular model so as
you can see it comes with the white LEDs
I like that now some people may not like
Browns and some people may not like
white LEDs they may clash with their
build maybe they want red maybe they
want blue I hope that they will have
other color options in the future for
LEDs rather than just going with white
but I am personally a fan of the white
board I really like about this keyboard
and actually I'll get to a whole list of
kind of pros and cons it from my
perspective
but it's the level of detail that they
put into this I mean it looks like just
your standard backlit 10-qs featureless
keyboard but that's not really the case
I mean they've gotten to a lot of detail
for instance and obviously you can see
that's the Windows key the caps lock
button the num lock and the scroll lock
buttons don't have dedicated LEDs that
light up anywhere on the screen so
instead what they do is that key cap
will either light up or not depending on
whether or not that function is
activated so for instance caps lock when
it's off by default is not lit up but
when you turn on caps lock boom it's lit
up and the same is for scroll lock and
the gamer lock function and all of that
so that's really cool I like the small
amount of detail that has gone into that
now you do have all of your standard f
row keys that do various things I mean
you've got your brightness level here I
apparently just opened up the wooden pad
help screen okay so what actually makes
the RapidEye intelligent well good sir
madam I am glad you asked it's got an
onboard 32-bit ARM processor with
built-in onboard profiles and memory so
you can set up lighting configurations
on this keyboard they're gonna follow
you wherever you plug it in so it's
stored on the keyboard in the built-in
memory it's not gonna be dependent on
software being installed to utilize any
of the profiles that you set up now
that's not new to the industry but it is
something newer for Coolermaster and I'm
glad that they finally decided decided
to start incorporating that because I
felt that that was on some of the other
keyboard reviews I did for them I
mentioned that I felt that that was a
bit lacking
so they debuted this keyboard at CES we
took a look at it there and I'm very
glad that they decided to do that so I'm
gonna give you just a quick
demonstration of as I can tour my arm
very strangely here of how that
functionality actually works so let's
say right now we want to record what
Keys we want on for one of the four
profiles which are listed here under F 9
through 12 M 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so I hold down
function hit record
keep holding function and choose the
profile I want so in this case we'll go
ahead and do profile M 2 now you can see
that's flashing to tell me that I've got
m2 activated but I don't have any keys
lit yet because I didn't tell it what
keys to light up so let's say we're
playing a shooter we've got WASD maybe
we've got weapons 1 through 6
maybe F is grenade or G is grenade c4
Crouch maybe left shift 4 sprint you can
illuminate the keyboard if you want that
way and maybe tilt is something and J I
know there you go so we can say okay
that's what we've got lit up that's what
we want to actually you know utilize for
this profile hold function hit F 2 or M
2 again and then there it is you can see
that we have now only got the keys
illuminated that we want so you can do
that for the
yes profiles here built into the
keyboard giving you a lot of different
combinations of different lighting
backlight that you can control on here
so like I said not new to the industry
but new to coolermaster and I'm glad
that they finally implemented that now
they do have a couple of new lighting
modes on here that I quite honestly do
have some fun with when I'm bored and
I've been using this keyboard for about
a month and a half now so I'm glad to
finally get to show you this let's say
we change the lighting - and here are
the built-in lighting modes obviously
like I said we've got breathe we've got
this one here which as you can see it
just lights up briefly as you type on it
can't really see it because it's under
your finger it lights up so quickly but
we've also got this trailing mode which
is like where it kind of goes on and
then just sort of fades out behind you
that's really fun actually if you're a
very fast typer you like to have some
fun with that that's kind of a cool cool
little mode right there and in fact if
you want to play with that mode and get
a good example of what it feels like you
can go on to the website that's linked
down in the description sort of a sample
page of what it's like to type on this
keyboard so when you type on your
keyboard it'll light up on the screen
and show you with that functionalities
like so head on down the description
check out that website which will tell
you or show you how that functionality
feels now when it comes to the bottom it
is it's got a nice wide rubber feet it's
got rubber flip-out feet so that you can
get a nice upward angle and it's not I
mean this thing is not notice that does
not slide very easy so there you go now
one other thing I want to talk about
here is it does have a nice rubberized
finish a very minimalistic look so it's
not really gaudy or anything like that
as you are you know maybe going to land
parties or stuff and as we mentioned
earlier it is 10 keyless so you don't
have a 10 key over there allowing you to
have a nice narrow gaming profile as
you're you know doing your thing so
let's go ahead and just kind of do a
quick typing test and I don't judge me
I'm I don't type on this keyboard an
awful lot and I'm very used to a 10
keyless so my hands automatically want
to go much farther left than I'm used to
but anyway what we'll do here is we'll
just make the font massive and I mean I
have typed on this keyboard quite a bit
already and I really do enjoy it
but let's see I can just say that I like
this keyboard a lot and I think that
most people would probably get used to
the 10 key list pretty quickly and I am
probably making all kinds of mistakes
but that that's okay because I am NOT
very SMRT so I mean tied behind it's
very nice I'm very used to brown keys
getting used to this keyboard was pretty
easy but again 10 kilos is a little
weird for me so guys this has been the
rapid eye from Coolermaster cm storm
line of products go and check it out
down the description that webpage is
kind of fun just to screw around with
follow me on Twitter if you guys want to
talk a little bit more about this
product or head on over to Jay's two
cents where I did do a little written
article over there going a little bit
more into depth of some of the built in
features of this keyboard so I get the
heck on out of here
we got a trip to Chicago coming up you
guys may be watching this way into the
future so I'm referencing something that
happened way in the past from the future
in a past video it's gonna be a weird
time paradox thing going on there but
anyway guys I'm gonna get on out of here
as always hope to follow you on some
social media and I will see you in my
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
