bringing you kind of a twofer review on
the channel here and if you're a gamer
you're probably not gonna want to miss
this because there are so many different
mice and mouse pads and gaming
peripherals out there it can be a little
bit overwhelming on what to buy so today
we're going to take a look at a brand
new product
technically it's a revision to an
existing product here from funk and that
is the MS 3 revision 2 Gaming Mouse and
the surface 1032 XL that's a really long
product named gaming mouse pad right
there so don't go away okay so here's
the packaging right here I do like the
packaging that funk comes with it's kind
of funky if that makes any sense at all
but they have listed right here on the
package as you can see are - this is a
revision - it's an update to an existing
product that has a ten million cycle
Omron switch or switches it's got an
improved cable I'm not sure what was
wrong with the old cable I never looked
at the old one better Windows 8 support
so that's always good to have firmware
updater so now you can update the
firmware in this as improvements and
enhancements to the software are created
extended macros I'm not sure what that
means actually it improved scroll wheel
maybe the other one had some slop or it
wasn't very good I'm not sure and then
it's got a setting software 1.2 - and it
comes with firmware 1.1 see out of the
box there's the mouse right there now
what you may notice right off the bat
taking a look at this mouse is this is a
full-sized mouse and we can get it out
of the package here we'll take a look at
what comes inside the box now just like
inside the packaging here for the
headset that we took a look at the HS
260 the manual that comes with it is
very nice it's well printed any company
that puts effort into its literature in
my opinion also puts effort into its
product now when it comes to the
extended warranty it does come with a
two-year warranty on there and if you
register the product they do give you an
additional year for three years of
warranty you have your settings software
disc right here I always recommend
downloading a fresh one off the internet
and then it also shows you here
how to install the driver listen Mouse
there's a little bit of a have a
QuickStart guide right there
keep it enough about that let's go ahead
and look at the mouse itself now as I
mentioned at the start of this video it
is a full-size Mouse and if you guys
hear me sniffling a little bit I
apologize I am fighting a nasal
infection and it really really sucks so
the cable is no different than any other
funk product they've got their signature
paracord on there with the black and the
orange and a lot of little twisty ties
on there get that off and it is a fairly
decent length cord I can't quite get my
arms entirely stretched out which is
good but here is the shape of the mouse
right here kind of has a go so like a
batwing look to it but it's designed to
have a placement for all of your fingers
your thumb your ring finger as well as
your pinky so it is a full size Mouse
it's not a claw or anything like that so
if you're used to small claw type Mouse
this may not be your thing now you can
see on here that it does have an a
scroll wheel that's rubberized it's very
very smooth and I like that but you have
quite a few buttons on here you have a
button here that goes under your thumb
you have a button here for the tip of
your thumb you have forward and back
buttons right there that can be set up
based on macros but you also have on the
fly dpi adjustments with these two
buttons here and an LED strip that
lights up in the middle to show you
basically where you are in the DPI
settings there's also an LED that I
believe lights up inside the scroll
wheel will check that when we plug it in
the only reason I say that is because
the picture behind me as you can see
shows an orange scroll wheel where mine
clearly is not so you also have a
profile switcher right here that you can
use to switch the profiles of your mouse
so that you can set up different macros
for different games and you can do that
on the fly now the feet there are feet
on the bottom the sides and the front of
the mouse now the sensor on here I think
it's a 90 400 dpi let me check that real
quick
okay I remember why I couldn't remember
the number now because it was a really
weird number
it's a 92 50 670 BPI that's a really
weird number if you asked me but hey
whatever it is adjustable here on the
fly now the physical properties of the
mouse are quite nice and is a rubberized
Mouse on here so it's a nice solid grip
so if you have sweaty hands that you you
can maintain a control of your mouse it
does have a max acceleration of 30g and
what I do like isn't included in the
software are the adjustable settings not
only dpi but you also have lift of
sensor control on there so you can
control how sensitive the mouse is to
movement when it's off of the surface
that way you can make it so if you move
it barely off the surface it stops
moving which is what a lot of people
like if you're having to do something on
the on the mouse pad where you having to
lift up and move like this kind of like
flying in battlefield if you do a jet or
something and use the mouse be very
similar to that so you can get better
movements rather than having the mouse
pick up the sensor at a distance and
still move side-to-side with you when
you're off the mouse pad that's
extremely annoying so when it comes to
the mouse though I do like the mouse
overall I'm not really more of a full
sized Mouse guy like this I don't really
care much to have a place to put my
pinky but it is comfortable in fact time
will tell on how much I use this Mouse
when it comes to you know hardcore
gaming or shooters or stuff like that
now if you're an MMO player you might
want more buttons but you know either
way it probably will suit your taste now
as I mentioned this is a 2 first we're
gonna take a quick look here at the
surface
10:32 XL this mousepad packaging is
probably the nicest for any mousepad
I've ever seen you flip it open you have
a nice foam protection on here you have
a felt lining we got this little orange
e lifter thingamabob over there and then
you have the mousepad right here now it
does have a rubber base on there so you
can see this popped right out of there
because it's a two-sided mousepad so
this is not going to move around on you
because it's got these rubber feet and
it's not gonna go and
we're at all but you do have these are
not my style of mousepad Ashley and I
let them know that at CES is this is a
very gritty feel to it now when it comes
to the slick properties of it it moves
on they're very nice but as you can hear
if you take a listen and put it by the
mic
it's very scratchy I mean that gets
annoying and to me these types of mouse
pads are almost like moving your mouse
around on on high grit sandpaper and I
don't know why I honestly don't know why
they go with this route I am a cloth
mousepad guy for life I love the
neoprene mouse pads and I even like the
rubber mousepad like here from CM storm
because these wear down over time you'll
start to get on the more gritty side
you'll start to get smooth patches where
you're constantly moving so you're gonna
start having different types of texture
on the mousepad based on where you spend
most of your time putting your mouse and
that's what I hated about my previous
mousepad that was the same material I'll
be honest I'm quite surprised they sent
this to me since I was very vocal
against it at CES but you know there are
plenty of people out there some of my
personal friends included who prefer
this style of mousepad one thing it does
have that I'm I think it's very cool is
it has this little cable clip on there
so you can clip clip it to the top of
the mousepad and then you can clip the
cord to that so you're not getting a
tangled cord so you go guys that has
been an unboxing the first look of two
products here from funk you have the MS
3 revision 2 Gaming Mouse and the
surface 1032 gaming mouse pad so tell me
what you guys think
what kind of Mouse do you like do you
like a claw do you like a full grip like
this what kind of mouse pad do you like
do on cloth mouse pad do you like the
kind of a rubbery mouse pad or do you
like these you know very hard and
scratchy surface mouse pads tell me what
you guys feel down in the comments take
it over to the website take the
conversation over to Twitter if you feel
like it and as always I'd love to see
you guys in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
