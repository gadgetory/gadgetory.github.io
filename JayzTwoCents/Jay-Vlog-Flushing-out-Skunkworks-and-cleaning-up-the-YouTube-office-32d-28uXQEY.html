I'm gonna bring you a vlog that's
something I haven't done in a while
because I've got a lot of stuff to get
done in this office and it's kind of
getting in the way I've been getting
very very frustrated I haven't been
wanting to come in here or work because
everything is just so discombobulated
and thrown up and out of order if I
decided that to get some work done today
and kill two birds with one stone I
would just do a blog and I think one of
the very last vlogs I did other than the
skunkworks blogs was the upgrade last
year when I guided this room and painted
it so let's just go ahead and have a
kind of a day in the life of although
it's not a very typical day gigabytes
flex display technology automatically
detects and connects up to four displays
for the best gaming experience in multi
display Ultra HD click the link in the
description to find out more first
things first you might notice that via
own if you hear some background noise I
like to catch up on youtuber videos when
I'm actually working or I'm doing stuff
in the office and this is a Nikki and
John blogs and I met them at vlogger
fair they're actually really really cool
people they've got an awesome channel
with a bunch of pranks and stuff plus
their vlog channel so once you guys go
and check them out pranksters in love is
their channel name so the first order of
business is kind of get this she'll
figure it out because it's starting to
sag and let me leave this this is a
floating shelf from Ikea it was never
meant to hold the weight of all of these
GPUs and especially when guys like this
980 classified or the 980ti classified
wares oh there it is stuff like that
it's too heavy for that shelf so I got
to figure out what I want to do with
that but as you can see this room is
absolutely a disaster it is just make it
could be worse I guess
but let me show you my problem here
stuff just collects and collects and
collects and I'll take an entire weekend
and I will do the best I can to organize
and I had this closet organized as can
be that's all my water cleaning stuff
over there I can't even get this door
open
right now because all this stuff in
front of it but I have had this I don't
know how many times have organized this
and I've got all this stuff here this
stuff here so this is the plot this is
she's almost called it a closet so this
is the hallway leading to the room and
as you can see I've got another master
five case right there they sent two of
them but anyway so I've just got more
stuff and stuff and some tools from
working on the car this TV actually
wasn't sent for review I won that during
the weight loss competition I lost first
place by like a half a percent whatever
more stuff there so this is the garage
right here I don't have much space in
this garage because it's just a one car
garage you see I've got stuff up here
there's stuff behind here my bikes
monitors and cases right there more
boxes and stuff stuff up here on top I
even have a storage shed and the whole
back portion of that is computer stuff
so I have to move a lot of it out here
Pelican case with camera gear but over
here you got Christmas decorations and
baby stuff that I can't get rid of and
this right here you may not be able to
tell but it's actually several layers
deep of computer cases and things so
yeah we uh we've got a space issue here
we Jake good boy who's a good boy this
is max he's my rescue dog yeah good boy
good boy cocky nuts
yes yeah yeah it's a good boy he's a
rescue he was abused and kicked and
beaten and stuff and we got him about
four years ago and he did get he trusts
people again sorry that's gonna be some
good and it's there Jade doing baby talk
with your dog doing it can't be an
inside dog though he refuses to
house-train now I can hear you guys
already saying stuff like that's not
nearly as much as Linus has it's not
matter of that one I have one bedroom in
this house side allocated to the YouTube
studio and I'm now overflowed into the
hallway of overflowed into the garage
and I've overflowed into the storage
area and yeah and I've also only been
full-time youtuber now for four months
and I've only had product being sent to
me now for review for a little over
a year what what's gonna happen in the
next few years I mean this is insane
we'll just give it away guys I don't I
can't just give away everything it
doesn't work that way I do giveaways
every now and then but pretty much
everything I keep is going to be used at
some point I think but space is a
serious issue in this place and my
goodness it's just now I guess the real
solution here would be to pick my
favorite video cards and put them on
here typically after I'm done with
review instead of putting it all back in
the box I'll just stick it up here but
you can as you saw there was just too
many so I guess I'm gonna have to pick
my favorites the problem is I love them
all I just like yeah yeah I love you
equally as my children how do you pick
how do you choose your favorites well I
guess if I'm going by weight the 390 is
out the thing is massive so we'll start
here with the we'll start with the MSI
980ti it is pretty I'd be a fool not to
put the kingpin up there but man this
thing is like twice the weight of the
msi carton that I put that on there look
at the shelf that alone moves the shelf
by itself everything I see rhymes I
still have to review this guy I've had
this guy for a while actually but then
the 980ti launched and they were like
yeah you can do the review and you get a
chance I'm still gonna do it because
it's still relevant but that's the 90
classified kingpin and that's a 980ti
keen pen on the 980ti they drop the
classified designation and just what
with kingpin so that's why some people
saw this and we're like oh that's a
classified but if you look at the back
tada
kingpin now the lightening needs to come
over here because I'm still reviewing
the light name currently in the process
of doing my r9 390x hybrid from power
color and then this guy is gonna be next
in line and then we got this little guy
hiding back here he's this video is
probably gonna come out before the
lightning video so we'll put the
lightning right there and then yeah I
was sleeping back there what would I be
if I didn't have the Titan that was just
floating around not being used sitting
on the shelf
yeah we'll do that keep these all nice
and pretty just like that it's not a
sagging too bad I don't think I think
it's time I do something with this shelf
maybe I'll take the extra GPUs and put
them up there got pop caps and stuff for
some linear blocks we've unblocked
random dust batteries yeah I think
there's some improvements we can make
here there we go
I think that is a whole lot better not
to mention actually let's a little more
light bounce in the room that's good
who has noticed this already in the
video no it is not leaking
I just never topped it off after the
bottom radiator filled because when
radiators like this and not like this
there's a lot more air that can get
trapped in the top growth of the
radiator has a lot more room to actually
store air so this will take weeks
sometimes months to actually completely
bleed out but as you can see the color
has changed again I don't know why the
GPU loop keeps going dark the only thing
I could think is the 560 rad the 280 rad
have they were custom powder-coated or
coated whatever they do into the
radiator by hardware labs one thing I
could think of some of that made its way
into the color I don't know it's because
I mean it's the same radiator up top
it's just a 480 version but that one's
not doing it so it could have something
to do with the Titan blocks gonna have
to do with the PW or the pawn material
and the pomp of acetal material I don't
know but this is the second time now so
the other thing we're to do today is
we're gonna take this apart I'm gonna
show you guys how my flush system works
and then we're gonna refill it
hopefully it'll stop doing it well
before we can do that we got to finish
cleaning up this mess I've room to work
tackling this pile right here just put
the predator back in the box it's up to
film a commercial for that a funny
commercial and here's the fluid
brand-new bottle in reused cube get rid
of that junk one bottle is not enough to
fill that whole loop though so yeah
we'll worry about that might have to
drain the CPU loop as well put the two
together to dilute it
a little bit and then put in some
distilled water to dilute it slightly
guess what to see what happens this guy
here this is a little connects man that
little J made for me
she gave him a bazooka and then these
are his bazooka rockets so that's why
this guy's but on top of the computer
because she gave it to me to put up
their eyes knocked over the trashcan gg
so I haven't decided I'm gonna do with
this guy yeah I know it still has a lot
of parts in there yeah some really nice
parts I've just been chilling in there
as you can see get this storm damage
let's just truck my scope what good
thing that thing is a pile of garbage
anyway so yeah this actually has a lot
of parts in there right now that's a
980ti with a water block just chillin
mostly because I haven't decided what
I'm gonna do yet the cables look like
garbage because they weren't meant for
this build but then again I'm learning
this case does not have a lot of room
for you know cables so in the downsides
of this case is there's not really any
place to hide cables very well
especially one with a I'll put that on
later especially ones with long cables
and that these are not long cables so
let's figure that one out anyway we'll
get this place in order and then we'll
go tackle that when someone's blowing up
my phone they really want my attention
so recently I put up a video where I
murdered murdered my as rock board by
drilling into it by doing the predator
2:40 review and you guys were like well
how does it compare to other coolers
should we compare you know how about the
220 X or how about compared to the H 100
well I whoa that was about to be a mess
okay that was a really close call trying
to clean up and I would have gotten this
all over the floor so first up that
we're gonna compare it to H 100 I and
we're also going to compare it to this
protect 220 X so we are going to be
doing some head-to-head competition
between these two failures this one's
got a lot of is that normal
listen to that
oh dear well the 220 ex isn't off to a
very good start anyway and then the H
100 ISO will be putting those against
the predator and seeing who is king of
all in once I'm actually really curious
as to what is rolling around in here
because loose items are a quick way to
damage things oh well all of the
retention screws are just kind of
chilling down there because there's a
big-ass tear in the package all right
someone's learning to walk and in doing
so she continues to get stuck on the
table she said help me don't just film
this help man hey
you want to be a faint you won't be
famous in the comments no no no really
it's not all it's cracked up to be kiddo
so I still have to do the review of this
guy - this is the GT Omega race or art
cockpit and it's got the gaming rig I
built it's just been sitting here like
doing nothing this system is so nice
yeah it's been doing nothing oh and this
is baby Jail yeah you're gonna go in
baby Jail get in there girl and your
shits very concerned
okay so allow me to reaffirm my love for
my horas gaming my Thunder gaming mat
once again you see how tore up this
thing looks I mean seriously this this
just looks kind of nasty right my kid
has been slobbering on that these
scratches are all from her taking mater
on my lap and she had like a CPU cover
or whatever and she was like and she was
like scratching it real bad you know
babies so anyway all you I do take some
invisible glass or any glass thing er
this is just glass cleaner keyboard
clicking spray so tip the glass cleaner
and seriously just spray spray I was
like oh my god this thing was working if
I just spray it on and then take a
microfiber cloth or a cotton cloth or
anything and then just start wiping it
down I'm not sure what material this is
but it comes clean with glass cleaner
and will look good as new
I mean it's freaking amazing and it
saves your desk because these desks
would look worse than they already do if
I didn't have one of these and when all
is said and done that's what it looks
like there's a little bit of where here
from where the mouse is but other than
that you see how nicely that came back
okay so this is realistically about as
organisation's kind of get and I think
it's a big improvement over what we had
I just left that out because I don't
know what to do yet with that build but
yeah everything looks pretty good if you
ask me about the GPU shelves situated I
still think I need to put some supports
on that thing because it's pretty bad
it's leaning quite a bit it worries me
actually so you can see with the lights
off just how much the colors changed
actually in both loops the CPU hoop is
looking kind of dark as well in any case
time to do some maintenance because that
is ugly oof looks like someone took a
diarrhea in my loop so I know you
guys have probably seen it but I've got
this second table that I keep underneath
that one that I pull out and do my
builds on so a little tip for you
IKEA tables are adjustable on height so
you can adjust one lower and slide it
under the other one keep it out of the
way protip all right so here's the back
side of skunkworks
and this is my drain valve right here
it's just a tea valve here from bits
power when the valves going that way
it's closed when the valve is going go
parallel with the loop it's open you
can't see it but back inside off the
radiator i have a junction block where
I've got this tube coming off with the
drain and it's at the lowest part of the
loop that's the biggest thing you need
to know when you do a drain it's got to
be at the lowest point of the loop so
what I'll do is I'll unthread this I'll
thread in a tube with a fitting and run
that to a bottle and then when I open up
the up at the top and open up the
reservoir air can come in and then when
I turn that valve the water or the
coolant will just run out so keep that
in mind if you're doing your drains you
can use a tee you can use tubing to a
fitting like this to be able to drain
your system it just has to be the lowest
point of the loop or it won't drain
anything below it so that's the color of
the stuff that came out of the GPU loop
it's got to be flux but it's already
been flushed once and it's doing it
again so I don't understand why this has
happened technically it's been flush
twice now if you wanna know the truth so
I don't know why it keeps changing color
like this it could be some sort of a
chemical reaction between the metals and
the coolant but that doesn't make sense
because I have the same coolant and the
same metals in that loop and it didn't
do it so it's something to do with one
of these lower radiators it's probably
flux but hey whatever alright so we're
gonna go ahead and drain the CPU loop to
because I'm gonna mix the new coolant
and that coolant together that way
they'll be the exact same shade and and
add the distilled water to it together
otherwise they won't match because that
was older than the new ones gonna be so
that's a little trick we're gonna mix
them together so that the color
identical
and that's the fresh fluid mix all ready
to go nice and bright so we mixed it all
together well not the old fluid from the
GPU loop we took some of the fluid from
the CPU loop brand-new bottle and
distilled water made our new premix here
so there we go we'll put it in will
bleed the CPU loop and then we'll do the
GPU loop and hopefully it'll be done
it's a never-ending project I swear
now in order to bleed it I just use a
second power supply over here that's
plugged directly into the pumps that way
I have to power on the system so when I
turn on the power supply you can see
that the pumps will run but gotta turn
it off because that one's gonna be dry
don't let the pumps go dry like that
that's kind of a neat effect out there
look at that the air making its way out
so mesmerizing
it's gonna take a little while for this
thing that completely bleed and make the
pump stops sounding noisy with little
micro bubbles in there turning it on and
off and shaking it around that all helps
but if you gonna shake it make sure you
plug up the holes on the top there so
I'm gonna get some lunch and we'll let
this thing run so this is what it's like
to be the wife of a youtuber we watched
knit we watched Netflix and chill all
day hey do you want to do wanna Netflix
and chill sure why not anyway guys I
guess that wraps this one up let me know
if you guys want to see me do more of
these blog e type videos I think it's
kind of fun because allows me to get
work done while still creating content
for you guys because there's a lot
there's a lot of times a video might get
skipped or not make it out because it
turns out that I had other things I had
to get done so I couldn't get to the
video but if those other things are
interesting then maybe I'll try and vlog
it and now that I've got this Sony you
know a x-33 camera with that glorious
1080p 60fps it's technically a 4k camera
but I don't see any point in vlogging in
4k to be honest I figure then we'll the
maybe we'll do more vlogging type stuff
you know get out and about and start
doing things worth vlogging vloggerfair
really made me want to revive the blog
channel I haven't gotten around to it
yet but yeah it's definitely made me
want to revive it and becoming friends
with John from John and Nikki vlogs or
pranksters in love makes me want to
start maybe pranking the wife I
accomplished something today and made a
video at the same time so with that time
to get on out of here guys thanks for
watching and we will definitely see you
in the next one I'll see me for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
