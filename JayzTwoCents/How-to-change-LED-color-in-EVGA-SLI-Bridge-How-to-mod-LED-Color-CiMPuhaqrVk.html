months ago an Instagram when I was
building skunk works version 3 or
version 4 or whatever version we're on I
don't even know maybe it's three point B
who knows I showed that I did some
custom work to my SLI bridges now if you
remember in the past I was using the
EVGA Pro bridge Pro SLI bridge this is
the 3-way one but these light up but
usually they light up and they're kind
of boring just a white LED and I thought
maybe I'd go ahead and do a how-to video
showing you guys exactly how I change
the LED colors in the pro bridges now
I'm using the s2 or the virgin to bridge
and these are even better candidates for
this mod so don't go anywhere because
this is how you can really make your
system pop with color if you're using
one of the EVGA SL EVGA EBG I you can do
whatever EVGA silent series power
supplies offer excellent silence and
efficiency through their new EVGA Eco
mode technology and also features a
seven year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more now the problem I had with
the first version here of the pro sli
bridge was the fact that the LEDs were
backlit and I mean granted talking me
backlit but what I mean is it's actual
dots of LEDs behind this shining through
so give you gives you a real onion onion
ofor meiting so no matter how you went
about it the EVGA didn't light up nice
and solid well with the Prout
bridge version to here they actually
went with side lighting side LED
lighting that will illuminate a white
piece of plastic that makes it nice and
uniform as you can see mine glows yellow
because of this mod now obviously my pro
bridge is not silver like everyone
else's this I just simply disassembled
the thing and painted the aluminum part
a gray color that matches the gunmetal
color that's in my case so if you want
to know more about the spray-painting
Paul's Hardware actually did a video
recently we didn't collaborate this I'm
just shouting him out because I thought
it was a good video about how to print
paint your SLI bridges granted his was
the flexible ribbon bridge painting
process is still pretty much the same so
let's go ahead and turn around here
let's this is
blissing and show you exactly what you
need to know to get this thing a nice
custom color so here's the v1 and v2
side by side just so you guys can kind
of see you know how much they've changed
the v2 is actually really big especially
with this metal piece here now as with
all things to do the job properly you're
going to need some tools I'm only going
to be using this multi-tool and I again
I have mentioned this I don't know how
many times this is kind of like my go-to
tool because it's got so many things
inside of it so you've got your driver
handle and then in here you've got also
two multi bits this one's in there
really tight that's what she said come
on holy crap there we go so you've got
two different sizes of Phillips and then
you've got two different sizes of flat
heads and then here you actually have a
nut driver that's got two different
sizes on here I believe it's got a 1/8
mil and a 10 mil so these are also very
common like the small one here this is
perfect for your like power supply
screws or case screws and you've got a
10 mil which isn't really used anywhere
in computers but anyway so really what
you are going to need though is a
flathead screwdriver and you're going to
need a Phillips head screwdriver if
you've got sort of a multi tool kit or
something like this a little screwdriver
kit this would also come in very handy
so anyway those are the tools are gonna
be using today now the method I'm using
to turn the LEDs yellow in the EVGA Pro
bridges is identical for both the
disassembly process is a little bit
different on the pro bridge version 1
these are Torx head screws right here so
you need to make sure you have small
Torx heads and that's where this kit
came in handy is this kit right here on
the top these are all torques on the pro
bridge version 2 these are just Phillips
heads so for the sake of this video
we're gonna do the tutorial here on the
v2 but the process and the way I'm
changing LED color works on both so on
the back of the pro bridge here you're
just gonna loosen up both of these
Phillips head screws careful not to lose
them they are pretty tiny as I say that
everything's just kind of falling around
so we're gonna set those
now the second you do that the aluminum
piece and everything is just going to
come apart as you can see those two
screws are what's holding everything
together now at this point this is where
you can go ahead and paint this metal
piece it's just aluminum and you can you
know spray-paint it without even having
to sand it I didn't because it's a
really texture and kind of a satin
material it's like a bead blasted
aluminum paint is gonna stick to it
really good so pick your favorite color
paint you can make that match your
system as well red black white blue
whatever set that aside and then you'll
see here on the probe red it's kind of
separated now you want to be careful
because if you look inside there you
have actually got a small wire that's
connected there so you're gonna want to
very very carefully simply lift up on
this wire it literally lifts up now I'm
gonna try and do this again with an
extreme close-up so you guys can see
what I did but it doesn't it doesn't
pull out it pulls up so showing this
once again here with extreme close-up
this is and my nasty fingers I've been
working on my car don't don't judge me
anyway there it is right there
again just slightly pull up as you can
see it just pops right out all right so
this is what the pro bridge looks like
without anything attached to it so you
can go ahead and set this aside we're
not gonna be doing anything to this what
we need to do now is online you're not
gonna see it simply because it's already
been popped out but there's gonna be a
couple of little like plastic weld on
these four holes you can see right here
there are four silver holes where
there's gonna be prongs that stick
through and then there's gonna be like
dabs of plastic on there now what I did
was I just took a tiny flathead or in my
case an even smaller flathead from this
kit and I just simply pried up on those
plastic pieces to break those little
tabs off and it's not going to damage
anything it's just basically they stuck
it through and then they put like a dab
of plastic kind of a melted plastic on
there and they will pop right off
and then when you do that the rest of
this thing will pretty much just come
off on its own but you might have to
take a small Phillips or flathead and
kind of pry up on the sides here and
trust me this looks kind of scary
because it's bending but you're not
going to hurt anything and then once you
get all of the sides up this is the part
that we are actually modifying here and
as you can see you can kind of see how I
did it already so this is the light
panel that is inside of the pro bridge
so this led wire lights up an LED that's
on the side right here and it's recessed
let's see if I can actually show you
that
now this LED right here is actually
recessed as you can see so it's kind of
even with the plastic which is gonna
make this thing side lit and it's gonna
make the entire panel illuminate that's
how we're getting nice even color now
the other piece we have in here is this
little plastic kind of a shield which is
what makes the EVGA logo flush right
here and this thing will just pop out
once you get all those but we don't need
to do anything with this in fact we're
gonna just go ahead and leave this
inside the pro bridge and as you can see
here I have got these different layers
of film now these are just amber pieces
of flash film now if you guys know
anything about photography you'll know
that you can buy these these layers of
film that actually go on top of your
flash so that you could add color or
warmth or color correction to your flash
it's that way you don't actually you
know get that harsh white light that you
get with a flash on a camera now you can
find these at any camera store Samy's
camera online they just come in sheets
of plastic and they're designed
literally to be taped over the top of
your flesh and you can get them in blue
red amber green magenta pretty much any
color of the rainbow
obviously I chose amber here now the
more layers of this stuff that you use
the more intense the color is going to
be so because we want to change a white
light which is very pure I'm using four
layers of this and all I did was take
them and cut them to size so that they
fit in between those black prongs so
I'll go ahead and sit those in there
they are not glued because this mod is
completely reversible you can change the
color later so as long as you make it so
that they fit in between those prongs
and then completely cover the EVGA logo
then you're not going to have any you
know non-uniform color so that's how I
made it yellow there's nothing modified
to the bridge there's nothing modified
to the light panel the only modified was
the color of the bridge it's metal
support it so and that's it so then you
go ahead and reverse the order of which
we took it apart to put it back together
now because you broke off those plastic
tabs here you're probably thinking how
the heck is this thing gonna stay in
place well the prongs are still slightly
bigger than the actual light bar itself
so those will literally just snap back
down in there if you listen I can
actually get them to to line up you want
to be careful you don't want to break it
there so those just snap back in there
and as you can see there was no there
wasn't even really a reason for them to
glue those down it won't be technical
about it it's can only go in one way
because the way that the holes are keyed
and then basically you just put the
thing back together now let's go ahead
and talk about how to put the plug back
in here now like we already talked about
the plug is not it doesn't snap in or it
doesn't slide in it snaps in so all
you're gonna do is you're gonna take the
plastic piece here and this this part
gets a little bit funky because you have
the plastic part hanging on here you
could technically do this before
snapping it in and then reassemble
everything this is just the way I'm
doing it so you're gonna take this
you're gonna line it up flat with the
prongs it is keyed and you're simply
gonna push down on it that's it that's
all you got to do there are little tabs
on there that will keep you from doing
it the wrong way but once you line it up
and you push it down there it's not
going anywhere so now the only thing
left to do is line it all back up put
the screws down make sure when you put
this thing down that that wires not
pinched on anything it should kind of
slide up and go right in between the SLI
solder points there so line it up take
those little terminals there for the
holes inside the metal piece push it in
it's only gonna go one way by the way
so if you'd have it upside down it's not
gonna work flip it over
slides right in take your screws and
retighten that's it
this whole mod should take five minutes
at the most the part that will take
longer is probably cutting your plastic
pieces down to size and getting these
stupid little screws to realign up I
don't have a magnetic screwdriver head
here because you know when you're
working with pcs you don't want magnets
so I don't use I'm losing my man card
here because I can't get it in the hole
how in the hell did I ever end up with
two daughters geez so that's it pretty
easy huh I bet at some point during this
video someone was thinking to themselves
well I don't have the e BGA and it's a
EB GI EVGA Pro bridge so why does this
matter well to be honest this technique
will work with any sort of LED
backlighting that's gotta shine through
hole I don't know if that's actually the
official term for it but if it's
backlighting that light light shines
through like a cutout similar to either
this bridge here right this is just a
cutout that light shines through the pro
bridge - for anything else in your
system that you can easily disassembled
and get some film in there between the
actual light source and the part that
shines the light through if you can get
film in there then you can change the
LED colors of anything so technically
this mod works on any sort of LED
structure that's built that way all
right you guys have requested this video
I went ahead and did it hope this helps
you guys send me your pictures of what
you guys do with this technique on your
system send them to at J's two cents on
Twitter or at J's two cents for Facebook
fan page and I'd love to see what you
guys do to get creative with the flash
film if you guys want to know but where
to buy the flash film Samy's camera
online carries it B&amp;amp;H photo online
carries it heck I got mine off Amazon
for like four bucks so you guys can do
that in fact you can use the amazon link
down below if you guys want to help
support the channel
I'm never gonna be opposed to that but
anyway regardless of where you guys get
it make sure you show me your pictures
of what you guys do because I think
custom LED color is really how you can
really make your system start to pop and
be your own and get some color in there
so anyway that's all for today guys
thanks for your continued support so
many amazing people out there following
and supporting this channel and that's
what keeps me going and wanting to do
these things for you guys not to mention
it's fun it's fun to see what you know
375 thousand people are doing to their
systems or want to do to their systems
so anyway guys I'm gonna get on out of
here thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next video oh yeah and if you
want more tutorials make sure you
comment down below on what it is you
want me to show you how to do and let's
make a baby because obviously as I
showed you guys I have a terrible time
getting it in the hole</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
