I'm gonna do a video I have been asked
to do literally as long as my channel
has been around I don't know why it's
taking me so long to do this I even said
on Tech Talk the other night that I was
going to do this video and you guys
flipped out like yes please do this
video and that is like the ultimate how
to set up speed fan guide because
although it's an amazing free utility to
control your fans and actually a lot of
other things you can do with this
utility on your system today we're just
going to focus on fan control though
it's not the easiest to set up and in
fact it can be very very difficult for
most people to understand all of the
gibberish that's on the screen so today
that is what we are going to help you do
it's a free utility download it now the
link is in the description they didn't
sponsor this video I'm just so that I
don't get a ton of people going how do
you download it and put it in the
description and then we'll we will do
some on-screen tutorials here to show
you exactly how to set this up I've been
using it for years don't know why it's
taking me so long to actually do this
video before we get started with today's
video we got to take care of a little
bit of business and that is today's
sponsor is Squarespace comm / Jays two
cents if you're looking at starting a
website or e-commerce site and you just
don't know where to get started then
Squarespace com is perfect for you
Squarespace offers a huge range of
templates that are fully customizable so
that it can meet the look and demand of
your product or your site and it's
integrated ecommerce tools make it
extremely easy to keep track of things
like shipping inventory restocking
notifications when your inventory starts
to get low now right now if you guys
head on over to Squarespace com / Jays
two cents and use offer code J's that's
J a y'see you get 10% off your order
and not only that if you sign up for a
year with space you get a domain
absolutely free so head on over to
Squarespace com / Jays two cents and use
offer code J's now or after the video or
just pause the video go and come back
that'd work too
alright so here's the program right here
if you guys don't know where to get it
again just look in the description of
this video and I put a link a link there
so you guys can download it it's
completely free I don't want to be
bombarded with a bunch of people go
where do you get the program on Google
Google's your friend - but anyway it's
called speedfan SPE SPE edy
and it's hard to say ee e anyway I
digress
I've got a camera down here wanting out
my fans that we're going to use for
example so that you at least can see it
working if I was just showing you how to
click a bunch of buttons and you didn't
see the effect of it then that would be
a really shitty tutorial and I don't
want the tutorial to be any shittier
then it's already going to be because
I'm the one making it but anyway let's
go and open up speedfan here
yes windows I want to open it so I
clicked it stupid anyway here it is
right here
what it's doing right now is it is
scanning all of the different busses on
your motherboard it's learning where
everything is that way it knows how to
control itself now the problem is once
this is done you see all this
information right you see your CPU usage
you see all your threads you see fans
right here normally you'll see rpms I
don't have RPM showing on mine because
I'm using a splitter or splitters and it
just yeah anyway it messes up that you
can see all your temperatures here for
your GPUs and you can see your
motherboard temps and CPU and all that
stuff and then you can see you have your
different PWM s and what tends to happen
right here and people go all this
software sucks is they start trying to
control their fans going but nothing's
happening da the software sucks this is
this is stupid
but guys what you have to do is be fans
you have to configure it now this
program is made by you know it's
completely free it's all made by I think
it's one guy who just does this as a
hobby it's not like getting a ton of
support meaning he's not going to go and
pre configure this so that it sets up
for every single motherboard on the
market that's impossible to do so you
have to actually use the scanner up here
to try and learn where everything is on
your motherboard so as you can see right
here I set PWM to zero and as you can
see by looking at the camera down here
my fans are still going full speed
nothing has changed so what you're going
to do next you're going to hit configure
that's going to bring up this guy right
here and make it so you can actually see
this I guess and then you're going to go
over here to advanced now real quick
there's a lot of things we can do on
here there's there's lots and lots of
function built into speedfan but today
we are focusing only on fan control
because if you can't get the fan control
to work then you might not be interested
in what the rest of the software can do
so right now yes fan can
is all that we are going to do now if
you click on advanced right here you get
this drop down here and it shows you all
of the busses here on your chips you can
see we've got our three video cards now
we've got this one right here this
dollar sign a 4-0 on is a that's
actually going to be where our pwms are
here they are PWM 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and you can
see the modes are set to on/off now the
only one I'm going to worry about right
now is PWM mode 1 that's the header I've
got my fans plugged into for my GPU loop
and that's what we're going to use as
our demonstration today but as you can
see by having it set to on/off it's
literally just that the fans are either
on full speed or off and the motherboard
is what actually set that when the
motherboard booted up so all this did
was scan what was going on with the PWM
what did the motherboard have
pre-configured and then speedfan will
match that setting rather than trying to
take over so what I'm going to do right
now is I'm going to look at the
drop-down here for set 2 and you can see
we've got on/off software-controlled
on/off smart guardian now you might see
some different things in your
motherboard again this is not going to
be exact for your motherboard there are
going to be a lot of different
variations every single motherboard BIOS
is setup different so you're going to
have to play around with this what I'm
trying to do with today's video it's
just more or less give you the direction
of where to go to start learning how to
use this software now I don't know why
on/off is listed twice I truly don't
smart guardian when I set that again
nothing happens on my motherboard but on
your motherboard they might slow down
suddenly because you see how right here
on its own when I click smart guardian
that went down to 27% that's where the
fans should theoretically be spinning at
but as you can see right here they are
still running full speed like absolutely
full speed nothing changed or noisy
absolutely atrocious so we're going to
go back to configure go back to advanced
go back to that chip we're going to
change the setting again now yours might
say manual yours might say temperature
offset it might you might see a bunch of
different things here than what I see so
again you're going to have to play with
it manual will more than likely be what
you would expect it to be manual but
there should be a
setting they're called
software-controlled and what that means
is let speedfan control the fans it's
basically saying override the PWM bus
and let my software speedfan control the
fans so when I click that watch what's
going to happen oh dang you see that
look at the fans see they're slowing
down oh my gosh they're like super quiet
now
and this load all the way down to 27
percent because as you can see that's by
default where the PWM went to now once
you figure out which one it is and which
one works click this button here that
says remember it if you don't every time
you open the software this is going to
revert back to wherever the motherboard
sets it to so hit OK check it out we now
have fan control I literally just turned
my fans off cool isn't it now I could be
that all the way up to 100 if I wanted
BAM like that now they're going back to
100% I could also set that to 50%
whatever I could set it to 48 if I want
because 50s just for noobs all right J
that's all fine and dandy but I what if
I want my fans to speed up when things
get hot and slow down or even straight
up turn off when things are not needed
when it comes to you know things are
running nice and cool what if we don't
need all that those those fans spinning
we're we're not under load well sir or
madam or child I'm glad you asked
because if you go back into configure
you have fan control now you've got
advanced fan control you're going to
want to click that by default it's not
going to be clicked now you're going to
add a fan controller so we are going to
add let's name this same this GPU
control all right GPU fan control we'll
call it that ok cool we've done that now
what nothing happened I mean nothing's
happening so what do we do well you're
going to go back into your fan control
you're going to click on that and as you
can see you now get a drop-down here
with a bunch of stuff so we're going to
click click controlled speed because we
want to control it we want to set up PWM
one because that's the one I have this
is the header that controls that fan and
are these fans right down here and
you're going to have to
kind of label these yourself trying to
figure out PWM one is PWM one on my
motherboard is actually system fan one
not CPU fan or any of that believe it or
not my motherboard won't allow me to
control CPU fan via speed fan so you're
going to have to play around that so I'm
not using the CPU headers at all on this
motherboard so anyway we're going to
control PWM one now on the method I
always use some of speeds instead of max
of speeds now on temperatures you have
to now tell speed fan what do you want
to control the speed what temperature
probe are you going to use to control
the speeds so you can hit add then you
get this little pop-up here which shows
you all of the different temperatures
that are located inside of your system
so these are all the temperature probes
we've got our three GPUs we've got temp
one two and three these are actually
going to be my chipset and vrm I've got
our hard drive temperatures because
believe it or not your hard drives and
your SSDs actually have temperature
probes in them and then you have got all
of your different cores right here
now I'm going to use GPU one which is
the top one listed here to control the
fans that you see here on this camera
because this is my main GPU radiator so
I'm going to hit okay so when you click
this right here this is your fan curve
okay you can see we've got a range of 30
C to 60 C so that says 30 C or below
will run a minimum of whatever this dot
is set to and then this says right here
at 60 C it will be a hundred percent so
anything above 60 C will ramp these fans
up to 100 now you can pull this in by
clicking the left arrow arrow so as you
can see iran or an arrow is anyway as I
click that left you can see now our
range is going to be commander right now
our range is between 30 and 50 and
because I have water-cooled GPUs I'm
going to set these this to maybe 55 and
I'm going to set the lower number here
much lower so that we don't have the
fans speeding up because again
water-cooled yeah you know you know what
I'm saying there so this is what our
curve looks like right there okay we'll
hit okay again nothing happened what the
heck it's still at zero well it's
because you have to click automatic fan
speed now watch what happens when I
click this
BAM that jumped up to 22 the fans didn't
actually kick on you can see they're
kind of trying but that's only because
I've got four fans actually actually I
technically have eight fans hooked up to
that particular circuit so we need to
make our lower we need to make our start
speed Jets a little bit higher so we'll
do that we'll hit okay ah there they go
so now that 30% is where we are idling
now and as we start up things like
heaven benchmark and whatnot it's going
to ramp up and slow down now as one
other thing we actually have to
configure here and that's because speed
fan has a safeguard that says if
temperatures reach a certain warning
level then just max out the fan just
ramp the fans up as fast as they'll
freaking go because we're trying to save
our and we don't want to blow up
and that's going to be right here where
it says GPU GPU and GPU and if that's
what we're using to control our fans you
need to set the warning right here the
warning is set to 70 C and I have it
basically two things are going to happen
if our temperature on the graphics cards
and you have to set these individually
reach 70 C a pop-up is going to come up
at the bottom of the screen and say
warning GPU has exceeded 70 C or
whatever that setting is and then it's
going to ramp the fans to 100% to
control yo to try and cool itself down
now watch what happens if I set this to
say 20 C absolutely nothing there goes
we got a little flame showing right here
because we're at 30 C so we're above
threshold of where I said it do you see
how the fans ramped up to a hundred yeah
it's it thinks right now that it's
overheating and the little pop-up came
up it just came up on my other screen so
I'm going to set this back to 70 okay
now watch that little thing went away
and we went back down to 31 C so you can
set where your warning temperatures are
so that you can keep an eye on things
you can even make a little audio thing
happen you know a little beeping and
stuff - that's really loud and obnoxious
to kind of get your attention like hey
you shits running really hot but anyway
guys that's really all there is to it
when it comes to speed fan there's a lot
of other things you can do with this
again I kept this very specific to speed
fan or the fan
speed control because as you can see
this video is still pushing 15 minutes
or more just showing you how to control
that but I hope that that has helped you
guys here oh and check this out if I
have automatic fan speeds selected and I
try and manually slow that down being it
goes right back to 31 so you can't you
can't accidentally change that you're
just going to let it control itself yep
there you go so yeah that's how how I
control my fans so many people ask me
how I control my fans this is how I do
it this is how I've always done it and
yeah it works out great for me so I got
these fans set to run really
whisper-quiet
30 30 percent or 31 percent when I'm not
gaming when I'm gaming everything will
then ramp up pretty quickly anyway guys
thanks for watching I hope you've
enjoyed today's video and tutorial if
you want me to cover more topics in the
future regarding software you know
settings and controls let me know I'm
going to do some overclocking stuff
coming up for 1080 showing you how to do
overclocking on that because it's
actually a little different on the
Pascal cards and we'll talk about that
very very soon and I I need you guys to
kind of help me just decide what it is
you want to see so anyway time to get
out of here thanks for watching guys and
I will see you in the next video
whatever that may be probably tomorrow
yeah
I've said too much</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
