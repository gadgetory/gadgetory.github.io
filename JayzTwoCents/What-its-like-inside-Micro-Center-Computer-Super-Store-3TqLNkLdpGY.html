are at the grand reopening of the Micro
Center store here in Denver Colorado got
a lot of people here a lot of things to
check out raffles we're gonna build a
computer and give it away so we've got a
lot to show you guys so I'm gonna take a
quick tour of the store and show you
exactly what's new so if you've never
been to a Micro Center it's actually
quite interesting
everything is on display we're talking
pre-built systems laptops tablets and
you can get hands-on with it you come
into the store everything's on display
they've got a knowledgeable staff to
teach you about it if you have any
questions but we're talking anything you
can imagine we've got surface laptops
we've got Asus Acer Samsung you name it
it's all on display I know about you but
one of the most frustrating things to
try and buy online is a monitor you have
no idea what's gonna look like until you
get it set up and finding a store to go
and check out these monitors in person
is kind of difficult so that's why Micro
Center has pretty much every monitor
they sell on display we're talking basic
panels for your basic web browsing and
word processing all the way up to your
extremely high refresh rate high
resolution gaming panels so you can come
in to the store see it on display you'll
find just the right panel for you now
we're gonna go over to build your own
trust me I know you lied you guys were
watching this video because you want to
see more about computers and yes micro
Center is an amazing computer store but
it's not just computers as you can see
behind me we have a wall of multimedia
this is TVs the latest samsung q LEDs LG
OLED it's all on display you can see it
in person but not only that you can also
get any supplies you need for your home
cinema or home theater we're talking TV
mounts speaker mounts speakers obviously
wiring it's all available right here at
microsensor so here we are in the build
your own section of micro Center this is
this is probably why you're here
watching this video so this is the case
section right here they've got all the
popular cases on display because buying
a case is one of those things that's not
one size fits all and seeing it in
pictures and seeing it in builds doesn't
always tell the whole story so being
able to see the case in person kind of
get hands-on with it feel the weight of
it the overall size makes it a lot
easier for you to make your case
purchase but as you can see over here
we've got a complete section of 3d
printing stuff as well a lot of
do-it-yourself not just build your own
but do it yourself you can even get all
the components to do circuit boards and
stuff here you name it you can do it but
if we come over this way just kind of
hand this way quickly this whole section
the
all the way to the wall down there is
build your own and they also have water
cooling stuff in stock now because now
they are stocking ek water block
products so let's go ahead and see what
we can find over here and build your own
so if you want power supplies they've
got your power supplies you want fans
RGB fans they've got it Louis all this
right here I know I mean viewers we got
viewers here too this is the section
that I'm excited about because we
actually had to use this section today
we're building a system in the back room
and we realized we didn't have a fill
bottle to fill the system yeah I know
right so check this out we actually have
a full isle of water cooling components
not just a i/os and closed loop closed
loop coolers but complete open loop
stuff so as you can see right here this
this is the wall of fittings so you've
got all the different fittings on
display you can see what they are you
got your little pull out and there are
your fittings right there we have
utilized this in the Tustin store many
times in a pinch we run down there pick
up a fitting and there it is as you can
see we've got radiators tubing
reservoirs pumps parts as well you need
parts for your water cooling stuff we're
talking like Oh rings and different
screws they've got all of it
this this whole section is neat but this
is obviously my pride and joy now
graphics cards are one of those things
that for the longest time was not really
easy to go and buy it wasn't in stock
anywhere but as you can see Micro Center
has a huge stock of graphics cards the
good stuff is all behind glass and then
obviously is a lot of it on shelves even
on the other side so if you need a
graphics card this is where you're gonna
find it if you need memory obviously
they've they've got your memory right
there look at it look at it there's a
lot of it now of course we need to talk
about motherboards and CPUs all of the
latest and greatest all the different
brands all the different chipsets they
are all here on display at a micro
Center the CPUs you name it they've got
it you definitely want to go into a
micro Center and check out the bundle
deals because trust me when I say you
will save a ton but as you can see
whatever your taste may be they're gonna
have it obviously in keeping with the
theme of hands-on you can see behind me
we have the periphery ohio's it got
keyboards on display obviously we have a
huge Corsair set up behind here so the
best part about a store like this is
where as you look at an online catalog
you can see a lot of the products and
stuff but you really can't get hands-on
with it
obviously hands-on is the theme
this newly remodeled gender store for
micro Center so micro Center has this
thing called the knowledge bar we can
bring in your product so you can get
help in service and a little bit of
training on how to use it if you have
any questions they also have a
full-featured service center as you can
see behind me if you have something
that's not working right and needs
repair and you're not comfortable doing
it yourself then you can get it done
here at my croissant every little fun
fact the knowledge bar was actually out
before the other service bar that's out
there which we won't name so as I
mentioned in the start of this video
though I'm not here just to show you
guys what's new at the Denver store I am
here to build a water-cooled computer
that will be raffled away today so you
know we got to do now we got to go
building
okay so here's the build right here
Shiloh was the lucky winner of the build
the Swift monitor as well as the
keyboard the mouse the mouse pad and
obviously the tower being the most
important part so congratulations thank
you thank you
and yeah so guys huge thank you to Micro
Center for bringing me out here for this
grand opening getting to build this
computer which we're gonna to switch
some lights out on real quick though
because yeah I Jade it hit that said so
guys if you live in the Denver area come
and check out the newly remodeled new
Grand Opening a regrind opening of the
Micro Center store here in Denver
anything you could possibly need in
terms of tech multimedia on-the-go
mobile devices or obviously build your
