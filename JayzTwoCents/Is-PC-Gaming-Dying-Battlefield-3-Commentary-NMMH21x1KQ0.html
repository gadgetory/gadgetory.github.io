watching Jeeves to sense and Before we
jump into today's topic at hand and game
commentary I wanted to show you what is
probably one of the luckiest shots you
will see in all of battlefield 3 history
I was playing some rush here on kargh
Island just doing a little bit of
tanking and I was engaging this chopper
here and well we'll just go ahead and
let the video speak for itself
hey J I'm building a computer but I'm a
little worried that computer gaming is
dying should I build a computer or
should I just get a new console this is
a question that I'm getting every single
day over and over again from people that
are on the verge of building their first
PC but they're afraid that PC gaming as
a whole is dying
well guys I'm here to tell you that
without a doubt computer gaming
certainly is on a decline but let me
digress just a moment PC gaming is one
of those things that had been people
have been speculating and saying that
computer gaming is over it's dead it's
obsolete it's just a big giant dinosaur
on your desk and eventually there won't
be any games for it people have been
saying that for 20 years but now the
reality of it is that yes
computer gaming is on a decline major
manufacturers would tell you that every
single day there are less people buying
computer components than the day before
now does that necessarily mean that
computer gaming is dying I don't believe
that that's true
I don't believe computer gaming is dying
simply because games are always gonna be
developed on computers and I just want
to pause real quick and say that that
you have to admit that that was an epic
fly under that pipe right there ducking
under that thing and not crashing so
give me a little bit of props to that
but then of course you know I did this
so whatever it was still cool I think
but anyway back to the topic computer
gaming is always going to be around in
my opinion because a computer system is
what the games were being developed on
it doesn't matter if it's for the Xbox
or the PlayStation or for your tablet or
your iPhone your Android the main device
that developers use our computers and a
lot of devices that people are using is
actually a Mac but not address computer
gaming is one of those things that would
always be able to be around by default
now a lot of people will argue about the
optimization of computer gaming vs.
consoles and that would be very true
consoles are a lot more optimized for
the user experience than a computer is
there are so many variants in computer
builds it's impossible for developers to
build for every single computer
component and scenario out there in the
market but that's not gonna stop them
from developing games for computers
especially when it's low-hanging fruit
for sales and the fact that the game is
already developed for the console and it
requires a very small and easy port to
PC it's always gonna be around and
that's why you're able to get amazing
sales for steam sales and you know I
guess Origen has them too but steam
sales that's where you get amazing
prices on games because the games are
already around by default so it doesn't
really hurt the developer to offer you a
game for five bucks four bucks or nine
bucks or whatever it is so it's always
gonna be enticing to people like me who
just take pride and ownership and the
fact that I'm a PC gamer doesn't have
anything against consoles I own consoles
but PC gaming is my preferred platform
and because of that it makes me proud
that as people say well no PC gaming is
dying and I'm sitting here to tell them
you know it's not it's on a decline it's
not dying people have been telling me
for 20 years that PC gaming is dead and
it's absolutely pointless but check it
out here we are
battlefield 4 launching you got
battlefield 3 which was a huge success
you've got you know it's a big deal when
you build your first computer and you go
and you experience your first Steam sale
it's very exciting but I definitely want
to tell you that if you're thinking
about building your first computer or
buying a computer or you're just afraid
that PC gaming is gonna one day just be
gone PC gaming is going to continue to
evolve throughout the decades as it
always has the piece of gaming is always
going to be around now that's not to say
that PC gaming doesn't have its
disadvantages of course it's a bit more
expensive than the initial cost of
getting into PC gaming if you don't have
any systems you don't have any consoles
you don't have a PC a laptop nothing the
initial cost of getting into PC gaming
is a little bit more expensive which
would make a lot of people especially
parents say well I want to buy my 15
year old and Xbox instead of spending
the $900 or $1,000 or
ever it is they feel they need to pay on
a decent gaming computer yeah
consoles definitely beat out pcs when it
comes to unit per unit sales but when it
comes to the longevity of a computer the
amount of things that you can do on a
computer and they're not just gaming
systems they're full on productivity
machines there's a lot of advantages to
pcs as well and it doesn't take a lot to
convert a PC for productivity to be able
to play games and I just got tweeted
check it out
a little bit of a shout out there to use
steep oMG from Newegg all right back to
the topic but one of the things that
I've always loved about PC gaming
especially over the fact that in the
last 20 years I can't even count how
many times my friends and and now
colleagues at work have told me that
beats of PC gaming is dying why are you
doing this you've got dedicated
companies out there that their entire
livelihood practically depend on the
survival of PC gaming Nvidia Intel AMD
and while AMD maybe not as much today
because they bagged some pretty amazing
deals when it comes to the processor or
APU combos going into the new consoles
that was a huge huge move for consoles
and AMD but one of the things that's
really interesting is the flexibility in
a computer so you've got a company like
Nvidia that's been able to find a way to
integrate these new technologies that
have been replacing computers like your
Android device or your handheld tablets
and now finding a way to integrate them
together to where you can do PC gaming
on a handheld device wirelessly that's a
big deal that's a huge technology move
for the industry and whether or not it's
something that I agree with or that I
like I'm not personally a fan of the
Nvidia shield or the Nvidia grid but I
can tell you that it opens up a lot of
doors for the future and cloud-based
gaming so it keeps PC gaming alive and
it keeps both parties happy you've got
your Android device and your handheld
device and you're playing your PC game
while mobile because that's one of the
things that a lot of people didn't like
about PC gaming was that it was so
stationary and gaming laptops are
ridiculously overpriced and
just not worth it so I'm here to tell
you J's two cents on this day in October
2013 gaming PC may be on a decline but
so is everything else in this type of
economy in this day and age there's a
lot of things people are cutting back on
so if you are using those numbers to say
that PC gaming is dying you can use
those numbers to say that a lot of
things are dying cars driving and
clearly they're not but when it comes to
PC gaming we will always be around and
it's the type of club that I'm gonna
always enjoy being a part of because
it's just something that I really like
to be a part of
I love PC gaming I love gaming as a
whole I've been playing minion rush on
my iPhone now for I don't know how long
and I can't put the damn thing down if
you're a gamer you're really not gonna
care what you game on but if you're
thinking about getting into PC gaming
and you're afraid that all of a sudden
you're gonna wake up one day and PC
gaming is just completely gone and
fossilized and it's a thing of the past
I'm here to tell you that you don't have
to worry about that PC gaming is always
going to be around gaming as a whole is
always going to be around and it doesn't
matter if you're a console gamer or a PC
gamer the bottom line is gaming as a
community is what's going to keep these
devices around for a long long time and
it definitely helps when you have a lot
of PC dedicated channels like myself and
Barnacle E's and Linus tech tips and
TECA Martinez and Austin Evans and all
of these great dedicated PC advocates
it's very unlikely that PC is going
anywhere anytime soon and with the
amount of subscribers that all of these
channels are gaining every single day is
only creating and strengthening the
community that rally around pcs as a
whole just think about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
