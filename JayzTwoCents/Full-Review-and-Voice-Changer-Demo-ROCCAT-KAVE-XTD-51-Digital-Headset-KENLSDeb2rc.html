two cents going to bring you a review of
a product that I took a look at in CES
or at CES in January that I'm kind of
excited about and I've been using it for
a couple of weeks now so it's not going
to be an unboxing but we are going to be
taking a look today at the row cat cave
xtd 5.1 digital surround gaming headset
it's got some really unique features
that I can't wait to take a look at so
you guessed it we're gonna go ahead and
give it the old Jase new sense yes that
is a thing now I think and if it's not a
thing it should be a thing if it is a
thing and you don't like that thing well
too bad it's my thing
I think so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to break these into four
categories we're going to talk about
build quality sound quality microphone
quality and bonus features that come
along with these Roccat cave X TV 5.1
digital headphones so they're already
kind of long and hard to say so I'm just
going to refer to refer to these as the
cave headset from here on out there's
more than one type of cave so just be
mindful of that
first things first to build quality they
are extremely durable I mean I would not
be doing this if they weren't doing it
all weekend long at CES without any of
them breaking at least that I was able
to see they are made out of a few
different types of materials I mean
we've got plastic here up on the
headband we've got kind of a neoprene
padding here on the headband very
comfortable for long gaming sessions
don't really notice the weight on my
head at all the weight feels like it's
centralized and well more distributed
amongst my big ol noggin in my big dome
here so I didn't really get
uncomfortable with those they didn't
really pinch my head I'm really
sensitive under my ears and I don't like
headphones that pinch and push down on
my upper jaw or under my ear because I
get sensitive and I get headaches from
that these were not a problem they did
not do that to me now when it comes to
the material the surface material used
it's kind of a rubberized plastic on the
outside and it does have a polished
piano finish ring that goes around the
ear can and then you have kind of a
leatherette ear cups they're not
changeable by the way this is the ones
you have as the ones you have
and they're sort of like a d-shaped in
there they give you the D nos they said
remember like an oval shape which means
that your ears are intended to kind of
slide into them you kind of are you're
inserting your ear into them which could
kind of pose a problem for some people
if you're if your ears are really big
and I'm not I don't know say anything
against people big ears you know people
with big ears that say you have a really
big but if you have big ears you may not
find it comfortable that your ears have
to slide into there because they may
kind of fold up on you I think my ears
are the perfect size unfortunately
because my right ear lobe is bigger than
my left ear lobe I feel like I kind of
have to wiggle it on in there my right
ear just goes or my left ear goes right
in no problem the other problem is if
you don't have ear lobes like I do I
mean we all have different-shaped here
some of us have an attached ear lobe on
the bottom they just go straight into
your head rather than having this little
flippy flappy thing this is your ear by
the way if you didn't know this is your
ear it may not be as comfortable for you
because that part of your ear is not
going to slide in if you look at the way
that this is shaped on the bottom it's
definitely intended for your ears to
slide in and be completely completely
over the ear it's also designed to kind
of forward make your ears point slightly
forward that way the angle drivers on
the inside are shooting directly into
your ear giving you a really good
immersion when it comes to the sound now
I don't like the piano finish the
plastic polished finish on there because
I don't have a headset stand
I've been putting them down on my desk
and because I get moved around and stuff
they're already wearing right they're
wearing kind of dull so they looks kind
of scratched in that spot just because
that's where it contacts the desk so
that kind of sucks because I don't have
a headset stand it's more my bad than
theirs but whatever now they were
comfortable to wear long term I did not
have any sweating issues when I was
doing Tech Talk with these on and if you
guys tell that Tech Talk you know was
pretty funny and we'll get to why in a
little bit now build quality we just
talked about that sound quality when it
comes to sound quality they took me a
little bit to get used to and hear me
out on this I am used to stereo headsets
which means it's got a big cone driver
in there with a tweeter in the middle
and the tuning on them is very defined
for stereo sound
means hard-hitting bass low-frequency
bass because of the size of the driver
nice clear highs nice clear mids because
they have specific drivers for that now
because these are 5.1 surround and they
do have three drivers per head four ear
can I thought there were four it's
actually three there's three drivers per
ear can means there do not have a large
driver in there pushing the bass now
it's able to produce the bass frequency
down in the low ranges sub sub 50 Hertz
below 50 Hertz submarine a sub woofer
range which meant in games I did get
some rumbly explosions and things but
nothing near what I like or what I'm
used to so in the beginning my thoughts
on these were they're kind of dull now
they do give you a full digital EQ with
the software that's included with this
that you can go in and adjust the sound
of them but I've definitely felt they
were really heavy on the mids and highs
and really lacking on the lows and
that's quite frankly because of the size
of the drivers that they have to deal
with in here I'm not gonna fault them
for that because where it made up for it
was the very first time I played
battlefield 4 with a true 5.1 surround I
had them on and I went into the options
and I'm going okay you know there's
already sound happening I go into the
options I think okay so I take my mouse
right and I click on options go to audio
and then I go to high high quality or
high fidelity and then I go to surround
style 5.1 and I just was like oh my god
because then I started hearing in
general I was hearing jets and stuff fly
right but I was just hearing it flat all
of a sudden I heard the jet behind me I
heard the boat in front of me
simultaneously I heard footsteps over
here it was like oh my god I know where
everybody's at now I I spent less time
looking at the map because I could go by
sounds so I immediately went you know
what screw the fact that it's not super
bass heavy like I'm used to and love the
fact that I have complete surround
quality now you're going to have to go
in and play around with some of the EQ
settings to get the sound just right
because we all like different style of
sound some people hate bass some people
hate trouble you're gonna you can at
least go into the EQ and figure that out
for yourself and tune it to your liking
now let's go ahead and talk about the
next thing which is the microphone
quality you know in fact here's what
we'll do instead of talking about the
microphone quality at the end of this
video I'm going to go ahead and just
switch on over to the computer and I'll
do a recording with the microphone so
you guys can hear some of the different
voice changer sounds that are options
that are in there because they do
include a voice changer which if you saw
last week's Tech Talk was a whole lot of
fun and it's it it's amazing how many of
you people said that you wanted to buy
these now simply because of the
demonstration I was doing with the voice
changer and you know what it's a whole
lot of fun now it's going to talk about
bonus features when it comes to
controlling the thing you get this
little dongle that dongle I said dongle
dongles a funny word this goes on your
desk which gives you a few different
options you can control the sound right
here with this big giant knob if you
want to mute everything if you want to
mute the microphone mute the game sounds
meet the computer every years ago BAM
push that down everything lights up it's
completely muted at that point and you
can cycle through front Center woofer
and rear settings on here so you can
control the EQ from here as well having
got to go into the software which is
really nice you are able to change this
use this button right here to change the
channel on there to adjust the volume
for each of the different surround
settings you have a movie mode you've
got a speaker pastor we'll talk about
that in a second a mute button right
here and you have this Bluetooth phone
button right here well what the heck is
that
well when it comes to bonus features on
this row ket's thought ahead and said
you know sometimes you're in the middle
of gaming and rather than taking off
your headset or some people will take
their headset off and set it down if
you're in like teamspeak or something
and you're talking on the phone everyone
hears your conversation and it's just
kind of annoying well you can push that
phone button if you pair your mobile
device to this dongle here and you can
take your phone calls right from your
gaming headset without ever taking them
off your head or changing any settings
so you do have Bluetooth interaction
between a mobile device and this which
is pretty awesome I thought it was cool
I don't really know of anybody else that
does that so Roccat is kind of an
innovator in there as far as I know
someone else does it let me know so one
other thing I thought was really nice
about this when it comes to bonus
features was I don't like having to cost
go into my surrounds or my sound
settings and change to a USB headset as
my main device and then go okay I got to
go in and change back to my speakers if
I want to listen to speakers and I'm
constantly having to change settings
well I do have a set of Logitech 5.1
surround speakers on my desk but I only
have them set up in like a three channel
mode rather than surround because I have
nowhere back here to hook them up at so
I thought well I don't want have to keep
going back and forth well Roccat has
thought ahead and they've done true 5.1
audio pass-through on the back of this
so this now becomes your sound card this
becomes your audio pass-through and you
just push this speaker button on here to
go back and forth between headset and
speakers I love that because it takes
out the fact that I have to go into the
settings on the machine or in Windows
and constantly change what my default
sound source is alright so enough
talking about the build quality and
talking about this little dongle here
which I think kind of changes everything
oh one last thing the cord I don't like
the cord for one reason I would have
prefered they did a sleeved cord it's
completely rubberized which means it
completely gets tangled up with any cord
it touches it's just like a big grabber
it's just like it grabs any cable near
and it gets all tangled up in itself and
you end up looking like kind of like
this by the end of messing with it so I
hate rubberized and I truly did just
tangle myself up here
I don't like rubberized cords I would
have much rather preferred to have a
braided cord so anyway enough about that
let's go ahead and finish this review by
doing the microphone test and showing
you guys exactly how this thing sounds
and we'll give you guys my final
thoughts okay so here we are now with
the row cat cave xtd 5.1 digital
headphones now you that's what we're
talking on now this microphone right
there now I you guys have to notice
immediately already that the sound
quality is not really all that good I'm
surprised considering the quality of
everything else about this microphone is
so great I'm confused as to why the
microphone quality in it is so bad I
don't know maybe it has something to do
with the fact that this is what it took
for them to keep the price range
somewhat controlled considering this is
a pretty expensive headset if you're
taking
for what it is now here's the dongle lit
up as you can see I've got all my
controls and stuff on there you've got a
mute button right here
and in anyway there's that now I did a
live stream with these headphones and
you guys have just been laughing your
ass off because there's an extra
function to these that I think is a lot
of fun and that is the built-in voice
changer and we'll go ahead and
demonstrate that right now you can be a
monster and tell people how from the
bowels of hell you are going to rip off
their head and eat their throats and
their babies yeah that was kind of scary
right yeah anyway rather gawky you're
that one you make that time loud toughen
Alex I like you then there's this one
that I like to say sounds like a super
creepy guy who gives free candy to
children out of vans down by the lake or
you can use it to tell all of your
subscribers about how they should be
subbed to you and anyone who's not
subbed to you
you'll be coming by
maybe seeing that really soon
then there's what I like to call my
minion voice you need you like a boy a
boy no no no boy a boy yeah ah
ooh Jesse so yeah I mean there's an
aspect to that that really kind of makes
up for the bad sound quality which is
why I'm going to probably continue to
use these headphones for a while
now I've got a whole lot of headphones
and things in this room and I like to
switch them out and stuff but the 5.1
immersion gaming quality of these
headphones really oh man it changed
everything I mean I've never actually
used 5.1 surround headphones and the
clarity of them and just the precision
of where things are around you was so
amazing it really made shooter games a
whole lot more interesting and a whole
lot more fun really feeling like you're
in there so guys these this has been the
rave the rave this has been the rave
guys I'm gonna head and bring out my
globe my glow gloves we're into that
we're gonna do this thing now I'm just
kidding guys this is been the row cat
cave xtd 5.1 digital surround sound
headphones a 5.1 type phone so yeah
that's what they are all right by the
end of these I kind of forget what the
heck I'm doing so what are you guys
using tell me so are using headphones or
using speakers and what headphones are
you using or hits it are you using
if you are using a headset okay guys I'm
gonna go ahead and get the heck on out
of here because I got some stuff I got
to do I got to go see a guy about a
thing in the place as always
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
