couple of things I need to apologize
first and foremost one if I sound super
nasally I am getting sick which couldn't
be at a worse time because I'm also in
the process of moving you notice the GPU
shelf here is gone fact this monitor is
not even hooked up to anything it's just
completely like a dummy prop at the
moment nothing sucked up to the test
bench in fact this room it might even
sound more echoey because it's nearly
empty but I'm going to keep content
coming
while I'm sick while I'm moving because
damn it sort men do with its
specifically tuned copper base and
maintenance free plug and play operation
the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers ultra-fast
gaming performance at the lowest
temperatures possible click the link in
the description for more details alright
so I figured while I have this test loop
still together I could talk about a few
things that I get in my inbox all the
time and rather than try and write out
the same answer or copy and paste it
1500 times I'll make a video and
hopefully that'll be a lot easier for
people to get some of the basic answers
thereafter when it comes to water
cooling one of the reasons why this loop
is still together was I was kind of
curious since this was the Primo chill
sickle which was their prototype sort of
a translucent fluid very similar to like
the Mayhem's or the dragon eyes so that
was curious as if it was going to fall
out because that's what was happening
with the Mayhem's is over time it would
start to fall down and then it would get
really kind of opaque and sort of
semi-transparent looking obviously this
isn't doing that what I did notice
though is that some of the dye will fall
out of this fluid and start to collect
in some of the lower portions of the
bends and stuff here but anyway this is
like I said a prototype it's not meant
for general use yet and that's one of
the reasons why it's not actually out on
the market yet they're still refining
this and this was a year old formula so
I was just kind of curious what was
going to happen but so far other than
the fact that it it got up here in the
threads and kind of acts like a glue and
I can can't really get that open right
now I might have to use a little bit of
assistance on there like a strap wrench
or something it's so far it seems to be
doing pretty good it's not really
changing any color it's not kind of
turning gunky or anything when I guess
time will tell but anyway with it still
being together here I figured it was a
perfect opportunity to talk about some
you know some of the basic things when
it comes to water cooling truly answer
some questions here now first things
first what is water cooling water
cooling is just one of two methods that
you use to dissipate and remove heat
from an object now the simplest way to
cool things obviously is by a heat sink
which is such a chunk of metal that's
touching the thing that's hot which has
a lot of fins on it thin fins that make
it a lot easier to one increase the
surface area of the object that you're
cooling and then to for air to move
through it and then dissipate that heat
out into the atmosphere so heat sinks
have been around for a long long time
they're very basic there's zero
maintenance and you can just forget it
but the problem is they're heavily
affected by the ambient temperature and
they have a very lower capacity of the
amount of heat that they're able to
capture and transfer away from the
object you want to cool now water
cooling on the other hand takes a water
block which is touching the object you
want to cool much like a heat sink but
the heat is being captured by the fluid
that is being moved by a pump through a
heat exchanger or in this case a
radiator that then has a fan moving
through there very similar to that of a
heat sink with tons of little fins on
here which are creating a lot of surface
area to cool and then moving that off
into the atmosphere but what's neat
about water cooling is you can remotely
move that heat so instead of having to
have the heat you know transferred right
here in a heat sink on top of the CPU
and all that heat moved into the
atmosphere whatever case that this is
currently in you can take these the
radiator
put it in an exhaust or a technically an
intake or an exhaust on your case and
then you move the heat more effectively
out of your case without heating up the
space that has the components into it so
you take that heat literally to the edge
of the case and then just send it off
into the atmosphere now the benefits of
water cooling is one liquid is a lot
more efficient when it comes to the
amount of heat that it can move the
liquid can gather up more heat than just
air can and then you can do things like
better overclocking you can get lower
temperatures much much lower
temperatures a much quieter cooling
benefit when it comes to cooling your
system the downside is as you can see
there's a lot of components involved
this is a very basic loop we got a
radiator two fans a reservoir and a pump
combo to make it easier to get that set
up
properly and then we've got our CPU
block and then our tubing and then as a
benefit
you know bonus on here we've also got my
drain plug or set up that I've got
another downside is this can be pretty
expensive where you can get something
like a cooler master hyper 212 Evo for
about 30 bucks US dollars put that on
and get very good cooling for stock or
mild overclocks on your system this here
is going to cost anywhere from 200 bucks
and up all the way up to you know
ridiculous amounts of money for super
high-end custom loops at costs well in
excess of a thousand dollars to get you
know better cooling lower temperatures
lower noise and a much more higher
Headroom when it comes to overclocking
another downside to water cooling though
is that there is maintenance involved
where the fluid has a lifespan the fluid
does need to be changed every so often
and that's going to depend on you know
the amount of heat in your system how
many components your cooling the types
of metal in your system
the you know metallurgy is a big deal
when it comes to water cooling that's
why we're constantly fighting things
like fallout or corrosion changing of
colors of fluids that's all metallurgy
that's that these companies are
constantly trying to evolve and make
better the problem is all of these
components here use different grades of
metal you sure it's copper but there's a
lot of different grades of copper
there's lots of different you know
there's there's there's contaminants and
copper and all that sort of stuff you
know whether it be also nickel plating
it's all different types of nickel and
and different you know qualities of the
nickel plating all of that matters when
it comes to the fluids most of the time
you can just install it pour it in and
you don't have to think about it but
when you start dealing with translucent
stuff like this like you guys know is
dealing with the Mayhem's there's lots
of factors involved in fact you could
have the same radiator and then you know
buy two of these do a metallurgy test on
them and find two different qualities of
copper in there it just depends on which
copper supply was used at the time that
radiator was actually made so that's why
you see so much constant debate about
fluids and what's better and what's not
now basic components that you need in
water cooling as I said is you're going
to need a water block usually at the
very least a CPU block you're going to
need your reservoir and your pump
reservoirs are technically optional you
can just use a tee fitting and plug it
and use a syringe to push all the fluid
in
Aaron get the air out reservoirs just
make things so much easier and you can
get them for is cheapest 30 bucks you
know 25 bucks depending on the type of
reservoir you go with but you also need
your heat exchanger with your fans your
tubing and your fitting so all of that
together you know they do have complete
kits that you could buy that have
everything in there you takes all the
guesswork out of it in fact it even
comes with the fluid or the concentrate
for you to put in there which is anti
corrosive and it will keep the metals
from you know turning all kinds of nasty
corroded crud in your system it's
happened in the past but fluids have
gotten a lot better over the years where
you don't have to worry note so much
about corrosion anymore and then
optionally on here like I said you have
a drain loop drain system here to make
getting the fluid out easy that's kind
of one of the most overlooked things
when people put together their loops is
how are they going to get the fluid out
and we'll do a video about that in the
future about some of the easiest ways to
get fluid in and out of your systems
another common question I see all the
time is am I going to ruin my system if
I develop a leak and the simple answer
to that is yes you could ruin your
system if you develop a leak obviously
depends on where that leak is
awesomesauce Kyle he had a leak he was
fortunate it wasn't anywhere near any of
his components skunkworks has had one
leak and unfortunately it was down in
the bottom of the case away from the
power supply and no other electronics
down there so it didn't damage anything
but if you got a leak let's say at your
CPU block you know this leaks down into
your socket or onto your graphics card
sure it absolutely could cause a problem
that could take out one or all of your
components have you leaked into your
power supply and it creates a short
across let's say the five volt and the
12 volt you start sending 12 volt down
to all your five volt circuitry yeah
it's going to fry pretty much everything
attached to it so the risks are there so
but the one thing I want to address si I
see folks say oh no I'm not gonna do a
custom look that just sounds dangerous
I'm going with an all-in-one coke cooler
well guys all one coolers are prone to
the exact same failures that could
happen with a custom loop in an all one
loop it depends on the quality of the
fittings and the tubing and the blocks
and the o-rings that they use when they
put that together and keep in mind that
a lot of these all-in-one cooling brands
they want to do it for the cheapest
amount possible simply because the
portability of an all-in-one cooling
loop is what really makes it the
incentive for newcomers to want to get
into water cooling so I just want to put
that out there don't think that all the
one water cooling loops are your answer
to potential leaks now that kind of
leads me into the next thing where folks
will say oh I'm not too worried about it
I'm just going to put it in non
conductive fluid and if it leaks I'm
just going to be like ha ha ha whatever
now that's good in the beginning but the
problem with those fluids is and I
tested this actually I did this on a
forum this was long before YouTube where
I ran a fluid XP non conductive fluid
for seven years in the same loop it
never broke down but what happened was
it definitely became conductive over
time because remember as these coolants
are flowing over all of these metals
they're deionized the the fluid they're
deionized as they're made and when
they're concentrated and when they're
have their anti corrosive and neo non
conductive properties to them the
problem is as they flow over these
metals over and over and over and over
and over these metals start to break
down and the deionized fluids they want
their ions back it's like it's like
crack for them they have to have it so
they start trying to absorb it as much
as it can from the metals that it
touches eventually over time it can't
become conductive again but the level of
conductivity that it's going to achieve
again is going to depend on a lot of
different factors so I can't say it
would or wouldn't end up damaging your
system but I want to put that out there
too where anti or non conductive fluids
are great in the beginning but it
doesn't mean they're going to stay non
conductive over time it depends on how
long you're running in your system and
they will always have a recommendation
on how long you should run the system
before you you flush it and replace it I
usually do it about well in Skunk cores
it feels like every two months
but typically on systems like the test
bench chair has been running for over a
year over a year now no change in color
no change in any sort of contaminants or
floaties moving around the system so
I've I've gotten pretty you know lucky
on that but then I'm going to have one
radiator in one block and that doesn't
get very hot and it's not used very
often so there's a lot of factors
involved with that but ultimately the
choice of getting into water cooling you
really have to ask yourself do you need
it the answer is very few people
actually need it
overclockers pretty much need it but day
to day general use in gaming and things
like that you've got to ask yourself if
the
no maintenance and potential headache is
worth it to you and if it's not then you
have your answer it's definitely not for
you but if you're an enthusiast like I
am and you're in and this just looks
cool and you like looking at it and you
just you're really willing to take that
next step of added cost and aesthetic
benefits to lower temperatures even if
you're not overclocking then it could be
worth it to you it's the same reason why
people put fast parts in their cars or
or people put decorative driveways in
their homes stuff like that's not
necessary but if you want it then it's
definitely something to consider
I've been water cooling now for well
over a decade and I don't see myself
ever changing that and I do take a lot
of precautions to try and minimize the
amount of risk that I take by doing
quality components and not buying the
cheapest that I can remember you get
what you pay for in every market in the
world you get what you pay for so you my
advice to you quite honestly would be if
you can't afford a better loop now but
you can afford say you know like Chinese
knockoff fittings and stuff like that
don't don't don't scrimp on the fittings
trust me
the fittings are the place you want to
definitely consider going top end
because the fittings are where the leaks
always had anyway guys under this video
was kind of rambling all over the place
but you guys like having these
conversations and they're easy to make
especially while I'm moving right now so
although it feels like a little bit of a
cop-out video you know in terms of
effort I still hope the information
helps you guys anyway let me know what
kind of content matter you guys want if
I'm going to continue the discussion
about water cooling part of the problem
here is an expert in the in the the
subject is that I have a hard time
figuring out where to start these
conversations because I know all of this
and a lot of it makes it's just so
ingrained in my mind it makes it very
difficult to determine where to start
where you know what is the most
beneficial to you as a newbie water
cooler that's going to help you put your
mind at ease and know where to begin so
let me know on either Twitter or
Facebook or the comments here all the
informations right here in the end slate
let me know what other topics you think
are worth talking about because the last
thing I want to do is put too much at
you too quick and confuse you which is
probably all I did with this video here
anyway I'm also going to be doing a
couple of moving blogs not a lot I don't
want to just start vlogging and
blowing up your inbox with a ton of like
I'm moving these boxes into a new place
here's might vlog I'll do a couple
because you guys some of you guys are
interested but not too many anyway guys
thanks for watching sorry this video was
not up to the standard I normally like
to keep them but I hope this video has
helped you nonetheless alright guys
we'll see you in the next one thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
