and it's like another graphics card
review every single week it seems like
it it's the summertime guys it says this
tends to be like GPU month usually
especially every other year because
that's when we tend to get major
launches specially from nvidia and AMD
so today we're gonna be taking a look at
one of two cards on the market that are
featuring a custom design for the new
fury air-cooled cards and this is the
sapphire try it's did what it's so small
you really think so what is the white
thing well she says it gets the job done
- how's that smell mm-hmm a fractal
design node - OH - it's not about how
big it is but all about how you use it
it's pretty obvious to me that sapphire
took the approach of let's just put the
biggest freaking cooler we could fit on
the world's tiniest card that's the card
that's the cooler it makes sense though
considering there is a lot of heat to
tame in this thing you're taking all the
heat of all the pita chips that would
normally be spread around the PCB and
stacking them on the exact same unit
that the GPU cores on therefore you're
going to have a lot more focused heat
now this thing has one two three four
one two three four five six seven heat
pipes seven copper heat pipes holy mmm
but because they have chosen to hang the
back of the cooler off of the card
significantly about two-thirds the
length of the card you are getting a
just over 12 inches of length as Barnack
Lee's would say woods but it's not just
about the length it's also about the
girth and as you can see right there it
backs it up with girth
okay those jokes are out of the way but
because it is a tri X cooler that means
we have one two three fans it's kind of
funny how that works
you've got tons and tons and tons and
tons of fins on this thing I like I said
sapphire took out all the stops when it
came to keeping this thing cool it's got
a cutout on the back here behind the GPU
so that you can get a reduction of heat
soak sitting behind the actual core
itself especially with all these
transistors back here resistors and then
you've got one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven looks like a
twelve phase power delivery system on
this thing Wow and because it takes so
much power you going to need two 8-pin
PCI Express power now on the back here
it also has the same load LEDs that have
been present on the fury X cards with
the same dip switches that you can
change them between red and blue and off
and I think you can even do purple in
there I didn't actually test that my bad
this thing isn't just an air-cooled fury
X we know the AMD would not have let the
partners do that so this is actually
shaped down just a little bit it's about
500 stream processors less at 30 584 but
when it comes to the memory bandwidth
the memory bus the memory speed that
stuff is all identical unfortunately
it's all still locked down even on the
15.7 catalyst drivers that are supposed
to directly result or fix some of the
complaints that people had about the
fury X especially with the varying
performances so this thing was tested
with 15.7 which was the newest most
recommended driver by AMD at the time so
with that said let's go ahead and go
through the benchmarks and then we're
going to do a live test with GTA 5
because I wanted to talk about fan noise
and I want to talk about coil whine
those were the two things that bothered
me the most about the fury X was massive
coil whine and pump noise obviously
there's no pump on here but there are
fans so we want to see how it's
performing so let's go ahead and look at
the benchmarks and then let's jump into
the live test transition
you
okay so we're going to do right now is
we're just going to do a little bit of
gta5 we're going to listen for two
things we're going to listen for fan
noise and we are going to listen for
coil whine unfortunately there is still
a little bit of coil whine on this card
more than I would have liked to have
heard I don't think it's as bad as the
fury X but it's still definitely there
and maybe it just has something to do
with the way that the board has to be
built because of AMD's interposer design
with the ram stacked next to the jet the
GPU rather than being on the top of the
GPU I'm not really too sure but I do
think that the coil whine is something
worth mentioning because it is still
there so I'm going to do now is I'm
going to take my mic I'm going to clip
it to one of the wires that's near the
graphics card and we'll just kind of
take a listen as I do a little play
through here at the beginning scene of
GTA 5 where your repoing the cars and
I'll let you guys listen for fan noise
and coil whine so right now we're
sitting at the desktop here the fans are
completely silent they're not turning at
all because there's nothing going on so
go ahead and take a quick listen for a
few seconds here and this is going to be
your audio baseline so that you know
where the system audio is versus where
the graphics card audio is
all right so here we are right now we're
in 1440p graphics card fans are still
not even turning that just shows you how
silent optimized this card really is
I kind of make it a point to hit all the
people I can it's extra points in this
game not really but it isn't my game oh
that's a really strong planter but you
gotta admit though this thing is doing
an amazing job at FPS we're sitting here
locked into the mid-70s at 1440p so
there's the difference of no coil wine
versus coil one will go back and forth
right real quick
so here's no coil line and there's the
coil line
notoya wine
Coyle one but you have to admit though
the fans were something you never heard
the fans didn't really turn up at all
all right well the game really didn't
like me tabbing back and forth and back
and forth so it restarted on me all
right so what do I think about the card
well I think that's kind of a loaded
question honestly the card fits in a
spot where there's really no occupation
right now five hundred and fifty dollars
is kind of a weird price point for
graphics cards because it always seemed
to have been at least on the video side
you know you'd have your three hundred
dollar card five hundred dollar cards
six fifty card and then a thousand and I
think AMD does a really good job at
filling in that five hundred and fifty
dollar space but considering you have
the 980 at 500 and the 92 Ti at 650 in
this card sitting right in between that
I think it almost is a little bit
confusing to a buyer who maybe is not
loyal to any particular brand now if
you're an AMD fan this is going to be
definitely a no-brainer card for you if
you've got more to spend then say on a
390 or 390x you want to go higher but
you don't want to drop 650 on a fury X
this card is definitely an amazing card
at that price point but as you guys
could see too though once you
overclocked some of the 980 stuff Nvidia
fanboys are obviously going to be
jumping for joy that the 980 classified
overclocked was pretty much beating this
card in just about every single test but
then again the price points are very
very similar and that's only if you're
comfortable with overclocking the card
so I don't know if overclocking should
necessarily be taken into the equation
via for a couple of reasons one not
everyone's willing to do it to it adds
more heat and wear and tear on the card
and three there's no guarantee that
you're going to get a great overclocking
card some cards believe it or not will
start to crap on themselves you know
only a few megahertz faster than stock
these manufacturers only guaranteed the
cards to run at their advertised speeds
overclocking is not a guarantee
even on overclocking specific cards
believe it or not but when we're talking
about stock for stock
I think this card is a fantastic
performing card I do wish the coil wine
was a little bit more in check I don't I
don't
understand why we're having so much coil
wine in these cards I don't know if has
something to do with the architecture
the way it's I don't know I mean we've
been dealing with coil wine and computer
parts for so many years you'd think by
now that there would be have there would
have been advancements in the way these
inductors are made so that they're not
making all sorts of crazy noise but
unfortunately this one does make noise
it's not as loud as the fury X was maybe
that's because we have more sitting on
top of the card kind of muffle it down
both with a back plate and with the
massive cooler on the front and then you
put this thing inside of a case it's not
going to be as bad I don't think it
would be very very noticeable but it is
something definitely worth mentioning
because it is there I'll be honest when
I say that the HBM memory itself it
doesn't perform as good as I was hoping
it would I don't care who came to market
with the first AMD Nvidia who had been
developing it longer I was kind of
expecting some amazing breakthroughs
when it came to memory the way a memory
is utilized on the GPU now obviously
it's got a massive 4096 bit memory bus
but the memory speed itself is extremely
slow compared to the well evolved gddr5
in fact the gddr5 now you're finding in
graphics cards are exceeding 7000
megahertz on RAM speed so although you
do have a longer path for the
communication between the GPU in the
memory it's so fast I almost feel like
that might be negating some of the
benefits of HBM so maybe time's going to
it's going to take time
HBM you know second-generation HBM is
already and you know development and
production technically for next year so
it's going to be interesting to see
where we go with the evolution of HBM
and especially when these two companies
start duking it out you know AMD and
NVIDIA when it comes to HBM technology
but I don't think anybody can take away
the fact that the card is performing
very very well as you saw at 1440p
mid-70s I all times on a single panel on
a single card 1440p with MSAA on it was
a 2 X MS a 2 X MSA test the cards are
just getting faster and faster and I
think Sapphire has done an amazing job
at developing a graphics card that I
myself would be proud to run
one of my gaming systems or put in a
customer system if I was building a
computer for someone and they said
what's the best AMD graphics card I
could get this card would definitely be
on my short list because it looks great
it's quiet it's got a fantastic warranty
and from a brand that definitely
specializes AMD graphics cards and takes
a lot of pride in what they do so if
that's a company that you're looking for
you definitely should put sapphire on
your shortlist when it comes to GPU
shopping so there you go guys has been
Jays $0.02 thanks for checking out
today's video I do have two more
sapphire graphics cards I'm actually
going to check out if this thing's a
little bit above your price range
in fact I show right here I have got the
sapphire nitro r9 380 as well as the
sapphire r9 390 nitro cool thing about
these cards is some of the complaint
sapphires gotten and I even mentioned it
earlier is the fact that they don't want
the orange they don't want to see the
colors well the nitro series cards are
like completely blacked out they look
really really good so be looking for
that soon like I said it's a GPU central
around here I think we're going to have
to change the name to Jade's two J's two
GPUs or J's two dozen GPUs something
like that alright guys as always thanks
for watching and as always I will see
you in the next one
it's like I swear this thing's like a
really good weapon because when it
weighs like four pounds at least it's
got a sharp edge right there it's got a
cutting edge and it definitely would
make a pretty good weapon I mean
somebody could have killed somebody with
this in Game of Thrones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
