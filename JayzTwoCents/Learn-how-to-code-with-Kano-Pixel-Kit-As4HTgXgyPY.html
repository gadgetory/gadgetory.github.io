if you kind of hear hissed of the air
conditioner I apologize it's hot in
Southern California we're breaking
records and I'm not turning the air off
but with that said I'm back again with
my little helper you guys haven't seen
her in a while this is my daughter she's
eight now can you believe it
I started appearing on town when I was
three yeah you were three and eight
that's five years anyway this is Little
J she's going to help me out with
talking about the new K no pixel kit
which is designed to make a programming
fun and easy to understand while giving
you well a light panel to play with so
huge thank you to Kano for sponsoring
today's video and sending this over for
us take a look at you know how we do it
we like to just put it together and play
with it and then we talk about it when
we do we talk about let's do it
you think yeah all right
Oh
okay this was a lot of fun to play with
we spent the last couple of hours
messing around this we put it together
going through the challenges it teaches
you some pretty cool stuff
now you can obviously play with it but
some of the stuff that's built into
there some of games but what this is
really meant to do is to download the
app to either your Mac device or your
Windows device and you can start to
learn how to program on this so what we
got one right now is just the audio
visualizer that's built in we had some
apps that you actually develop she did a
little talking app or when you talk yeah
Mac right so let's put that on here and
click so when you talk the little face
will basically talk and animate the
sounds that it hears and it teaches you
how to create that app and you can
download it to the device but you can
create all kinds of things either follow
the tutorials and their challenges
create your very own that it's
absolutely endless of what you can do
you can save the app on the website and
then you can download it to your device
later and constantly switches I made a
little critter kind of looks like a cat
things that one and you can move it with
the kids on I think you gotta move it
directly to joystick you know cat yeah I
know Simon seriously a cat she thinks
okay I'm not sure exactly what kind of
critter it is but you make it you
animate it by making it move side to
side very basic stuff but the cool part
is this this is this is meant to make
learning fun and specifically learning
coding because it takes a very basic
approach to code it makes it simple to
understand because it's all visual where
you put together and plug in different
blocks and you have different values and
variables and just it's endless on what
you can do with it so the tutorials are
very good at guiding you to understand
how all of that works now I worked in a
software environment for nearly 10 years
so obviously this is stuff that I
already understand but her learning it
or watching her learn it for the first
time as an 8 year old who's never been
exposed to programming whatsoever and
seeing how fast she picked it up was
pretty awesome for instance we
programmed this weather app right here
and as you can see it's stunning because
it's set to Los Angeles and it's sunny
here like year-round but the cool thing
is it shows different types of weather
based on
the condition so what are the weather's
that it would patch um no II which will
never get in Los Angeles let's face it
sunny which we have on right now cloudy
and rainy right and so the cool thing is
you can change the fetch data and it
will change the weather based on the
location so just like if you put a zip
code into your phone but the cool thing
is this taught her this app was not just
about building the weather it was about
understanding if-then statements so
you're kind of being tricked and to
learn things you don't even realize
you're learning and now she understands
exactly how if-then statements work so
give an example of the if-then statement
for the weather app there was if it's
snowy then show snow if it's sunny
venture sunny if it's rainy then show
rain if it ever got to be remotest
cloudy then chill class so the cool
thing is all of thats in the same string
but it's based on the data that it's
fetching and then it will use those
keywords to display the image based on
an if/then and she's eight and she
understands it stands that but she
didn't know she understood that until i
explained to her what the actual if-then
was and what that block looked like so
it was really really cool
and this is the kind of device here that
kids and adults all-ages anyone that's
interested in learning more about
programming should definitely check out
we had a lot of fun with the candle
computer and the cool thing about this
is there are other products that are
available from Kano that all tie
together as an ecosystem that can be
used to control each other they have a
camera device that you can build a
microphone this was a very good start
and it's not that expensive whatsoever
and there's the computer one that
controls all of them well you know you
can use the Kano computer but what we
did was we downloaded the app directly
from their website and that's where you
do all of the learning and you plug this
into your computer either Mac OS or
Windows and then you can do everything
on the computer and then you save it to
your device and you could take it with
you and play with it so she's got her
little critter on there that she likes
and you can rotate those out all of the
things you work on are saved on the
website and then you can save them to
your device we have multiple USB ports
on here because there are other
attachments that you can get for this it
comes with the tilt sensor but there's
other things you can get for it it's all
listed in the back of the manual it's
worth checking out and there's other
things that you can unlock based on the
challenges you can
so there's more to gain by continuing
through all the tutorials and figuring
those out so yeah there's all kinds of
cool things got a climate sensor a sound
sensor a gesture sensor so you can
actually control it with motion that's
cool we'll check that out a trip wire
sensor make a sign that activates when
someone goes by there's no she'll know
when her little sister goes and sits at
her desk anyway so that's that I hope
you guys definitely check it out link
down the description below a huge thank
you to Kano once again for sponsoring
today's video and I think that this is
something that is great for all ages and
this is coming from an advanced user
myself and you wanna say before we go be
early</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
