and we've got a new graphics card to
talk about this year and I'll be honest
it's one that I don't even know why it
exists I don't think it needs to be here
but regardless I am going to go ahead
and talk about the new 1070 TI just
launched by Nvidia but I'm not gonna
talk about the traditional benchmarks
I'm not gonna go through my benchmarking
suite and put it up against all the
other graphics cards because spoiler
alert it's a little faster than a 1070
and a little slower than a 1080 which is
exactly where you would expect it to be
this time around there's a rumor that
you can't overclock the 1070 TI that
Nvidia has locked it down and won't let
the users overclock their cards what
we're gonna talk about that today so let
me go and talk about the rumour and the
fact behind it because the problem is
everyone just copies these rumors
basically word for word and then
misinformation gets out there and people
become confused as to what the facts are
here is the fact the founders edition
card and all of the AIB cards we'll be
shipping with the exact same clock speed
now you see all these custom cards
behind me here both Nvidia and AMD which
is over here behind Nick people seem to
forget to have a wall of AMD cards but
each AIB does determines and builds
their own custom boards and own custom
cooling and with that their own core
clocks based on what they think is gonna
be stable for the public and they're
always faster than the reference design
this time around that's not the case
which leaves people going well then why
do they have a custom cooler
why are there two 8-pin power plugs on
this card if they're not allowed to
overclock it well the difference is AI
bees aren't allowed to but you are so
that's the first bit of that's
been floating around out there about you
not being able to overclock to 1070 ti
you absolutely can which is why these
custom designs still exist so this is
the 1070 TI as you would expect
it's a 19 or 20 432 CUDA cores
versus the 1920 CUDA cores found in the
1070 but again it has less cuda cores
than what you would find in a 1080 base
clock is 1608 boost clock is 1683 and of
course GPU boost 3.0 is going to take
that even farther based on cooling
conditions so again that's why you have
a IB custom coolers that exist like this
guy right here so let's kind of go ahead
and do
a test here what is windows remind me of
this time windows feature update get out
of here with that crap out of the box
settings this is a mess a MSI
Afterburner nothing special you can
still adjust and move all your sliders
just like you want and yeah there's
nothing weird about that so you can
indeed overclock it when it comes to
time spy standard clock we got a 68 16
GPU score 1080 founders had a 72 88 and
then if we compare that to a 1070 1070
founders head of 5839
so it's actually closer to a 1080 than
it is to a 1070 which leads to why their
factory locked for the AIB is when the
AI bees cannot ship them faster than
what the Nvidia specs are but like I
said that doesn't mean we can't play
around that so as you saw we got a score
of overclocked 78 35 so where does that
stack up against out of the box 10 80s
well we have got the 1080 Fe was a 72 88
as we talked about remember these these
are stock clocks right here so remember
you can't overclock a 1080 of course and
get even faster 10 ad Arctic storm was a
76 91 so that was slower but once you
overclock the Arctic storm it goes quite
a bit faster what else we got here it's
faster than the 1080 classified out of
the box on the slave BIOS and it is
faster than a 1080 hybrid out of the box
74 70 so that's pretty impressive and
it's right behind the zotac 1080 amp
extreme right there at eight thousand
twelve so that should really come as no
surprise
in fact the core speed that I was
getting on that with my profile right
here and for my profile I'm running
voltage at plus 100 so that's make given
max voltage at a lower frequency power
limit set to 120 temp limit set to 83
actually that's allowed to be cranked
and then core clock I read at 250 and a
450 on the memory which actually gave me
a 21:52 megahertz core speed and then of
course as it gets hotter because the
founders card it starts to come down a
little bit so the question is now can a
custom card come anywhere close to that
let's take a look so the founders card
was automatically GPU boosting up to
about 1883 falling down to about 1797
and sometimes a little lower depending
on
temps which I don't think surprises
anybody so already there's a benefit to
a custom card when it comes to cooling
but again this is old news nothing new
one on a test right now is if this
boosts up to that same factory clock
because it should write the P States and
the BIOS frequencies should be identical
as the factory because that's what they
are being forced to do there's a way
around all that and we'll talk about
that in a second I don't mean by
downloading afterburner and doing custom
benchmarking I mean a specific approach
EBA EVGA is taking with this and it's
new for them which i think is really
cool and we're gonna talk about that but
first we need to check and see what we
were actually boosting up to I like to
use time spy though because it's a dx12
benchmark it's actually fairly demanding
on graphics cards and it's gonna allow
the graphics card to actually ramp up to
a pretty significant amount of boosts
clock did that leak just get bigger it
sounds like a 1898 is where it went up
to at a hundred percent load so okay the
claims are obviously validated now that
they are running the exact same speed so
we'll let this go we'll see what the
out-of-the-box score is on this guy
versus the founders 1080i expected to be
a little bit higher because I think the
cooling situation is gonna keep the core
clock more stable at a higher frequency
but then obviously we'll talk about a
pretty cool new feature okay so this is
a little teaser to a video we got coming
up here we've got a big-ass tank of
liquid nitrogen with a big-ass dent in
it which is already kind of scary for
her first of all but we were sitting
over there making this video and
suddenly it started leaking everything
it's supposed to do that
I got gloves on getting colder it's cold
in there put my finger to plug the hole
well now I got to get to stop again
wait it's lonely now okay so our factory
graphics core 69 52 out of the box if we
look at our core stability here you can
see we stayed max temp of 72 which is
pretty good and then our core clock
1911's were hit for like a split second
and then it came down to the 18s and it
stayed significantly higher when we
tested the founders Edition card Nick
will attest to this a drop down to like
seventeen ninety seven so already the
core clock stayed much higher on this as
expected again this is not surprising
stuff on a card that doesn't even need
to exist honestly but again our score of
a 69 52 so it was more than a hundred
points higher than the founders Edition
card out of the box and 69 52 puts it
right up pretty close about with about
200 points of us Vegas 64 significantly
faster than a 56 Vega 56 and then yeah
so it's sitting right where we had
expected it's lower than at any 1080
obviously without being overclocked and
significantly faster than 1070 founders
at 58 39 so not bad out of the box like
I said about a hundred and forty ish 37
points whatever it is faster okay so II
BGA's precision app our precision OC has
been updated specifically for this card
and what its gonna do when you install
it it's gonna scan the card it's gonna
recognize that you have a 1070 Ti in
there and then it wants you to actually
register your card I forgot about all
that let's register it with a funky name
see if anyone knows is this okay taser
face and I will put in my email okay so
this is what's new right here this is
the EVGA precision XOC scanner and
what's going to do it's gonna scan my
ten seven ETI once you submit here check
this out so it's got what's called OC
scan mode and it's gonna I'm sorry
having a meal at that Nick that's really
small huh quick test 15 to 20 minutes
full test thirty to sixty minutes or you
just go straight to manual overclocking
now what these first two tests are going
to do is they are going to scan your
card and it's
gonna run it through a series of tests
probably using fur mark or something I
know they love using fur mark and it's
gonna find stable overclocks for you now
I don't want to say it's a lot like
another product but this is very similar
to how a Seuss's five-way optimization
works only it does it with CPUs as well
as GPUs so I don't maybe we'll do the
quick test the 15 to 20 minutes and then
we'll go with a manual overclocking test
I'm just kind of curious as to where
it's gonna take this out of the box now
right now this only exists with 1070 Ti
but I wouldn't be surprised if this
doesn't now force EVGA down a path where
they start doing this with all their
cards because why the heck not if the
scanner can automatically do it then
that allows you to overclock your card
it takes some of your fear out of it all
right I'm apologize now but the hissing
sound that big container over there is
still purging because as it's warmer in
here it's expanding and then it's got a
purge valve so that's just gonna keep
happening until we use it tomorrow but
anyway so it finished its overclock it
says right here your overclock has been
saved applied this overclock on your
startup I'm gonna hit yes it's pretty
conservative it didn't touch the memory
at all in all went plus 101 on the core
which i think is super conservative yes
so we're gonna go ahead and just go to
manual mode here we're gonna crank that
we're gonna try matching what I can get
with the founders card which is 250 on
the core 450 on the memory the sound is
really annoying
I'm only tolerating it because I know
what's coming next with it and the
nitrous oxide okay
the oxide mm-hmm
Nick has this theory that we're gonna
get really happy like laughing gasps
happy but that's nitrous oxide not
liquid nitrogen you don't breathe liquid
nitrogen so unfortunately though it
crashed with the same settings I was
able to run with reference that means
one of two things I potentially lost the
lottery or Nvidia super cherry-picking
witch GPUs they keep for the founders
cards which is something that we kind of
assumed that they did with the 1080 but
yeah yeah it's too bad I mean it really
seems like in videos cherry-picking you
know the best core is and keeping them
for the boundaries Edition cards but you
still get a lot of benefits though on
custom cards even whether it's EVGA or
any other brand right you're getting
better cooling you're getting
theoretically a better built PCB so
longevity be better as you're
overclocking these cards back plate on
this RGB control of course this
particular card has the IC x9 sensor so
you get to monitor temperature for
memory power delivery and core so I mean
obviously there's their benefits but it
looks like we're might actually make it
in this time and it's probably sitting
right around that 2101 clock speed again
so this is right up here just loading
2101 so what I'm gonna do right now is
I'm gonna let this go and I'm gonna see
exactly how 2101 compares to how the
founders Edition card did and
considering the founders Edition card
still throttles a little bit downward
even though I had the fans set to 85% I
have a feeling that this card might
match and maybe slightly surpass that
score just based on my past experiences
with founders versus custom cards that
are a little slower on the core speed so
at least in this one benchmark try it
out it looks like we completed with a
plus 200 so our score is a seven
thousand 772 and a seven seven seven two
that puts this obviously way ahead of
the ten seventy founders and if we
compare this to the ti FC so we're only
about we're about what sixty points
lower than an OCD reference card
the quite a bit higher than a standard
you know reference card so anyway here's
the bottom line this card doesn't need
to exist it really doesn't because it's
it's a weird stopgap card in between a
gap that's not big enough I think the
slide and a card like this and have it
makes sense I think it's still making
all kinds of noise and like clinking and
stuff it's scary
being that close to that anyway sorry
about the noise so this is 449 this is
499 and all the custom cards from all
the brands that you used to sing like
this wall right here or within about $10
of each other but you get a significant
additional amount of value for the 50
bucks right like I mentioned the at
least this card the two fans the icx a
custom PCB custom power delivery
backplate multiple bios the question is
whether or not it makes a whole lot of
sense to do that considering that's what
the MSRP for a 1080 is but we all know
that the 10 80s are also marked up to
around 550 bucks so between the $400
range and the $550 range of three cards
I guess it's kind of neat to have like a
$50 leapfrog effect in pricing but I
just I don't know so I guess the bottom
line is I just don't necessarily feel
like this card should be here but that's
just a personal opinion of mine what do
you guys think but all the custom cards
are sitting right around $489 to 499
bucks they're still not cheap by any
means it's just a weird card slid into a
gap like it slid like right into those
dm's it slid into a gap that was just a
no-no did you guys find that gap to be
too wide sound off in the comments and
tell me what you guys think anyway if
you think has any other test I should do
with this card let me know I don't think
I'm gonna do a whole lot of testing on
1070 T I'd not a whole lot of purpose or
reason for that but I'm gonna go guys
lnto video coming up next that's gonna
be a fun one thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one
