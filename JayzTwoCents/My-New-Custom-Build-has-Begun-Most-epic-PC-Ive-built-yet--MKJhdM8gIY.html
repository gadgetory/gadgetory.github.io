figured the best way to end the year is
actually start my personal build writer
this is my personal build this is semi
replacing skunk works skunk works is
gonna come back to the studio a lot of
you guys said you've missed it I hear
you we're gonna do that we are gonna be
bringing it back to the studio here but
even though we've kind of done a little
bit of a video sort of showing off the
chassis I'm using here which is the in
windy frame 2.0 I've showing you how I
kind of plan out my loops with this and
yeah that so sort of a teaser as to
what's to come but now we've got all the
parts that we need well about 95% of the
parts that we need so we're gonna start
building this and we're gonna do like we
always do we're talk about the parts and
yeah we're gonna get this a year ended
right so that hopefully we can get 2018
started on the right foot the sennheiser
HD 58 x jubilee headphones offer
everything audio enthusiasts desire
continuing from a long line of
innovation weighing in at just 260 grams
gold-plated connector one point 8 meter
detachable cord and full rich sound make
the Sennheiser HD 50x headphones from
mass drop the obvious choice for those
who are serious about sound sign up for
mass drop is always free so take
advantage of this deal by heading to
mass drop using the link in the
description below so like I mentioned in
the intro this is the in windy frame 2.0
the D frame originally came out in like
2012 or somewhere around there like way
back in the day they've made quite a few
changes to it obviously this is the 2.0
you can see the top part comes off it's
off right now we've stored it because we
don't want to damage it while this is
being built I've always liked the idea
of open-air chassis and when I saw this
tubular frame I had to have it because
of what I just I'm into automotive and
it looks like a roll cage to me
motherboard is an Asus x2 99 rampage 6
extreme because it just doesn't get much
more extreme than that running a 7900 X
memory we've got 32 gigs of the
Dominator platinum blackout special
edition so it's black tops with LEDs
built into here it's sort of a polished
gunmetal kind of a look on here and then
of course we've got the black heat
spreaders on there which look obviously
really nice we I don't want to go with
silver or chrome or any of that I wanted
this to be as much like black and green
as possible cooling of the CPU and the
motherboard of course we have got that
rampage
it's monoblock which is one of the
reasons why I went with this motherboard
because it has monoblock available so
it's a single block that's going to
cover both CPU and vrm which can get
pretty hot when you overclock on X 299
this is the EKF CX 3 terminal it's
basically a block that attaches to the
graphics cards when you water cool them
or use ek water blocks which makes it so
you don't have to use tubes in between
the GPUs I've never used one in the past
I was thinking about using one this time
this is actually a 3-way block it's
designed for three cards obviously I
have two but they do have a block off
plate that is an add-on piece that they
sent me with this haven't decided if I'm
going to use it yet we'll see I think it
just depends on what the aesthetics end
up looking like of course we have two
NVIDIA GTX Titan XPS these are the
little piece it's got the 38 140 CUDA
cores no not going with volta even if
explicit sli worked I would not have
done it because there's no point I'll be
$6,000 worth of GPUs 2 terabytes worth
of Toshiba OCZ nvme SSDs we're going
with only nvme on this no SATA drives at
all no big hard drives or any of that
we're gonna be keeping them cool with a
couple of ek nvme heat spreaders so ek
waterblock of course for the GPUs these
are the founders edition blocks so it's
a single block that works with any of
the founder's edition cards gtx 1060 it
up so it's pretty neat because if I
decided later on to tear this whole
system apart which I'm not doing with
skunkworks but whatever if I decided to
tear this whole system apart I could use
these on another founders Edition Pascal
blog card so that's pretty neat and then
of course we've got the Titan X branded
back plates for those now here's the
part where I heard you I heard you guys
in my last video I talked about mounting
the reservoir and how it didn't fit in
certain places like I hope don't think
in the history of my channel I've ever
received more messages and comments and
people telling me to check out
singularity pcs I'm well-aware who
Daniel is I'm well aware of what he does
we even talked prior to the videos but
now we have a situation where using
their stuff is perfect so this right
here is the protium tube reservoir this
is a so basically we've got a assist
set this is the first time I've actually
taken a look in person of anything
that's Daniel's work I'm telling you
right now you will be hard-pressed to
find any higher quality of build out
there I mean even down to the reservoir
and the build quality the polish should
be acrylic I knit getting close on that
because I don't think you're gonna find
a better build quality when it comes to
acrylic work out there at all but anyway
we'll be taking that apart we'll be
using the protium d5 top which is also
an acrylic it's a see-through they do
also have it in black so that they can
be blacked out like everything else but
I think the acrylic is gonna look cool
because we will be using having decided
on the fluid yet you guys notice there's
no fluid here I'm excited I'm gonna go
with you or if I just want to go with
some opaque or even some see-through
fluid but whatever here is the pump top
I don't know if they're if they're flame
polishing this or what I'm gonna have to
assume yes cuz this is just too damn
perfect look at that I mean that is yeah
I know I sound like I'm fangirling here
but anyway he also sent over a whole
bunch of different brackets and
different colors and adapters and stuff
most of its off-camera he sent a ton of
stuff because he saw that video and he
was like no matter what you're gonna be
able to find a way to mount this where
it fits you're gonna be happy then of
course we've got our lighting which is
going to be supplied by a cable mod
we've got our lighting kit here these
are the RGB UV so they can do both UV
light and RGB you can actually see it's
thicker than normal RGB simply because
it has multiple rows of LEDs so we can
do color or we can do UV it's a single
strip that will handle everything you
want with your PC in terms of color so
no longer you decide like RGB or u UV
and I might do UV in this I've been
thinking about doing UV so that's
perfect and of course we have our
revolver fittings here from primo chill
have it aside I'm gonna do black or
green to match this hardware I don't
want to over do the green especially
since we're probably gonna do green
fluid anyway it's time to shut up and do
some building
well as it usually goes when I do my
personal builds I didn't get as far as I
wanted to on this day I was kind of
hoping to get fittings and start the
bends but I get the bends but anyway no
we got far enough we got our blocks on
our gtx titan x peas and you might
notice actually kept the nvidia back
plates on these instead of putting on
the usual back plate I get from ek water
blocks I think I like the way this looks
a little bitter I don't know what it is
I I'm glad I left these on and I think
it gives a good aesthetic to the system
as you can see I've got both of my 360
rads on here and I did indeed get a
second 360 bracket from inland which a
lot of you guys recommended that I do
and I'm glad that I did because it just
makes it mounting a whole lot easier I
was able to put the fans underneath
right here which means I have more space
on top you can see the rads the fans are
also got there the ML 120 RGB from
Corsair not the new light loops I don't
have any of those but I had six of the
ML 120 so that'll work it's gonna give
us some under glow even right automotive
under glow whatever I would never run
under glow at my real car my actual car
but I will do this in here no problem
and I am proudly representing the
singularity computers logo now on this
this is by far the highest quality piece
of water cooling tech that I have
touched in all of my water cooling years
that I've been doing this and these guys
been doing it for a lot longer than me
the build quality of the fitment the
adjustability absolutely could not be
any happier the way that this turned out
so obviously the next thing to do now is
all of the tubing and the bending and
the wiring on this is gonna be
interesting so I may be going with cable
mod for the wiring on this where I'm
gonna be actually showing you guys
another video how I'm gonna set my
custom cables up we're gonna order them
on the actually in the video and then
we'll take a look at them when they
arrive they'll be custom links and all
that stuff but what's gonna be
interesting here is hiding wires on this
is gonna be a pain in the ass when I
probably end up doing though is building
a cover for the back of the motherboard
so that I can just have the mess of
wires under a cover and then I'll
probably make one for the front side of
Worthy hard drives would have gone as
well something else I think looks really
awesome in here is the dim two with the
EK water blocks heat sinks on there i
had to kind of jimmy rig that up though
because these nvm e's actually have
chips on the backside as well and the
the heat sinks that they sent me are
designed for chips or and nvme drives
that only had chips on one side
so it wouldn't fit with their little
backplate and clips that are supposed to
go on there because it just clips on
there so I had to kind of come up with
my own thing but I think it's fine we'll
test all that obviously the nice thing
it's the dim dot to makes it super easy
to take them out and work on it which is
exactly why I didn't use the motherboard
m2 mounting locations because obviously
from your rigid water-cooled which means
it's going to be like a lot of work to
get to an m2 Drive that's underneath the
cover on the motherboard so since we're
doing with water cooling dim dot - was
the obvious choice again in terms of
parts upgrades it's it's it's it's a
lateral move on the CPU a little bit
higher frequency because it's 1700 X
versus 69 50 X and then we've got to
tighten X little P's versus my tight
necks Pascal's which we're in skunkworks
now so these each have thirty eight
hundred and forty CUDA cores it doesn't
really matter this is just more about
being able to keep skunkworks together
and still have an awesome build that
makes me excited to go and look at it at
home but now I'm running the same
problem again Nick where I'm building
something that's so pretty I want I want
to display it and I want to use it and
want to tuck it away in the office but
you'll use it what you need to do is you
start coming over and forcing me to play
some games you used to do that all the
time and now you don't do that no more I
think could you spend all day with me by
the end of the day you're just like I'm
done with you
done with you but this isn't for the
same rig also - honorable mention -
performance - pcs comm may help me out
in a pinch as they always do cuz I've
always short something I needed a few
fittings and stuff they stepped up and
they are sending that to me so guys all
the water cooling stuff that you see
here is available at performance - pcs
comm not sure if singularity parts are
available there yet I think they are but
go and check it out guys I'll put a link
down below I'm gonna go help me help me
with a name alright guys thanks for
watching see you in part two point six
