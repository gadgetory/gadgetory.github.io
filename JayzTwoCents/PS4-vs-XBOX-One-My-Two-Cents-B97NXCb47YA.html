oh my god if you follow me on Twitter
you know things have been blowing up on
Jays to census account and here's why
ps4 and Xbox one later in May a few
weeks ago we were given a few details
regarding the Xbox one and a lot of
people were really wondering what is the
deal with the Xbox one it seems more
like a media console and so today both
parties had their press conferences for
their new console the Xbox one press
release only lasted an hour and we were
really left wondering what's the deal we
really kind of left wondering more about
the games we were left wondering more
about the console what it isn't we're
gonna get regarding the games because at
the Xbox one release we were told all
about the media aspects of it the fact
that it can allow you to watch the TV
that you already paid for and already
have a box for whether it's satellite or
internet or FiOS or you know cable
doesn't matter you already have a box
the fact that it can play Hulu and
Netflix and YouTube and all that stuff
who gives a shit the fact that you can
minimize the screen and input what
you're watching off to the side and have
all all this area of your screen filled
with sports scores and stats and ESPN
and all that crap this is a game console
who gives a shit about that seriously so
we wanted to know more about the games
Microsoft continued to call it nothing
more than a media device so okay fine we
expected III to bring us information
regarding the games and such so what do
we find out we find out in the interim
the Xbox requires you to connect to the
Internet at least once every 24 hours
when playing with your own console so
what happens after that 24 hours if you
have an internet outage for several days
and don't say this is 2013 that that
doesn't happen
I have Time Warner I'm the only house on
this node I have a 50 megabit connection
I am the only house connecting to the
pole which is in my back yard and in the
last year more than once we've been
without internet for up to three days
because of a connection
you somewhere in the data center so what
does that mean for the first 24 hours if
I were playing on my console I could
play offline games but after that 24
hours because the console can't check in
I can't play my offline game anymore
what the is that all about seriously and
if I were playing at a friend's console
I have to check in online every single
hour when doing that what is that all
about what is the point of that
seriously ok so we talk about use games
now in the Xbox one sure you can share a
game with a friend a disk that disk has
DRM content on it you can only share it
with one person one time and that person
has to been on your friends list for at
least 60 days so that means you can't
you know just meet a friend and yeah how
many how many of you guys have met
somebody and within a couple of days you
like yeah ok let's trade some games so
they give you a disc you give them a
disc and off you go
well you can't do that unless you've
been with friends with them on your
friends list for 60 days that's just
seriously a bunch of bullshit so I found
myself really wondering do I want an
Xbox one I'm not a huge console gamer I
mean look behind me this that this is my
life I'm a PC gamer so consoles have
just been not that big of a deal to me I
have an Xbox 360 my wife uses it more
than I do my kid plays Kinect on it it's
not been a huge part of my gaming life
when it comes to PlayStation I didn't
know what to expect because I haven't
owned a Playstation 2 or Playstation 3
the only Sony gaming device I've ever
owned was the original PlayStation and
even then I didn't play it all that much
it wasn't all that exciting to me so
then came a 3 and the Xbox one press
event I expect I had high hopes I
expected a lot so what does Microsoft do
they bring out you know your typical
games that you expect to see and we
finally get the battlefield 4
multiplayer demonstration and what
happens it starts off with no sound and
then the awkwardness of the guy on stage
a k-member his name because he was he
had the personality of a doorknob he
just goes ok we'll show you later and
walks off stage and we're going what the
hell is this shit
this is dice people this is what you get
with dice so then what do they do they
bring us titanfall
the game looks cool don't get me wrong
to me it really seems like what
battlefield 2142 successor could have
been and it's just another shooter but
with a mech suit so I just went okay
they really didn't show us very many
games we already know the DRM
restrictions on it are retarded we
already know that the Media Console is
really what they're after and they
didn't show us very many games so I
really didn't have a whole lot of hopes
then came the PlayStation 4 press
conference and everything they showed me
blew me away I didn't know what to
expect I had no expectations whatsoever
and I didn't really feel that I would
ever want to own a ps4 because I hadn't
owned a ps3 or a ps2 so why would I want
the ps4 until I watched the two-hour
presentation they showed a huge diverse
collection of games to bring it back
Final Fantasy they're bringing back
Kingdom Hearts and I've never played
Kingdom Hearts but just watching the
reaction of so many gamers on my Twitter
feed we're like oh my god Kingdom Hearts
is coming back I can't wait Kingdom
Hearts 3 um that made me want to figure
out what the hell is Kingdom Hearts what
am I missing so I want to go back and
play and maybe do some emulators and see
what that's all about
they showed so many different games and
when they walked out on stage to
introduce the PlayStation 4 they
introduced it as the world's most
advanced gaming system and at that point
my ears perked up and I was listening
this is a gaming system that's what I
care about I don't care about using it
to watch TV that I can already watch or
watching discs and blu-rays that I can
already play on my blu-ray player I want
to know what it can do that I can't do
now and the more I watch the more I was
just this is awesome we already know how
I feel about used games here I know how
I feel about DRM we already know how I
feel about the online requirement so I
waited and I didn't get my hopes up but
by the end of the hour and 45 minutes or
so I just was I want this I want this
console oh my god I'm a PC gamer but I
want this console and then they dropped
the bomb they didn't dance around it
they have been watching us they have
watching the videos people like
boogie2988 put out videos that I put out
videos that all of us little guys have
been trying to get Microsoft to listen
to
there is no DRM you can share it with as
many people as you want as often as you
want with whoever you want
there is no online check-in requirement
whatsoever you can play your offline
games as unlimited as you want from any
console that you want and it's a hundred
bucks less the Xbox one comes in at $499
and the PlayStation 4 comes in at 399
dollars once again put the games on top
it was all about the games to them so
PlayStation 4 and and Sony you're gonna
get my money you've made me feel excited
about console and that doesn't mean I'm
not gonna be a PC gamer I'm gonna
continue to play with my my plate my mic
see I can't even say computer my
playstation here my computer always be a
computer gamer at heart but now I have
more options PlayStation 4 has made me
excited I cannot wait for this holiday
season I will own one and I would really
love to get my hands on an Xbox one
codenamed Durango simply to run over
with my Durango Microsoft you had a
chance you had a chance to take the Xbox
360 and have its predecessor just be
something amazing and you drop the ball
fuck you
Sony I'll see you this holiday season</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
