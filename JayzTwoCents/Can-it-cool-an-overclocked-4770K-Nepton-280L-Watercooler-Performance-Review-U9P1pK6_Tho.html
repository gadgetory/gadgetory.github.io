got the reputation of being a little bit
of a water-cooling snob I don't really
think that's true at all all right maybe
it's just a little true so to try and
break out of that mold I'm gonna go
ahead and feature my test rig right here
in a video we're gonna throw in an
all-in-one water cooling unit the cooler
master Neptune 280 L I'm not above this
hell no you better not blow up my rig
now coolermaster obviously knows I'm a
little bit of a cooling snob so they
said why don't you go ahead and take our
280 L and take it for a test spin so
they sent this bad boy over and that's
what we're gonna do today now as you can
see this is a factory sealed box so this
isn't gonna be one of those I've already
taken it out and played with it I look
cooler that is we are gonna find out
together on camera for the first time
exactly what my impressions are of this
NEFT on 280 L so let's go ahead and talk
about the features real quick before we
get inside now it is maintenance-free so
this is not like the 240 glacier where
you can expand it open it up drain it
all that stuff it is maintenance-free
you don't open it
you open it up your void your warranty
got two times the surface area because
it's well I guess two times the surface
area of the 140 and it's got durable fep
tubing so it's kind of ribbed you know
for your PC's pleasure and you can bend
it around however you want so extreme
cooling performance dual jet flow 140
fans and I've I've played around the jet
flows and oh my god do they move a lot
of air like a lot now for CPU sockets
it'll fit on pretty much any CPU on the
market and as you can see right here
they've got some dimensions and some
cooling graphs and stuff now I don't
really care about their cooling graph I
care about my experiences with open it
up here it is right here now I do like
the way the packaging is I like the way
that everything is you know kind of
ready to go out of the box here's the
radiator and my goodness it is a pretty
good size if you ask me there
here is that radiator this is a pretty
good sized radiator I like this now the
pump in the block is one integrated unit
make sure you take off that plastic
piece before you put it on there I'm not
embarrassed to say that I've done that
before where I put it on with the
plastic cooling on there probably way
more times than I should have but here's
our tubing it's nice and big and like I
said it's nice and ribbed and the
fittings on here do rotate that's the
thing I really do like is they do rotate
but you can rotate it off to the sides
that way you can pretty much take as
much torque off the tubing as possible
you know you don't want to torque the
tubing even though it is pretty durable
so there's the radiator right there we
are going to be mounting this into the
top of my fractal arc XL for this review
here are those dual 140 millimeter jet
flow fans right here the cable on here
is sleeve this is a 4 pin pwm cable and
these these fins to move an awful lot of
air in fact these are rated to over
2,000 rpm so I definitely recommend you
hook it up to a PWM signal that way you
can control the speed of these fans cuz
my goodness do these things sound like a
jet when they're flowing do you see what
I did there
now that kind of brings me to the next
point coolermaster does not have
proprietary software for controlling
their fans and their all-in-one units so
compared to some other brands on the
market that may be a little bit of a
downside but I've yet to find a
motherboard where I couldn't actually
control a PWM fan so with that said
that's not going to be an issue oh and
also to the pump is PWM controlled so
you can speed up and slow down the pump
based on the load of your CPU so it's
got a lot of automatic control in there
so here's all your hardware right here
it does have everything for AMD and
Intel all your old and new socket sets
or I'm trying to get out of here if I
can is the PWM fan splitter thank you
for including this this is huge because
I have even on my end power board here I
have two CPU fan slots for PWM CPU one
CPU two and I've got two fans and a pump
I kind of lose control over something so
you can hook this up to like CPU - it
splits off to both your fans you can
control it through your motherboard and
then your CPU one can control your pump
or
first I however you want to set it up oh
this is all great talking about what's
in the box i'm talking about specs and
stuff but there's only one way you can
really see how well this thing works and
we are gonna hook it up to the god-awful
horribly hot 4770k that's right we're
gonna see how well this thing cools the
4770k while overclocked because we all
know 4770k is have been known to bring a
lot of all-in-one coolers right to their
knees and not in a good way
so the Coolermaster neptune 280 l how
does it do well first things first I
just want to let you know that my 4770k
was a perfect chip for this cooler
because it is an absolute king dud it
does not like to overclock and if I want
to push it anywhere at all above its
factory turbo spec I have to pump a lot
of voltage into it so I thought that is
the perfect scenario for testing this
cooler let's just pump a ton of voltage
into a chip that likes to get hot and
has thermal interface material issues
straight from the factory and let's see
how this cooler can handle it now right
now I'm running my chip at 4.4 gigahertz
but it's taking 1.2 9 volts to do it now
if you guys know anything about Intel
overclocking at all you know that
running 1.3 volts on the chip is
definitely a lot of voltage and it can
really push your temperatures up to the
ceiling really really fast in fact on
the empower motherboard if you plug in
one point three volts manually the font
turns red to basically tell you hey
buddy
hope you've enjoyed your chip while it's
lasted you're about to melt it to the
ground now when it comes to temperatures
it pretty much spends most of its time
during these stress tests bouncing
around the low 70s in the upper 60s but
it can get up into the 80s depending on
which algorithm it's throwing at the CPU
at that time but don't worry about those
temperatures under general use you're
never gonna leave the 50s over the 60s
these stress tests are designed to take
your CPU and hammer the shit out of them
in fact the little animation when you
turn on OCC T is a couple of guys taking
sledgehammers - with CPU it's exactly
what these things are doing they're
throwing redundant calculations at the
CPUs and absolutely positively maxing
out every capability of the CPU at the
same time so that's why these tests get
really hot sometimes and that's why
they're perfect test for coolers like
this so guys in depth on 280 L it's a
fantastic cooler in fact I've got an F
ton that's cooling the APU build and I
love the white glow around the logo on
the CPU the only thing I think would
make that better was if it was an RGB
maybe you could change the colors I
would change it to red currently for
this build or maybe even yellow or
something like that I think that's
really the only criticism I have about
this is that the LED should be able to
colors but that's just me you know some
of the other brands do that I think
maybe this one should as well but the
price is right
the cooling is right the functionality
is right it's got all the things I love
in a CPU cooler I'm a huge fan of the
fact that the 280 millimeter radiator
supports both 140 and 120 millimeter
fans that way if you have 120 fans you
prefer to use or maybe your case doesn't
support to 140 mils but you can fit the
radiator in it you could use 120
millimeter fans to mount it so it just
gives you a little bit extra
compatibility and versatility so this
summer if you guys are looking for a way
to keep your CPU from catching fire you
should definitely have the Neptune
series on your shortlist it's available
on a couple of different sizes in fact a
Computex they even talked about new
versions of this cooler coming out soon
we'll definitely be taking a look at
that here on this channel gotta give a
huge thank you to Coolermaster for
sending me this cooler to look at and
test for you guys hopefully you guys
have enjoyed the video and it helps you
make a decision when it comes to buying
cooler for your computer now one last
thing I want to mention if you haven't
noticed this video is only available in
720p that's because I'm trying out
YouTube's brand new 60 frames per second
function to see how well you guys like
it would you guys rather have 1080p
video at 30 frames per second or would
you rather have 720p video at 60 frames
per second unfortunately my camera's not
capable of doing 1080p at 60 frames per
second I am in the market for a new
camera so maybe the future I'll be able
to do 1080 at 60 frames for now you guys
have a choice which one do you like head
over to Twitter to tell me I'm probably
not gonna be able to see all the
comments here on youtube head over to
Twitter it's at Jay's 2 cents pretty
easy to find me it's the same for
Instagram and Facebook and all that
stuff and tell me if you guys want 720
at 60 or 1080 at 30 so guys I'm gonna
get the heck on out of here as always
I'll see you in the next one at least I
hope so unless you've been subbed and
then you're not watching this anyway so
I guess I guess I will see you in the
next one whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
