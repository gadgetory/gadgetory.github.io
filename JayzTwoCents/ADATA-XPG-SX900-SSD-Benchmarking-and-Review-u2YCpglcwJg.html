cents your one-stop place of learning
how to tweak and build and upgrade your
PC and with keeping that tradition alive
we're gonna go ahead and take a look
today at the a data xpg SX 900
solid-state drive this thing is pretty
cool so let's go ahead and dive in and
take a look if you're like me when it
comes to upgrading your PC or building
or just getting anything new you want to
tear into the box and throw it aside and
generally I would do that but for the
sake of educational purposes we're gonna
go ahead and take a look at what's
printed on the box because it puts the
most important information about this
SSD right here where you can see it
first off it does have smart command
support not all hard drives on the
market have smart support and having
that smart utilization built in gives
you the ability to talk to your hard
drive and learn a lot about what's going
on and when it comes to SSDs it's pretty
important because it lets you know
everything that's going on with your
drive so this definitely supports smart
support for controller this is driven by
sand force there are other kinds of
controllers on the market Marvel for
instance this is a sand force drive it
does have shock resistance built in it
has trimmed support and it's got the
Acronis True Image HD and what that does
is it allows you to copy your current
hard drive or SSD or whatever it may be
over to this one without having to
reinstall all your programs or windows
or any of that we're gonna definitely be
testing that feature as it's going to be
going into my main system right here on
the back of the box it tells you what
comes included it is a two and a half
inch SSD but it does have built-in ECC
and wear leveling technology so what
that means is that it's gonna constantly
move data around as you're reading and
writing to give you maximum life on this
drive if you're not familiar with how
SSDs work they're basically like memory
chips built into the hard drive rather
than having a moving disk or a rotating
disk in there and the lifespan is based
on read/write of each individual chip
and module so what this does is it keeps
the information nice and spread out so
that you don't what
portions of the drive prematurely so it
keeps things nice and level not only
does it include the migration software
it also includes the three and a half
inch bracket in case you have a case
that doesn't support a two and a half
inch drive you can use a three and a
half inch adapter and mount this
anywhere you could put a standard sized
hard drive now when it comes to read
speed it is up to five hundred and fifty
megabytes per second for documents and
up to five hundred and ten megabytes per
second for multimedia data and for the
write speed you have up to five hundred
and thirty megabytes for documents and
up to three hundred and twenty megabytes
for multimedia that's pretty fast and
it's a lot faster than the M for them
getting ready to replace this is gonna
be a pretty simple unboxing so we're
gonna go ahead and do that right now
it's just got these two little seals
over here break that this is unopened
we're opening this together for the
first time right here on J's two cents
and I am not the most graceful unboxer
in the world but I get the job done I
can get in the box alright so when you
pull it out this is what you're greeted
with here the SSD is sitting in a
plastic tray you have your QuickStart
guide right here which is going to talk
all about getting it mounted into your
computer it's gonna have C this is gonna
be in here it's got a million different
languages on here but it's got your
start Drive your handling precautions
and how to install it and all of that
and you have your drive right here it is
a brushed metal drive it's pretty
cool-looking actually I do like that
it's this brushed black I actually
thought it was greatest on the pictures
but this is brushed black which is
actually gonna look really good in my
case even though you can't really see it
as you can see that I did go I did get a
256 gigabyte model which is a step up
from 128 gig but I currently have you
have this little bracket right here I'm
not entirely too sure what that's for
wat to take a look at that together you
have the three-and-a-half inch adapter
here which is kind of a purpley color
interestingly enough go ahead tear that
open a look real quick
so it's like a a violet color which is
kind of strange I would think that they
would have made that black but whatever
I digress it's I guess if you're into
that color and that's pretty much it so
what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna do some
investigation here on how we use their
migration software we're gonna go ahead
and migrate my current Windows
installation over to this drive to see
how well the software works and whether
or not it's flawless or not and just how
easy it is and then we'll get into some
benchmarking and see just how fast this
drive really is
okay real quickly when it comes to the
migration software the way it works is
there's a little bit of a there's a
little folded up document in here that
tells you exactly what to do it gives
you a address for you to go to a web URL
that you go and you download the
software and then what they've done is
on the back of each SSD and I'm gonna
cover mine up but under my finger here
is a sticker with a serial key on there
or a authentication key for the Acronis
ati HD 2013 migration software so that's
how you do it there's a sticker on here
with a key you download the software you
put in your reboot you turn off your
computer obviously you install your
drive and then you let the migration
utility do its thing so we're gonna go
ahead and do that now and when we come
back the drive will be installed and
we'll go ahead and see how well that
migration utility actually works
I've got the SSD installed it is really
really fast and I've got to say that
when it comes to using the utility for
migrating the data over to the new hard
drive from whatever hard drive you
currently have whether it be a hard
drive or an SSD or whatever it may be
was very very painless it was flawless
it worked perfectly and there was
absolutely no issues using that
whatsoever well I think that back my
mouse wouldn't work in the little
utility thing but the keyboard did and
everything was fine so there's really no
complaints there who knows why that was
but whatever it was now let's go ahead
and talk about the speed of this drive I
used three different well two different
utilities to actually benchmark this and
then I loaded up battlefield 3 as a
little speed test on loading of the game
now the first drive I'm gonna show you
here is my crucial m4 and that was a 282
megabyte per second read speed and 188
megabyte per second write speed this a
data this xpg SX 900 is advertised as I
mentioned at 550 read for documents 510
read for multimedia and 530 write for
documents - 324 multimedia and we got
speeds that are pretty much as
advertised I mean we got 494 megabytes
per second read speed as the drive was
being used as the operating system so
and about 50% utilization on this but
you can see we got 494 megabytes per
second read speed 330 byte 330 megabytes
per second write speed in multimedia and
now just to kind of cross-reference that
with another benchmark here I used DX
stories there little utility for
measuring how fast it can write to the
drive when it comes to capturing games
game capture and stuff we have as you
can see here 169 megabytes per second on
the m4 which is the bottom drive there
322 megabytes per second right speed on
the a data and that hundred and thirteen
that you see there is a 7200 rpm
mechanical Drive to kind of give you
some ideas of how fast this drive really
is so there you have it guys if you if
you're looking for an inexpensive SSD
that comes in at a pretty good price
that right about eighty cents per
gigabyte this is a great great bargain
it looks good if it's gonna be on this
place somewhere where you can see it the
speeds on it are not the fastest on the
market but they're definitely very
competitive they're very good Windows
boots for me in about twelve to fifteen
seconds and that's from the point at
which you see the splash screen for your
motherboard go away a lot of people like
to measure their you know boot time from
the moment they push power but every
motherboard boots at a different speed
so it's about twelve seconds once you
see the windows logo pop up really
really fast and battlefield loaded in
under thirty seconds in 64 player maps
that is just really awesome this is
gonna be my new main drive here on the
the big black and yellow case yeah
system that I have here and guys if
you've enjoyed this video you know what
to do if you're looking for an SSD this
season definitely give a data look there
a product that I think performs really
really well at a price that's not gonna
break your bank and of course are
available anywhere from 64 gigs up to
500 gigabytes and there is a lot of
Technology in this drive when it comes
to migration when it comes to level when
they call it level we're we're level
technology where it keeps the drive
operating as long as possible it's got
smart technology so it's definitely
worth taking a look at guys I'm gonna
get on out of here thanks for watching
this video and as always I will see you
when I see you in my next video take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
