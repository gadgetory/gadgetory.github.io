and trust me when I say that there are
very few times in life or sighs truly
matters trust me I would know but don't
tell that to zou Tek because with their
new GT X 1080 amp Xtreme they obviously
let the extreme stand for its size
because behind this is a standard
founders edition card which is I've
never actually looked so little and puny
until now remember this this is this is
crazy the new z170 classified
motherboard from EVGA features eight
phase PWM four-way SLI support along
with top notch components to offer
gamers and enthusiasts more of what they
want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more
all right now I don't want to spend a
lot of time going over the specs that we
already know this is like the 6th 1080
review we've done it's the same 16
nanometer GPU 106 FinFET Pascal core
256-bit memory bus a gigabytes of g5x
the memory coming out of the box on here
is actually overclocked 2500 and 60 CUDA
cores and it's got a boost clock of 1911
megahertz out of the box the base clock
on this card is faster than the boost
clock on the founders Edition obviously
this one is much much bigger it's got 2
8 pin power connectors on here 270 watt
TDP on this card so obviously that's up
almost 100 watts from the standard
founders Edition allowing it to pull a
lot of power to try and get the best
overclocking out of box but we'll talk
about that in a minute trust me
overclocking was something I really
wanted to spend with our time with on
this card but it's got its Icestorm
triple fan design here
it's got massive heat pipes on here
running the length of the card the card
measures about a foot long it's a really
really long card and it's a triple slot
card so you want to keep that in mind
that small form-factor builds this is
not exactly a small form-factor card now
just like the other app cards in the
past it's got this very really kind of a
in-your-face gunmetal in yellow design
which actually fit perfectly in the sim
rig because I've got a black and yellow
theme going on in there but it's got
this this light on the back here that
says push the limit and unfortunately I
agree with some folks that this kind of
looks gaudy I think this takes away from
the whole appeal of the car
it's not a sticker that you can just
peel off you got to keep that in mind
this card right here is humongous now
kind of keeping a tradition with the
other ten eighties we've seen this does
not have a multiple bio selection on it
which is kind of interesting because
with the 980 T is we saw lots of
graphics cards that had bio selector
switches for higher voltages and more
overclocking options more fan options
but so far none of the Tenet's I've
taken a look at actually have that
feature and I'm wondering if that has
something to do with the core or in
videos getting involved with that so on
the front of the card here these do
light up light the zotac logo here
lights up white and this actually pushes
a lot of light down in your case so when
it's facing like this you are going to
see the lit so tach right here and this
is going to push a lot of light down so
it's going to light what's underneath
the card pretty nicely but with that
said let's go and talk about the things
you guys want to know how does it
perform well let's go ahead and find out
right now okay so before we jump into
the benchmarks I know I just told you we
were going to do that but then we didn't
do that I wanted to point out obviously
as you can see the LEDs on the front
right now are not white and that's
because I didn't realize that if you
downloaded the firestorm app it was
actually a an LED chip that's changeable
colors in there now it's not true RGB
because you can't choose from the
18,000,000 color spectrum on there it's
just selectable lighting colors is like
seven colors that you can choose from
you can change the lighting including
that silly push the limits logo on the
back plate to change a color to be
whatever you want but although it's a
gunmetal and yellow back plate it's
going to look good in a black and yellow
build kind of like the old skunk works
or like a bumble bee theme or even like
a fallout 4 theme or something like that
would look really really good with this
card but then again you know I've always
wondered what the point of RGB is or
color selectable LEDs when the card
already has its own color theme anyway I
digress
again let's go ahead and jump into those
benchmarks transition
you
okay holy hell if this isn't like the
ron jeremy of Tanna tees oh my god it is
freaking the okay fortunately in the in
your endows are going to continue on
this because let's just face it there's
some huge material to work with yeah
that was cringeworthy but i move on and
i digress
that this is the fastest 1080 out of the
box that I've had come through the
channel yet I've already checked out
several of these cards custom PCBs
founders editions and out of the box
this thing boosted all the way up to
2050 megahertz
on its own without touching anything no
additional fan curve no additional power
limit no additional template that 270
watt TDP is at the hundred percent power
lemon on there which they allow you to
go to 120 percent which means you could
do a lot of power draw on this card with
the two 8-pin connectors on there but
yeah i boosted all the way up to 2050
and the crazy thing about that is the
fan curve on this with the three fans
and it's custom fan design and the
massive heat pipes on this and just the
Boheme ithaca cooler kept this thing
under 66 C the entire time what's kind
of funny about that is that's right on
the threshold of where the fans turn on
and on this card here it's the only card
I've seen that's come through this
channel yet that's been able to turn the
fan on in the middle of the test and
cool itself off enough to turn off again
during the stress test oh yeah it turns
back on pretty quickly but it actually
will go on off on off while stress
testing and I've never had a cooler
that's been good enough yet on a tiny to
manage to do that but the fan curve on
this is actually very very noise
friendly where you're never going to
hear the fans on this ever and that's
without even touching touching temp
limits and stuff you play with the fan
curve even a little bit you can get a
lot of additional boost out of this but
twenty fifty in my scenario here that's
139 megahertz faster than the advertised
1911 boost speed so out of the box this
is the fastest 1080 I've looked at yet
but like I said the Indian your endows
continued unfortunately even though it
has a dual eight pin power plug design
270 watt TDP eight plus two power phase
and a massive cooler the size of
Manhattan I cannot achieve a stable
twenty one hundred megahertz overclock
on that that's only fifteen megahertz
faster than it boosts
- on its own although that be 139
megahertz faster than its booze clock of
1911 on the box
yeah 10 80s just that that seems to be a
magical number 2100 above is not easy
for them to achieve ironically the only
cards I have that can continuously hit
2100 and be stable are my Founders
edition cards which have left a lot of
people wondering if Nvidia maybe was
handpicking these cores and hanging on
to them for the founders edition all
three of my founders edition cards can
achieve 2100 or more this exact one I'm
holding my hand good 2,136 the one I
already put the waterblock on can hit
twenty one hundred and sixty six
megahertz on air that I haven't even
tested on water yet yeah so again single
eight pin power and standard power phase
design these are going farther than all
of these custom cards now that said it
is the farthest boosting bar card out of
the box yet these didn't boost this far
so if you're the kind of person that
wants to get a massive card and just put
it in and know you're getting you're
going to get over 2,000 megahertz
guaranteed then it's it is a fantastic
card it really is as an overclocking
enthusiast myself I was hoping with all
this extra extreme power and stuff that
it would get me 2100 and higher 2150 or
maybe even like the unicorn 2200 not
even close
unfortunately at 2100 I started seeing
black artifact artifacting on the screen
without even touching the memory because
again the memory runs at just under
11,000 on its own it's like 24 80 so
it's like ten thousand nine hundred and
forty or nine hundred and sixty so it's
really fast memory out of the box I
didn't even touch that yeah I was
getting artifacting at 2100 with be sink
or g-sync off of course when when g-sync
and vsync is on the megahertz can ramp
up the core isn't under as much load and
it can actually stay stable but the
problem is once you let the FPS run away
and go to its max generated fps
something happens in the calculations
and then the core just falls on its face
at the same speed it's stable at with
vsync on but if you're a die-hard
overclocker
again silicon lottery is going to make
the biggest impact on how far your card
is going to overclock there's no way of
knowing what's going to happen until you
get out and try it so there you go guys
the zotac 1080 and
stream card the fastest boost clock out
of the box that I've tested yet if
you're a die-hard overclocker remember
Silicon Lottery matters more than
anything that you put on the card and
there's no way of knowing how well that
card is going to perform until you get
it and check it out you might get a
unicorn
you might get a dud again that's why
it's called the silicon lottery tell me
what you guys think down in the comments
about this card I find a lot of people
love it and a lot of people hate it not
many people in the middle brown and it
all comes down to the styling the
styling on this is really kind of
in-your-face some people like that in
some don't you guys tell me do you like
it and what other cards do you guys want
me to check out because I'm going to
kind of cut off the 1080 reviews here
pretty soon I don't want to do too many
1080 reviews and obviously we've got the
1060 launch and right around the corner
and I want to look at some more 1070 s
with that said guide with that but that
said guys I'm gonna go ahead and get on
out of here thanks for watching and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
