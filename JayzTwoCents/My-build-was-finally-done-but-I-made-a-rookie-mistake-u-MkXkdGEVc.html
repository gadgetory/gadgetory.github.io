you
as with all new builds we had to do some
testing and I discovered a problem and
this is a problem I've done probably
once or twice since I know since
starting the channel so in the last five
and a half years not a bad run if you
ask me but it's a pretty noobish mistake
one that I think even the best of us can
make and I'll just show you if you look
at the temperature right here Nick get
in your clothes I want you to see how
fast the temperature is rising on this
graphics card right here it's actually
not as bad as it was it was rising all
the way to like oh jeez I went to look
to like 80 C in the first 10 seconds of
running I've actually got to improve a
little bit but here's the problem this
GP right here is not it's not put
together right something is causing the
block to push off a little bit so it's
not making great contact with the GPU
you can kind of see right here when I
squeeze it you see all that see all that
flex that shouldn't be like that that
should be sitting nice and flush what
I'm gonna do right here watch the
temperature Nick stay focused on the
temp so when I squeeze the block
together watch the temps come down see
I'm squeezing it see how it came down
like 5 degrees 6 degrees instantly I'm
gonna let go watch a temps client so
what does that mean well guys that means
that we unfortunately I say we it's all
on me I have to drain the loop and I
have to pull the GPUs out and I have to
take that GPU apart figure out why it's
not making good contact and put it back
together so it's looking a lot like I
just forgot to tighten these down look
how this is how loose that was and this
one's the same well I should just
tighten that one off-camera this one's
the same and that one's the same what I
tend to do is I get everything in place
and then I start with these four and
then work my way out when tightening
down the card it just seems like on this
one I forgot to do that I'm still gonna
take it apart and look at it probably
reapply the thermal paste man there's
some shaky hands today I'm a third yeah
that's my shooting hand I'm still gonna
take it apart and look though I mean
like I said I it's four screws now to
get the block off so what
the difference at this point right right
because if I put this back in and does
the same thing again and I'm like god
I'd be super mad
I would be about as mad as pulse
hardware well it's got good print now
because I spreaded it already but I
guarantee the first time like Nick saw
off-camera it was going up to like a TC
just like in a few seconds that's
because it wasn't making any contact I'm
fairly certain until I start squishing
squishing squishing I think I just sort
of forced it to touch a little bit
okay so we've had Kevin benchmark
running right now on loop and we are
sitting at 45 C on the first GPU and 43
C Watts warmer here 43 C on the second
GPU running heaven benchmark with
everything's max tessellations max the
anti-aliasing is maxed all the settings
are max I'm trying to pump as much heat
into this loop for a couple of reasons
one I want to see what as max
temperature is gonna be and two just
because I want to make sure that the fix
worked because I made that stupid dummy
mistake of not tightening the block all
the way but whatever even the best of us
can make mistakes but anyway that is my
system it is mostly done I just need to
figure out the lighting I I want to put
UV lights in here because the cable mod
UV hybrid lights look phenomenal they're
bright and the UV actually makes this
loop just pop it looks radioactive it
glows so much I definitely want that and
although the asus or lighting on both
the polaris fans from in wind and the
ram-paige motherboard look great i want
to front light that loop and make it
really show so i got to figure out how i
want to do that because obviously a
tubular frame like this is not giving
many mounting options for lighting and
for it to actually look decent so I got
to figure that out but one thing to kind
of point out with temperatures here
though we're sitting here at 46 C and 44
C under load overclocked to 2025
megahertz on Titan XPS on an overclocked
7900 X running 4.5 gigahertz with the
fans running at their slowest speed so
this is kind of like the worst case
scenario in terms of temperatures and
man you put your hand right here whoo it
is warm there's no doubt about it
so if I was to go in there and speed up
the fans which I can do obviously using
the
aisa software then I can get better
temperatures but I just want to see how
bad it would be not even 50 see under
this test which has been running for
over a half an hour so definitely
reached it will equilibrium on the Prima
chill view fluid which is a brand new
fluid bright green looks amazing but
anyway this build wouldn't be possible
without the help of my sponsors so ek
water blocks are sending me the water
cooling gear singularity for sending me
this amazing reservoir pump combo in win
for sending me the polaris fans and the
d frame 2.0 I'm a huge fan of these fans
sense so look a piece of dust I am a
huge fan of these fans I know that
sounds really silly I wanted to do RGB I
wanted to control the fan color and the
problem with most most fans is you've
got wires upon wires coming off
everywhere for that but in one actually
Daisy changed them so I have one cable
that has both power and RGB going to the
first fan which is this one right here
and it daisy chains to all six of them
so all six are being controlled off one
cable man that makes wire management
absolutely amazing so that's even
besides effect their amazing build
quality with rubber standoffs and
aluminum shrouds and it just looks
amazing but that daisy chaining yes
thank you for that oh my god thank you
and it just uses an RGB header it
doesn't require like any other
standalone boxes to do anything thank
you I just want to give a huge thank you
to performance - PCs calm guys links to
all these companies are down below
they have always stepped in and helped
me out when I forget something or I
order something wrong and they always
straighten it out and it seems to happen
every single build but guys for your
water cooling gear definitely go and
check it out everything you see here in
terms of water cooling and customization
is available from them so definitely
worth checking out and of course guys
cable mod you guys remember how I showed
you in the last update video how you can
go in there and use their cable mod
configurator to set up cables how you
want them well that's exactly what I did
they built them they arrived in less
than a week and here they are now
installed to my specs my length the
colors I wanted the color order even
these green screws right here
I ordered through them that way we can
add a little bit more green to the
system so if you really want to get your
system to the next level check out cable
mod and check out their configurator
pretty much every single major power
supply
is supported even the in wing one but
guys it's time to go thanks for watching
hope you guys have enjoyed this build
series this is my new personal rig it
means skunk works we'll be coming back
to the studio which is gonna kind of
suck now cuz I'm gonna be like I'm just
looking at the D frame
dad's got built two of every system now
we have one for the studio one for home
right way shaking her head no don't have
to you wants to look at once to play on
anyway I'm gonna go and some of you guys
are probably wondering wort about
benchmarks I barely got Windows and
stuff installed on this I'll probably do
a benchmark video but you guys are still
waiting on the thread Ripper benchmarks
as well and let's face it it runs about
as good as you expect to Titan XP is
overclocked to run and that's fast
that's really fast all right guys I'm
gonna go thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
