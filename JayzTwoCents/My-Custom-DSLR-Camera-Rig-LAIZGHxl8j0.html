Jays two cents and many of you been
asking for more information about the
camera setup that I use or have recently
built for my channel to get some of the
epic cinematic stuff that you see every
now and then so I figured today I'd go
ahead and give you guys a little tech
attic look and what it is I use here on
my channel now if you follow me on
Twitter and why the hell wouldn't you be
following me on Twitter the link is down
below you would have already seen some
sneak peeks of this camera rig
especially as I've been building it over
the last couple of months
the most common thing you guys said was
this looks like that turret on the
Millennium Falcon in Star Wars you know
when they're doing that thing it is kind
of fun to sit here and you know aim this
thing around and have some fun with it
but let's go ahead and get down to
business when I was a kid I was the kind
of guy that was always making movies I
made my own indie films I made my own
sets I took you know praat I made my own
props and stuff and I was the kind of
guy who never wanted to be in front of
the camera which is why this whole
YouTube thing is kind of weird I would
much rather be the guy that's behind the
scenes that's working the camera
director photography or director of
actors because this is where I'm
comfortable I'm comfortable back here so
I had to build a rig that I felt was
comfortable for me having a nice rig
gives you confidence to make your videos
and stuff but it's definitely not
necessary for right off the bat anyone
that's gonna say that this is overkill
for doing YouTube absolutely however
this rig was designed for being able to
do mobile interviews it's gonna be going
to CES it's gonna be helping me do more
cinematic indie type films in the future
probably for the vlog channels they may
not be tech related now we've got a rig
where I can do that so let's go ahead
and take a look at some of the parts at
the heart of this rig we have my Canon
t2i which might actually surprise some
of you guys considering the fact that
this camera is so old however it has all
the functions that I need it's got the
same sensor as the 60d in there which is
a fairly decent low light sensor it's
not great when it comes to low light
which is really its drawback but it gets
the job done
it's got 1080p 24 P it's got 30 P it's
got 720p at 60 frames per second so I
can do that nice
move slow motion stuff like you saw on
the 20k subscribers video where the
whole video was done in slow motion film
it at 60 P slowed it down that's what
you get now when it comes to the frame
that everything is mounted to on here
this is an SP productions shoulder rig
and it's a basic model because I knew I
was gonna be building up on top of this
so I didn't really want to pay for a lot
of parts that I wasn't gonna use but
what I liked about it is that it was
under 300 bucks and it came with the
follow focus now the follow focus on
this isn't perfect but it has all the
features that I need so it's got the
stops that you can dial in there it's
got the you know the whiteboard material
if you will where you can put marks on
there so you can control your focus and
it hooks directly up to the lens so you
can see that so when you turn this it is
adjusting the lens focus on the camera
which is absolutely you know it's
perfect it's it's nice and smooth I have
no complaints about whatsoever i mounted
up perfectly the shoulder pad here this
is you know obviously a shoulder rig so
we'll go ahead and demonstrate that real
quick this is designed to be able to go
onto your shoulder so when you're doing
running and gunning or you're doing it
it's actually referred to as running gun
believe it or not so when you're doing
running and gunning and you're recording
out in the field you know you have a
nice a nice comfortable pad on here and
it is fully adjustable right now it's
it's adjusted so that the cameras
farther out but you can move it in so
it's closer to your body and I do need
to add a counterweight to the back of
this because it is still a bit front
heavy the rig isn't a hundred percent
complete but it's about 90% complete
mental have any complaints about it but
yeah if you wanted to move the shoulder
pad forward for comfort just loosen
these knobs right here just slide it
forward where you want it to go lock it
down and you're all set but I'm gonna be
adding a counterweight back here about
four extra pounds that way it's got a
little bit more rear weight to it so
your arms aren't as tired when you're
holding that now when it comes to
running and gunning as I mentioned here
I do have the Nexus 7 tablet connected
to my rig here through this home-brewed
11 inch articulating arm with this you
know cheap eBay
in case and then a ARCA Swiss cheese
plates that everything is mounted to
nice and sturdy it's not going anywhere
and the cool part is with this
articulating arm is I can move this
around literally in any position I want
it so if I had the camera down low and
because the tqi doesn't have the
articulating flip screen like the t3i
inure do I can just move that to
wherever I want it the cool part about
this too is that I can flip it around so
that it faces me that way when I'm
filming myself I am perfectly in focus
see we flipped it around and now I have
a front-facing monitor on there and when
I turn on the camera the software that's
built into the DSLR controller app
immediately turns on you'll see it turns
it on there this and now you can see
there's me oh so now we have a
front-facing camera and everything is
hunky-dory it was a lot cheaper to go
with a tablet for this than it was to go
with an actual 7 inch HD field monitor
because the Nexus 7 was only 229 bucks
and a HD field monitor that 7 inches
costs over $800 so you do the math on
that 229 Plus about 50 bucks with all of
the stuff here to make it mount versus
$800 yeah that's pretty much a
no-brainer now on the front here which
is the part that most people you know
that catches their attention that has
that real professional look is my pro a
matte box and a lot of people ask what a
matte box does obviously you have these
shields on here that you can use to
block the Sun they're made of metal and
they are adjustable so you can swing
them in and out if this needs to be up
higher you can raise the side of this
and get you know all the Sun flares and
blooms off of your lens I also like that
they are removable just with some thumb
screws so that if you're doing indoor
recording and you don't need these two
you know obviously I don't need them
indoors you just take them off which
makes the camera rig just a little bit
less bulky definitely needed though if
you're gonna be doing outdoor stuff now
not only is this block the Sun but it
also allows me to install filters on
here so that if I want to get a custom
effects or look I just simply install
glass filters that are designed for
these particular frames they slide right
into the montt to the matte box
and you just lock them down and then you
can get you know a more customized
cinematic look or you can even just
block out more sunlight if you have if
it's a really bright day and you don't
want to change your camera settings to
block out the Sun because you there's a
particular look that you're going for
you can simply do it with these big
filters right here so that's the purpose
of the matte box now on the top here
I've got my cowboy studios 160 LED light
for when you're doing you know dark room
you know interviews and stuff this is
pretty much only gonna be it is dimmable
as you can see here it is pretty much
only gonna be used for CES I just have
it on here because I don't have anyplace
else really did to mount it and then
I've got my zoom h4n which has the Don
King hairdo sportin a little donking
hair which blocks all the wind noise if
you're outside that outputs directly
into the camera
it has XLR inputs in the back so when
I'm doing my interviews at CES it's
gonna be bringing the audio straight in
to the camera and then it's got an audio
output right here that the cameraman can
be listening with headphones monitoring
all the audio telling us if there's any
problems now when it comes to the tripod
I am using an FM 18 fluid head as you
can see it's very smooth it is
adjustable on how tight it is so I can
tighten it up and it gets a much more
tight movement which is good for if
you're doing pans and stuff and then you
know you've got this lever here which
you can turn and then you get you know
your up-and-down movements and stuff so
then you get full customizable movement
of your tripod and then it else it is
also a quick release you just flip this
knob and then push this button on the
side and as you saw earlier you can
slide the camera right off and what I
like about this tripod is it also has a
safety on there when you pull it back
you'll hear it click hear it click now
if you forget to to mount that knob and
you go to tilt the thing forward if you
didn't have that safety lock in there
your camera would just fall off the
front of the tripod and break but as you
can see
it's it's not going off cuz it hits that
lock so this tripod was about 180 bucks
it's not too expensive when it comes to
videography video ography head tripod
heads it is a lower-end fluid tripod but
for me it gets the job done and then on
the top here i forgot to mention
everything is just mounted to the hot
shoot here with a steel bracket I'm not
too happy with that I don't want that
much weight on my hot shoe so I might
change that where I get another arm and
I mount the the zoom over here on this
side and when it comes to software my t2
I if you know anything about cannons is
using magic lantern magic lantern is a
custom firmware on here that allows me
to just control all sorts of really neat
stuff when it comes to the camera so
guys that's pretty much it there's
nothing else really to talk about here
you guys are gonna see this camera used
a lot more in the future I'm gonna be
doing some more feature films with this
and who knows maybe even one day I'll
start filming weddings or something I
don't know and we do interviews or
something for hire make this camera work
for me but we are gonna be using this at
CES and it's definitely a lot of fun
putting this together it is certainly
not needed for YouTube video guys it is
by far overkill when it comes to YouTube
but because I am me because I am a DP or
a director of photography deep down
inside when it comes to videography this
is my passion so I wanted something that
I could have fun with outside of YouTube
as well and and there's some videos I
have in mind that I want to make with
this that are gonna be very cool I hope
you guys will check them out so as
always I appreciate you watching this
video I love you effect I love the fact
I love each and every one of you for
supporting this channel over twenty
three thousand subscribers strong and
yes I just dated this video by saying
that but it's important to say that your
guys's support is what keeps me going in
all of this look down in the description
we've got some links down there to my
blog channel to the Facebook page to the
to the Twitter go and check out those
pages if you want to interact more with
me those are better places to get hold
of me than YouTube because there's just
so many damn comments that come through
my channel on a daily basis so I'm gonna
get on out of here I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna make some sort of really cool
video or something you know I don't
I don't know maybe I'll just walk around
town with this thing on my shoulder and
look like a complete and utter idiot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
