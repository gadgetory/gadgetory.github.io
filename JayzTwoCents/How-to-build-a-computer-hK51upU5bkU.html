we need to build a new computer we are
gonna build ourselves the ultimate 9900
Kay editing rig so we've teamed up with
MSI to show you how to build it so these
are the parts that we've chosen for our
onion 100k build and again a huge thank
you to MSI for sponsoring today's video
now the main part of this and
everything's gonna attach to is our m EG
z 390 god like this is their flagship z
390 motherboard it has all the features
we need to unlock all of the features of
our 9900 k it's overclockable expandable
and even has a live streaming capture
card that comes with it as well as an
MDOT 2 expansion card that can plug into
your PCI Express Lanes giving you a
total of five nvme m2 drives on this so
that's amazing when it comes to a
motherboard for a graphics card we've
also chosen the msi RT X xx atti trio
this is a custom PCB overclocking
friendly xx atti that's gonna give our
gaming performance as well as our
rendering performance a huge boost now
as mentioned we've got our 9900 K we
will be overclocking this because you
know overclocking you might be asking
yourself why we chose a 9900 K for an
editing rig when there's X 299 a much
higher core count CPUs out there well
that is because of quick sync this has
something called quick sync which means
premiere can actually leverage the
internal GPU in this chip as well as our
GPU on top of all the other core you
know workout that's happening during
premiere to give us a huge edge when it
comes to rendering speeds so we saw a
huge improvement with the 9900 K in our
small form-factor build when we enabled
Hardware encoding and it was a huge
boost versus not using it at all even
with having a GPU so that's why we're
using that now in terms of power supply
I am using my RM 850 this is a Corsair a
power supply we're using a custom sleeve
cable set for that to make it look good
obviously I mean this is a little bit of
an extreme build we want it to look as
good as possible because it's a
showpiece as well as a regular desktop
PC now we've got here some very special
edition Corsair ram this is the
Dominator platinum it's actually the
black and orange with
the burnt tops but I switched the silver
tops back on this making this more of a
one-on-one custom one-off as a lot of
ones in their RAM for this build because
we are using our be quiet silent bass
801 case which is also black and orange
so this is gonna tie in a bit of a theme
there
speaking of case obviously we like I say
we're using the silent based 801 it's a
full tower case it's gonna fit our
motherboard our graphics cards and we
have plenty of expansion availability on
there when it comes to hard drives want
to add more spinning storage to keep our
CPU cool we're using the NZXT kraken X
72 this is a 360 millimeter a i/o water
cooler which is going to be easy to
service because this is a rendering
system we're not doing custom loop or
rigid tubes or anything like that
because ease of maintenance and working
on this system needs to be a priority if
somebody goes down so we can easily swap
it out we care about lights and stuff
around here we like bling if that's not
obvious already so we are using the NZXT
q2 lighting accessory kit we might
expand this to also using the under glow
for the case we'll see how that goes and
then storage this is this is the
interesting part here because this is an
editing rig you'll see we've actually
got three different types of storage
here we are going to be using a patriot
400 and gig 480 gigabyte nvme SSD so
it's an m2 SSD that will be plugged in
directly to our motherboard in one of
the MDOT 2 slots that's gonna house our
operating system premiere stuff like
that that we want to load quickly we
have a kingston SSDI SSD drive this is
our scratch drive we're gonna move all
footage we're editing on onto this drive
and that's the only thing that's gonna
be tasked with is allowing us to edit
off of this drive so it doesn't have to
share resources with any other drives
the only readwrite this can be happening
on here is with our project files and
when we're done we move them off and
then the process continues and then we
have got the behemoth right here this is
our Seagate iron wolf 10 terabyte drive
this is going to be our storage drive
for all of our video project files when
they're done and then we move them from
there to our Nazz so we have kind of a
redundant backup on there so now that
all the parts have been discussed let's
go ahead and talk about the tools we're
going to use for this build now to build
a computer like this you don't really
need any sort of specialized
in fact all you pretty much are gonna
need is a screwdriver and this is a
multi-bit driver so it's got flat head
on one side Philip on the other and then
two different sizes for each as well as
a six millimeter an eight millimeter nut
driver so this is usually all you need
to get the job done
because I'm a little bit lazier I like
to use a power screwdriver so we'll be
using one of these today zip ties and a
side side cutters and a magnetic Bowl
this is kind of optional tools it just
helps you stay organized will be zip
tying wires and stuff for cable
management the side cutters to cut the
zip ties and then of course we don't
lose any of our screws so we have this
magnetic tray to put all of our screws
in so now that we talked about the parts
and we've talked about the tools let's
go ahead and start building it and show
you just how to put it together so the
first thing you're going to do is
prepare your case now there's no one
method that's gonna work for every
single case that's out there so you're
gonna probably have to check the manual
for whichever case you chose so we're
gonna take off both the both side panels
on this because we're gonna need to
access obviously both sides of this case
and get these out of the way for
safekeeping because we have a tempered
glass side panel we're gonna put this
somewhere where I won't break it inside
pretty much every single case
manufacturer box is a box of accessories
which is gonna have all your screws any
mounting plates that you need for hard
drives or whatever else in this case be
quiet puts everything in this box
drive sleds additional drive sled screws
zip ties everything need is here so
locate yours instead of the side we'll
use that in a minute but now that we've
got our case pretty much ready we're
gonna go ahead and move on to the
motherboard so before we install the
motherboard into our case there's two
things I want to do before that we're
gonna install our CPU into the socket
because it's easiest to access right now
while it is out of the case and we're
also going to install our MDOT two nvme
SSD onto the motherboard because it's
obviously easy to access now I'm gonna
install it in the bottom portion right
here because we're gonna have a graphics
card in this top slot so if we ever have
to access this instead of taking our
graphics card out we'll be able to
access it right here
much easier obviously if you're using
three nvm e's then you would put one in
all three spots to install the CPU push
down the retention arm move it out of
the way but keep your finger on it
because it is under spring tension so
you don't want it to
back on you remove the socket cover and
then you'll notice on the CPU you
actually have two indentations on there
and those are going to correlate with
two indentations that are on the socket
so it can only be installed one way an
easy way to remember with Intel CPUs is
the lettering is always going to go
right side up
so smoothly drop it in there give it a
little wiggle to make sure it's seated
all the way push down the retention
cover push it underneath the retention
screw and then you'll push the arm down
under a lot of tension that's gonna feel
awkward there's a lot of tension there
move it back under the little lip move
the cover out of the way inter CPU is
now installed now the nvme installation
is pretty simple
most of the motherboards are the same
you're gonna remove the cover screw this
will fold back out of the way the MSIM
dot two slots have thermal pads on there
so that you can get better thermal
transfer of heat from your SSD because a
colder Drive performs better so peel
that cover off and out of the way remove
this retention screw for your SSD keep
it in a safe place the SSD installation
is very simple it can only go one way
you'll notice this notch and it's going
to correlate with a notch that's on the
motherboard put it in at a slight angle
push it down against the thermal pad and
then reinstall your screw to hold the
drive down so remove the cover from the
top piece and then reinstall it in the
reverse order that you took it off and
now you have one installed nvme SSD now
before we install the motherboard you
need to prepare your case now the be
quiet silent base 8:01 already has the
standoffs installed for us for a
standard ATX layout but your motherboard
may vary if you're using a different
sized motherboard or your case may not
have those standoffs pre-installed so
reference your manual now because ours
are ready to be installed we're gonna go
ahead and put our motherboard in the
chassis
now this motherboard already has an i/o
shield cover built into the back of it
so we don't have to install one in the
case if yours has a separate piece of
metal you would install that first and
then drop your motherboard in now this
case has a center stand off that doesn't
have a screw thread in there but it has
a nipple which is going to hold our
motherboard in place so be careful when
you line up the motherboard you don't
want to have to use any sort of force to
get it in there
and you don't want the standoff to be
grounding anything on the back of the
motherboard so once everything is lined
up and that all the screw holes line up
with your standoffs then you can put in
your screws and tighten them down finger
tight so I'm going to be relocating the
140 millimeter fans on the front of this
case to the top because there are no top
fans in this particular case but I'm
going to be putting the three hundred
sixty millimeter radiator on the front
so I'm just going to take these fans off
and mount them over here the nice thing
about the be quiet case is it has this
sled that slides out so if you're
installing an a IO or fans or whatever
it may be you don't have to try and
fight with it you can just slide this
out mount everything to it and then
slide it back in so depending on the
cooler that you have it's gonna be a
different process for mounting air
coolers are different than a iOS AOS are
obviously very different than like
custom water cooling loops but the
process is typically the same on when I
do my installations I like to mount the
fans to the radiator first and then
mount the radiator where it's gonna go
so in this case I'm gonna have the fan
set as a pool which means it's pulling
air through the radiator into the
chassis and I'm gonna mount that to the
chassis first and then the cooler to the
CPU now to be able to do it right for
your application you obviously need to
consult the manual with whatever cooler
that you're going with now if you're
going with at a i/o you need to kind of
check for some clearances here so we
tried to install this normally so that
the writing on the NZXT is horizontal
the problem is the tubes we're
interfering with our RAM right here
which is kind of unfortunate but it's
okay because we have plenty of slack in
our tube so we can just rotate the
cooler in a 90 degree orientation
because the bracket is perfectly square
so we can just rotate this so that's out
of the way and then we are good to go so
now that we have our CPU installed our
motherboard installed in our chassis and
our cooler in there and we've made sure
we have no obstructions we can go ahead
and install our memory so now you can
see why I went with this black and
orange kind of an aesthetic because it
matches perfectly with our silent base
801 now before you install the memory
you want to make sure the tabs are
flipped up and that you orient yourself
with this notch in the module that
correlates with the notch in the socket
so because we have four modules it's
pretty simple for us we can just put one
module in every single slot but if
you're not running full modules in all
of your slots you want to look at your
manual to make sure that you're
installing them
in the proper order because you have a
single channel and dual channel config
or if you're running even an x-series
motherboard then you can actually have
quad channel as well
so consult with your manuals to see
which slots you need to use for your
particular memory configuration so the
next thing I'm going to do here is
install our storage our one terabyte SSD
and our iron will 10 terabyte drive now
the be quiet case has this removable
cage that you can install the drives in
because we might add more storage to
this later I'm not going to install both
in this cage I'm gonna let the SSD get
installed in its portion on the back of
the cage or the back of the case right
here rather so that we can easily access
that because then we have room here for
two of these drives if we decide to
expand it later now installing it is
gonna be dependent on your case so again
look at your case mounting options to
determine what the appropriate process
is but the sine of base 801 actually has
these rubber grommets on here to keep
our mechanical drive nice and quiet
because mechanical drives tend to make
clicking sounds and having these rubber
grommets are gonna isolate that so that
we don't hear it and the nice thing
about SSDs is because they're so small
you can fit quite a few of them into
cases now case manufacturers have picked
up on this and it started coming up with
pretty unique options to allow you to
mount more SSDs and because of their
small thin form factor you can fit them
just about anywhere so like I said this
one mounts on the back of the
motherboard tray which gives us nice
easy access to it if we decide that we
want to remove it replace it upgrade it
or whatever down the line so as you can
see our SSD is now installed so the nice
thing about the NZXT q 2 controller is
that it uses the exact same mounting
mechanism or hole spacing as an SSD so
anywhere that you have an SSD mount you
can actually mount the control box but
it's also magnetic so if you have a
steel case you could just install this
on the back your motherboard tray if you
didn't have anywhere
that you could screw this down and it
would stay but because we have the
mounting option we're gonna go ahead and
mount this on our bracket that goes
right behind the CPU so next we're gonna
do our power supply and get our cable
management ready to go I like to install
the graphics card last so if you're
waiting to get to that part that's kind
of like the icing on the cake we're
gonna get our Gref
we're gonna get our power supply and our
cables all run through here and the be
quiet case here has this bracket that
comes off the back you mount this to
your power supply directly and then you
can put in your power supply now there's
gonna be a lot of debate and whether or
not your fan should be facing down or
your fan can face up it's pretty much
gonna be preference at this point but
these cases do have perforation and
airflow vents on the bottom so it can
pull in fresh air from the bottom but if
you're setting on thick carpet a really
tall carpet that could sort of choke off
this particular vent right here so it's
really gonna be based on your situation
if it's on a desk or a hard surface or
thin carpet then you'd be fine pointing
it straight down in fact that's the way
most people prefer to install it so this
power supply is fully modular and I have
these custom cables to use with this
power supply now the cables that come
with it or black which look nice but I
like the weight individually sleeve
cables look this is a black paracord and
these are available for the Corsair
power supplies so what I'm gonna do now
is I'm just gonna plug in all of the
cords I know we're going to use we're
gonna need our power cable for our PCI
Express which is our graphics card our
24 pin for our motherboard our a pin EPS
for our CPU and in fact we have two
eight pin EPS on this motherboard so I'm
gonna plug in both of those and then I'm
gonna plug in my peripheral on here as
well so that way I can plug in power for
our hue to any lighting modules we might
add our fan controller as well as our
storage now this is where you can start
doing some of your cable management you
can run the cables that you know we're
gonna be going together and zip-tie them
now before we put it into the chassis so
these are both my 8 pin CPU power plugs
and I know these are gonna take the
exact same route so I'm gonna go ahead
and zip tie these two cables together so
I'm not fighting with trying to pull
them out of the stack later because as
you can see there's quite a few wires
that are going into this build and it
just makes it easier for me to keep
track of I'm gonna do the same thing for
the PCI Express as well as the SATA
alright so next we're gonna take care of
the front side connectors now in this
case we do have USB 2.0 and 3.0 header
for the front we will not be using the
USB 2.0 though because we only have two
USB 2.0 headers on this motherboard and
we need to use those for NZXT q2 as well
as our
cooller so we are going to go ahead and
route these and try to make them as neat
as possible now we also have on here our
front reset power and our LEDs and these
are gonna connect to the bottom of our
motherboard and pretty much every single
scenario there on the bottom of the
motherboard so just route these wherever
it makes sense in your case in our case
we're gonna route them kind of right
along here like this
this is also our HD audio which is front
panel audio jack connector so headphone
and microphone I personally never use
these so I'm just gonna kind of roll
that up and push it out of the way now
usually in the bottom right hand corner
of your motherboard this way you'll find
your front panel connector header now
the pin outs on these are pretty much
standard nowadays where the top two on
the right are gonna be your power switch
the top two on the left are gonna be
your power LED with the positive
terminal on the far left the two below
that are going to be your hard drive LED
and then two to the right of that are
gonna be your reset switch with the
farthest right pin on the bottom being
unused now verify that with your
motherboard manual some motherboards
decide to be a little bit different but
things have been pretty standardized
over the last few years now for the
frontside USB 3.0 it's a little bit
unique in this case so these little
covers right here or where additional
hard drive sleds can go like this one
down here although we're not going to be
using any of those they do have these
covers that pop off the nice thing is we
can actually adjust the depth of the
cover if we want it to not be flat
against the other side so we can run
cables to there so yeah I just made this
gap so we're gonna be doing that here
for the USB 3.0 and the SATA cables and
here for our 24-pin power going to our
motherboard so I'm gonna go ahead and
route this guy through just like this
flip the case around and plug it in and
then I'll pop that cover back on so that
we have a nice clean look so next up is
everyone's favorite part of building
computer whether you're experienced or
not and that is cable management and I'm
not gonna take a lot of time right now
to tell you how to cable manage I did a
whole video about that that you guys can
go and check out right up here we'll put
a link in the description below it's all
about what I think about when I'm wired
managing a computer what I'm gonna tell
you right now though as a new big as a
new builder if you haven't done this so
a couple of things to look out for one
you
want to make sure that nothing is
protruding past the side panel of the
case because that's only gonna mean you
can't put your case back on so you need
things to be run as flat as possible
some case just like this one actually
the side panel comes out slightly to
give you more depth not all cases are
like this you want to check with yours
the other thing is specifically
regarding SATA power that's these thin
little guys right here this the thin
flat ones not the fat molex like these
guys right here but this guy this is
what's gonna be powering like your hard
drives your SSD we have even some
external ones over here for like
powering where to go where are you
somewhere anyway we've got additional
ones that are gonna power like our fan
controller here the plastic that's used
on these hard drives the SSDs and hard
drives is very brittle and when you plug
this in as you can see it sticks out a
little bit so you want to make sure that
you're not pushing down or up on that
make sure that does not happen because
if it does you will snap the plastic off
that quicker then I don't know insert
your own analogy here a lot of power
supplies actually have a 90 degree plug
for SATA rather than a straight like
this which means it doesn't stick out
nearly as far now if yours is like this
you can bend the wires quite a bit like
that kind of make your own 90 that way
they're sort of stuck out of the way
like that so they're not getting you
know sticking out too far and getting
hit on things definitely be careful of
that as you can see that sticks out
really far and that will snap off the
plastic same goes for your SATA plug
this guy right here as you can see I'm
using a ninety degree on here so that we
don't accidentally snap that off as you
can see it goes just like that so let's
go ahead and wire manage this then we'll
plug in our graphics card and we'll get
things to start firing up so now that
all the wiring is in here there's alot
crammed behind this case but this is
this isn't the business end it's okay if
this is a little bit messy but you need
to make sure nothing's binding or
getting caught up or is going to get
pinched on your side panel so I'm gonna
go ahead and hook this guy on make sure
that we're good to go
and there we go so everything is on if
we flip it around you can see all the
time we spent managing our cables made
everything look way cleaner on this side
now before we install our MSI r-tx 20
atti trio we need to prepare the back of
the case right here so we have to remove
some of the expansion slot covers that
way we can actually get access to our
DisplayPort and HDMI ports so it's
pretty simple this uses 2 if it's got 2
of these little screw holes and it's got
2 of these little brackets on here you
only have to remove 2 from the back of
the case and the easiest way to know
which 2 is just go straight across from
the slot that you're gonna put it in and
then go take the 1 even with it and the
one below it off so in this case because
we're using the top slot we can just
take off the top 2 expansion slot covers
on the PCIe slot just push the retention
tab down yours might look a little
different it might have a little squeeze
tab on the side just make sure it's open
and ready to accept the graphics card
lineup these two tabs right here with
the slot so I always start there line
those 2 in and once those are lined up
then you can push the card into the
socket until it clicks that little tab
is now closed and our graphics card is
pretty much installed we've got to put
our screws in here now and then in plug
in our power
it's done our custom 90 100k build that
we built all on our own and
theoretically if you guys followed along
you built a computer to 99 hundred k
sitting on top of our MSI m EG z 390
god-like motherboard and our msi RT x 28
e TI gaming trio but obviously we have
to test it we've got to get an operating
system installed we got to make sure it
turns on all of our drives and stuff are
there and to do that msi has hooked us
up with a plethora of stuff to get the
job done so this panel right here is a
27-inch 144 hertz 1080p gaming panel
that is the optics MP g27 see our
keyboard right here is the GK 80 it's
the vigor GK 80 keyboard which has a
detachable wrist rest that's made out of
metal
super super heavy-duty as you could hear
that's not going anywhere we've got an
immersed gh 60 gaming headset and AGM 80
plus mouse so here we go we need to see
now if this thing is going to boot and
otherwise we'll have to do it all over
again
and this little cable we got sitting
right here this is actually for our hue
our hue lighting is attached to our
glass panel so we plug that in when we
put the panel on and then everything
should go from there but we've just got
a monitor just boot it up you can see
we've got some RGB going on the bottom
right there all this lighting amongst
all of these devices actually controlled
via MSI's mystic light so you can
actually control our mystic RGB so you
can control all of that via their
control panel there is our BIOS and
let's see if we've got our let's see if
we actually got our hard drives and
stuff going on so hardware monitor
actually just go over here to our board
explorer and that'll tell us what we've
got so here is our MT right there our
Patriot hellfire 480 gig you can see
we've got our frontside USB 3.0 going
and if we look at SATA ports it shows
we've got our kingston right there which
is our SSD now one terabyte and we've
got on port 6 our 10 terabyte iron wolf
drive and of course of 900k showing up
and all of our RAM sticks are showing up
so that's a really nice feature of the
msi motherboards as the BIOS will show
you a board Explorer which gives you the
information of everything that is
plugged in
to it okay so we have to install an
operating system on this now and we're
gonna obviously be installing Windows 10
and using Adobe premier for all our
editing purposes and installing an
operating system is a lot easier than
you may think
Windows 10 now installs from a flash
drive plug it into the motherboard the
motherboard are automatically detected
it's a boot device and take you through
the installation process so guys once
again a huge thank you to MSI for
sponsoring today's build guide and
providing us these parts to bring you
our coverage of how to build a ninety
nine hundred K system you can learn more
about what MSI has to offer by clicking
the link in the description below and as
always guys we'll see you in the next
but this is guilt this guilt abide
walking here alright so these are the
parts we're gonna use here on this
