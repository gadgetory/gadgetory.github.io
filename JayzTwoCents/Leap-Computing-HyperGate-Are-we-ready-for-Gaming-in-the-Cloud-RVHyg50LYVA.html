service coming up that you guys actually
had an opportunity to preorder for of a
service that I had been excited about
for the last six months and I've been
wanting to tell everybody about it but
because of NDA's I couldn't but finally
the time has come where I get to do this
review now there's very few things that
ever make me really excited anymore and
this is one of them the new EVGA silent
series power supplies offer excellent
silence and efficiency through their new
EVGA Eco mode technology and also
features a seven year warranty for
worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more no it's no surprise that I'm
a bit of a snob when it comes to
hardware and liking high-end stuff but
the reality is most people including
myself cannot afford everything you see
here I'm just in a very fortunate
position to be able to review the
coolest stuff on the planet now this
review is absolutely no exception now
this video has been six months in the
making because last year I sat down with
a company called leap computing and they
asked me how I felt about doing like
cloud-based gaming stuff and I thought
well you know there's a lot of hurdles
there and you if you can overcome those
you might be onto something they were
excited about it I was excited about it
and last week on Tech Talk which is a
podcast Barnack liaison I do every
single Thursday we just kind of hang out
like hanging out at the bar just talking
about whatever we want I got to kind of
let the cat out of the bag if you will
that I'm gonna be the first reviewer
taking a look at this cloud-based gaming
service here from leap computing called
hypergate I'm not gonna lie I was a
little bit skeptical when they first
asked me about this because I thought
man there's a lot of variables that are
just out of your control I mean how are
you gonna deal with ISP lag how you
gonna deal with latency how are you
gonna deal with you know different data
center distribution how are you gonna
deal with global clients well leap
computing is definitely the folks that
can pull this off because they are
absolutely based on cloud based
computing on not just gaming but all
sorts of stuff involving the cloud so
who better than to do cloud based gaming
than somebody who is a huge part of the
cloud now there are some pre-order
information
to put in this video but it's gonna be
at the end so you guys are gonna want to
watch for that I already talked about it
on Tech Talk but today we're gonna
actually do the live demo and now here's
what's cool about today's demo is you're
gonna see a pretty impressive
performance
well demonstration it's what's what demo
means and let's talk about demolition in
which case if this service sucks will
demo it demolition it I have no idea
where I'm going with this now let's go
ahead and talk about the base Hardware
real quick now right now if you
pre-order you can actually get the
service for half off for life so any of
the tiers of service you can actually
get half off for the life of your
account as long as you don't cancel it
for more than three months but you get a
dedicated 5820k that's a hex core 12
thread CPU you get 16 gigabytes of RAM a
ddr4 Ram and you get 128 gigabytes of
storage as well as your choice of either
a top tier AMD Radeon graphics card or
in NVIDIA Titan X now that's yours now
for limited time if you do pre-order you
can get the service for $29.99 a month
now basically this is going to be your
hardware it's like your machine but it's
hosted in a data center that is already
astronomically cheap when it comes to
data center hosting at that price it go
look up how much dedicated servers like
that would cost and then try and tell me
that even $59.99 isn't an outrageous
steal but on top of that you can add
more storage 500 gigabytes or one
terabyte or 32 gigabytes of RAM or I
mean it's just this is where they're
starting the service and they're gonna
be doing more and more hardware in the
future with lower tiers of hardware if
you decide you know you don't need all
of that but really for the price I don't
know why you wouldn't want it now I
don't want to sit here in front of the
camera doing all sorts of disc jockey
yakety-yak about it I want to go ahead
and turn around and get into the machine
and let's do a demonstration now the
machine that we're using is a media box
this is a box that's been assembled to
allow us to demo the service and it
actually has lesser specs than what's
going to be in the client do retail
version this is only an i7 4790k which
is a 4 core 8 thread not a 6 core 12
thread has 16 gigabytes but it's DD
three not ddr4 and we do have a AMD
Radeon Tahiti base GPU this would be
like a 79 70 version or this might even
be believe a I didn't open up the box I
don't wanna be too intrusive but I
believe this might even be one of their
fire pros in there but it's a Tahiti
based graphics card so it's gonna be
absolutely amazing when it comes to
rendering and I mean basically
everything you're gonna see is on a box
that's lesser specs than what you're
actually going to get at launch
so enough chatting let's just go ahead
and turn around get into the demo and
let's see how the gaming on this
actually performs well it feels like
forever in a year since I've been in
this format actually we should be doing
some more stuff like this so here's the
website leap computing dot-com and when
you come here and you click sign up
here's basically the information about
it it's half off right now for all sign
ups whether you use my code or not it's
half off but you get an option of 5820k
hex core a GTX Titan X or an AMD radeon
GPU with eight gigabytes of vram 16
gigabytes of ddr4 on both 128 gigabyte
hard drive as well as windows 8.1 pro I
hit pre-order it was even a couple of
different options that you can utilize
here you can do love AMD level 1 2 3 or
4 and basically the differences here is
the amount of hard drive space and the
system ram so level 2 is 500 gigs I
highly recommend level 2 it's only five
dollars more for pre-order because 128
gigabytes is gonna fill up incredibly
fast level 3 gets you 1 terabyte and
then level 4 get you 1 terabyte and 32
gigabytes of ddr4 so that's pretty much
the service right there and when you
install the service you get this little
it's like it's their own client and it's
gonna give you complete access to the
server so we're gonna go ahead and login
and I'm not gonna show you my my login
info we don't want to I don't wanna do
that alright so once you log in here it
says server at the bottom if you have
more than one server then you would see
those there but right now I'm connected
to leap computing because that's my
server and when this text turns green
you can hit connect
and once you do that it will bring up a
window BAM so here is our desktop now as
you can see it's in a window we have
full control over it as if we were at
the machine now it's gonna seem a lot
like an RT PT but it's not it's it's a
completely proprietary piece of software
that is written specifically from leap
computing for this service so don't
confuse it for an RDP but you have full
control over it and that's what Barna
cleaves and I were talking about on Tech
Talk that makes this thing so amazing is
things like on live didn't give you full
control over the system like this this
is the same as if you took a computer
put it into a data center and then you
have full control over it now you're not
gonna be able to do things like install
torrents or any sort of miners or
anything like that or counter-strike
servers because this is not for setting
up servers and hosting so it's gonna
have its own software built in that's
gonna kill those services and keep them
from being able to run because of the
fact that that's not what this is you're
not buying a server to host things
you're buying a server to play games on
that is the point of this service now
this is what a 1080p window looks like
in a 1440p panel technically we're
looking at a 1440p so you can see the
amount of difference right you know here
it's a massive amount of difference in
pixels so I'm gonna go ahead and push
this guy over here into one of my side
panels alright so now we're in the leap
computing app that's built into this
server and as you can see we're in the
setup tab and if we had multiple
encoders built in here like for instance
AMD's our only option because that's all
we have is a single AMD card on here
quality there's three different settings
here you have high quality balanced and
low latency now here's the thing the
server's gonna be running 1080p that's
the native resolution for the server and
if you want lower latency which is less
time between the signal reaching you or
being encoded and sent to you then
you're gonna want to go with AMD because
AMD cards are actually superior to
NVIDIA when it comes to their period of
coding power now if you want higher FPS
at the sacrifice of a little bit of
network latency then you're going to
want to go ahead and go with an Nvidia
graphics card now you can also see we
have three quality presets here we have
high quality
balanced and low-latency well here we go
inside of grid Autosport so we got it on
balance mode and let's go ahead and take
a look here at all right so our settings
are gonna be set to high I set them to
high and then MSAA and all that's on
Forex so we're gonna be doing well I
guess the same type of settings I would
be running this game at probably locally
or I mean I guess realistically I'd
probably be doing it more like maxed out
setting so let's do that
graphics here preset high will do preset
ultra there we go right one other thing
I want to mention though is you may have
noticed is that the sound it's off by
about a half second now they've assured
me that that is not going to be the case
when the system launches or the service
launches it has to do specifically with
this one machine that we're using for
the demo and that the drivers for the
built-in audio on the motherboard or
having a problem with the rendering so
it's always one half second behind so
that's not going to be the case with you
know the actual service so what does
have to live with it as is that's if you
guys can even hear it I'm trying to keep
the volume kind of down on it because
there's a lot of music in here that I'm
not licensed to you so I don't exactly
want to get my video flagged alright so
let's go ahead and do as you can see
we're getting 60fps here at the window
the FPS for fraps as you're seeing is
the amount of frames I'm getting from
the service so that's how much is being
encoded and sent to me so that's how
many FPS I'm actually getting out of the
the cloud-based gaming stuff alright
here we go
so I guess the question here is gonna be
can I do this without it feeling like
I'm being gimped by latency I have a
feeling the only thing I'm gonna be get
by really as my own driving ability
yes me whoa
yeah I don't like driving with the
keyboard much that's not a lot of fun
so because we're on balance mode there
is a little bit of blockiness but that's
because I want to make sure I get at
least that 60 FPS but the blockiness
really isn't that bad be honest there's
a little bit of encoder blockiness there
now if I was to put this up to high
quality we would of course be
sacrificing some some fps so you're
gonna have to determine what it is
that's high there I broke your window
sorry I have insurance we can deal with
it later we'll swap information at the
end of the race but you know I feel like
the controls are very responsive I don't
feel like I'm dealing with any terrible
latency here in terms of
controlling the car I just can't control
the car because I suck never played grid
before this so I'm completely green at
this or team red in this case cuz it's
named debug all right so that's grid
let's go ahead and let's try a shooter I
don't really want to mention what
shooter it is but we're gonna do a
shooter all right so as much as I hate
to admit it we're gonna do some Call of
Duty advanced warfare ok
aftermath Detroit Michigan exit type
specialist right shield overdrive
instead this is some sort of like a oh
that's right they're copying crisis I
remember now
that's right Scott um I don't know why
everybody's blew everybody's blew um
Joker oh there's always someone named
Joker in the military
Gideon okay 60 Hertz monitor a 248 okay
yeah see it as a fire pro that's in here
like I said it's a fire pro W 8000 so
this is it Tahiti it's a it's old stuff
well there we go we got our color tones
back apparently going into bordered
windowless a windowed borderless works
so now we're no longer playing The
Smurfs edition now like I said FPS
shooters are going to be clearly the
most noticeable when it comes to being
any sort of latency so we're gonna find
out real quickly if this is uh this
lives up to the expectations that is
well this is a big looking dude
these guys aren't friendly at all
I guess we'll come back when something
actually happens so because so far
advanced warfare is nothing more than
cutscenes simulator frames four seconds
looking pretty good we're in a tease now
that's one of the things you guys
complained about most when I showed
other streaming services even in-home
streaming was that you guys were like
30fps no way to screw 30fps well clearly
we're getting way above that well that's
nice they're all sleeping together
this guy got spaghetti on his back
Missy eater nothing Bad's gonna happen
here huh oh no I didn't see that coming
didn't see that coming
oh we're still falling through the
ground the sound being off a little bit
weird kind of funny oh well we're just
giving him his shots guys that's all
yeah I have no problems aiming whatever
at all with this this is this is pretty
lag free give that dog
oh wow
anybody that guy was right there shy
foot look at the FPS yep PS is actually
doing really good whoa hello
ow I just never did this game than them
yep so the bottom line here is I have
absolutely no there's like no lag with
this well except for the sound but like
I said that's that's a bug that's gonna
be repaired
all right well there you go now is Call
of Duty FPS shooter very very doable
actually with high FPS I mean eighties
can't complain about that can you but I
think one of the coolest things
obviously about this whole thing is the
fact that you get a full desktop control
with it so like I said you could do a
lot of things with this anything you
could do with your own PC with the
exception of you know torrenting and you
know doing servers like I said all right
so let's go ahead and turn around let's
just kind of talk about the service and
how I feel about it
when it's available and whether or not I
think this is something that the future
is ready for or whether or not this is
ready for the future whatever well guys
there you go when I did some of the
stuff earlier in the year like the dokgo
you guys were like no a 30 FPS is
terrible but as you can see here the
guys over at leap computing have
definitely found to weight a way to
bring you very low latency very high FPS
up to 144 FPS actually a cloud-based
gaming now this has a lot of uses that I
think would be absolutely beneficial to
anybody who's looking for a way to bring
their stuff with them when they go
places for instance when I was working
full time I was traveling quite often
for my business and I did not have a
gaming laptop I still don't have a
gaming laptop but I did have a basic
professional grade laptop that I was
able to carry with me everywhere I went
and I could have done all of the gaming
that you just saw me doing even on a
low-end laptop because again all this
thing is doing is sending a video signal
that your computer has to decode no
different than if you were doing
something like watching YouTube or
whatever but the cool thing about this
service is the fact that you have
control over the quality of it as well
as the latency of it so you can choose
if you want quality latency or balanced
so everything we saw today was actually
unbalanced low latency would have given
us even lower lag but I wasn't really
getting any lag and high quality would
have limited the FPS a bit more down to
the 30s or 40s which is what a lot of
people wouldn't have wanted now a high
quality with the tight necks option it
would have been higher FPS but there
would have been a little bit more
latency involved unfortunately I didn't
have
tight next version of the server
available just the one with the AMD
FirePro in it so I think this has a lot
of uses I think people who want to be
able to do their encoding or their
editing and stuff mobile as well because
as you saw with the full desktop
functionality you could install your
Adobe cloud or work Adobe software on
the server and then upload your stuff
via FTP you're gonna have a full control
panel available to you so you could
upload your stuff to the server and have
your videos online that you could edit
on the go and pick up with wherever you
left off from one machine to another
it's not like in my case where I've got
all my editing stuff on one machine and
I've got to transfer it via my land to
other machines it's all transferred via
the cloud now another use for this is if
you couldn't afford a full-on gaming
machine but you could afford say $30 a
month and you already have a basic
computer or like a Walmart box or
something then you'd be able to have
high-end hardware including like a Titan
a hex core 16 gigs of DDR 4 for 30 bucks
a month and it would take three years to
recoup the cost alone of a Titan exit
$30 a month let alone the rest of the
system and not only that they are gonna
be doing upgrades as hardware's upgraded
as well included in the price so if you
had let's say a tight next today and
then next year the next line of Titan
cards launch the next generation it's
you know Titan XYZ I don't know then
you'll get an automatic upgrade so
you're always on that top tier hardware
and getting the level of hardware of
what you've paid for at no extra cost
they just take out the old hardware and
update it over time and you get free
updates for no charge whatsoever it may
really makes you wonder how the hell
they're gonna make any money hit this
but it's a pretty awesome worthwhile
endeavor at least to give it a shot its
month-to-month it's not even a contract
so one last thing - is they are offering
a free gift for people who sign up using
my promo code which is j2c the letter J
not J why J to see and they're gonna
give you a free gift I have no idea what
it is to be honest with you they're also
gonna read they're also gonna flag your
account with a two cents discount I know
right J's two cents but that actually
Flags you for future
things that are gonna be available only
to people who pre-ordered using the j2c
promo code again I don't get any
kickback I don't get any portion of
those proceeds no money this is just
something I think it's freaking amazing
I love it I'm gonna use the hell out of
it and this is just 100% me speaking
like a computer geek because I think
this is freaking cool so there you go
guys if you have any questions hit up
Leap computing comm check it out
the pre-order that half off is only good
during the pre-order once they go live
it's no longer half off it's 60 bucks
instead of 30 bucks so you definitely
don't want to wait and they're only
gonna charge you the one month to do the
pre-order and then they won't charge you
again until 30 days after the service
goes live so you're not gonna be paying
up until the service goes live just one
time set up and then until it goes live
nothing else so there you go guys what
do you think of this cloud-based gaming
stuff I can think of a lot of ways I
would use this both good and gooder
alright guys as always I had a lot of
fun making this video for you guys and
of course thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
