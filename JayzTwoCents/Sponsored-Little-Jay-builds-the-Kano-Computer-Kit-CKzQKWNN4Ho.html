we're going to be taking a look today at
their custom computer kit that is
designed from the ground up
to make kids excited about technology
now they advertise that this is designed
for kids 6 and up to build the computer
learn how to set it up how to program on
it and actually program their own little
scripts and games and and just anything
you can think of and it's designed to
make kids her age ready for this world
of technology and I thought that this
was a perfect opportunity for those
viewers who have kids or maybe our kids
at heart themselves to check this thing
out I've waited a couple months to do
this we finally doing it and I can't
wait now I'm going to kind of guide the
video through here but really this is
about the kids and what it's like for
the kids to use this kit so that's why
we've got Little J here she's going to
be doing most of the work here and I'm
just gonna kind of make sure that you
know we keep on track because we kit you
know kids they get a little distracted
if you see something shiny are you're
gonna run away sometimes I get
distracted on my homework if I see my
mom doing something go on I'm like what
are you doing it and then I completely
forget about what I'm doing and I get
off track of it now just taking a kind
of quick tour around the box it's kano
orange it says computer kid on here and
on the back it kind of talks about what
is we're going to look at today I mean
it's got a music app in there games
hack snake minecraft pong other games
that they can program hack and play with
you can learn how to code you can even
has video output you can hook this up to
anything with an HDMI and HD software or
HD input and and you can use this on TVs
monitors whatever else I I can't wait so
go ahead and let's go and unbox this
thing and see what is inside remember
this is a complete kit everything you
need in one box there we go
now when you open the box the first
thing you see on the inside here is
everything is guided I mean you've got
different manuals here's step one step
two step three and it's its intended to
take you from beginning to end to get to
where you want to be with this kit
nice little pamphlet here talking more
about the product nice little foam cover
there and look at that
mmm-hmm now real quickly what comes in
the box here it comes with a wireless
keyboard and trackpad so this is how
you're going to control everything it's
got a big yellow HDMI cable here so
everything's nice and big and color
bright color coordinated makes a lot
easier for kids we have got a US micro
USB plug right here flat cable a red one
also forgot to mention the HDMI is a
flat cable and then of course we have
got the computer components that all
have to be put together here's the
speaker it's pretty much based off of
Raspberry Pi so it's going to make it
very very simple here's the power
adapter here's the power brick so this
thing does run off microUSB power and
then here is everything else right here
now I'm not going to mess with this
because I want you to put all this
together
now obviously step one is to build the
thing so why don't we go ahead and do
that what do you say you want to build
it can you do it you think that doesn't
sound very confident can you do it yes
let's try that again
can you build this yes thank you
putting the KO together is really easy
it's 11 easy pieces to put together with
the design concept of being as simple to
use as Legos all kids know how to use
Legos you've got like what thousands of
them my cousin has like 5000 her cousin
has 5000 labels well now you've got 11
more here that is basically a Raspberry
Pi - very easy to put together all of
the instructions are right here and very
nicely Illustrated manual that kids have
no problems using they say that this is
recommended for ages 6 and up they think
the sweet slots right around ages 9 or
10 but she had no problems at age 6 the
moment you plug it into power it boots
up and it starts guiding you through a
little coding sequence to put in your
name and then you've got to follow this
white rabbit that gets lost in the
memory of the Raspberry Pi and then you
have to put in some code to keep a bomb
from going off it's actually really
really cool but everything inside the
desktop is guided there's also another
manual here step 2 that's designed to
kind of guide you through the best way
to start using the coding functions and
learning the kind of the most efficient
route and where to start and the you
know progression of learning code inside
of the Kano software here one of our
favorite things to play is minecraft and
what's cool about this is minecraft is
included on here but it also has a hack
function where you can hack the game and
start playing with the code and setting
up the world as you see fit by using
code and it's pretty neat because it's
all a visual representation of code
where you drag puzzle pieces and
complete the blocks because you know
just like code you have to have a gift
of your statement you have to complete
it and it has to make sense it has to be
correct well the building puzzle pieces
on this for the code show you a visual
representation of how code works which
is exactly why it's tailored towards
kids because it's something kids
understand puzzle pieces and doing some
very simple problem-solving so it's not
even something that only kids can enjoy
adults can enjoy this as well and it
makes it if you've never seen a piece of
code whatsoever it'll start to make
sense because rather than just being a
bunch of
text in a notepad it's all puzzle pieces
that start to make sense on how the flow
of code works so they use Python and
JavaScript on a lot of their coding
methodology in here which is a very
common language and you can get you
started doing a lot of really cool
things you can even play music on here
by using computer code which is really
really neat that it's really endless and
if you go to Kano World and set up an
account there's even more that you can
do and you can download this thing is
fully wirelessly connected to the
internet it also has an rj45 adapter on
it so that you can plug it into a wired
internet if you want and a simple HDMI
output so that you can hook it up to any
TV or monitor it's very very simple
obviously the footprint is small and you
can set this thing up anywhere now don't
just take my word for it in fact this
has been featured on Forbes Wired the
Guardian Wall Street Journal BBC Fast
Company recode CS NBC quartz USA Today
CNN CNN Money fortune tnw Time BuzzFeed
and more tech outlets have actually
featured this computer kit from ken o so
it's something definitely worth taking a
look at which is why when they
approached me about sending me one for
Little J to try out really what I think
about it doesn't matter it really
matters how the kids feel and as you can
see she's having no problems whatsoever
just apparently encasing herself in a
room made of what is that diamond blocks
we think I don't know it's a blue block
I guess that's maybe a diamond block
blue block with yellow in the middle if
you know what the blue block with yellow
in the middle is and minecraft put it
down in the comments anyway if you want
to check this out for yourself or your
child or do it together this has
actually been a fun experience to do
together here then head over to us Ken
ome there's a link in the description
and you can check out the different
options they have there are multiple
kits different levels of kit that you
can get for this and it's definitely
worth checking out anyway thanks for
watching today's video a huge thank you
again to Ken o for sponsoring today's
video little J absolutely love this
thing to death and it's probably going
to end up utilizing another monitor of
mine full time for her to be able to
hook this up and play with but I'm okay
with that because this is only going to
make her smarter while having fun at the
same time the coding makes you think
you're playing a game but really you are
learning how to
program and that is definitely the
future in the world that we're looking
at today so anyway thanks for watching
let me know in the comments how you guys
felt about this don't forget to check
out the link head over to Cano get yours
today and I you really can't go wrong
with this anyway see you guys in the
next video and maybe we'll do another
one in the future and see how her
progression is going on this anyway
thanks for watching guys see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
