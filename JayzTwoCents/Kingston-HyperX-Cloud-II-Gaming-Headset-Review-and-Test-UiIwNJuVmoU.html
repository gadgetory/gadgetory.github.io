here J is two cents but I might point
that out Jays Jays not jay-z two cents I
mean I don't I don't rap not very good
anyway so recently we took a look at the
mod Mike 4.0 and kind of showed you guys
how to make your own gaming headset
utilizing your favorite headphones and
slap it in mod mic 4.0 on there and a
lot of people in that video said no
thanks I would actually prefer an actual
gaming headset so today we're going to
take a look at what is probably regarded
as one of the most favorited headsets on
the market the HyperX cloud but what's
cool about this is this is the cloud -
it's the predecessor to the famous
HyperX cloud and they have put some
pretty cool features into this thing and
I'm pretty excited about this I'm
starting to turn into a headphone whore
I'm gonna be catching up to Jerry at
this rate gigabytes flex display
technology automatically detects and
connects up to four displays with the
best gaming experience in multi display
Ultra HD click the link in the
description to find out more alright so
here's the headphones right here but
before we start talking about them let's
go ahead and talk about the packaging I
rarely talk about packaging but that's
because manufacturers rarely give you a
packaging experience that's worth
mentioning but the HyperX takes that to
a whole new level in fact they even have
like tissue paper in there that's that's
pretty interesting so you got your
paperwork and stuff on top your
instructions on how to use it
you guys are know how to use it though
they are so yeah now the packaging has a
lot of soft foam in there I mean you've
got this covering it tons and tons of
soft foam we all know who loves soft
balm you get an extra set of ear pads
these are fabric pads and then all your
cabling is down here obviously I already
got them here I've been using them and
then you have got a detachable
microphone right there included with it
is also one of those old-school airplane
plugs you know you guys know how the
airplanes kind of separated the sound
from left and right so you have to use
their headphones you know almost like a
DRM of audio on the airplane well they
include that in case you wanted to use
that but what makes the HyperX cloud
twos
so awesome is the fact that not only
does it feature a metal frame you know
some have very you know plastic key arms
on here when it comes to the adjustable
arms and the swiveling ear cups
these are billet aluminum they are tough
they are not going to get damaged also
aluminum right here on the ear can
itself but you also have a nice stitched
leather and black and red stitched a
headband up here on the top nice soft
foam for comfort for long gaming
sessions and then I have installed right
now the pleather ettor pleather
leatherette whatever headphone or ear
cup pads I personally don't like fabric
fabric kind of makes me get itchy and so
I don't really enjoy that so I am using
the leather ones on there and that's
going to talk about the headphones
themselves they do not have a detachable
cable at all from the earphone itself
which I guess is not a bad thing but the
microphone is detachable as you can see
it just plugs in like that now why would
you want to detach your mic well a lot
of people are on the go they're in
school or in university whatever and
they kind of want to have one set of
headphones that's versatile can do
everything they need it can play your
music or you can do do VoIP or chat in
your games and it's going to go with you
wherever you go and you have one set
that can do everything well that's what
the HyperX cloud twos is all about
you've got your dongle I love that word
dongle has so many meanings depending on
the context of what you use it anyway
you've got your dongle here which does
have a clip and it's a nice long cable
there so you could clip this even to
your waste if you were say jogging or
biking or whatever I guess you wouldn't
really be jogging or biking considering
this terminates into a USB 2.0 but let's
say you want to detach from your
computer without and use this headphones
doing something else whether it be with
your cell phone or smartphone or mp3
player well this actually plugs in to
the dongle and it has the three-way plug
on there so that you could use it with a
smartphone and also utilize the mic if
you wanted to but you've to take off the
mic then it just becomes a stereo
headphones that plugs into your mp3
player smart device or what
rubee while this is still plugged into
your computer the entire time
I love the modular aspect to this
headset now one of the things I like
about the inline control system here is
it does have a slider mute on the side
but it also has not only volume up and
down for the headphones but it also has
volume up and down for the mic how many
times have you guys been in teamspeak or
in a game or something and you you say
hey guys what's up but everyone goes oh
my god wow so loud geez you're loud it
happens to me all the time I know it
happens to Barnack Li's but you could
now turn down your microphone or turn it
up right here without having to go into
control panel and change any of your
level settings on here you also have a
7.1 surround button which turns this
into a simulit 7.1 which is actually not
that bad I tried it out in battlefield
and the moment you press it the
environment seems to go from very close
to very expand it now of course it's
only as good as the software controlling
it and the nice thing about this is all
plug and play you don't have to install
any sort of HyperX
software to make it all work it all
works on board and I found myself using
7.1 quite frequently and I'm not a fan
of 7.1 in fact you guys probably
gathered that from my Sonos video but I
don't like 7.1 simulate however I found
this to actually be usable so you may
like it but if you don't want the 7.1
you can just turn it off and then you're
pure ly in stereo mode but I did find it
to be somewhat accurate when it comes to
simulating locations of noise and sound
when it comes to games which definitely
comes in handy and things like twitch or
you know twitch shooters FPS shooters
things like that so I guess what's left
to do at this point is to go ahead and
plug this thing into the computer and
then we do a mic test and we say how
this thing sounds transition
now that I plug the headphones into
audacity I've gone ahead and take a
listen to this microphone before giving
you guys my impression spec I've heard
the microphone a few times already in
fact when I was up at PDX land these
were the heads this was the headset and
mic that I use the entire weekend now
one of the things I noticed with the mod
mic 4.0 was the fact that the esses and
the s sounds that it made tended to make
me sound very lispy now truth be told I
do have a little bit of a lisp ma when
it comes to the way I say SS and it just
seemed to sort of enhance that a little
bit more so I I found it super silly and
flappy and stuff when it came to my
essence so some people actually pointed
that out and yeah it does take a natural
Lisp but that I have and enhances it
even more so it sounded kind of silly
but I think you guys can hear right now
with this microphone that although not
bad it's not great either it does sound
a little bit modulated a bit compressed
which is kind of normal for I guess
gaming headsets with as much technology
as crammed into this headset it makes
sense so that something would have to
suffer a little bit in the microphone
tends to usually be that thing that is
going to suffer I also notice that the
audio levels seem a little bit low and
even if I turn the microphone up as high
as I can the audio levels came up a
little bit which is kind of good I guess
they returned down slightly but what
you'll notice is when you go into the
control panel you're actually locked out
if any sort of levels control you you
can't change anything in there it's all
done through software through the driver
for the headphones in fact at all again
it's all plug-and-play there's no
software to install or any of that stuff
but I think all in all for what it is
and considering how versatile it is it
sounds pretty damn good the audio is
good the bass is pretty clear the mids
and highs are very sharp and then when
you go into 7.1 surround mode it sounds
great in gaming but music sounds
terrible as you would expect music to
sound in 7.1 but once the cool thing is
once you plug this into say an mp3
device and you get stereo anyway there's
no 7.1 but if you listening to music on
your machine I would highly recommend
turning off the 7.1 simulate and going
purely with the stereo which is going to
sound a whole lot better now overall I
would say that the sound is pretty warm
some headphones have a very tinny or
very harsh sound to them like for
instance the rock at headphones that I
had although they had a lot of features
to them they sounded very tinny and
almost had a lot of reverberation inside
the ear cans and I'm not getting that
whatsoever with these they're extremely
comfortable I cannot even describe how
comfortable they are you guys know if
you watch PDX coverage I wore these
things for three days straight and I
don't think I've ever worn any
headphones or headsets here in this
office for three days straight I have a
lot I'm always switching them out
because I get a lot of ear fatigue and
you know head fatigue when it comes to
wearing headphones and headsets that are
not comfortable for me so I tend to be a
little bit of a horror when it comes to
that aspect I shall hoard a lot of
things but it's definitely that now one
last test I'm going to do before we wrap
up this video is a typing test I took a
lot of took a lot of crap from people
saying I didn't do a typing test I guess
for streamers that actually matters so I
am going to be using my razor chroma RGB
mechanical keyboard here this is their
mechanical green switch I've got notepad
open and we're going to go ahead and
we're going to type and we're going to
see just how this thing sounds if you
were say you know a streamer and you're
typing on this thing so let's say and I
won't talk during it because that was
the other thing I took flak for sure you
stopped talking during the typing test
alright here we go
I guess you guys will never know what I
typed since I couldn't talk but it looks
like audacity picked up some of it but
it's very very low so I imagine that the
rear facing noise cancelling mic on this
probably did a pretty decent job of
cancelling out that sound you're going
to hear it but even though it's a clicky
key I don't think it's going to sound
entirely too bad once again Kingston has
definitely hit a homerun when it comes
to a rounded gaming headset that doesn't
destroy the bank and gives you a lot of
features I personally especially for an
on-the-go person love the modular aspect
of the headphones where I can pretty
much and I'm going to switch back over
to my built-in mic here where I can
pretty much say okay I'm here playing a
game I've got to go to school gotta get
on the bus to ride your bike or whatever
it may be this is how quickly you turn
these from a gaming headset into audio
headphones you now have audio headphones
that you can
with you and this is still plugged into
your computer when you get back plug
that back in and then you can plug the
mic back in now you have a gaming
headset so that is freaking awesome so
there we go guys that wraps up my review
here of the Kingston HyperX cloud twos I
think there is pretty fantastic
headphones the versatility of them is
really what sells me on it more so than
the mic quality and stuff because most
people my quality VoIP and game it
already sounds compressed and terrible
anyway so the compression on this is
really not all that bad
so anyway time to get on out of here
guys make sure you follow on that
Facebook that YouTube or that will
YouTube would be great but Facebook
Twitter and Instagram you guys get a lot
of behind the scenes there check out
pricing for these things down on in
Amazon if you guys end up using the
Amazon affiliate code it doesn't cost
you anything it helps out the channel
helps me get more product in here to do
reviews for you guys I just highly
recommend not using Amazon's overnight
service especially for prime because
I've pretty much figured it out after
the last three Amazon shipments that I
paid overnight for came late Amazon is
operating on a fortnight that seems to
make a whole lot more sense but anyway
I'm gonna get out of here and as always
thanks for watching
