when it comes to your computer we have
to have it everything plugged into it
graphics cards CPU memory power fans
everything plugged into it yet what's it
then we kind of forget about it but you
don't want to scrimp out on your
motherboard because literally it
controls everything
so I spelled motherboard you listen to
your mum what you do you know what's in
my mom you get it whoops so what I'm
going to be talking about today are some
of my favorite features here on Emma
size newsie 270 gaming m7 we got a kind
of a sneak peek of this at CES now I've
finally got a chance to put it in the
system here and we're going to be
talking about build quality we're going
to talking about some of the utility
features that are included with it and
what you can control on here and we're
going to be talking about overclocking
of course you're integrating it through
the set overclocking I mean to me that's
like the most important requirement of
any motherboard but interestingly enough
it says VR ready
on the box it's kind of funny I mean
technically all motherboards are v
already it is very refreshing to see a
gunmetal and black motherboard and not
have some sort of Gotti's just weird
color scheme shoved down your throat
this one is very refreshing ly simple it
is gray and it is black more of a
gunmetal and black and we've got some
shiny parts on there because of the
steel armor which keep the dim sockets
and PCI slots from making your
motherboard Bend if you're pushing stuff
on there there's a few things in this
world but it is cringe worthy as
listening to the creaking and cracking
of a motherboard as you're plugging in
your graphics card and your memory
sticks that is that is literally some of
the most terrible sounds to listen to
but not this guy because of the steel
armor now the chipset has a very flat
nan in your face heatsink on there which
is LED lit we'll talk about that in a
second and of course the VRMs have a
very beefy heatsink on there because
this motherboard has a lot of
overclocking in mind there's a lot of
granular features on here that even
people like me would never use because
I'm not going for world records but you
can control a lot of things on this
motherboard that even I don't understand
but that's okay because there are some
very user-friendly features on here as
well as where'll like the game boost
which is actually a dial that's got
eight different levels of overclocking
on there and they've kind of gone
through and determine what the most
reliable settings would be for a
particular frequency range whether
particular and you just simply dial in
the overclock that you want and it does
the rest I'm usually not the kind of guy
that would be excited about automated
overclocking like this but I'm telling
you right now it's very difficult for me
to pull out a better overclock than
these are able to achieve by spending
lots and lots of time tweaking on it
when this is they've already done all
the work I mean they really are taking
some of the fun out of it but it's also
fun to be up and running at the max
overclock you can get by simply turning
a dial a game booth style on this
motherboard actually has eight different
levels of predetermined overclock
settings based on all of their testing
that they've done back during
manufacturing now if you've got a 7600 K
a 7700 K a 6600 K or a 6700 K you're in
luck because this dial will control an
automated overclock your cpu based on
predetermined settings now those are
going to be determined based on the CPU
that's in there too so what level eight
might be on one CPU is not the same on
another so you need to look at the
manual or the command center app which
we'll look at a little bit later which
will tell you what those settings would
be but I think they're taking a page of
Microsoft's book with their numbering
sequence though because even though it's
eight levels it's not one to eight it's
actually one two four six eight ten
eleven
I still to understand that one now all
the usual stuff of course it supports
7gn Intel six gen Intel if you have four
dimm slots on there it can do nvidia sli
in two ways or AMD crossfire in three
way that's why you've got three 16x PCIe
slots on there and then all the rest is
you know pretty typical now MDOT to
support it's got three turbo m2 sockets
and one of them actually has a heatsink
with heat pads on there to give you max
thermal dissipation of your M to drive
all right that's enough it's the same
system that we've done in the past this
is like its third form it's taken on
down to 7700 K the MSI gaming x GT X
1080 is in there and we've got the same
g.skill 16 gigabytes of ddr4 tried in
the new one here now because I want to
take as much cooling as I could in here
is the fractal design Kelvin s 36 yeah
the same one we use in the holiday ad
can't forget that one
what time is it guys I got a fractal
design Calvin SAT six oh no it was like
way too early for this so it's a triple
one twenty by thirty millimeter radiator
and I want to make sure has much cooling
as possible it is quick and easy for
doing some of the overclocking testing
on this so roll that epic b-roll and
then let's take a look at the you
you
so this is how you control the lighting
it's built into the MSI gaming app it
can control any of your MSI products
that have LEDs on there so my game UX
graphics card is also showing up right
here because of that
so there's red yellow green TL blue
violet and white you can't choose any
variants or any color of the spectrum
you have to choose these hard-coded
colors as you can see there's yellow
green white and yes that's kind of
unfortunate I was kind of hoping I could
have chosen on a wheel or something the
exact color I wanted that doesn't happen
the effects are kind of lackluster also
there's a breathing effect very basic as
a flashing effect why anybody would use
this I have no idea it's terrible
there's double flashing which is double
terrible so I'm just going to stick with
a static color but as you can see though
we have some green LEDs that are flashy
or bright and in our face up there which
really stinks you probably noticed it
during the b-roll those are to tell you
that there are fans plugged into the fan
headers okay that's cool it tells me
they're working I guess and that they're
on but what sucks is they're green if
they're DC fans and it's a red LED if
they are PWM fans why I need to know
that they're PWM or DC based on a color
LED is something I have never needed or
wanted in the past and any computer I've
ever built in the decades I've been
doing it so why why they're giving me
that I don't know it's cool that they're
giving me this but I don't need it I
don't want it and it's ruining my color
scheme here and what's even more
disappointing is that if I turn off the
LEDs you can see it turns off the
graphics card it turns off the
motherboard and it turns off those
stupid green LEDs so that tells me they
could have added a button in here to
allow me to turn those off individually
but again I can't it's either all or
none but one thing I'm happy to see here
is it does recognize my g.skill ripjaws
Mouse which is right here so I can also
control the colors of my mouse as well
but look at that it gives me a spectrum
wheel so it's kind of neat that MSI is
supporting a peripheral
that I've got plugged in that gives me
more color feature than MSI gives me on
their own product it's kind of silly
this that you're looking at now is the
MSI command center I'm actually very
impressed with this and let me tell you
why it gives us full overclocking
control it gives us full voltage control
control over our RAM control over our
timings control over our fans everything
is controllable on here it's actually
not bad either usually these utilities
are terrible so here's that game boost I
was telling you about before right where
you can choose the different levels
right there's 0 1 2 4 6 8 10 and 11 so
weird so much like I said it's like
Microsoft's numbering sequence there but
you can see right here because I have a
7700 case installed these are telling me
the different ranges I have right here
so it'll go up to 4.5 on 0 four point
six seven eight nine five five point one
and five point two so each level is just
adding another 100 megahertz and it's
going to choose whatever these settings
are that it needs to be to give you a
good chance that those will actually
boot that way it doesn't mean it's going
to work doesn't mean your CPU can handle
it but it's going to try you also get
full control over here your RAM
frequency your RAM voltage your IDP
frequency your Gd voltage everything is
here it's so cool if you click advanced
check this out we can go dance
DRAM and then it brings up all of our
timings we can control our timings yes
you can do everything from right inside
to OS now typically an old-school
overclocker like myself would never do
OS based overclocking but I've got to
tell you man this is actually pretty
good I'm not going to lie so right now
we're running 4.8 gigahertz I can select
all on the cores I can do per core
overclocking if I want I can even
increase the beat clock rate watches
I'll put the beat clock to 101 I'll hit
apply and watch this right here will go
from 48 o9 to 48 48 just like that now
it's running 48 48 so I can do my
testing in the inside the operating
system so if my test passes I can
increase it and then test it again
without having to reboot every single
time that is really nice and last but
not least you have voltage control here
so we can do live changing of our V core
voltage for overclocking
and it's just it's just good I kind of
hate that I'm saying this but it's good
the software is really good now believe
me when I say that no one is more
shocked than me when I say that I like a
built-in utility for overclocking inside
the OS I'm still always going to have a
soft spot for overclocking inside the
BIOS but it's just it works and it saves
time and it makes people like you that
might be afraid to try it give it a shot
and it's actually safe it's easy to
revert it will revert itself if it
doesn't work and you can go into the
BIOS and do it later on if you want to
kind of play around learn what some of
those settings are if you want to now
the board is not perfect like I said
those green LEDs are bugging the crap
out of me it really is B it's got two
USB 3.0 front panel headers which is
amazing because a lot of cases now are
shipping with multiple USB 3.0 headers
on the front which means that you're
going to need more than one 3.0 header
on the motherboard to plug them in well
this one here is really strange it's got
a 90 degree bit one right next to the 24
pin which points at a really weird
direction why it's not pointing up I
have no idea and then the other ones on
the bottom yeah way away from where the
other one is and these are big thick
cables which are difficult to route and
now you've got to split them two
different directions just put them next
to each other like everyone else's
that's a I know a motherboard
manufacturer might say well that it's
not so easy to just say put it here but
other manufacturers are doing it and
when you're not it then becomes easy to
say just do it as a consumer I think
it's a big deal anyway guys I spent a
while sort of taking a look at the
motherboard let me know if there's any
other ones you'd like me to take a look
at I will definitely look at those in
the future like I said motherboards
don't get the respect and credit that
they deserve alright time to go I spent
an awful lot of time making this video
but I also had a ton of fun making this
so let me know what you guys want me to
do starting to step up my game and I'll
do the best I can to make you content
that's fun and enjoyable to watch as
always thanks for watching subscribe if
you're new here like the video if you
enjoyed it and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
