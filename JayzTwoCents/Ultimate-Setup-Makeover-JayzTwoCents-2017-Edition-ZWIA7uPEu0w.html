I've been working on building myself a
new set up ever since moving into this
studio and unfortunately my workspace is
usually like the most neglected space
but I finally got what I think is pretty
close to my final setup here for 2017
and then we'll do it all over again
probably 2018 whatever now I know I'm
not the first tech youtuber to use a
dining room table as a desk but I don't
think it's unnatural for us to want more
than the desk has to offer especially as
Tech and PC enthusiasts as when most of
us are I wanted something more and
honestly that's because the desk just
didn't go big enough to fit the two
ultra wide 34 inch panels I'm using but
we'll talk about those in a second what
you're looking at right here it's
actually the malcolm extension table
from living spaces it's 95 inches by 45
inches that is huge it's got a dark oak
finish which I thought had a really nice
rustic look with the rest of my studio
loft here which I think you'd have to
admit especially with the way the table
looks underneath and it's got these kind
of like brackets under there which just
really fit the aesthetics of this very
rustic
loft that we're using as a studio so I
when I saw this I basically was like
that's it that's the one that's the one
we're going to go with now when you're
dealing with a 95 inch by 45 inch table
it can get kind of big so what I did was
I put a card reader underneath the table
on the right that's within reach of the
sitting position and that's how I
transfer all of my data from the cameras
to the computer when I'm doing my
editing it's also a USB 3.0 hub which
allows me to be able to connect things
to the computer without having to reach
behind it because again 45 inches deep
and then 95 inches wide it's a it's not
easy to reach back there on the left
side because I also had my laptop so I
do testing with and use on my day-to-day
basis I have a power strip mounted
underneath the desk on the left side
which allows me to easily plug in things
like cell phone chargers laptop chargers
and whatever else we just might need
which allows me not have to drape cords
all over the floor and it just keeps
things nice and tidy also bright behind
the keyboard I drilled a pass-through
hole yeah it was painful guys to drill
through this oak but it had to be done
so that way I could pass my cables
through the table and not have them
draped again across which really takes
away from the look I'm not a fan of
wireless peripherals still to this day
so that's why I use my wire
set up and so the pass-through was
necessary now speaking the peripherals
I'm running a k95 from Corsair which is
of course an RGB keyboard it's the
Platinum keyboard and I'm using my
Reaper mouse old CM storm Reaper mouse
which is technically Coolermaster they
don't make them anymore it's my favorite
Mouse when we devastated when it breaks
because I can't get another one but
speaking of capable management
underneath the desk
we actually stole from one of the
beckett desks that we have in the studio
here the net that comes with the desks
allows you to be able to keep all the
cables tidy and managed so we just use
the shallow wood screws and screwed
those to the bottom of the table sort
allowed me to just kind of throw all the
cables and stuff that would normally
just be hanging behind the desk and this
net end looks tidy because on the other
side of the desk it's just a wood grate
and then you can see down to the first
floor of our studio so whatever is on
the back side of that table which would
normally just be obscured by a wall it's
actually visible from the other side of
the studio so we wanted to look nice and
I think it turned out pretty well and
then we're just using velcro straps on
cables to keep things as tidy as
possible now let's talk about the panels
because that's one of the reasons why I
went with such a big table 95 inches by
45 inches I know I mentioned that again
that is a huge huge table I've got two
aces PG 3 4 8 Q's which is 100 Hertz IPS
34 over 40 by 1440 ultra wide a 21 by
nine aspect ratio and that amount of
real estate is absolutely priceless
to me when it comes to doing my video
editing so having that much space to be
able to put folders and things that I'm
using and have a huge timeline in
preview windows and effects windows and
transitions and all that stuff just it's
nice to have to go digging around
through different panels or tabs to try
and find them it's all just right there
at my fingertips and absolutely love
these for gaming as well the hundred
Hertz refresh rate and gsync make them
extremely smooth so yeah
they these panels right here have been
literally an amazing experience for both
editing and gaming now I didn't want
them sitting on the table so what I did
was I went over to Amazon and you can
find links to everything I'm talking
about in this video by the way in the
description of this video but I went
over to Amazon and I just found whatever
hydraulic arms I could find that had a
high enough weight capacity to be able
to hold these monitors when they're out
stretched
the farther those those hydraulic arms
go the more leverage the panel has to
pull those arms down so I had to get one
that had like 25 pounds of lift capacity
and it gets the job done it's pretty
neat because you can articulate the
panel in any position you want so if you
want portrait mode or landscape mode
they're pretty easy to just rotate
around they stay wherever you put them
takes a little bit of adjusting to get
it just right but they weren't very
expensive and I was able to get two of
them but I just mounted straight to the
desk themselves and it keeps the
monitors up gives me a place to put
things underneath the monitors if I want
push the keyboard out of the way if I
need to and it just it just looks better
it's almost like the panels are floating
which I thought are really cool speaking
of underneath the monitors I had a bit
of an internal conflict of what to do
for sound I ended up going with a sound
bar and what the right thing to do would
have been put reference studio monitors
under there but I didn't want to raise
the panels up any higher because if I
did then I'd be looking more upward of
the panels and right above my desk is
this massive both blessing and curse
skylights in this studio and it can get
very bright especially here in Southern
California we don't have many cloudy
days so I didn't want to force myself to
be looking at this skylight I've not
actually been able to block out the
light yet or put up shutters because of
it's very strange that's a whole nother
topic for another day but I didn't want
to praise the monitors any higher so I
went ahead took a chance we're going
with a pretty inexpensive sound bar it
was only 150 bucks I'm actually going to
be buying more of these it's the Samsung
hwk 450 it's a 2.1 stereo sound it's got
a subwoofer which actually does a really
good job of giving you full and punchy
bass it really fills out the sound and
when we heard this in the invest buy we
kind of Nick and I both kind of listened
to it we went wow this actually sounds
really good then we got it here in the
space and we were just going this is
really amazing not to mention we like to
listen to music when we're doing things
like b-roll and whatnot so you can just
Bluetooth connect your phone to it you
got music in you're up and running
things I couldn't really do with the
studio reference monitors and not to
mention I didn't have an amp to run
those and then you buy ones that have
internal AM so it just gets really
expensive and I just didn't have the
budget for that so we're happy with the
choice that we made now for my editing
rig this is actually a system you guys
have already seen when I did the Cougar
panzer video it's an X
960 900 k overclock to 4.5 gigahertz 32
gigs of g.skill 32 hundred megahertz try
to zr gb ram it's got to EVGA for the
win 3 GTX 1080p is which gives you both
amazing gaming and transcoding
performance and then in terms of cooling
I just got to crack an ex 62 on there
instead of a big custom water-cooled
loop because of the fact that when this
is my work editing rig I need it to be
easy to work on if something needs to be
swapped and big rigid tubing systems
like skunkworks are nice but they're
labor-intensive when it comes to
maintenance and swapping out parts now
we will be doing a very high-end custom
rig for the studio I just haven't
finalized exactly how I want to do that
yet right a weird time with hardware I'm
sure you guys know but skunkworks is
safe and sound at home it's my gaming
rig ax man playing on that a lot lately
and yeah don't worry we'll come up with
some more really custom stuff for the
studio I promise just give me a little
time now something else that's sitting
here on my desk that probably won't be
here much longer is my alesis multi mix
mixer and preamp for my microphone now I
don't actually do any podcasting anymore
really that often and when we do we have
a more professional setup that we're
actually going to be working on so I
won't be doing it here at my desk using
a webcam so this will probably get
relocated to whatever set that is and I
will be on my desk before I just left to
here for a couple of reasons one it
looks nice on the desk this is kind of a
neat little touch and two just to show
that even this cheap mixer I got for 60
bucks
years ago is still running strong so
yeah you don't have to spend a ton of
money to get amazing stuff now for chair
you guys have been asking a lot about
this this is the autonomous ergo chair
we've actually been testing a couple
years out here in the studio ever since
we moved in so it's been a few months
now and it's a pretty good chair now the
price is about 300 bucks it's fully
adjustable you can adjust the butt
cushion either inward or outward it's
got lumbar support neck support it's
fully adjustable there are some things
though that we're not perfectly happy
with on this chair for instance the
headrest will kind of fall down on its
own sometimes rather than staying where
you set it in terms of height I don't
like the fact that the armrests don't
lock into position when it comes to
either forward backwards or Internet in
and out motion pipe is obviously
lockable but I wish that the arms
just kind of move around now obviously
being a tech youtuber means we have to
have some IKEA representation no
self-respecting tech youtuber is without
supporting IKEA in some way we've got my
IKEA lamp here I don't even know the
name of it I just thought it looked cool
and it matched the rustic look of the
desk and gray as kind of our accent
color that we've been using around here
so I thought this lamp was perfect it's
an LED and is dimmable so it's kind of
nice that we can dim the lights although
we don't really work here at night
very often the days are long during
summer right now but that'll be nice on
the days that are they get dark early I
don't know and then of course you can't
be a tech youtuber without having the
planting you know a fake IKEA plant
thing goes John De Morrison that said
you can't be a tech youtuber without one
so there it is so anyway that's my setup
here for 2017 guys a lot of the
inspiration comes from suggestions from
the audience other tech youtubers or
other youtubers in general because I'm
not good at this whole design thing but
I think this turned out all right so you
guys can tell me what you think down in
the comments below or once you head on
over to social media you can find me on
Instagram Twitter Facebook and tell me
what you think about this setup what
would you change and if you've got a
setup that's worth taking a look at why
don't you guys send me a link to those
and yeah I find a lot of inspiration
from crowdsourcing you guys are so much
better at this than I am so with that
said guys I look forward to seeing your
setups I'm going to go and as always
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
