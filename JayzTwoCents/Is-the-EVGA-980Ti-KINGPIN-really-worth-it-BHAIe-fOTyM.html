I'm dropping crap holy shoot hey what's
going on everybody Jays two cents here
and you guys have been hash tagging the
absolute crap out of me with show me the
copper because of whoa Paul and Kyle you
guys suck and you guys have been
wondering where the is the 980ti
kingpin edition video well guys here it
is right here we're doing it now before
we move into the benchmarks and stuff
I'm gonna go ahead and address the
forehead goatee on my head yes I have
ducked my hairline because I plucked my
hair when I'm doing frustrating stuff I
don't realize it and then I've got to
let it grow back so for the next two
months I'm gonna look stupid so it's
open season go ahead and have fun that's
it I'm not touching it no more I'm not
I'm not talking about it I'm not
pointing out alright enough about that
let's go ahead and move into the
benchmarks but first it's time to pay
some bills if you've been thinking of
getting into the hobby of aerial
photography then I've got some good news
for you right now the folks over at mass
drop are dropping the DJI phantom
standard and this is your chance to get
in on a group buy at a great price check
out the link in the description for more
details and if you're watching this in
the future
and be sure to head on over to mass drop
and request they drop this one again
okay so I don't want to actually spend a
lot of time talking about the cards
looks and stuff I think we've seen it
enough it's all over their website you
guys have seen pictures on Instagram
that I've posted if you're not following
an Instagram you should because you
would have seen this already back plate
it's got a back plate but then again you
better put a freakin back plate on this
thing because of how much it costs but
it's got an all black metal cooler and a
massive amount of copper under here all
the fins are copper all the heat pipes
are copper the cooling plates are copper
they've really really thought ahead on
that now this card is really meant for
ln2 overclocking and at least water
cooling but we're gonna talk about air
cooling we're going to talk about I
forgot to take a sticker off this oops I
guess we'll do that right now huh
there we go now it's now it's used so at
the heart of this thing is a GM 200 core
with all 28 20 116 cuda cores unlocked
seven 7,000 megahertz gddr5 six
gigabytes of that and other than that
that's all that's really inherited from
the nvidia version of the card with the
980 TI kingpin this one's actually got
14 +3 power phase on here it's got
triple bios it's got physical v droop
switch on the back if you guys have ever
followed like high-end overclocking back
in the let's say the 580 series a 480
series guys we're having to do like the
pencil trace we actually drew traces on
the PCB with a pencil using the lead to
make various connections on the PCB so
that you could get things like v droop
enabled because all that stuff was sort
of disabled from the factory you
couldn't control the juubi droop was a
thing you had to deal with and if you
want to do high-end overclocking you had
to find your way around v group which is
where the voltage will actually drop
under load conditions and create
instability when you're shooting for a
certain voltage target and you can't hit
that because of the V RMS infrastructure
so Vince over at kingpin has designed a
mechanical V droop switch on here so
that if you want to try and push the
clocks as far as you can you have
control over that but there's all sorts
of knobs and dials and whistles and
stuff on this thing and on top of it
it's got RGB everybody's going towards
RGB and you can control that with
precision six precision x16 now five
point three point seven is recommended
with this card because five point three
point six had some bugs in it so all the
results you're going to see today and
regarding overclocking and testing we're
done using overclocking suite built into
precision X five point three point seven
now because this thing has such a
massive cooler on it it is freaking
heavy I know I talked about the msi card
being really heavy and this thing is
massively heavy compared to that now
power delivery on this thing is nothing
short of gargantuan it's got to eight
pin PCI Express plugs on here as well as
I required six pin there's been cards in
the past where you could use the two
eight pins or even the eight pin in the
six
and not use the other one unless you
needed it for exhilarating high-end
overclocking nope on this one here
you've got to have all three power
connectors plugged in which means if you
want to go with more than two-way SLI it
if you want to go 3-way or even 4 Way
SLI on this you're going to have to have
some custom power supply options ready
because there's not a lot of graphic
there's not a lot of power supplies on
the market that will actually give you 3
6 9 12 PCI Express power plugs for
four-way but then again I don't think
many people are going four-way on this
card in fact I'm not even sure you could
buy 4 of these at one time they're so
freakin scarce alright enough about that
let's go ahead and turn around let's
talk about the charts and then I want to
talk to you about my experience with
this card and we'll just get we'll just
get right on down to brass tacks
honestly there's a lot to talk about
here so if this videos a little long
sorry
no actually I'm not sorry at all watch
the whole video you might learn
something transition alright here we go
we're gonna go ahead and talk about some
charts but guys do me a favor yeah I
know the colors and stuff aren't
representative of the brand and I'm
working on making it so that Nvidia
cards are green on the chart and AMD
cards are red I'm not very Excel
proficient actually so if anyone can can
email me and tell me how to make it so
that like the gigabyte 980ti would
always be green no matter where it is on
the chart because we have notices if I
make the actual graph itself green right
here representing the g1 gaming if the
g1 gaming moves the bar up here stays
green with whatever is in its place so
yeah anyway okay enough about that let's
go ahead and talk about the cards we're
going to compare it to today now I
decided to go ahead and pick cards that
are in the same performance category
because we want to compare the 980ti
kingpin - you know what NVIDIA has
offering from the other brands MSI and
gigabyte I do not have an asus strix
do not ask me about the asus strix i
cannot answer your questions about the
asus tricks asus doesn't send me
graphics cards so I cannot include them
in my benchmarks moving forward we are
comparing it to the r9 Furey try X which
is the air-cooled fury card we are
comparing it to the fury X and then we
are comparing it to the Titan
and then other variants of the 980ti and
as you can see right here I have thrown
in the GTX 970 SSC SLI because it is the
exact same price of the cards here the
980ti range so here is the actual
pricing right here now you can see over
here on the Left I've got all the
graphics cards pricing but the chart is
only going to last you it's including
all of them so anyway as you can see the
980 or the 380 nitros 219 but they go
all the way up to 1,000 $49 for the
kingpin 80% ASIC quality card so you can
see we've got four kingpins represented
here seventy-two percent plus seventy
four percent plus seventy six percent
plus an 80 percent plus and the tight
necks right here at 999 matching the 76
plus ASIC quality from the kingpin now
what I find kind of curious here on the
pricing and I'm kind of I don't know why
they did this in fact I didn't ask them
and I should you've got a two percent
bump between the 72 percent and the 74
percent and a $50 price difference for
that 850 versus 899 technically that's
it's actually 849 I should probably fix
that
Oh fixed okay see that's how we do
alright but if you look here the 74
percent and 76 percent are again a two
percent jump but a $100 $100 percent do
remember to hurt you have a one hundred
dollar difference between that two
percent but then you have a four percent
jump between 76 percent and 80 percent
and again only a $50 jump so evj why the
100 dollar jump between 74 and 76
wouldn't these 76 or the 80 percent plus
be a rare herb in making this more than
a $50 jump so I don't understand this
100 dollar gap right there so I just
want to point that out on the pricing
but I am showing pricing is this based
on new eggs pricing right now and of
course as pricing as dynamic and it's
going to change and I'll try to keep
these charts up up to date as pricing
changes but as cards become unavailable
and they become phased out the pricing
becomes no longer relevant on older
series cards so it's always going to be
the current series which is why I don't
have you know the matrix platinum in
here oh look at that a power color r9
390x hybrid mmm maybe we'll be doing
something with that okay
core clocks overclocking
as you can see right here the gtx 980ti
gaming from gigabyte is for megahertz
faster on the max clock then I was able
to achieve with my kingpin we were
really trying for 1550 on the kingpin
and we could we couldn't do it in fact I
had EVGA helping out we just we couldn't
do it my card is a 70 he said he thinks
it's a 78% ASIC well ASIC quality GPU I
forgot to look at it at GPC men total
Foyle
yeah I'll annotate what the cards ASIC
quality is actually I put up a screen
cap I'll do that before I edit this
video huh okay anyway so you can see the
tank the g1 gaming in the kingpin are
gonna be pretty much neck and neck on
clock speed this this 4 megahertz isn't
going to make any difference
the 980ti is trailing behind at 15 for
15 14 max 980ti hybrid 1484 970 s at
1400 the reference card for 980 TI you
know to compare is at 40 know to
overclock and my Titan X is only at 1400
I want you guys to keep this in mind as
we go through the benchmarks because
this is 125 megahertz lower then the
kingpin that we're going to be comparing
it to obviously the Titan X has more
CUDA cores 256 more of them but we are
running a bit slower here so this is I
have four Titan X's in this office but
the three best ones obviously are in
skunkworks and then the one that's left
is you know that's the one we have here
which kind of craps is it craps its
pants at anything over 1,400 not a very
good overclocking Titan X all right
temperatures the Titan X reference was
the hottest at 86 and so is the
reference that makes sense user
reference coolers the kingpin
overclocked maxed out at 75 and as you
can see the fury X and the 980ti gaming
both at 75 actually all three these at
75 and then the gigabyte g1 gaming came
in coolest at 72 and then of course the
AMD fury X came in the coolest at 56
because water cooling fire strike here
is fire strike we've talked about this
before where this is not a very accurate
representation of really testing
real-world experience or a real-world
performance on a graphics card so again
I want to point out
that the 970 SSC sli of course scored
the highest
but I'm only showing this graph and I
only include firestrike because I I want
to really reiterate with the viewers
that fire strike and in heaven and
Valley benchmark are synthetic and
they're they just do not account for
enough API and other variables and
gaming API and DirectX optimization
where this is not going to be a true
representation you know some reviewers
would be like hey 970 SSE SLI is the
fastest fire strike benchmark score
therefore we can denounce and use other
big words and things that probably don't
fit in the sentence to say the 970 sse
sli is the best config done ship it that
doesn't work that way
so the 980 TI kingpin overclocked was
given us a graphic score remember guys
this is graphics score this does not
take CPU into account 21,000 117 who
corrupt that's the fastest single card
I've ever had come through here on fire
strike you can see here on the 14 of the
extreme numbers ten thousand seventy
eight and five thousand fifteen on the
the ultra there so when we sort it by
standard which is 1080p you can see
kingpin overclocked is king and the king
pin non overclocked is below everything
else but that's because admittedly these
the gigabyte in the MSI I don't have
benchmarks yet for stock speed I've got
to go back and do those so these are all
technically overclocked I forgot to I
forgot to put the little OC on there so
anyway if we sort this now by extreme
you can see it pretty much stays the
same we had a couple things swap spaces
right here the hybrid and the MSI and
the or the gaming 6g those swapped we
look at ultra kingpin OC is even beating
the 970 SS SSC SLI but that's because
we're running into kind of a VRAM thing
an issue here you know 3.5 gigabytes of
vram it really starts to fall off and
you know it's vessel is being beaten by
a single card here as well as the hybrid
which your three I found this to be kind
of interesting because the 980ti kingpin
overclocked as you can see right here
ninety-seven frames per second just
smashing the SLI configure of the 970
SSC so as you can see fire strike you
can just kind of take a dump because
obviously that's not representative of
real-world 97 frames per second
overclocked on the kingpin absolutely
insane I mean almost 100 FPS which is a
hard game to run and it did a fantastic
job at 1080p as it should
1440p same story 71 FPS to above the g1
gaming from gigabyte and beating out the
Titan X even with 256 less cuda cores
the rest is kind of self-explanatory and
the 484 K once again
the kingpin OC and the 970 are matched
at 4k so that's what I thought was kind
of curious about this where 4k 42 frames
per second on the kingpin overclocked
and the SSC SLI 970 s were matching it
but the SSC SLI could not actually keep
up at 1080p or 1440 which was kind of
weird because you would think the 4k is
putting a bigger stress on the vram on
here so I don't know what's witcher 3
has always been kind of a weird
benchmark so i like to include it
because i like weird things GTA v 1080p
no surprise here the SSC sli is winning
141 kingpin right behind 139 FPS and
then we just kind of go down from there
unfortunately i mean you can kind of see
here you know I haven't been mentioning
AMD much representative because really
AMD's theory is not representing I mean
these numbers are very contrasts of
which is kind of unfortunate especially
when the fury and the gigabyte 980 are
only $30 apart so mmm that's too bad
Metro last light oh wait we've got to
look at the other resolutions 1440p a
the SS 970 sli still wins kingpin
followed by the Titan X same exact fps
and then the MSI and the gigabyte
matching each other at 95 and then the
rest is is down from there but look at
this 105 on the arm side 98 on the
kingpin versus 95 at 1440 not a huge
difference and 4k same story the 9 70s
li wins and grand theft auto 5
hands-down 3 FPS faster than the Titan
but the Titan is faster than the kingpin
at the 4k settings for GTA 5 and then of
course gigabyte an MSI trailing couple
FPS behind I mean these these are so
close though you're not going to notice
a performance difference between these
two Metro last light 1080p kingpin just
blows everything away here at 156 FPS
1440p again the sli config wins but the
kingpins right behind it
102 and just pulls ahead of everybody
else by quite a bit
unfortunately AMD is still down here
come on guys catch up and then for K you
see 53 for SLI of 9 70s and 980ti
kingpin 49 matched the Titan X so you
can see but the I'm sorry I'm sniffling
have a little bit of a cold but anyway
the 980ti kingpin overclocked is
matching the Titan X overclocked but
member the Titan X is 125 megahertz
lower than the kingpin and it's matching
it and a lot of these tests so we'll
talk about that a minute Crysis 3 106
FPS for 970 SLI followed by the Titan X
at 102 followed by the gigabyte then the
MSI then the EVGA s so for whatever
reason that kingpin just in crisis
didn't really keep up with I'm grant
we're talking to what for FPS difference
between the Titan and the kingpin again
the Titan much lower overclock obviously
but yeah compared to when you overclock
it goes from 91 up to 98 so that's a 7
FPS increase it's a pretty big deal
1440p Titan X is the winner followed by
970 SLI followed by kingpin OC at 67 in
fact they're matched at 67 and then
everything else just kind of like fell
down which is kind of funny especially
since the gigabyte and the msi are
overclocked and they weren't matching
these numbers that's strange I can't I
need to go back in overclock B's and or
not overclock but put these back at base
clock and see what happens they'll be
even farther down the chart
AMD is still down here like way for us
guys Far Cry same story
ESL like in big wins tight necks
followed by kingpin way over 100
Esso unless you have 144 Hertz monitor
running 1080p obviously you shouldn't
even be looking at this card 1440p again
978 Titan X followed by the kingpin all
at 79 though just Bam Bam Bam I love
that a single GPU like this can actually
match the 970 sli that's a big deal to
me
when one card can match two cards of
especially two cards and are not
slouches a 970 is not a slouch 4k as you
can see here again SLI 9 70s Titan X
followed by kingpin but only 2 FPS
difference between the leader and where
the kingpin is and then followed by the
msi and the gigabyte and last but not
least battlefield 4 177 fps and 1080p so
even if you had a 14 or 144 Hertz
monitor you would have to enable g-sync
or vsync or or free sync or whatever you
have actually not freezing my bed
because they're down there under 144
anyway if you have 177 fps you still
have to enable vsync are you going to
get some tearing that's a big deal when
one card can make 144 Hertz monitor have
to enable vsync or vsync when we look at
1440p 128 frames per second the Titan
EXO's CUDA cores picking up the slack
970 SSE SLI 124 followed by the gigabyte
then the msi then the EVGA hybrid then
the reference then the kingpin I don't
understand why the kingpin just like
fell on its face down here this doesn't
make sense to me
but I did it several times and you know
battlefield 4 battlefield Far Cry yeah
there we go battlefield 4 is a hard it's
a hard game to actually benchmark
because there's so many variables in it
I mean that it is just impossible to
keep things static and inconsistent so
it could have just been what was
happening in the map at that moment I
don't know but you can see here we've
got quite the difference but then in 4k
it's kicking ass so for whatever reason
I think that 1440p test even though I do
it multiple times the average is just it
just had something to do with that match
but anyway there we go there's that you
know I think it's a big deal that the
970 sli cheaper than the kingpin is
beating it elvis lee in many many tests
even at higher resolutions showing that
the 970 with 3.5 gigabytes of vram you
know really accessible VRAM is a
contender it is something to consider
over over a high-end card like this
of course you're going to have less
profile issues you're gonna have less
overclocking issues less heat less
requirements of your system with a
single card so I'd still recommend it
but I just like seeing that a single
card can be an SLI config and the SLI
config at least in some tests but again
when we come back to the price here uh
is it really I mean considering the
kingpin is being beaten by the other
cards or at least matched by the other
cards or at least within 1% or 2% of the
other cards but at a price premium is it
worth it well let's go and talk about
that right now I've been just a little
bit conflicted on how I want to end this
video because it's it's a fine line
talking about facts versus subjective
opinions and I kind of try to do my best
to separate both now I know what EVGA is
doing here and I know it Vince kingpins
goal is with this card this is a card
basically where you want to go out and
have all the custom shit that Vince does
and he's going to put as much of that as
he possibly can on a card put his name
on it and be like the potential in this
card is the best you could possibly buy
and that's what they're going for with
this the part I have a problem with is
how many people are really going for
that now I guess that's something where
it's up to you to decide if that's what
you want in the card but if you're
looking to just buy a 980ti take it out
of the box and put it in a system this
is not really the most cost effective
way of getting good 980ti performance
because as you saw with the gigabyte
card being 210 dollars less than this
guy is because this is a eight hundred
and ninety nine dollar ASIC card this is
a 77% card nine hundred and ninety nine
dollars nine hundred dollar graphics
card and for $689 you can get the
gigabyte g1 gaming which is going to
give you what
within 2% of the performance I was
getting with this card is that 2 percent
worth 210 dollars to you I mean that's
the subjective part now if you're if
you're like okay I just want to buy a
card that I can rip the cooler off which
is unfortunate because that's kind of
the best part of this card is this sexy
sexy copper cooler then we'll keep it in
view we'll keep it nice and pretty over
there then that's definitely the card
for you it's got the 14 plus 3v RM power
phase delivery it's got Samsung manned
in there for the memory so I was able to
even overclock this memory over plus 400
in fact I did plus 500 and when I was
doing my overclocking and stuff and it
stayed stable for me but I backed it off
to plus 400 because I want to make sure
I wasn't gonna get any crashes the
problem is when you crash halfway
through your benchmark suite you got to
start off freaking over and it takes
forever so I backed it off to plus 400
most of the other cards are not using
Samsung memory which are lesser quality
so the components pick for this card are
top-notch top-shelf best componentry
that you can pretty much get to build a
GPU with so the part that disappoints me
is that the card was just not able to
live up to a standard of overclocking as
far as I'm concerned at least not out of
the box I can't speak for its Ellen to
potential this card could still be a dud
on ellentube for all I know because I
haven't tested that but if you're if
you're just an average buyer and you're
looking at the pricing going Wow the
price of this card and the ASIC quality
and all that sort of stuff you would
think this card is going to be fantastic
but as you saw it was four megahertz
behind the gigabyte g1 gaming not beat
the gigabyte in all the tests which is
kind of funny considering the fact that
they're the exact same core but the
supporting infrastructure on this card
is better for the GPU there was no
throttling 170 percent power target I
mean that's insane 170 percent you can
go 70 percent above the reference power
target or reference design of the GPU
and that's kind of insane in fact in all
of my testing even overclocked before
reaching like 89 to 95 percent power
target so that hundred and 70 didn't
even really make a difference at all
so that's clearly going to be for when
you really start bumping up that power
delivery but I can't do that
because that's not the type of testing
that I do now the question is are there
any 980ti s that can even reach that
1550 plus mark 1550 plus like 1600 is
just pretty much unheard of all the
cards I have seemed to sit right around
that 1520 mark below below a little bit
above my Titan X is over here all sit at
about 1500 and then the other one that I
have as you saw crapped out of 1400 so
the GM 200 seems to be very very picky
when it comes to overclocking so how
much does it matter when you build a
card like this with all supporting stuff
on it are you really going to get what
are you really going to get anything
above those numbers right now the data
that I have in here is saying that no
you're not going to but as you can see
performance is still going to vary now
just putting full disclosure out there
this is actually the second 980ti
kingpin that I had that's why this video
took so long the first one just would
not go above 1520 megahertz and no
matter what I did didn't matter if I use
the V group setting it didn't matter if
we were playing with the voltages it was
still like that other card was I think a
78% ASIC quality a little bit higher
than this one and it just didn't matter
we couldn't get above 1520 I thought
well wait a minute this is a kingpin
card this thing should just be like
busting through the ceiling when it
comes to the max achievable megahertz
but that this wasn't happening so I took
the card back over to EVGA live local to
them so that's fortunate
they got me another one all the way from
Taiwan and unfortunately this card as
you saw 15 25 was the highest I could
get out of it tons of crashing anything
above that tons of crashing didn't
matter if K boost was on it didn't
matter if I was manually overclocking or
doing over voltages or over over
boosting played with guys I spent so
many days screwing around with this to
where I finally I'm just okay 1525
that's where it is that's where I'm
going to go it's unfortunate thought the
card should go higher so I'm
disappointed that it that it didn't I'm
a little disappointed that - now I can
understand one but to kingpin cards
back-to-back not going any higher than
that to me was very very disappointing I
really expected more for the card
especially considering how much GM 204
loved to overclock like 1600 on the
classified it was like said it
move the slider boom done didn't touch
it stable this could be these cards were
picky as fuck it was really frustrating
guy like me who has tons of experience
with overclocking - just have to sit
there and say well I guess that's where
I have to leave it I at the end of the
day overclocking this card left me
frustrated and that's what bugged me
because I was used to the classified and
the other kingpin cards just being so
much better but it's starting to look
more and more like it's not the fault of
you know EVGA or gigabyte or msi I
started to look back the GM 200 is just
extremely picky about the power delivery
because I got this card stable at 1550 I
ran heaven loop for almost a half hour
over 20 minutes no crashes whatsoever
stop the test restarted the test got an
immediate grey screen with a hard lock
and never got 1552 work again so that's
the part that really left me frustrated
it's like why the hell did it stop
working well it's really looking like
the power delivery on it is what makes
things you know kind of insane now this
isn't the only high-end overclocking
card we're going to be looking at in
here we're going to be testing on the
cards in fact I do have missing as heavy
as hell an MSI lightning that we'll be
taking a look at so that's going to
either validate or invalidate the idea
of the kingpin card you know when it
comes to custom overclocking cards if
the core just can't handle it it doesn't
matter what you build it build around it
then you know the cores are going to
ultimately decide what it's willing to
do or not so there you go guys that is
my honest opinion a can't get any more
honest said I did in this video the
whole point of doing this is about being
honest and transparent I don't sugarcoat
things I don't hide things that was my
experience with it and you guys have to
decide whether or not paying an hundred
a minimum of a hundred and eighty
dollars more then another custom 980ti
is worth it to you to have well honestly
what is really the sexiest 980ti on the
market with a high ASIC quality buy
remember that doesn't mean anything when
it comes to overclocking it's just
hopefully you'll get a better
overclocking experience than I did but
is it worth it to you do you guys think
that the premium price on this card is
worth it based on what you saw here
today now please for the love of God
don't just take my word for this check
out other reviews I know there hasn't
been a lot of reviews on this card out
there and unfortunately right now I
might be the only review on youtube but
I really hope
a sends out some more samples of this
card and if it wasn't for the fact that
I already know the results of what this
card is I might have sent it to another
youtuber to be like hey give me your
opinion on this card but I already know
what the results are going to be because
I spent a lot of time on this I'd love
to see another sample with another
youtuber or another written outlet to
see what their experiences are and you
should do that too
don't take just my opinion for this I'm
one of voice I am one experience I'm one
opinion in all of this and I am not the
I'm not the final say on this card
whatsoever this is just my experience so
guys thanks for watching I know this
video is long if you guys want to follow
me on Twitter or Instagram usually that
stuff is just more goofy I don't I do
some tech stuff there but it's really
kind of just a goofy behind-the-scenes
of me being stupid and talking about
forehead goatees and stuff like that
then you guys can head on over to
Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or
whatever and that's it if you guys don't
want to follow me over there
then I will go ahead and see you in the
next one and it's time to get the hell
out of here cuz I'm tired</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
