gonna be the first person to pop in here
Wow
literally just popped it up right there
don't Channel
oh so Petrus was first Petra's vengas
been couse man cos he was first so why
am i live streaming today well one it's
Saturday and it's 1 p.m. here in
California which means a lot of people
actually get a chance to see the show
the show that's a loose term show I
think you know what I'm trying to say
the other reason is I did not have a
piece of content ready to go for Friday
I had planned on shooting kind of a side
piece when we were out doing man vs.
build but that took a lot of time and
all I got shot was an intro to a video
so that's not exactly the most exciting
piece of content so I figured what we
would do we would just pop in here and
hang out and talk like we used to do
where's the beard if you guys are
curious where the beard is I did a vlog
on the vlog channel early last week
technically earlier this week explaining
where the beard is going it's a it's a
weight loss thing I a couple years ago
when I was really big into the cycling
and weight loss I shaved my beard
because it the beard hat hides face fat
and if you or if you can't look in the
mirror and hide behind your your your
face fat then you get you're forced to
do something about it as a mental thing
for me so that's where the beard went
not to mention without the beard a lot
of people say I look younger I think I
look more rapey but that's at the right
term I should be using there but what
about what about your custom Lok goes to
s1 case they never followed through what
they're promised to actually send me the
additional top hats and stuff I needed
to do that so Loki just straight up did
not keep their part their promise like
they said and I guess we'll kick it off
there and that's why I
I never do Kickstarter type videos where
they want me to promote something of
theirs they're trying to get off the
ground because then companies like Loki
will come in and they convince you to do
something with them they smash their
crowdfunding goals because of exposures
of large channels and then they just
piece out and don't follow through with
the promises they make you so basically
they convince in a short or long story
short it's like hey J do this thing with
this no sorry I don't do things with
Kickstarter's we promise it'll be great
oh it's kind of neat fine okay I'll do
it but I'm gonna want to do a custom
build with it okay cool we'll give you
anything you want once the videos up
video goes up and then they go radio
silence so yeah that's one of the
reasons why I don't do anything with
Kickstarter's usually and it's my own
fault
I should not have worked with them and I
don't plan on working with them again in
the future so yeah if you guys want to
want to be like yo yo where the hell is
Jays case so he can do the build if
you're wondering why I'm not building in
the black one one I need an additional
top hat to do the build I want to do to
do the loop I want to do you know that's
not an AI oh I need another top hat and
I wanted silver because unfortunately
they're anodizing a shit and so it's so
thin that just by handling it around the
edges of the case has already started to
show through like the the bare aluminum
because the anodizing 's been rubbing
off or not rubbing off but the metals
been rubbing away enough to where the
anodizing is has been rubbed through if
that makes sense and it izing isn't a
coating it's actually the dyeing of the
aluminum and it's an electro process
where you you electrocute it and you put
it in like an acid bath and then the
pores open up in the metal then you diet
you dip it in a dye bath and then the
metal absorbs the color so it's not
actually a plating like nickel plating
it's actually dyeing of the metal way
more durable than paint it's as dirt
it's as a it's as durable as the metal
itself the problem is if you don't
penetrate the metal well enough you
don't get a hard enough anodizing or
thick enough layer of the top layers of
metal being energized so then you get
the rubbing through issues not to
mention the case they sent me is also
the wasn't the final version there were
additional things they told me they were
gonna be changing and so yeah they've
completely not followed through with me
they've completely basically given me a
slap to the face with disrespect of of
going radio silent and not following
through with anything they said they
would do and I do believe that my video
was a huge contributing factor to their
massive crowdfunding success so they
made hundreds of thousands of dollars up
front through the help of channels like
mine and then did not follow through so
if you guys are wondering that's where
I'm at with that the post Malone build I
have word that the parts have finally
been let me read the email because this
has been as you guys know ongoing for
quite a while so I heard from Daniel
directly and Daniels doing the cables
for me for the case because they have
the The Spectre case from singularity
computers has channels in the and the
remember the back plate or the
motherboard tray whatever want to call
it it's also a distribution block for
the water cooling system and so there's
there are channels that wires can go
through on that and so very specific
lengths Tim for the power supply and
stuff to to fit without there being
excess and still look good
so they are going to be doing the cables
for me on that I was told on Tuesday
I'll have tracking in a couple of days
unfortunately it's been more than a
couple of days since Tuesday but I
digress they have received all the parts
back from the platers and they have
already received everything back from
water jet james is currently assembling
the case and daniel is doing the cables
so that's where we are we are at the
final stages of that which kind of
segues me into the next topic of new
graphics cars because if you guys recall
Wednesday of this week a video went live
of mine talking about predictions on
next-gen in Nvidia cards it's kind of
funny the way things work let me explain
I recorded that video the week before so
you guys saw it Wednesday I recorded it
Wednesday the week before that so that
video was already technically seven days
old in terms of the the real-life
atmosphere timeline so that video goes
live and no sooner did it go live did
all of the articles rebooting it saying
July is when the new cards will be out
started coming out the following day
after my video so I don't know if it's a
coincidence or if it wasn't just the
massive hot topic that that topic is you
know a couple hundred thousand views in
only two days and everyone just wanting
to kind of jump on that that discussion
but if July timeframe turns out to be
true then that's great news because the
flavor of my video was not I don't want
the video I don't want the new video
cards to come out it's I want them to
come out
Pascal is a bit old Pascal is a bit and
I guess it shows where we are with
graphics cards and that in videos and no
rush to give us new things because
they're just raking in the dough so yeah
I bought a 1080 because of your video
you should buy a 1080 because it was a
video card that works right for you
today not because I said go buy a 1080
so that's the way this works and I said
in that video you also Joker says July
release well Joker is not exactly the
most in the loop person regarding this
this he's just repeating information
that everyone else is talking about so
there's that when it comes to buying new
hardware there's always the risk of
being not obsoleted there's nothing
obsolete by a 1080 if you are the guy
who is like I have to have the
top-of-the-line best of the best then
you can expect that every every 18
months or so you're gonna be buying
buying new stuff if you were the kind of
guy that goes I want a graphics car
that's gonna play the games I want to
play
right now at the FPS and settings I want
to play the map then just buy whatever
you want that works at the time you're
ready to buy it so I think most people
reside somewhere in the middle they want
to get the most of their money obviously
but they kind of want to brag a little
bit about their hardware so there is
that the reason why I'm even mentioning
this the post Malone project has to
tight and XPS for that and the full
thirty eight thirty eight hundred and
whatever three I remember exactly what
the kukuda count core is remember the
standard XP is in the 1080p 1080i is
have like thirty eight or thirty 560 I
think CUDA cores and the full-blown
Pascal chip has thirty eight hundred I
have two of those for him it's the same
two that I run in my system if the new
card because I this systems gonna be
done before July so regardless its he's
not going to be running two of those
more than likely if the new card comes
out similar to Pascal where the 1080 was
a was a separate artists if you guys
aren't don't know the 1080 and the 1080
ti are not the same chip they're not the
same core and so it the the 1080 when it
came out was a little bit faster than a
980 TI but just a little bit slow slower
than them tighte next Maxwell and so it
wasn't until the 1080 TI came out did
the Maxwell cards really then just look
slow so if that's the case I have no
problems with running the two Titan X
peas in there I told him up front that I
told him up front that if new card comes
out that he's still going to have an
absolutely beast of a machine he is less
concerned with his build being the best
of the best the top of the line and this
and that then he is about it being
tailored to it to his taste
he's more about the build being
something built custom for him it
matches beer bongs and Bentley it
matches his flavor his his just really
how he marches to his own beat he's more
interested in that than be able to say
I've got the best money can buy now in
terms of case I think that's true
hardware-wise I still have not even
decide a hundred percent on what CPU I
want to go with the 18 core processor
not an option the reason why it's not an
option he's gonna be using the computer
for gaming and live streaming not
necessarily doing work on or doing any
sort of his like his studio stuff
because he uses I guess he used this
Apple and Mac for all that and he's got
a studio space completely separate from
where he does his these people stupid
people so what happens is you give kids
a keyboard look what happens so he's not
looking at the PC being his his work
machine so I'm thinking like maybe a 12
core something like that I think that
would get the job done 14 court maybe
but with with the live streaming and
stuff it's really not all that demanding
so there's that all right let's find
some questions here mmm I think it's
pretty obvious that he cannot use low
budget gaming tech I think he uses razor
that's not true at all his actual
desktop he's been gaming and live
streaming on is an alienware with a 1060
so there's that your name is Jeff
that is awesome Jeff hey Jay if you
can't afford an SSD would you still
recommend a separate HDD for OS alone I
think that's probably a useful video to
do it's what I always did I always tried
to keep the OS separate from where my
main storage was just because it just
made seeking a lot faster because
remember it's having to constantly read
different sectors of the hard drive and
the least amount of searching it has to
do the better its whyyy
that's why running games on a hard drive
isn't that terrible because of the fact
that the hard drive is only it's just
sitting there idle if it's indexed it's
just sitting there idle not doing
anything until you call you know a
process that looks or something that's
stored on that hard drive and then
that's the only thing
looking for especially when it comes to
like background tasks and updates and
stuff like that he'd be well served in
eight core the problem is none of the
eight cores okay so here's the problem
with that on X 299 none of the eight
core CPUs have 40 PCIe lanes see again
you're back to this to the stupid Intel
thing of we're gonna go ahead and shave
down our CPUs by cutting down the amount
of available PCI Express lands and since
he does want a good sound card and we
are running nvme SSDs and we are running
to Titan XPS yeah we we want the full 40
PC healings on to the cpu are you doing
EVR related content of the gaming
content I've already done awk HTC vive
the first one right because I think the
vipro is out now whatever they call it I
did a setup video on that talked about
it I've done videos of me showing VR
with like erasing and project cars and
stuff I've got this right here this is
my oculus rift it's garbage because it's
one of the ones that the day I bought it
it the horizon is always tilted and it's
a it's a problem with the gyroscope
inside of it it's not the sensors or
anything like that because if that was
the case and it means you would have to
a lot of people just assume that a non
level horizon where it's always a little
bit like it's like one degree off and
that really through if you've never
experienced VR one degree off in terms
of where your your inner ear balance is
telling you you are versus the horizon
telling your eye is something else that
is a very sickening feeling and I use
this specifically because I do flight
sim in here by my writer and my yoke and
all that stuff and I use that for flight
sim because flying in VR is just as good
as driving in VR and so yeah it's bad
I've done all of the troubleshooting
process is supplied by oculus and oculus
didn't even want to replace it for me so
I'm like those five hundred bucks down
the drain
so yeah unfortunately I think I'm
probably just gonna move my current HTC
vive in here for flight sim and then I'm
going to move I'm gonna probably get a
new HTC vive pro for the game room why
don't these companies you feature ship
internationally also will the prices of
video cards go down further please
answer why don't you just ask me for the
lottery numbers while you're at it
companies most companies do
ship ship international or they have
some sort of in regional offices if
you're gonna ask me why they don't ship
international that's a really stupid
idea that you should probably ask the
company why they want ship international
not me
let's see hey J thanks for the content
your videos gave me the confidence to
build your first PC awesome dude
either it says base a holic or bass a
holic either you're really into fishing
or you're really into electronic music
not sure yet but neither would probably
apply well the h61 motherboard will 861
motherboard will support GTX will it
what okay sorry saying you got to
address your questions a little better J
by 584 gig for 300 or wait and buy new
AMD cards any in the offing love the
content note that means any in the
offing a 584 gig for 300 only has a
terrible price but I think I think or
for three at 300 I mean that's not bad
price but a four gig is its gonna start
showing it's a limited buffer is it okay
to mix and match various water cooling
company stuffs the only thing it's not
okay to mix and match technically is
aluminum with other mixed metals you can
run copper brass nickel in the same loop
but
once you add aluminum the accelerated
process of galvanic corrosion becomes an
issue even with proper coolants so it's
it's highly recommended to just not add
aluminum to the loop for simplicity
brands
newsflash guys are all made in China
doesn't really matter whatever brand
you're buying from it's all made from
the same place
Jai make an overkill PC and get like 120
gigabytes of RAM and make it run Windows
on that Ram oh you tell me like a ram
drive you don't need a crazy high-end PC
to do that the thing with Ram drive is
anytime the RAM loses power the drive is
gone hot that about playing Ram drives
in fact like some motherboards - Asus
think it's a SUSE they even have a ram
drive feature built into where you can
more easily create the the RAM drive but
you're right though it's like it's like
20 gigabit per second type of readwrite
something crazy Oh Jake I saved the
money
Jake should I save the money I could
spend on a Vegas 64
well AMD or in video released new cards
this year what do you think man Google
is your friend dude there's lots of
information out there Howard did my
video on what I think the Internet has
rebooted what I think saying July which
I hope is the truth it's still q3 the
rumors I had always heard were q3 I was
guessing later q3 and I think September
ish is what I was saying July would be
better will probably see the founders
Edition cards coming out in July with
the custom cards coming out in September
that's what a lot of people are kind of
going with a Vegas 64 though right now I
just think there's better
there's better options out there for
that kind of money I mean something like
a gtx 1070 or even a 8 gigabyte 580 from
AMD the Vegas 64 is a stupid
power-hungry it doesn't overclock great
I mean can't overclock it better than
then the fury card could that's for sure
which was Fiji based but I just don't
think they're a value that's where
with that which do you like better
mainframe or cable mod those are two
very different approaches to the same
type of result cable mod is very much
about I don't say mass production
because it can still be made there's so
many to order when you when you custom
order the cables you get them much
faster than something like mainframe
the problem with mainframe is ace much
smaller operation so it takes a lot
longer to get cables and stuff done and
quite often you have to wait until
they're done for filling large orders
they get from companies like Intel and
stuff when they do these these show
builds or these cookies like eSports
builds so going with Coolermaster would
probably get the job done quicker and
for cheaper favorite porn site the one
your mom's featured on what do you think
about msi merch - on AMD polaris cards I
don't know what that is actually make a
budget PC 2018 where we've done several
Jim just now adding an SSD should I have
should I have only my OS on it other
than a smaller program like an
anti-virus or a stream or my drivers or
steam or your drivers well you just said
you're adding an SSD agent say what size
so if it's like a 128 you're probably
you're only gonna fit your OS on there
and a couple of programs probably not
even a modern game like GTA 5 because
that's gonna be half your drive alone so
again it obviously depends entirely on
the size of your drive let's see 370z
versus a v6 Camaro mmm tough one
probably the 370z for its better
handling characteristics if we're
talking fifth gen Camaro six gen Camaros
really are handling well in fact when I
was at Buttonwillow with the zl1 there
was a guy there with a 6 gen v6 1le and
he actually did really really really
good so if you're a bigger guy go to
Camaro if you're a smaller guy are you
just like a higher revving engine
then go with the 370 did the last
windows update screw up any intel SSD
you got I don't have any Intel SSDs
let's see you guys find something
interesting or something that can spark
a discussion Jay you going to youtube
call out no I am NOT going to you to
call out most those guys are just drag
racing anyway that's shit's boring I
will say this though
regarding my ZL one I've already paid
for the stage three and I'll talk about
which parts those are cuz I don't a lot
of people don't know what that is I've
already paid for it we're just waiting
for the custom parts we made now which
will be about 850 horsepower but it's a
cam long tube headers the pulley
obviously the tune new heat exchangers a
hole and believe it or not guys yes a
custom water cooling loop because we
have only the all custom cooling
solution for the supercharger that the
water-cooled
new water cooling tank new heat
exchangers so yes custom loop and then
all the small stuff you would expect oh
and it's flex fuel so will heavy 85 but
all the small stuff you'd expect to you
like hardened valve springs might Rd got
titanium valve so that just need to be
change hardened push rods the ARP studs
you know better head gaskets all that
sort of stuff so all the little things
to go with keeping that kind of power in
check Jason choices where's the post
Malone build I already answered that go
back and watch the replay if you want to
know not answering it again can you make
one or multiple pcs in one case with
every common is in the same guys place
pre fruit proofread your questions or
I'm just gonna skip let's see hey J I'm
confused between the Rison 1600 and i-5
8500 what should I go for if I want to
game edit bids and a bit of music
production both are similarly priced so
the i5 8500 is a slightly higher clocked
8400 which was considered a very good
budget dish six core processor remember
the i-5 does not have hyper threading
the 1600 is also a six core 12 thread
with overclocking ability you can
slightly overclock in 8500 depending on
the board you put it in but it's fairly
lockdown
they're both dual channel with memory
they both will game just fine I think a
lot of people would say go with the 8500
I'm the kind of guy that would say go
with the 1600 because of what you said
they're editing vids the bit of music
production only because when you're
dealing then with rendering of your
video and it's exporting you with the
amount of cores you have on that you can
do other things in the background
without it having effect without really
affecting your overall export time or
slowing down your system to the point
where you can tell you're exporting it's
one of my favorite things about like SMT
or simultaneous multi-threading and
hyper threading on Intel or AMD because
it really does allow you to get more
multitasking capability out of it if you
were gonna say you were just interested
in gaming I would have said the 8500
probably catted or not no there are
there are no cats Jay nobody thinks I
could build my own PC now I'm hesitant
and trying it I'm not very tech oriented
should I try it anyway well I think my
entire video would would tell you that
you should try it and I would tell you
whoever's telling you that you can't do
it I think you should tell them to no
we'll keep this family-friendly today
when somebody tells me or I hear someone
tell someone that they can't do
something that triggers me because
that's like the most ridiculous thing to
tell someone you can't do that you can't
build your own computer as it makes me
wonder how well they know you or don't
know you get an inner chiller I would if
I were drag racing Jay do you have any
experience with Linux not really am I
excited about battlefield 5 alright
let's talk about that for a little bit
Battlefield 4 was ok
battlefield 3 was my favorite
battlefield next to battlefield 2 bad
company battlefield 2 bad company was
more of a DLC ish feel to battlefield
three was my favorite close-quarters was
a lot of fun for that just a quick
gameplay conquest has always been my
favorite mode you guys know I love the
tanks you guys have probably if you've
been following along enough you've seen
what I do with jets and helicopters
battlefield 4 didn't have that same fun
feeling to me to it
I mean I enjoyed it but I felt the
balance was terrible I can't even tell
you how many times you can I like
hardcore
so I played hardcore a lot because I
liked the realism you take a couple of
rounds you're down you take a 50
called-- even an even in a limb you're
not gonna get up and keep running and
shooting I'm sorry if you're running
across the tank and an MBT shoots a
freaking Aichi shell that lands at your
feet you're not gonna be down to 10%
health and still running full speed
you're going to die and that's what I've
always loved about battlefield but so
many bitching and moaning so many people
bitching and moaning about you know
fearing it tanks but first of all like
every single class in the game pretty
much had some sort of anti-tank or
anti-aircraft capability but the tanks
and aircrafts got very little increase
in defense so that bugged the shit out
of me they also made the little bird
much less maneuverable and they made the
attack helicopter way more maneuverable
so that was ridiculous and then
battlefield one came out and that's
where I quit I I'm level three I think
I'm level three if that tells you how
much I played it so I got to the point
to where I was just like the battlefield
series has just lost me as a fan can
they get me back with that field five I
guess the live stream will tell I mean
that'll tell whether or not I even plan
on buying the game there is no way in
hell I'm gonna preorder it no matter
what incentive they might offer and
because I'm pretty much against
pre-ordering games at all because of the
here's here's my mentality regarding
that what incentive does a publisher or
a game manufacturer have to earn your
money if they have your money before
they've even given you the thing that
you bought if you no offence people who
pre-order but if you're dumb enough to
give a company your money before you've
even seen what the product is going to
be
like then you kind of deserve the shit
show you may get if companies if people
stopped pre-ordering games games as a
whole would improve because they would
have to earn your money once again so
pre-order pre-ordering games in my
opinion is the is the worst thing you
can do for the gaming industry what they
started doing when people like boogie
and and other folks Mike myself were
just extremely outspoken against
pre-ordering
because remember at the time here's the
thing here's how pre-order started if
you're if you're younger in the chat if
you're younger than you probably don't
have an experience this if you're over
the age of let's say 20 you've
experienced this back in the day all
games were a hard copy all games even
computer games and when a new game came
out the only way to guarantee your copy
was to pre-order the hard copy and then
pick it up otherwise you it might be out
of stock at Circuit City comp USA game
stop whatever yeah Game Stop used to
actually have a decent amount of PC
games available but anyway that was
about guaranteeing your copy and it
wasn't even like you didn't have to put
down all the money upfront you had to
put down a deposit or like 50% of it
upfront and then when the game came if
you choose if you chose not to take it
you get your money back
now when you preorder a digital copy you
get you have to pay the entire thing
upfront and then if it comes and it
sucks sorry no refunds well I guess
Steam changed that a little bit but of
course battlefields not on Steam so
people people started to decline the
amount of pre-ordering that was going
down so the companies fought back by
offering stupid incentives that you
would get through pre ordering exclusive
guns or exclusive skins or you know
pre-order and get 15 battle or get 15
battle crates whatever so now they've
started incentivizing the amount of a
day one advantage you have by
pre-ordering and so I've just been on
this crusade probably for the rest of my
life against pre-ordering games and
that's where I am on that I will I will
adopt the wait-and-see regarding
pre-ordering our nut pre-order but
battlefield 5 until I see how it goes
down
dice is usually pretty good about
allowing reviewers to have early access
and talk about it a little bit ahead of
time as long as they don't go with the
route of you can't release your review
until after the game is available which
I don't agree with because they just
want to negate any of the negative that
you might hear about it dice has also
not been known for the most smooth new
game launches so again I'm adopting the
wait-and-see yes team will let you
refund as long as you have under two
three hours of gameplay yeah and I have
Irie funded grid Autosport because I
hated the game played it for like an
hour
got my refund the chat stopped updating
stupid chat there goes whoa the shot by
really fast what's your opinion on
psychedelics yeah they're like totally
psychedelic man you take it and you can
like smell colors man it's cool it's
doing ever man what the baby-faced looks
good on you Jay do you like ARMA I never
really played armor that much I thought
that controls were really weird like the
one time I tried it I was like the
controls are so weird and I didn't feel
like remapping them so I just moved on
to be honest I J has it been good Nick
how are you Nick Slayer music J what
pisses you off more people who keep
asking where the post Malone build is or
car people who think they know
everything hmm probably the car people
who know everything or think they know
everything because that that resides in
the in the territory of opinion and most
people like confuse their opinions as
facts asking where the post Malone build
is
No kind of makes sense and I'm not gonna
do a video where is the post Malone
field where I talk about it
because even if I do everyone's still
gonna ask where's a boom video because I
did it the happened with Terry Crews I
did an update like where's the Terry
Crews build because there was a couple
delays there as well and yeah it was
just super frustrating so I just ignore
the people asking where post Malone's
build is hi Jay how do you hey Jay what
do you say about Intel showing dedicated
GPU in 2019 I think that goes all the
way back to like 2011 my friend Intel
rumor has it Intel tried to acquire in
Nvidia or merge the companies or
whatever and Gen sang was like no pounce
and an Intel made a vow at that point to
like fine we will destroy you and Jensen
was like whatever bring it even did the
the little like you know like the
kung-fu fight you know that that was
like 2011 mm maybe even 10 ish around
there I mean I think it's taken a long
time for them to even start like
discrete GPU but I hope they bring the
competition because infinite Intel has
the money to fight Nvidia but NVIDIA has
a hell of a head start in terms of GPU
technology so I guess we will see what
happens and for the record no I have not
seen Linus's video about it I saw his
thumbnail and but I have not seen his
video about it yet Alexander Padilla
says hi Jay I love the content wondering
about the Camaro Camaro spelled wrong by
the way beautiful do you use synthetic
or conventional oil when you track the
co one oh dude synthetic of course
nobody uses conventional oil anymore the
zl1 when le calls for 15 1550 oil weight
mobile one specifically mobile 115 50
for the track that's because of the
temperatures that the oil gets up to it
gets up to about 260 265 which is very
hot so that when the oil thins out it
thins out to the proper viscosity and
weight versus a street oil and then I
run
it says 5w30 on the cap I actually run
0w 40 european blend for the street
which most people actually who are
engine builders that i trust for this
particular platform in pro EFI tuners
agree 0w 40 is perfectly fine i did not
run 1550 the couple of times i tracked
the car though specifically because of
the fact that the morning sessions were
very cold we're talking about starting
up the car at like 38 degrees fahrenheit
which is just like what 3 celcius I
think for celcius really cold and so I
did not I did not feel comfortable with
starting it with that heavy of an oil if
you guys know this the start of when you
start an engine that's cold that's what
it takes the most where and so I just
did not feel like doing that so I did
cero W 40 worked perfectly fine I don't
have any question about PC but I must
say god damn you are a handsome as hell
boy you know it you know it ok head
looks a little round oh yeah I told my
barber I wanted to get a shorter haircut
than normal because it was hot and yeah
he I look like a jarhead whatever it's
fine
you also see I got my tan because of
track time when we went to the track and
bike riding again and so yeah got a
little bit of color going on here hey J
what forms of websites would you
recommend for troubleshooting computers
also specifically server parts Tom's
Hardware has a vast knowledge in those
forums hard OCP hard forms is kind of
dead I mean that's it's really just a
dead platform now so Tom's hardware is
probably a good place to go what brand
engine oil do you prefer torque Oh
actually it's just a really expensive I
also like mode tools oil as well why
don't review why don't you review UPS's
there is Zachary there is nothing more
boring than me talking about a battery
you plug your computer into
I was like if you can think of an
entertaining way for me to present that
I am all ears but I can't think of
anything more boring than their
reviewing a UPS when did your hair turn
gray I got my first gray hair I believe
I was 13 when my dad pointed it out by
the time I was 18 I had like an
estimated 10% of my hair was gray by the
time I was 30 more than 50 percent of my
hair was gray and now I am turning 37 on
the 3rd of June and my hair is
approximately 90% gray so whatever I
have hair that's what matters I would
not look good bald I do I don't think I
could pull off the bald head
I'm not I'm not answering that what
should I buy questions guys not
answering League should I buy this or
this I want you to do your research and
come up with your own answers to what
fits your particular scenario yeah look
at that baby face oh and I do have a
dual-core PC that's in the works using
an AMD dual core CPU and a good cooler
that know nothing about okay now if you
want me to review you Pete ups that's a
difference I will review UPS United
Parcel Service I'll give them a review
sure Jay why didn't you like battlefield
1 again as I was trying to explain I'm
about the realism there is nothing real
about battlefield 1 how many of you and
I want you guys to answer like seriously
in this chat if you've played
battlefield 1 or you've been playing
battlefield 1 how many of you noticed
first of all that all three aircraft are
made out of wood and fabric just like
the era yet the bomber you could put a
thousand rounds into and that shit ain't
crashing you could be sitting there on
the ground with anti-aircraft blowing up
shots all around these paper planes and
they won't crash but if you're in a
fighter and you and you go after a
bomber who's got a tail gunner
that bomber will just rip you apart and
you could put everything you've got into
that bomber and he won't even he'll be
at like 50% damage before by the time
you crash so it's it's just it's the
realism it's the realism side of it that
I have a serious problem with I don't
like it because no one plays on hardcore
mode yeah because people are people are
pansies when it comes to battlefield
they like to bitch and complain that
they can't run around Rambo and they die
so but dice is given in and created a
terrible imbalance what are your kids
passionate about um Little J or my
oldest daughter is she's really into
games
she is a gamer girl through and through
she's playing on her computer right now
as we speak she's also extremely
passionate about reading she's nine
years old she's already read she a
couple weeks ago got for her birthday
the entire collection of Harry Potter
books and I always told her I was like
girl them books are like the size of
phone books you're probably too little
to read that she's like no I want to
read it I want to read it and she is an
extremely advanced reader so it she's
had the books now I would think three
weeks and she's already read the whole
first book and she's halfway through the
second book she just can't put it down
if we're in the car she's reading if
we're waiting somewhere she's reading if
we go anywhere she's got her book with
her she is a she is a bookworm my
youngest is super into anything that has
wheels she rides her razor scooter she
rides her tricycle she rides her her
well her real power car she hasn't
driven much lately I could pet her power
wheel I'm she got a little I hate Power
Wheels probably start driving that again
soon she is really natural with things
that require steering which i think is
awesome for me because my oldest shares
my hobby for tech and my youngest looks
like she's gonna share my hobby for
motor sport so I can't wait until she's
older to be honest
what's your take on black ops 4 man I
have not played call of duty since Call
of Duty 4 I don't care lift books what's
a book well you know right now if you
use my link inaudible you get a free
book this month and if you sign up you
get a free book that's yours to keep
every single month a little shameless
plug right there they didn't pay for
that so umm she's gonna be a racer heck
yeah I think so
she's really into trucks though um she
likes my race cars but she's really into
my truck so maybe she'll be like maybe
she'll do the Baja 1000 I don't know I
had to build will build a back
grassroots build compete the Baja 1000
are you going to have another little one
I think that depends on who you ask me
or my wife car are DOJ that is fun I
used to do car audio back in the day we
used to build competition systems for DB
drags which is why to this day I cannot
handle heavy bass anymore because it
gives me a migraine Jay what do you
think the stream link app no idea what
that is
what's up from Idaho what's up Austin
our 6s what do you think never driven in
one so I can't give you an opinion if
you if you can't tell there's a there's
sort of a common theme here with me and
that is I don't like to give opinions
about things that I haven't had
first-hand experience with I know that's
a foreign concept to many people in this
world but that is the way I've always
been
so if I've not had first-hand experience
then I don't like to talk about it or
give anyone any sort of opinion right
obviously because I don't want to steer
someone in the wrong direction on
something that I may be completely wrong
or subjective about which is why I don't
talk about any of the tech I haven't
experienced it's why I don't talk about
the one-plus or any of that stuff
because I haven't experienced it but I'm
not passionate about it I think my
audience is smart enough to know if I'm
not into something they're gonna see
through it so I'm not gonna fake it for
the sake of
views speaking of sake of views though
I'm still continuing this stupid mad
scientist series I'm doing because
remember with the box fan and the four
rats the four or four eighty radiators
we got the GPU on at 26 C under load and
then we took the seat the the GPU down
to 16 C under load by adding an air
condition into the loop we've got some
more ideas we're just gonna keep
building on and I'm excited to get into
the studio this next week to start
practicing we're not practicing about
doing some of these projects that's the
kind of stuff I have fun with the views
don't the fuse don't line and what did
the what did they the 480 by 480 red
video get in terms of views it was a lot
yeah 450 1000 views on that video and
it's only been out it hasn't been out a
week yet three hundred and ten thousand
on the one with the air conditioner I
mean that's that's fine but you know
what the more importantly we actually
learned something ish you could see
what's what volume and where overall
volume was able to achieve in terms of
you know cooling the radiators and
cooling the components but it's
entertaining I think the way we go about
it is fun wheezes vlog while we're doing
it usually I screw up in some way we
have a lot of fun in the studio when we
do these types of builds and we just try
and translate that to the video concept
so if you guys are enjoying watching it
then I think you're more than likely to
watch the next ones and and last week it
seemed like that was a proof of the
concept that these are fun what kind of
phone do you use I have an iPhone 8 and
8 plus because it was sent to me when I
did the the it wasn't easy skins they
sent me the the phone and the skins to
do the add-on they sent me the phone I
was allowed to keep it so I just I use
that tell us a joke please
I don't wanna I don't know any jokes do
I need jokes go subscribe to my channel
you get a joke three times a week there
you go there's one for you hello from
Australia what time is it in Australia
isn't it like close at the same time
just tomorrow something like that
speaking of which I don't have a
birthday this year it's gonna be weird
I'll leave for Taiwan on the 2nd of June
well okay the flight is technically June
3rd at like 12:00 in the morning but I
board the plane before my birthday and I
get to LAX at you know the evening of
June 2nd but I land June 4th in Taiwan
so my birthday doesn't exist this year
so I get to be 36 for a whole nother
year the weird part is coming back from
Taiwan I get to do the same day twice
because I land two hours before I took
off when we land in LAX so I think we
take off at like 4:30 in the afternoon
in Taiwan and we land at 2:30 in the
afternoon
la time the same day which is really
weird the moon landings are fake mm-hmm
I never been in the moon would you do
reviews on third-party GPU air coolers
like prolimatech MK 26 all do review on
anything the audience like shows a
general interest in you understand the
one or two guys that'll be like hey
check out do a review of this really
specific thing please and then that's a
very that's a very niche narrow target
like I have to make videos that I
believe is gonna hit the mass the center
mass of my audience let's treat this
like a like a target shooting silhouette
you've got a silhouette you've got a
target center mass is where you're
trained to shoot these things that are
like hey review this that's like trying
to aim for the finger or review this or
you know trying to hit the ear or this
is trying to you know to hit the the
eyeball
we shoot our videos to aim for center
mass so we have to do where the general
consensus seems to be on what the
audience finds interesting while also
having fun and meeting my own desires
because the channel is about things I
want to do and share it's not about
doing what the audience tells me to do
so the way this works in my opinion I
make videos about things I find
interesting and people who share
interests in those things will watch the
videos and hopefully find them
interesting - somewhere along the line
the audience seems to think they dictate
what we do but that's not the way this
works if we may if we make it if I
decide suddenly guys I'm only gonna
review printers from now on it's pretty
self explanatory and self expecting that
the channel will decline subscribers
will will stop
I think the subscribers would still
continue to grow suddenly because of
residual views but I think it makes
sense that the audience is gonna be like
okay he did a printer video
I'm not into printers I won't watch that
video that's different than he's making
nothing but printer videos I'm going to
unsubscribe so it's the same concept of
the cars there's gonna be more content
car content coming I'm into cars my
channel is about things I am into hence
the name so would I upload a car video
the tt-rs video is a good example for
the first three hours or so I lost about
100 subscribers an hour which is in the
grand scheme of things is not a lot it's
really small those are the people that
either and I only say this because this
is the way my mind works when I am
subscribed from a channel either you're
the kind of person that went I'm ending
the cars I'm out click if it's like one
car video out of every so I've got like
five or six car videos on the main
channel out of over a thousand videos
that's a very low percentile so you
can't be like why is he making all these
car videos because that's not a majority
or a bulk or even a fractional like
measurable amount of the of the video
account so those just be like I'm not in
the car as I said I'm out or they went I
haven't really enjoyed his car car
content recently and the car video just
put me over the top
peace out I'm out what I what I kind of
find annoying is when you do one video
that's a little different and everyone
loses their mind because suddenly they
assume that's the direction that your
channel is going in when the proper
thing to do as a viewer if you're not
into car videos instead of popping in
and being like I hate car videos this is
dumb is just don't watch it because do
you know what's more powerful than
saying this is dumb I don't want to
watch it it's not clicking on the video
at all because the view count tells us
as content creators that the audience
wasn't interested in it not your comment
coming in they're complaining about why
you didn't watch it because here's the
reality of it you clicked on the video
to come in and tell me that which makes
the view count go up so the view count
is high then we can say hey the audience
liked it let's say there's let's say
there's a hundred thousand views this is
this is a total hypothetical number and
and really exaggerated but I think it'll
get the point across if there's a
hundred thousand views on a video no one
liked and fifty thousand of them are the
people clicking to say they didn't like
it which is more what you think's gonna
have a bigger impact on the viewer or
the the content creator the hundred
thousand views or the fifty thousand
views fifty thousand views with with
hardly any comments or a hundred
thousand views with people saying I'm
not into car content they're gonna chase
the view count because at the end of the
day that's how the business generates
revenue so the lesson for you guys as
viewers the most powerful negative
feedback you can get is don't click on
the videos you're not interested in
that's how we know what you are and are
not into not the not the outlier you
know a handful of people that will come
in and just complain about how they
didn't like the video I hope that makes
sense Jay what games do you play these
days I've been playing Ghost Recon again
with a with Nick and a few other friends
from my racing a car racing group
insurgency is a fun shooter version of a
hack and slash just go in there with
some friends and try and be tactile and
complete the missions
other than that I have not really been
playing much PC build simulator or like
in my spare time just because I'm bored
but yeah I'm even playing that much do
you think the 1080i will scroll away
where to go do you think the 1080i will
still hold up as one of the best cards
when the new cards come out all you've
got to do is look at the history of the
previous releases and that will tell you
exactly what to expect the 1080 Ti I
think will be roughly on par maybe a
couple of percent behind
whatever's new I think the new Ti
version of whatever is coming out will
obviously be what shows attend a DCI
who's boss that's my prediction are you
gwah
I'm not going I'm gonna disappoint you
Adam something can be said about a guy
that can't spell a three-letter word
though if you click the video and don't
like it then give the video a thumbs
down that is more for more powerful in
the comment alone I can tell you Kate is
it the Kate I will tell you that the
dislike ratio is indeed an indicator but
as a content creator let me tell you the
problem with the dislike button and I
wish there was like a little radio
button that you could click telling why
you just like to dislike the video we
sometimes can't tell the difference
between you don't like the topic versus
you don't like the product if that makes
sense you could like the video you could
like my production value you could like
my presentation but you could be like
that monitor is crap I'm going to
dislike the video so I don't know if you
disliked the monitor or you disliked my
presentation of it does that make sense
oh geez
what happened here Jay's two cents I
love you so much I love you more Ethan
Ethan Richardson you almost have to
first names but the son the son killed
it all right
I'm gonna have to disable chat here in a
second it looks like
ever built an IND spc not yet but I am
actually going to be building an in desc
PC for Brian because Brian is moving
into a new a downtown apartment which is
not very big he wants to maximize his
space we're trying to decide if we want
to do the lien lis desk or the red
harbinger so we haven't decided yet um
road racing or drag racing road racing I
mean all it takes is a freaking three
second search of my Instagram or my
Twitter pictures to know the answer to
that what was your low life and low
point in life and how'd you turn it
around I think almost hitting 500 pounds
with my low light alright so here's what
we're gonna do we're gonna start putting
people in timeout
who are spamming that's what we're gonna
do what do you think wait to maximize
space get a bigger place hey I see these
are the types of comments you have to
deal with alright let's go ahead and get
rid of this guy drifting I think
drifting isn't a very important talent
and skill to have in your repertoire of
driving skills because when you're
driving grip and suddenly grip is gone
and you turn into an unintended drift
it's a very important skill to have but
in terms of it being the driving style
not my thing
that's for sure let's see 11:30
oh wait 11:30 p.m. going to watch it
tomorrow okay was my first GPU I was
like old buddhu card I think it was old
voodoo card how many but it was
10:8 I eat 1080i a soos or EVGA better
whichever one you can get your hands on
in this current market let's see here
hey J what is your favorite console game
as a kid I was a huge fan of Tyson's
punch-out the obviously goes back to NES
I was also a fan of ghouls and goblins
mmm obviously I was a side-scroller game
Metroid that was a game I really enjoyed
altered beasts on Sega Genesis was a
game I really enjoyed playing and making
me think back that far come on it's not
fair what was my first CPU I don't know
I had a Commodore 64 so whatever that
whatever was powering that what did i do
before youtube I worked in IT I actually
have several videos about me work about
things I did for work before I worked
for YouTube so NES was such a crap
console oh man again opinions and
assholes we all have them couldn't make
it to Vegas for the meetup but I live
locally in SoCal any chance of a local
family tip at some point we're talking
about it actually
we're thing about doing a fan meetup at
the new Auggie's coffee being made in
Redlands because Auggie's had to
relocate and thing about doing that for
like part of their grand opening which
we need meet J and have coffee coffee
nothing goes together like salt and
coffee will you answer super chats I
don't prioritize them and I'm very
adamant about people not really doing
super chat I don't prioritize it
everyone gets a chance at a comment if
you could get any exotic car which one
would you get and why I won't I've
answered that many times I am NOT an
exotic car guy drove a four or five
eight this week piece of crap I don't
have no no love for that car with
the Huracan was okay again would never
ever ever buy a car like that am i
coming to LTX 18 I absolutely will be at
Linus tech Expo 2018 so if you're gonna
be there make sure you come say hi I'm
not gonna be there in any official
capacity I'm not I'm not
I think Linus is planning on like
telling people I'm gonna be there he
asked me if it was okay if you did so I
think that's gonna be a thing but I'm I
don't think I'm doing any kind of like a
panel I don't think I'm doing any like
official presentation of any sort he's
assessable when to come and hang out and
I'm like of course any reason to get out
of hot soak out and go up to cool BC
during the summer I'm down for even if
it means that to put up with Linus for a
day I'm just kidding I like Linus what
about the S chassis s chassis Tsar cool
but that's not an exotic car is it
when will liquid cooled laptops be
mainstream hopefully never to be honest
only guy I know that doesn't like the
four five eight and the Huracan well I'm
glad I could be the only guy you know
that doesn't like those cars but again I
always felt I didn't like them leading
up to this week and I always told people
those kind of cars aren't my thing and
now that I've driven said vehicles I can
now confirm that they are not my thing
does that mean that the people who have
those cars are dumb absolutely not you
would never hear me tell someone they
wasted their money on a Huracan or four
five eight you would just hear me say
that it's not my kind of car what are
some unique high-end cases you are dying
to do a build in the murder boxes one I
would really like to do a build in the
murder box I just love the cleanliness
and the MA and the milling on that it's
based on a t jo7
a very very popular Silverstone case I
would really like to I'm looking forward
to building in the custom Specter that
was built for post Malone a desk build I
haven't done in a long time or haven't
done like at all to be technical so I'm
looking forward to doing that I kind of
would love to do a wall build and I
don't mean a build like worried that you
hang on the wall
flat belt I think it'd be neat to build
a system in the wall I think that'd be
awesome
especially that means you could get the
radiators up into the attic and out of
the space that would be sick and then
you have you have your low volatile so
you could plug your HDMI and your mouse
and keyboard and everything into the USB
is in the wall that would be awesome
then would have like a like a nun that
plexi I would do acrylic or not acrylic
tempered glass but maybe like a nice
metal border that looks very industrial
and then you can access everything
through that but then the water loop
would be built into the wall taking it
all up into the Attic which means I
could go copper tubes for that very sort
of a steampunk II look but also have to
worry about corrosion and stuff on them
nearly as much I could go with stupid
amounts of oversized radiator space up
in the attic because I do have a vented
attic and it is cooled up there so it's
not like I'm trying to cool the system
down in a 180 degree attic I think that
would be neat nun thing I think would be
cool if I had a basement I don't have a
basement see SoCal's
don't SoCal doesn't have basements in in
the houses for the most part because of
earthquakes and crap like that but if I
had a basement I would do one of those
submerged builds where you you build the
loop into the ground because the ground
is really cold if you build down into it
I think that would be neat it wouldn't
be the first time someone's done it
there's been plenty of build logs but
people building drums and stuff into the
ground and doing that natural cooling so
yeah why are ddr4 really expensive
because it's expensive Vandermeer Jade
just a random question how do you feel
about the new post Malone album beer
bongs and mentally have you got have you
had a listen I have a listen to the
album several times and there's some
there's some really good songs in there
that I like I feel like a lot of the
overall beat though is the same I would
have liked to have had a few I would
like to have had a few songs that were a
bit more tempo to kind of get when you
listen to an album right I mean
everyone's obviously nothing's this
subjective as music but I think when you
listen to an album and stuff
you kind of are looking for that
rollercoaster of emotion right this is a
happy song this is a sad song this is
this is a party song this is just
straight-up instrumental I kind of like
that rollercoaster ride of music I felt
like beer bongs and Bentley took me on a
very consistent ride and a ride of the
lyrics and the beat when we're not
always in tune personally I feel like
there was a there were like a lot of the
the undertone and the beat and the bass
track and all that was very repetitive
and repetitive is not my thing
so I had a couple I had a couple songs
in the album that I really liked but for
the most part probably just like
everyone else I think his singles or
what resonate with me and not so much
the entire album and I think that's
probably fair for most music okay so
Luke says smile you have an awesome job
and it's the weekend and try to remember
the age bracket of the majority of your
audience top three favorite movies I'll
answer that in a sec if we're curious as
to what the age bracket of my audience
is we can look at that right now
actually this might surprise you the the
general consensus is Jay the YouTube
audience is just a bunch of 12 year olds
ignore them that's not the case for mine
my YouTube analytics paint a scarier
picture where a lot of people the header
saying some of the really really really
dumb things are straight-up adults and I
can tell you what that age duration is
here in just a second I'm curious now
demographics here we go yes hi hi his my
highest bracket is 25 to 34 followed by
35 Arnim sorry followed by 18 to 24 then
followed by 35 to 44 yeah so 43% of my
audience is a male 25 to 34 years old
point seven of them are female the irony
is the older I get more female viewers
there are guess I got that cougar crowd
the bag I don't smile a lot because I
don't like my teeth I'm not missing a
tooth over here it's a baby tooth fully
rooted never dissolved and then this
tooth over here is really crooked so I
don't smile just cuz I don't like my
teeth and then top three favorite movies
The Goonies is my favorite childhood
movie I like so many movies it's hard to
say
Caddyshack was one I watched a lot as a
kid I really liked Caddyshack and then
number three I don't know if I want to
answer that only because it will make me
sound racist okay fine whatever American
History X to me it was one of my
favorite movies simply because of the
issues that it tackled with one of my
favorite actors at the time Edward
Norton I just really liked I really
liked that movie in terms of somebody
who was like as diehard racist and white
supremacist as they can get to going
through prison and like changing
themselves trying to better their family
especially his younger brother who's
trying to live in his footsteps and then
it turns out that his brother is
following the wrong footsteps and he's
trying to fix it and it's just it's a
good story I thought was a great story
you all watch enemy no I do not the only
enemy I've ever seen honestly is initial
D in what car guy hasn't right J do you
think I'll ever do standardized
water-cooling hardware testing or do you
think it's too boring for your audience
I don't know what you mean by
standardized I can tell you one of the
water-cooling reviews I have coming up
though is that deep cool case it has the
built-in water loop was it the 8 H 90 or
some of that AC 90 something that I
remember then donar the model number of
it but I'm doing a review of that so
it's a case that comes with a water loop
built into it it's really just an like
an AIO to be honest but it's it's
already built in so why not
old Hulk our new Hulk Oh new Hulk for
damn sure Edward Norton as much as I
love him as an actor was not convincing
as a Bruce Banner for me not at all I
remember the actor's name though that
they have now I hope it's something I'm
gonna feel stupid when someone says it
but yeah I can't remember his name he he
is a great Bruce Banner Jay do you know
how to build a computer barely I have to
reference my videos to build it why
don't you use the Arnold voice anymore
because I not that good at it anymore
no no what I just haven't been doing it
mostly because it only it only works
when you can't see me like if you just
mark rough Ruffalo that's right if if
you see me the Arnold voice isn't is is
convincing but when I'm playing a video
game or whatever and there's no face cam
then the Arnold voice is really
convincing he doesn't want to be Bruce
Banner anymore um you think it's fair to
assume that a lot of these actors are
becoming typecasted now because they've
been in the Avengers or the the MCU or
the Marvel cinema universe for so long
that they're that's all they see now
Robert Downey jr. will always be Iron
Man Mark Ruffalo Ruffolo Tyrese his name
will always be Bruce Banner Chris what's
his name who plays Captain America will
always be Captain America Scarlett
Johansson will always be what's her face
do you sell PC parts no I'm not a store
what is your opinion of a big truck with
excessive amounts of lights we mean the
bro Mobile's
yeah the Bruma beard yeah I got a light
mark got my my wheels I don't touch dirt
no I gots my big lift in two-wheel drive
I guess it's same kind of people that
would want to stance their car that's
just their thing do you want to visit
England I would love to visit England
but I don't want to go I mean London
would be cool I don't really want to go
to London I want to go to Scotland I
want to go I want to go check out
Ireland I want to go to the country I
don't want to a lot of people don't know
this I was heavily into camping I was
heavily into hiking I'm an Eagle Scout I
was a vigil in the order of the arrow I
did a lot of stuff when I was a teenager
that I never would have otherwise gotten
the opportunity to do so nature is
actually something I'm I'm a huge fan of
in fact before we left Vegas we went to
Red Rock Road Rock Canyon of course we
just drove through there but I would
love to go see the countryside I'm not a
city person
the irony of me living near LA but
whatever don't I have a stance to 370's
afk Jim you go you go delete yourself go
delete yourself right now how dare you
call my 370z stance
gtfo MF hey J shout me out please please
please no no well what do you think
about the quadrats in Coldwater
I think Kyle already did a video like
that that that shows it would kind of be
a waste of time remember he took an AI
oh and put it in an ice bath and it
didn't change temperatures that much in
fact I can talk about something here the
AC video because we got the coolant down
below ambient a lot of people were like
orange you're gonna be causing
condensation like isn't condensation
gonna be a problem
no because you understand condensation
doesn't form at least not enough to be
water droplets or anything right when it
crosses the threshold of going
underneath ambient it has to do with the
Delta of the difference in temperature
when it goes below in the ambient that's
what's called like outside and whether
they call that a dew point right the
temperature at which the dew is going to
form it has to do with the difference of
air temperature versus ground
temperature and where the water forms
let's talk about a water bottle or a
glass and the reason why the water
droplets form on the outside is because
the thing inside is colder than the
ambient so
the condensation forms on the warmer
side so which is why if you got your
loop way below ambient then of course
the water could form on the outside of
the loop that's why when you if you're
running a water-cooled system you've got
your reservoir and your gaming and the
water temp goes up that's why the water
droplets form on the inside of the
reservoir at the top if you have space
at the top but that only happens if you
get a huge difference in temperature and
that depends on a lot of factors the
humidity the temperature at which the
air temp is outside the vs. the coolant
temp on the inside so although when you
would touch the block
it was cold like it felt like you were
touching something from the the
refrigerator versus something out in the
in the environment it wasn't enough for
it to actually create condensation so
the AC was not a problem that's why with
things like ln2 cooling you have to
control the moisture because when you're
dealing with sub it like sub-zero
temperatures you're so far below ambient
then not only does it count is it you
know create condensation the
condensation freezes as well that's what
all the white is all over stuff what you
have to worry about is when you bring
that stuff back up to temperature all of
that condensation as frozen is going to
turn into liquid all over your system so
that's the challenge with ln2
and then you've got stuff in between
like a Peltier or chiller which is where
you're essentially turning the fluid it
works kind of like an HVAC where you
have a pump and you have the fluid being
cooled down below ambient temperature
and but it's also condensate I know
several people who've killed their
system with pail tears because the some
of the really good ones actually have
condensation control like it failed and
then it got condensation everywhere and
just caused a big problem something I
want to play with I just haven't mostly
because of the fact that chillers take
time to operate just like when you first
turn on your air conditioner in your car
it doesn't blow cold immediately right
it takes time for the condenser and the
and the the pump to do its thing to pull
the heat out of the air and exchange it
into cool air a Peltier works the same
way so when you turn on your system you
power button is actually routed into the
Peltier and then the Peltier plugs into
the motherboard so when you push power
it turns on the Peltier until it gets to
temperature and then it will turn on the
motherboard when it's cooled down enough
otherwise the CPU could overheat long
before it ever got cold if that makes
sense I love you I get games to play you
should be playing games rather than
watching me to be honest in fact I'm
gonna be ending the stream in about
eight minutes
cuz wife and I are going out on a date
tonight and I'm gonna tell you where
we're going till the end because I don't
want anyone to to say stuff so
standardized testing by standardized I
mean with the standardized test bench
that stays the same except for
individual components you test in the
bench and compare them head-to-head I
mean that's kind of the way it works now
we just recently switched our test bench
from an X 299 Platt for X 99 platform we
went to X 299 for a little while now
we're on Z 370 with an 8700 K which i
think is kind of a waste only because of
how bad it it runs in temperature wise
it gets hot no I'm not gonna deal with
it I don't feel like having to deal with
any of that but we're running the same
water block the same fans same pump the
same radiator on all of that so I I'm
not sure what you mean by standardizing
it in terms of the water loop are you
saying I should put quick quick
disconnects on there and constantly
change out the one component we're
testing at the end of the day a pumps a
pump a radiators radiator and a block as
a block so if we're testing a block I
mean we do change the block so I think
we already kind of do that and then the
test bench is what we use to test things
like mostly just GPUs if I want to test
a CPU I tend to just do a build but the
test benches will be cheap do most of
our GPU stuff on JD smoke weed or
cigarettes no I do not like smoking
anything you know like the feeling of
smoke in my lungs I don't care if it's
hookah never vaped never had any desire
to
hey Jay greetings from Holland quick
question custom water cooling or AIO for
cooler master half XP evo the cube case
going to upgrade do an AIO that case is
configuration is strange I had a head
one for a while I use it as a test bench
just go with an a IO and use the dual
120 spot for that it's just not the best
layout for custom loop what are my plans
for the next minimum specs video well
battlefield 5 will obviously be on there
was gonna do one Far Cry 5 we just
haven't got around to it I bought the
game and haven't even installed it yet
but I think that was gonna be one the
last one we did was fortnight and it was
kind of funny how polarizing the
comments are on that but again Hot Topic
enough people in the world searching how
to build a computer for fortnight and
that gets the win so where's my bed so
small because it's not my bed this is a
guest room my computer's this used to be
my home office / studio you guys might
recognize if I turn the camera that way
see there's all the stuff having the
walls pictures of my car now on track
right more track pictures there and
stuff so this is actually just a guest
room that instead of having the computer
used to be a computer by that window
where I did all my testing on we decided
we got tired of when family and friends
would come to stay at our house for a
day or two or a weekend I got tired of
having to have them sleep on a couch I'm
like how am I gonna have this house and
nowhere for them to sleep so this is
just a guest room it looks like this
because Nick stayed the night here
before we went to the track last
Saturday and when we left he didn't make
the bed he just left the bed a mess so
my wife kind of sort of straighten it
out but Nick did not make his bed no
surprise that oh that's Jerry's bed this
was the bed we actually bought when
Jerry came to stay we had ordered it and
got it installed like the day he came so
it's why he complained like this bed's
too hard well he was the first one to
lay on it it's fairly broken in that oh
we've had a lot of people sleep on it
since I ever wanted to have a son I have
never had a preference and that shocks a
lot of
cool I think my wife mostly most people
assume a dad wants a son and then that a
mom wants a daughter I just wanted a
healthy kid and I got two of them and
I'm happy about that
and I think my girls are a lot of fun I
do sometimes wonder what the difference
would be with a boy but I just have not
thought about it what did you do before
making YouTube videos I've got videos
about that man you gotta go look it up J
I'm inspired by your weight loss story
or right now my weight gain story but
too lazy to do anything about it myself
what motivated you to get in better
shape and how did you stay motivated
motivation is a thing that comes and
goes to be honest I just got tired of
feeling like I was trapped in this big
ball of blubber I know it sounds kind of
rude but I got tired of feeling like I
was trapped in this in this body that
couldn't do anything so although I have
put some weight back on I am still
extremely capable I still work out a lot
there is why the weight with back on is
cuz my diet went to shit you can't
outrun a bad diet right but I've been
changing that again and I'm enjoying it
I'm already feeling the benefits of
riding the bike more and trying to eat
better Vegas sucked because of course
not a single home-cooked meal for a week
which really kind of sucked but that's
besides the point
yeah can you do a build in the Corsair
1000d I had a 1000 D I said to back I
don't like that case I don't like it at
all it's giant for the sake of being
giant it's impractical it's heavy I
don't like anything about the case the
glass is pretty I don't like the case I
would rather build in the 500 d I'm
sorry but the thousand D is just it's
ridiculous for the sake of
ridiculousness and is just in my opinion
just a terrible size concept do you play
flight sim yes I do eat salads more I'm
not asking you for opinions about my
weight I'm not asking you for advice
either so when I don't take your advice
don't get offended
I'm stealing views from Steve at gamers
Nexus why is he live streaming I'm get
ready to end it so if you guys want to
head over there you can do that also to
do me a favor
there's 2700 people in here and there's
only 900 likes so I think you guys
should hit that like button because it
does help rank things with YouTube if
you enjoyed it anyway and what that does
is it it makes the little thumb counter
go up that's what it honestly does but
hey whatever it's always kind of
surprised me how sometimes there's
there's so many people in the chats and
stuff but the interaction buttons a lot
of people don't use them like thumbs
down the thumbs up a lot of people just
don't use them to make sense I guess
what's your opinion on the fantex p300
let me look that up if we're gonna
remember crap a can't type in this p300
well it's a neat looking case but to me
it looks an awful lot like it just looks
to me like they copied Coolermaster be
honest it looks like to make the cooler
master maker series see that's what
happens with these these companies is
someone will come out with something
that does really well and then they'll
go we can do that too and then they'll
make something super close to it so
whatever oh well from now hundred likes
to 1400 in a second again only if you
enjoyed the stream hanging out today
otherwise the other buttons there for
that reason too and yeah so I'm gonna go
guys I'm actually going out with the
wife here in a little while and I will
not be going on Twitter because I don't
want anything ruined for me because we
are actually going to see Deadpool too
which I am really looking forward to so
now that I said what I'm going to do
before anyone can try and spoiler that
I'm gonna go ahead and end this stream
thanks for watching guys again more
content coming up next week we are
continuing our crazy mad scientist
series of doing I wish I had a white lab
coat like with the AC and all that we
got some more stuff in store which i
think is gonna be a lot of fun so and
one of them is evolving a vacuum cleaner
no not a Dyson no we're turning a vacuum
cleaner into a cooler so
I'm gonna go thanks for watching and
I'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
