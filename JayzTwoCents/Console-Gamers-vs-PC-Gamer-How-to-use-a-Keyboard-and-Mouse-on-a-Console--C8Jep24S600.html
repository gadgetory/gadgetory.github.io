I this is my channel there is a line I
like to be here we are going here this
is not my comfort zone come out here
j-man okay right now Giggy already
promised I owe you this
hey guys it's Jays two cents and today
I'm going to be doing a video about this
we're going to talk about Xbox be happy
hey guys what's up Jays $0.02 here just
having a little bit of fun with the
start of this video no offense if you
guys like your hex haha it
are you a console gamer and do you like
playing with your Xbox or your ps3
yeah do you spend all day locked in a
dark room playing video games wishing
you had a girlfriend
oh are you a PC gamer like me and every
time you pick up one of these guys and
try and play a video game on your
console you just get completely wrecked
yeah me too
so that's why today we are going to be
taking a look at the i/o dear commander
basically what this thing does is it
allows you to take this pretty much a
toss on the side and use a keyboard and
mouse on your gaming console we're gonna
hook this up into the Xbox we're gonna
show you how it works
and then we're gonna play some halo for
maybe a little call of duty modern
warfare 3 I don't know we'll see like I
just call of duty it's just like a big
duty but we're gonna do a little before
where I try and take this thing right
which way does it go like that yeah okay
where you take this thing and I'm going
to try and play with that and we're
going to switch over to mouse and
keyboard in the same game without
unhooking anything and we're going to
see if my game improves like this thing
claims it will so don't you go anywhere
alright so the commander from IO gear
basically what it does is it takes this
and emulates that to the Xbox 360 or the
ps3 or the Xbox one and soon the ps4 and
it makes your keyboard and mouse input
pretend it's one of these when it comes
to the console so what it does is it
allows you to take your favorite mouse
and keyboard 104 key keyboard anyway
your standard 10 key type keyboard and
plug it into this device and make the
console think that your mouse and
keyboard is a controller really simple
they give you all of the stuff that you
need right here inside the package
unboxing is not my strong suit
got it so this is the commander right
here it's nice sturdy metal construction
it's got a little like recon looking guy
on the front there but it is metal it's
got three u @ mini USB on one side and
three full sight usb on this side so
what you do is you plug this into your
computer and it brings up some software
where you can map keyboard keys and
mouse clicks and mouse movement to
emulate movement or button presses on
your controllers so what you can do is
set up different profiles so you have
like a halo 4 profile or modern warfare
3 profile and you just load them with
different hot keys on the keyboard so
the software could be a little bit
easier to use I didn't find it as
immediately intuitive as I thought it
could be but after you know kind of
farting around in there for about 10
minutes or so it started to make sense
and then it became pretty easy to use
now this isn't the first time I tried to
use this actually I had a hard time
using this in the beginning because I
didn't think the instructions were as
clear as they could be but after talking
to their support then it did end up
working for me and all is good in the
end one of the biggest things you have
to make sure that you have is an actual
wired controller I actually went out and
bought this controller for this video so
you see how much I care about you guys I
actually bought an Xbox 360 wired
controller I don't remember whether the
last time I played Xbox was with you
yeah a year ago probably yeah about a
year ago was the last time I played a
console so I went and paid 40 bucks for
this controller new note could have gone
to gamestop or something but hindsight
is 20/20 but I wouldn't bought this
controller new just for this video so I
hope you guys at least appreciate that
but it has to be a wired controller
because a plug in charge or whatever
they're called does not work with this
it does not turn it into a wireless
controller into a wired controller okay
so enough talking about this you guys
can go and check out the website if you
want to see how the software and stuff
works what we care about is whether or
not this is actually going to raise your
game so let's go ahead and turn around
and get on the console back here which
is really going to kind of feel weird
weird to say that get on the I'm
surrounded by awesome computers they
have an awesome computer just sitting on
the floor and I'm going to play this too
let's go ahead and play some halo 4 and
maybe a little Call of Duty and see if
this is going to raise my game coconut
monkey is this gonna raise my game lack
of duty okay here we got the we got ya
boi finiti ther I'm trying
I think I killed a guy oh dear
oh that's right
Oh God okay I don't remember the buttons
on this thing
how does buttons see you I was enough
shooting I was pulling the trigger
nothing what's happening but get a host
drop
I remember those halos hard all my I
killed a guy you know I think we need to
do halo our colony forwards I forgot
about shields and shit in this game I'm
not filming
oh I did I killed a guy okay I killed
another guy I got a sticky on me get
away
I killed her geez yeah what was that
mean there we go now we're using
keyboard guys oh god right click it's
okay I forget how you use halo yet like
this
okay sensitivity is not high enough we
must turn them give it up
and since it is too low now we're
talking
I like really sensitive okay kill you
kill you
what is beeping oh shoot oh yeah kill
you too after you play yeah yeah I
kill him too dead but he's dead too
I don't know what Mele is I don't know
my melee but news that's a problem no
that's not it
Oh guys is good name
good him get out of here oh no oh Jesus
okay ish step over this shit with the
fates with a sniper rifle it seemed a
little overkill hallo
you guys okay
go Helen I'm not gonna lie this is
actually kind of fun
oh god let's do them oh Jesus forth okay
so uh halo four was a lot of fun I'm not
gonna lie okay uh alright coconut monkey
what'd you think of that it's fun yeah
actually let's be honest here
the commander actually works it works
really well and what's cool about this
is it in the software included with this
it has a whole slew I mean like a slew I
think it's a rightward of controls that
you can use to control the sensitivity
you can do tons of mutton mutton mapping
okay gig you can do tons of button
mapping you even have a turbo mode I
didn't turn on turbo but I think that
can be fun but then again it is this is
technically a cheater device now if this
is what you're looking for if you want
to play with a mouse and keyboard on
your console this is the device to do it
it can be a little bit steep I see it
going for about $80 so it's kind of an
expensive component but it does exactly
what it's advertised to do now I don't
really have too many complaints about
this I do wish the software was a little
more intuitive it's kind of like a lot
of abbreviations you just have to sort
of figure out but all in all it works it
actually made playing on the console a
little bit more fun for me because I
went right into my element and as you
saw in Halo 4 I went from barely being
able to figure out how to shoot a guy to
just like killing sprees so I think it
was one killing spree but still I went
from having not touched a controller in
a year and not being able to kill a guy
to killing people going positive KD and
even monkey over here thought that it
was a lot of fun and his comments were
this is actually kind of fun he was
enjoying playing Halo but you didn't
have any interest in playing it before
we hooked this up so guys commander here
from IO gear go and check it out you can
find it on Amazon and their website and
put a link down the description where
you guys can find it tell me what you
guys think do you guys use emulators
like this for your controllers do you
consider this cheating I think a lot of
people might consider this cheating if
it's giving you an unfair advantage I
don't really care because I'll go I'll
go in there kick some ass sure why the
hell not so guys get on out of here
follow on Twitter if you want to see
more crazy shenanigans
from me and as always I will see you
guys in my next video
we're going to kind of go with it okay
you can do this Nick you can do this
remember remember you got to beat a
freaking computer on this channel
remember I can get you stuff smiling
you're like crossed it today my</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
