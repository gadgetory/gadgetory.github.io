honorary third idiot for the day that's
actually the owner of red mist right
there has rarely ever seen him I think
the ribbon on the channel before oh yes
that's right remember he was on the PC
rescue thing that we never did anything
else with yeah that was a cool series
that had one part we need to do more
than anyway we have all of this stuff we
have to box up this is not all of it
either like it just as much as the
studio already fortunately we also a
storage unit but today we're going to
see how much we can get done while
recording it at the same time which
sucks because it really slows you down
so let's get creative sick and tired of
all the RGB craze well don't worry
because the EDG AZ 270 classified que is
full of all the things that matter like
Intel obtained memory ready you to nvme
SSD support 11 phase PWM for stable
overclocking and a sleek monochromatic
design that is perfect for any bill
learn more by visiting EVGA comm here
cards we've done an assault take them is
a California legal the first box is
packed whoa are we that for our each
other this yeah there we go fuck with me
oh man
Italy he's recording January in Haiti
drastic like I use the venue for a
monster in front of need topic and his
emotional message egg okay so we explain
there's still a lot of stuff on the
shelf and we've already piled up a lot
of boxes as you can kind of see out
there this is one of those things where
it's like you just keep taking stuff off
the shelf but it doesn't really feel
like you're making a dent in anything
than that says Mary Poppins bag that's
what this place is
that's what we need like one of those
Hermione purses
oh my god Nick I don't know if we're
ever gonna get this place cleared out if
we get all the shit that's still under
here at that moment your wires oh I know
it's on my wire stuff but if we're going
to be doing turning the studio into a
workshop we need all the I will slap you
so we don't record too much of boxing
stuff up we got two truckloads right now
Chris has this truck we've got a lot of
stuff boy way more than I realize I want
to talk to you guys real quick though I
made a tweet a couple days back about
this project and that we're redoing the
studio that we're getting rid of the
living room set we actually still have
the living room set it's upstairs it's
smaller now but why why am I doing this
we like the look you know I started
taking a long hard look at the feel of
my videos and what I was trying to
accomplish and where my roots were stuff
and I kind of felt like I got away from
that and I really liked the old school
feel of having the you know the wall of
boxes and all the inventory in a
workshop and so that's what I'm doing
I'm redoing the studio and making it a
completely functional space we're having
that was like probably a good quarter of
the downstairs right yeah it was just
turned into living room couches that was
unusable backdrop I say unused well when
we sat there right we entertained there
we were sometimes filmed there but it
didn't have deep feel PC enthusiasts
feel so I decided you know I this is
expensive
and that was a lot of money that kind of
didn't go to anything but I was finding
myself not building systems nearly as
much anymore because of the fact that my
built shop was still back at the house
and I that's not real spending my time
so I had split up and actually branched
off from the root of my my channel what
I built my channel to be and I wanted
this big build space and I always wanted
it and then I had it and I didn't do it
so it didn't make sense and I decided
you know what this we need to get back
to the PC enthusiasts feel and vibe and
that's what we're doing it'll look good
it will that's why I'm doing this I want
the I want the look and feel of a
functional workshop and what better
backdrop is there for a PPP what better
backdrop is there for a PP enthusiast so
I talking like Mike Tyson difference
what better backdrop is there for a PC
enthusiast to look at on a video than
all of that all that PC porn right
true to his love there's a lot of we
have boxes of that stuff actually where
where is good Chris is not behind me
anymore on the freeway and I haven't
seen him in a while so he got I think he
got hit I think he stopped in a
stoplight or something but then we
started wondering like is there a value
on friendship like a few is just to
drive home that truckload of parts and
we decided that yeah I took the
truckload full of GPUs is probably
totally worth a friendship totally worth
of something for the friendship you'll
be set for a while
keep it of value on friendship a
truckload of GPUs absolutely yes it's
been a long time since we turned this
camera on hours and hours ago but look
at what we've got done so far some
shelves have been built it really
doesn't look like we did anything this
place is a disaster though let me show
you make sure what is asses so I for all
the turning and spinning on are you guys
or a good I stop tuning your camera and
give me thick sorry this is a plug deal
with it
the kitchen as you can see it's not
really much of a kitchen anymore and
then we've got all this stuff right here
so we have to figure out what to do with
right here and the reason why I keep
turning this way it's about to face the
mic this is boxes of stuff that has all
been packed up from the other studio
that has to make its way to the shelves
we bought a couple work benches because
as I said this is going to be a
functional shop not just a studio if you
will told you guys why I'm like you know
what Jay doesn't need a studio he needs
a shop did I did I need something did I
miss something anyone want to hire Nick
he's gonna be looking for a job soon I'm
sitting on the floor right now they're
giving me a hard time
whatever I'm sure the neighbors love us
so much right now
all right so it's the end of day one I
don't know how much footage it really
was to take a look at but check it out
the build shop starting to look like a
shop I've got a place feel to build
stuff Chris thank you for helping out
today
absolutely nick is up there dead at the
top of the stairs you can kind of see
him right there see he's dead so as you
can see lots and lots of parts and stuff
the idea is this going to be all the
water cooling stuff and we might have to
get more shelf to upcoming review LG
ultra wide gaming monitor pretty cool
power supplies motherboards processors
memory storage nvidia graphics cards AMD
graphics cards and peripherals a iOS
headset and this isn't even all of it
we've got more stuff we've got to figure
out and organize there's still like the
intake table over there we call it the
intake table and things that deliver
weeds like
on that table in figure what to do with
it later and we're nowhere near being
done but we had enough done for today so
we're gonna end this vlog at least part
one day one here we'll pick it up
tomorrow same video for you guys but
tomorrow for us morning stay - I don't
know he's doing a dance so check out the
studio you're gonna make them all dizzy
and they get mad when I turn the camera
fast that's their problem it's morning
any any amp up the energy has like two
T's and me already
when he gets to you and him he gets all
antsy in the pan see well we do some or
J through some up lights there so we
have blue and he did he did the look at
his work like it was where he's so proud
of it look at that well and then I went
to put the other one up and I realized I
don't have the cheap floor stand like I
have these these are the stands that
like came with it right I mean these are
Amazon pieces of crap that look how
flimsy that is they held the lights for
a long time they did but then we weren't
asking them to be raised that's because
if you're sitting at a chair and you're
using these that's fine but let's how
high did it so what I did was I took the
core out of it
gasps taped it to the edge of the shell
and now we can adjust that up and down
and I get some rear lighting because
it's really dark back there but the only
other stands I have here and I left the
other one at home accidentally are these
really nice their hydraulic stands well
pneumatic the pneumatic fan just air in
there so if you look like there's no way
we see how slow that's going down
there's actually see that there's air in
there it holds up heavier things and so
we need these for other stuff so I can't
put my other softbox up right there we
also need to figure out a new main light
system because we have this light which
is good it's not bad and it's not
plugged in either no Sun plug we bounce
this light off of this big bead board
and this is how you get the nice
diffused soft lighting but we want to
get a better light one that actually has
more output because now that we're going
to raise this up higher to try and light
this whole scene a little better that's
not going to have enough lumens so we
think about using that one as an accent
fill light and then getting a new light
for that so there's a lot of things need
to be done we also need tool boxes the
gray square now we kind of regret
just a bit but it adds a very nice
separation between a wreck like the
little pink box removed so this right
here guys obviously is kind of like
everything from this part back is
destroyed in the studio right now yeah
this is going to be our conference table
slash eating table and I'm ordering a
refrigerator to finally get in the
kitchen so this is the upstairs and this
is the living room space so many people
were like why did you get rid of the
living room we didn't get rid of it we
moved it and we downsized a little bit
so we have one couch here and one of the
other couches actually went back to my
house and it went into the kids playroom
so they have a couch to watch TV on and
I think this is the right side yeah
right it's not done we're so going to
decorate up here a little more but this
is the basic layout it's a lot more
cozier - yeah it is
they're ceilings lower so it doesn't
feel as high and cold that makes them
it's more intimate this carpet yeah the
carpet on carpet shag we want to shag
carpet like specifically for the very
purposes of shag sort of a cholesterol
this is actually Nick's desk right here
this is just another desk we moved and
your shoes are inside little trip next
desk Park - we just we don't even need
to desks up here honestly because all
the testbench endings can be down there
we just have more Destin we need now and
we even gave one away to someone in the
building it's because we were like we
don't need all these freaking desks now
yeah and then of course you've got my
workspace here which is a mess at the
moment but it's still here in all of
exploring we're not done we got we got a
lot to do so a lot to do but it's
looking better if you look at the shot
up here though so much room for
activities jump cut into the next scene
of the vlog the other thing you actually
have to say jump cut in the next scene
of the vlog when they obviously
experienced that jump cut we went to
hover for a and we got more stuff for
the studio as you can see we got to lock
or storage compartment containers it's
the Mets and in the trunk which you
can't see probably is a little what do
you call them like a cart no it's a
rolling it's a roller toolbox
Kirt thing so it's not just a roller
carve it has drawers and stuff in it and
I just can't bring myself to pay like
craftsman prices and God forbid a day
like snap-on or Mac o prices or Cornwell
because I'm not making really a living
with these tools and if this breaks I'm
not devastated because it was a hundred
bucks
I love to crank my fingers we got a
toolbox that took a while to assemble
but it's assembled now and we basically
put most of the tools in here while all
the tools all right need zoom in on that
that face of you talking to me gosh
that's a pretty angry face actually
except for that one is the piece de
resistance flame feet did you see access
another you're doing camera session oh
man would you look at that
sneak peak of what it might look like in
one of our next videos see all our
videos like that now saw some comments
to their like that looks like an awful
lot of nvidia product I don't see much
AMD that's because the AMD stuffs all on
this side it's not as much of it
obviously there wasn't as much AMD
launches over the last couple of years
but I think that's going to all change
obviously with the thread Ripper stuff
in Vegas stuff it's still amazing how
many people are like I like your green
screen windows in that great range lock
that outside I know a lot of lot of you
people watching probably aren't familiar
with the outside it's there I promise
morning morning there's a new set I like
it
it's so cool I like it so much so cool
and I'm glad you're happy because that
makes me happy too
hi can I help you we'll do an official
studio tour I don't think we've ever
done like a true official studio tour
heavily yeah comment below if you want
an MTV Cribs style studio tour but
everything's arranged in certain ways on
purpose everything's arranged sorted in
a place until we do our first build or
video and then everything could be just
combined a pro set it that's right oh my
god that's part of his job guys we're
going to go this weekend you guys have
yourself a wonderful weekend and I will
see you all next week
turn up turn it up for what I don't
speak Jai</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
