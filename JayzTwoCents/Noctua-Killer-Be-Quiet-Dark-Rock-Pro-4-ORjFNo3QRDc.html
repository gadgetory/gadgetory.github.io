quiet and if you guys have ever dealt
with air coolers or look them up the
dark rock Pro Series from be quiet is
one of the most popular air coolers that
you'll possibly find it's not just
because it's all black and it's blacker
now than it used to be it's like a very
jet black heat pipes are black even but
it's not just the color that makes it
popular it's it's a massive amount of
cooling capability of 250 Watts TDP
displaced but if you've also ever kind
of tried to install one then you would
know that they were not necessarily the
most friendly and if you were dealing
with a motherboard that had high vrm
heat sinks or you're dealing with tall
ram then you more than likely ended up
with some sort of a conflict and getting
the brackets on there was really kind of
a pain so that's why they are upgrading
this now with the dark rock pro 4 which
we've actually got one right here what's
made this extremely different is the
fact that they have created a
pass-through right here just simple
design change it allows you to get a
screwdriver all the way down to the
bracket so you take the middle fan out
right here on their twin cooling tower
you can easily get to the the screw
right here to tighten this down making
it much much more simplified making it
easier to install more friendly with
more setups because we also have more
RAM clearance over here now than we used
to you can kind of see right here on
this unit maybe we can kind of show it
right here - we've got a little bit more
of a cutout on this side specifically
for RAM clearance so tall Ram your
Corsairs your G skills that have your
nice tall RGB tops on there are no
longer going to conflict now I talked
about color a second ago and I want to
kind of mention this this is not just a
black painted heatsink anyone could do
that but the problem is when you paint a
heatsink you also reduce its efficiency
if heat transfer because it's paint acts
almost like an insulation at that point
so that's why what be quiet is done
right here this is actually a ceramic
particle coating very similar like what
you would see on the Space Shuttle is
what they're telling me here but it
gives it a much more efficient transfer
of heat so the color is not just an
aesthetic thing it's actually a very
functional aspect to how this cooler
works and it's not just on the heatsink
itself it's also on the heat pipe so
yeah it's kind of it's functional and
form you know I'm gonna say this if you
were Noctua I think I'd be scared if I
were you because aesthetics people care
about aesthetics now that's why our GP
RGB is still a thing but something else
are gonna take a look at here that I'm
interested in is you guys
Sall video I did about a month ago where
I showed off the new ghost s1 case from
Loki which obviously uses an SFX power
supply but the problem is SFX power
supplies usually are very small wattages
they're not designed for heavy loads or
big gaming machines but with now having
mini graphics cards and the efficiency
of CPUs and stuff moving forward like
8th gen processor and the efficiency of
Rison we have now got an SFX l-series
power supply from be quiet that comes in
500 watt including a 600 watt that keeps
the same form factor
the problem with SFX is sometimes as the
wattage gets higher it actually gets a
bit longer which kind of negates some of
the form factor benefits of going with a
small form factor build list something
like SFX but unlike in the past where if
you had to deal with either an SFX or a
full sized ATX power supply you had to
choose one of the other but what
included well all the SFX out power
supplies is this bracket which you mount
to the power supply and you can use this
in other systems with the amount of
output that this has you could use it in
multiple system not just a small form
factor but more important that is the
cables cables on small form-factor are
always the most challenging part in a
build which is why we've also got a
fully modular SFX power supply so DB
quiet SFX L definitely worth checking
out so you're probably going to see this
used in my ghost build which is coming
up in the first quarter of 2018 we're
just waiting on a few more parts who
manufacture that and sent over and the
challenge is obviously how much Hardware
can you pack into an extremely small
form factor unfortunately we've got a
600 watt solution right here that
doesn't make us compromise on either
modularity or wattage output so guys
that's what we're taking a look at here
at be quiet here at CES 2018 again a
huge thank you to our sponsors EVGA for
making this trip possible or you guys go
and check them out of EVGA comm and as
always we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
