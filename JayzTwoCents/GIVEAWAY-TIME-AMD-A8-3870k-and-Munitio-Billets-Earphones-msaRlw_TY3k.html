billets you cannot win both you can only
win one so make sure that you enter for
the product that it is that you wish to
win if you enter for both you are
disqualified because you can only win

horn out and being greedy when it comes
to technology because let's face it that
is my job so click the tweet for the one

weekly live stream called tech talk with
Jace to sense where I just talked to you
