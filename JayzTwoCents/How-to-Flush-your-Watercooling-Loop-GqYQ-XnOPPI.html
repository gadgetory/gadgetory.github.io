I've got some work I've got to do on the
test rig it's been a while since we've
used this and I figured this is a
perfect opportunity to opportunity I'll
start slurring my words here I've been
drinking the coolant I swear I figure
this an opportunity here to show you
kind of how I do my loop maintenance
I've done a video on this before but I'm
still asked this all the time so I
figured what a perfect opportunity to
both teach and get some work done it's
going to talk about how I flush my
systems now for starters here we need
distilled water and to knock over a
bottle but we use distilled water here
at least to get as much of the
impurities out as we can this is not
going to be a deep cleaning a deep
cleaning would be taking the whole
system apart
flushing stuff like hot water and
vinegar and other system cleaners
through it we're not doing that today
so as more of those do as I say not as I
do things that would be the most
thorough way to do it
but the most time sensitive way of doing
it is we'll just be using distilled
water and I'll show you the process for
that you need some sort of a catch to
catch the fluid and we'll show you what
I mean by that again as I do the
demonstration but if your system has a
drain port in it and you put it at the
lowest portion of the loop like I'm
always telling you guys then this
process will be a whole lot easier and
you're also going to need some sort of a
jumper for your power supply unit or you
can just jump the green and black wire
on your 24-pin look at the diagram for
it don't just start plugging things in
especially if you guys have a power
supply that has all black cables yeah so
these are like a dollar and some in fact
some companies are now including these
with the water cooling parts and then
last but not least I am using a 3/8
fitting right here as well as a scrap
piece of tubing which is going to attach
right here so that we can drain stuff
out of the system so let's go ahead and
get started here the first thing I'm
gonna do is remove the plug right here
and do yourself a favor make sure that
that's closed off before you do that the
easiest way to remember if it's closed
or open is if it's perpendicular and you
have a siren going sirens are important
together you're going to have sirens if
the valve handle is perpendicular then
it's closed if it is parallel then it is
open that's the easiest way to remember
so we're going to take our fitting right
here we're just going to screw that in
just like that we're going to take our
hose so now we have here is a way to
control our fluid flow and the other
thing we have to do is remove the top to
your reservoir
okay so flip off the switch to your
power supply if it has it so make sure
there's no power going to it yet remove
your 24 pin from your motherboard and
plug in your jumper quick note though
this is only going to work if your pump
is plugged into a power supply cable
like a 4-pin molex or a SATA power if
it's plugged into a header on the
motherboard this method isn't going to
work you'll have to plug it into an
adapter to your power supply so that's
important I'm going to start by draining
what's in the reservoir here some so
take your hose put it in a hole I told
you the jokes are going to be real with
this one and then just go ahead and
drain whatever will come out do that I
always think it's me watching the
physics involved with this I mean look
you have water flowing up over there
right it's pretty neat look at the rings
cap her off again
I guess the cool it doesn't actually
look all that bad it still looks pretty
close to the color we put it in there
I'm not taking the coolant out right now
because of color change I'm honestly
just taking it out because of
maintenance I mean we've been running
this coolant in here now for she's
probably close to a year now so it was
Green before that and then I flushed it
put in white pastel again and made it
pink I like the pink color but it's time
for change so we're going to do now is
now that that's capped off we're just
going to fill up our reservoir once
again with distilled water
oops I just poured a little bit there
all right now if you've done everything
right when you flip on your power supply
it will cycle the fluid
there we go so as you can see it kind of
mixed up again it's a little bit more
cloudy but now this is the part where
while it's running I will just let some
of it come out keep an eye on your
bottle too so you don't overfill it also
do not let the level go below the bottom
of the reservoir you don't want to suck
air into the pump this is the part right
here right pretty much just repeat this
process over and over and over until we
get clear fluid okay one thing I want to
mention here too is this stuff depending
on the fluid that you're using may not
be legal to flush down the toilet or the
drain it may not even it may be
corrosive to those materials you need to
pay attention to the proper disposal
methods for the fluid that you're using
so I'm not giving you any instructions
on how to actually dispose of this stuff
that's on you a few moments later and
you can see it's pretty clear by now the
block is clear the reservoir is looking
pretty clear it looks a little bit
cloudy is because this Rezo is kind of
old it needs to be cleaned we'll talk
about that in a second but one thing you
want to be mindful of - if you want to
wipe things like the rim the threads for
the caps the others a little bit of dye
left in the cap right there there's even
some dye that works its way down into
the threading right here in the
reservoir so now we're basically going
to do is we're going to go ahead and
shut it down and we're going to drain
out as much of the fluid as we possibly
can because we now want to disassemble
the tubing here to clean all that off
you also want to clean off any threading
on caps you can see that there's some it
kind of sounds like after I've had
Mexican food you want to clean the
threads of anything that's going to be
touching that you can easily access so
that's why you want to take it apart and
just wipe down as much of it as you can
because if you have any of this dye
still in there right this old fluid it's
going to well it's going to just add
itself to whatever you do next kind of
like the back up buzzer from that truck
is just adding itself to this video this
is also the perfect time to to kind of
take a look at your water block come
over here because if your water block
you've got a lot of micro channels and
stuff in there and this is not a
supremacy Evo block I should be actually
changing this block right now - because
they sent me another one
but if you have gunk and stuff stuck in
here you see some color then your
I want to take it apart and actually
clean that out with a soft bristle brush
so I'm going to go ahead and while I've
got it empty I'm gonna take this
opportunity now to go ahead and install
the right block nothing gets me quite as
happy as seeing the nice shiny side of a
brand new water block so this is what
one of the water blocks actually looked
like taken apart right it's pretty neat
it's not just a piece of metal which is
what they used to be in the past we've
got all these little micro Jets right
there is little micro fins are super
Samuel give an idea of how thin they are
I can barely fit that piece that's 1/10
of a millimeter in between them right if
I go the thicker one which is a quarter
of a millimeter or 0.25 you can see it
doesn't sit doesn't sit between them so
you can see how just how fine those are
what we're going to mix my coolant now
I'm using the Mayhem's x1 clear
concentrate this actually makes 2 liters
of fluid which is nice
normally fluids will dilute into one
liter the concentrates will anyway but
this affiliates into 2 liter so we got
to put 1.75 liters of fluid and so what
we're going to do is we're just going to
fill this bottle which is one liter and
now we're going to transfer it into here
such a fascinating video riveting
it's what's Jaipur water in the world
now you might be asking yourself Jay how
you going to know exactly what's one or
three-quarters of a leader when they're
not there's no markings on the bottle
easy we're going to pour this in and
then fill it because this is point too
far this is 250 milliliters right here
and now we just fill the rest of the way
so that smells strong oh oh forgot how
much these pre-mixed coolant actually
smell we're going to add a little color
to this and I'm not going to add it to
the bottle I want to leave this bottle
clear and we better label it so we hope
they pour it into you know anything
it smells like a game for Russia we're
going to add color to this we had let's
decide on a color in a second but we're
not going to add it to here because we
want to be able to reuse this and not be
stuck with it ever color we choose right
plus it would take a lot less dye to add
color to our loop than it will be to add
it to two liters of fluid so this is the
good stuff we'll set that aside it can
be in charge of labeling this afterward
and what we're going to do now is we're
just going to go ahead and fill up our
reservoir and now we're going to do like
we did earlier we're just going to fill
it up cool look at that go
buh buh this loop I swear is the easiest
loop to fill of any loop I've ever done
do we want to do like an electric blue
that would go good with the purple light
right here it's use the electric blue so
if we had UV lighting it would show up
but steel blue we feel we should do blue
steel electric UV blue it's not blue
steel steel blue well I am with you
it definitely takes more than one drop
to make color happen I like the way it
all sits on top though whoo that's a
cool looking color let's go get teal
anyways okay
well it's very watered down right now
you know it also is an all mixed in
there so a lot of here we have a block
it's very like crystally I like it the
reservoir always is going to look darker
though than the tubing because the doop
the tubing is going through like the the
plastic which kind of lightens it up a
little bit plus there's just more fluid
in the reservoir so it's up and running
it's nice and quiet we're running at 24
C right now on the CPU of course its
stock voltage right now 7900 X will be
overclocking that and seeing what we can
get out of it but once you do guys
actually service your loop so it depends
on quite a few factors it depends on how
hot the loop has gotten as the loop gets
hotter various fluids can break down the
nanofluids don't like to exceed there's
certain max temperatures but it depends
also to how old it is I tend to change
mine at least once a year some say they
can go two years or more I once a year
is pretty much how I'll do it sometimes
every six months depending but there's
just so many factors in there the best
you can do is really refer to the users
guide for the different coolants that
you're using there's so many different
types of coolants on the market
distilled water 2 is perfectly fine if
you're using something a biocide in
there to keep growth from happening
typically distilled water though would
have to be changed out a little more
frequently usually about 6 months is
when it's ideal to change that out but
there those guys I figured make a video
while I'm doing it you guys are always
asking me about loop maintenance and
that's how I do it so with that said
guys thanks for watching and as always
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
