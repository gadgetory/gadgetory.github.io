remembers this system right here I've
started building this the end of last
year and then finished it right around
the time that we were doing the second
video with post Malone which is like
February and it has sat unused since
then because I made a stupid mistake one
that now requires me to take it
completely apart and I'm not looking
forward to it
that's why high-end builds sometimes
suck the new cooler master h 500 p mesh
white provides maximum air flow sleek
design and elegant tempered glass giving
you the ultimate platform to show off
your next build learn more about the new
H 500 P by heading to Coolermaster calm
so one of the reasons why this sucks is
because I'm using this beautiful glass
tubing right these are glass tubes in
here if you guys haven't seen the bill
blog on this system I'll try to remember
to put a link in the description below
but if I forget just look up D frame on
my channel you guys will see this bill
blog I fell in love with this frame
because it looks a lot like a race car
like roll cage I did glass tubing in
this which looks great I got to mix up
this reservoir a little bit better than
that it's like totally separated because
this has been sitting for months but if
you guys remember when I did fractal
Josh's custom build
I forgot I didn't put the thermal pads
on the block because it's the same
motherboard on the monoblock up here on
the VRMs in the right spot so not only
are the VR M's not being touched and
actively cooled by the thermal pad
I'm afraid that where I put the pad is
actually spacing the block off of the
VRMs entirely which could end up causing
a problem here so what do we have to do
we have to drain it entirely because
unfortunately and we'll show you here in
a second unfortunately the opening on
the back of the Inman motherboards is
not big enough to allow me to take off
the block without having to take the
entire motherboard off of the
motherboard tray which means that the
drain the system remove the tubes
complete pain in the ass
so this is the back of the motherboard
right here and you can see some of the
screws for the block the other two are
located down here behind the metal if
anyone had just opened up this hole a
little bit more it would have saved me a
whole lot of time I'll say this though
one of the things I really like about
glass tubing is that there's so much
more sturdy that's way more sturdy than
anything that's ptg would there be so
much more wobble it's very rigid I'm
going to spare you guys the just I guess
the torture of me just talking while I
do this so when we go ahead and let Phil
work some of his amazing magic and we
just montage
so it's finally done after months of not
getting time to do this I can finally
start enjoying this system so it's
running right now heaven benchmark at 4k
extreme tessellation ultra settings and
the GPUs are running 43 and 44 Celsius
respectively and they are running over
between 90 fps and 120 fps in 4k
depending on the scene that it's
rendering temperatures are definitely
looking good we ran OC CT our
temperatures were in the mid-60s spiking
into the high 70s low 80s during certain
you know Hammer tests which is what
they're designed to do which could be
better obviously if I had deleted my
7900 X which I didn't but I'm not taking
this back apart again that's like the
third time all of this was to move that
one stupid thermal pad because I didn't
pay attention to what I was doing and
fortunately I found out though on Josh's
system before we shipped it and that's
what made me realize like crap I did it
wrong on my system too but we're fixed
and we're up and running now which kind
of leads me into this conversation about
high-end systems like this and how once
you do water cooling with rigid tubes
and stuff it kind of sucks because there
is definitely a give-and-take there
there is definitely a sacrifice in terms
of ease ability easiness easy Mac
whatever it it's not easy to service the
system when something goes wrong which
is why when we built the server that I'm
still got to get my raid card in and get
the raid going which is why we went with
an a IO and simple simple simple because
servicing has to be of the utmost
importance in a system like this once
it's together and running I tend to not
really mess with it too much like
skunkworks hasn't been touched in over
two years
same exact setup no problems whatsoever
but if you're a more of a beginner
builder or even an intermediate builder
then you probably would want to go with
something that's a little bit more
friendly in terms of servicing yeah
rigid tubes or in this case glass tubes
look great but man there is obviously
you can't just unbolt your CPU block and
swing it out of the way like you could
with soft tubing or move your GPUs out
of the way in fact there's been times
with soft tubing I was able to take GPU
block CPU block rate
pump and everything out in one complete
unit and set it aside work on the system
and get it all back in without ever
draining the loop obviously we can't do
that with this so I mean but this is
this is part of the fun for a guy like
me and when I do these types of videos
it usually gives people tons of
ammunition and be like see that's why
water cooling sucks that's why water
cooling stupid it's why you shouldn't do
it that that's probably true for you but
not for me and plenty of people who
share in my love and interest in water
cooling and building systems like this
so anyway I guess that's pretty much it
I don't think I had the lighting done in
this system when I finished it I think I
put it all together but the lighting
wasn't done yeah I show down social
media so what we decided with is purple
lighting on the fans because remember
this is all RGB the fans are RGB the the
motherboard is RGB because we are using
blacklight and I love the way the green
fluid the Nano fluid looks this is
Mayhem's green fluid I do love the way
it looks under black light it kind of
brings me back to the early water
cooling days where glow-in-the-dark
black light UV alien was kind of the
only options you had that in red which
was actually pink it brings me back to
that it feels very retro to me but
because we are using the black lights
which have a bit of a purple hue to them
or actually they're not blacklight will
call them UV light a triggers people
when I say blacklight because it's not
black when we use the UV light obviously
it's got a purple glow so that's why we
wanted the purple fans and the greens
it's got a bit of a joker theme plus the
green on the D frame but now that it's
done I can finally take it home which
means I can now take skunk works to the
studio which I've been promising and I
might do some sort of an update with
that system I don't know I really know I
got more systems than know what to do
with again first road problems I'm not
complaining but definitely I'm lucky I'm
a lucky individual all right guys we're
gonna go thanks for kind of coming along
with us on this journey where I took an
opportunity to get a video created out
of work I had to do and something I've
been putting off now for six months I
believe it's been six months since I
finished this built my road is
depressing whatever I'm gonna go guys
thanks for watching give us a follow on
social media you'd see some behind the
scenes stuff and know what videos are
coming up plus you not to rely on
YouTube's
terrible notification system to know
when a new video goes live so click
Subscribe follow on Twitter
and you'll always be up to date on what
I'm doing here on the channel alright
guys we'll see you in the next one oh no
what hit 42 and 43 they're overheating
out the far cry from our 15 Celsius
setup far cry 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
