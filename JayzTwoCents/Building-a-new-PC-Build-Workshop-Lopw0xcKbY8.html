now we've used it in quite a few videos
already and that's only a small portion
of this space it's amazing how quickly
we filled this up with crap like well
this guy Jack's not crap that's actually
pretty fun but you can see we put down
some rugs and stuff here we've got one
very important area to work on though
right there because that's where our a
lot of the magic is gonna happen that's
where this is gonna be my new and
improved ultimate PC building space I
bought toolboxes and stuff but we gotta
get this all set up we gotta do
something about some of this echo you
got the carpet back down on the floor
we're gonna do some stuff at the
backside of this set wall so that it
will integrate with here and so anyway
we got some things to talk about and
we're just gonna kind of bring you guys
along for the ride you guys seem to
really be enjoying the build series and
I'm really excited about this one here
because imagine having this much space
dedicated to just building computers and
I want to make it as awesome as possible
but for as cheap as possible because I'm
cheap Coursera is proud to present their
new Hydra X line of custom water cooling
products the new XG 5 series radiators
offer the perfect balance of fendente
and airflow to keep your loop cool and
quiet
the XG 7 water blocks feature full
coverage cooling through GPU while also
maintaining an aesthetically pleasing
design while the XC 7 and XC 9 cpu
blocks keep all your modern cpus nice
and cool to see the complete lineup of
high directs cooling products from
Corsair click the link in the
description below
alright so we're switching over to
shotgun mic because I'm gonna be moving
around dealing with stuff down here and
I don't want to get my very expensive
level or mic tangled up on something but
here are some work benches that we've
got these gonna be going in the back
we're gonna have a very similar table
thing in the middle of the floor like
our old set was grass some racks over
here we'd have some toolboxes and
shelving yeah so there's a lot to get
done here one of the things I had
originally talked about doing here was
building a set for the shop and the
reason for that was because of these
so I was worried about the panels being
here and I thought man I don't want to
cover those up because code dictates I
have to have four feet of clearance in
front of the transformer physically the
transformer if you come over here the
transformer sticks out about a foot and
a half from the wall so that means four
feet from there the end of the shop
would have to be about right here so
that's a lot of space we're gonna loose
I figured if it's gonna be a workshop
anyway why the hell not have it right
here in the shop accessible one thing we
also we're still gonna have to do which
I can't do myself I've been trying to do
this is so far I've done this 100%
myself but I have to bring in a licensed
contractor c10 electrician to bring
conduit along this wall I want plugs on
the wall I want plugs over there for the
set the sets got its own electrical
which is within code but I need I want
to bring in dedicated 20 amp circuits
cuz if you check this out we've got
plenty of room for expansion so we could
literally have every plug be on its own
dedicated 20 amp that's great news for
overclocking so yeah here's what I do I
think we're gonna set up maybe some of
our time lapse II thing like we tend to
do and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead and talk about kind of
the setup of the shop
today's goal is not have to shop be a
hundred percent done that's that takes
time you guys have seen sets and YouTube
space and all that takes time to evolve
but we need the bat we need the
foundation the backbone we need things
to kind of go where they're gonna go
before it can sort of start filling in
the blanks so by me using this corner
and this wall which I originally didn't
want to put anything on this wall it's a
brand new wall that they installed brand
new paint and I was like man well my
lease is up if I leave I gotta put this
wall back and that's okay it's white how
hard could that be
does this fat make me look fat
the idea here with this is that I can
work on computers and have plenty of
space for tools and like one of the
issues we had on the other set was that
you get phone calls while you're trying
to shoot one of the problems we have
with the other set and I really need to
sand that clean this is that this twist
my space this was all I had to build
this right here and so the problem was
if I was in the middle of like working
on skunk works or something I've got to
being everywhere in fittings and trash
and just it's like crap we got this
other video we got to make so then it's
just like really on the floor and then
do that thing and then the floor was
just like oh my god like that's why you
never saw the floor because it was
pretty bad but now look at this we
technically have a works based on top of
the tool box we have to work benches
back here and the main thing plus all
this shelving space so the idea here I'm
probably gonna put things here that we
use all the time like probably like one
of each rise in some of the CPUs and
stuff things that are not gonna be like
stored away on the shelves because the
shelves in the other studio did two
things one they gave us a place to put
things the shelves work right they also
gave us a backdrop we have controls with
the backdrop here so we have full
control over that which is why now this
shelving here is gonna be a place we're
gonna have bins with like cables and
piping and tubing and soft tubing and
all that sort of stuff labeled in its
place and if we're working on something
and we got to come back to it later we
can like quickly put a label up here or
a piece of tape and write skunkworks v2
whatever right and then put those parts
here and then that's where it goes
it's we're ready to keep working on it
so instead of having this space be the
only workspace I have now we've got all
this so it's like a ram upgrade all
right we download it so much RAM yes I
kind of went back and forth on what tool
box I wanted to get because I've got
some pretty nice tool boxes at home but
they're not full
there each of them are half-full so we
decided to get one of the smaller husky
boxes which joke they're not Maximo
cannot snap on I'm not spending five ten
to fifteen thousand dollars on the tool
box this is way more storage than I need
for the tools are gonna be you know
through me doing it and the products
we're gonna be working on but the cool
thing is this creepy the workbench so if
I wanted to check this out if I needed
the space like for cabinets and stuff
there boom yeah I mean so we're gonna do
right now is we're gonna head over to
Home Depot are some things we need to
get I'm gonna be putting sound dampening
or the sound foam on the back of the set
you guys kind of saw me start doing that
at the beginning of this whole build
series and some of you were really
confused as to why we're doing that
that's because anywhere we can stop
reflections is a good thing we have lots
of it so why not so we've to get a
staple gun to staple those to the back
of that cut the hardwood we were gonna
do adhesive but it's just it was over
spraying everywhere we need to get a
sander so I could stand this off it's
got gold all over it from the gold build
it's sticky this is real this is real
wood lots good to get screws for it and
then debating getting a cabinet but I
don't know where it would go now because
I'll be honest I thought we were gonna
have more room in here than we do in
terms of like the shelving and those
benches and then I'm debating putting a
pegboard back here but everyone does peg
boards right I mean Steve to the
pegboard Kyle did a pegboard - did the
pegboard in his studio so
was due a different name bored everybody
at lunch cause were fat yes I know gee
it's not the right kind it should be
this we should be that this isn't a
soundstage okay we're just doing like I
said the very start of this whole series
if I can get 70 or 80% of the result for
less than half the price then I'm fine
with that
in fact this fight cost like 20 percent
of the actual stuff but you can see we
decided not to build a wall we just
wanted to leave it open so we have more
space a wall would've taken in more
depth so we have a much wider set now
when we originally would have we had to
put a square back on up there the glue
came off on that one we got to fix that
but what we need to do now as you see
how I believe this is this it's filthy
it's sticky something good on there we
walked on it when we were moving there's
paint on here when we did the gold build
I am now going to sand the top of this
and I don't think I'm gonna refinish it
because that's such a light-colored wood
that's such a light-colored wood I think
I'm just gonna let this be whatever
color it looks like it is after sanding
but because it is real wood we can get
away with that it's not like a laminate
at least yeah it is real wood you see
cracks and stuff that we've made in
there so let's do that
all right if you look at the surface now
I got rid of all the paint that was on
here I just I should have probably used
the coarser grain this was just a 320
finishing pad as you can see it's very
dusty but we're gonna do right now is
we're gonna do it just a little bit of a
hack something that one of my woodshop
teachers told me yeah I took shop what
what about it so one of the things that
you use to kind of hydrate and keep wood
nice is a citrus oil believe it or not
okay so now we're just gonna rub this in
nicely and as you can see now all my
paints is gone the scratches we put in
there with like the the knives and stuff
when we cut things are still there but
this is the 279 dollar tabletop from
Ikea I was not about to buy another one
but as you can see already not bad right
compared to how it looked when I started
one thing it's nice too is because it's
so warm and dry in this warehouse and
there's still have any air conditioning
out here and it's 108 degrees Fahrenheit
today this is so dry it's gonna this oil
is gonna dry overnight really quickly so
you guys are used to this set and here's
what we got done today I present to you
the new and improved foundation for the
J's $0.02 makerspace plenty of counter
space I'm thinking about even getting a
3d printer to be honest there's been
times I've wanted to 3d print my own
parts but I never had space for it but
obviously we do it is super vanilla
obviously right now there's nothing on
these shelves feel just kind of stuck
these these coolers here for now cuz
this is like I said earlier this is not
intended to be storage there will be a
whole storage section over there but
this is not intended to be stored just
as intended to be commonly used parts
that we do for builds and other videos
and stuff and then once the shelves are
filled up you won't really see the back
of the other set wall over there yeah so
the biggest issue I have so far is
philistine over there where like a cam
would be with a big white wall behind me
it's pretty plain obviously and so I
want this to be like ya see it looks
like I'm just in
the matrix or something and I'm like
guns lots of guns right so oh man ok
well you know California what I did at
the other studio as you guys saw is I
put some of my favorite builds back
there the thread Ripper build has been
back there the whole time you know
symbiotes skunkworks was there for a
little while the D frame build our test
bench I might have a permanent test
bench setup here I don't know yet how I
want to handle that I'm kind of thinking
about doing a test bench cart that's
always there and can roll around and we
just have to plug it into power and it's
ready to go for whatever testing we want
to do but I don't want to utilize this
space for any sort of like things that
are gonna reside on there like builds
and stuff I think that's what this area
is gonna be for over here because if you
guys look we've got a lot of carpet on
the floor over here to kind of give you
an idea of how big the next set is going
to be I want this to be almost like not
really a living room but just a nerd
space if that makes sense this was
designed to be kind of like a home
office this is obviously our build shop
I scratch the idea of recreating our
current set because I'm frustrated there
I feel crammed I feel like that place is
a source of anxiety for me to be honest
I know it's a youtuber Newberg's I did
know that none of that crap it's just I
didn't like working in there
why recreate the thing that bothers me
so I'm thinking I want this to be like a
dual zone kind of a that not only is a
functioning set but also like lounge
area for when Brian's here and we're
just kind of kicking back we could have
table and chairs are like a couch and a
TV and you know that you can hook up to
for showing your screen and all that
sort of stuff like a real relaxing kind
of a greenroom meeting space and then
another like standing set over here
where we could do like bigger showcase
stuff like case reviews and that sort of
stuff for when the shop isn't being
utilized because I still think I'm gonna
spend most of my time over here but I
want this space over here to make sense
to and I'm sure that this is where guys
were like I thought you were gonna park
your car in here no that was that
would've been nice but that's certainly
not the idea this area over here is
where storage is going to kind of be
we'll probably have two racks against
the wall and then two more racks right
here in the middle so that you can get
to either side of them with plenty of
storage there but if you if you turn
about
look at this carpet again so I'm so
excited for this I can't wait to see
what comes together over here you can
see we started getting lumber I know the
last time I was like guys what would you
do in the space you guys all told me
what I was doing wrong no if this were
your space right here what would you
build in them I'm looking for instant
inspiration and some ideas so what we'll
try this again this time without as much
of the abrasion as I said in our
interview or a JC sense QA but yeah look
at that
this this is I'm excited for this and
then we still have an editing den to
build I think by the time we're done
building or lease we'll be up guys we're
gonna go thanks for watching the build
series will continue we've got lots to
build out here we still need to get HVAC
out here our HVAC literally consists of
this three ton unit right here blowing
into the office with this shop fan
blowing cold air out here overworking
that 3 ton unit but hey keeps it about
85 or so out here which is manageable
considering is almost 110 today all
right I'm rambling now thanks for
watching guys we'll see you in the next
one did it even focus that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
