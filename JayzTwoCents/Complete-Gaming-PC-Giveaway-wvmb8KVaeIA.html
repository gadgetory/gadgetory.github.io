jay is too censoring can you believe
it's been five years since I started
this tech channel that I swore no one
would care about or anyone would watch
it's been a hell of a fun five years in
fact let's take a quick look at where it
all started
welcome ladies and gentlemen to Jay's
$0.02 YouTube channel come at just semi
live on the internet here I want to
welcome you to my new channel
formerly J's VFX now Jay is two cents
yeah this is good yeah but it's here get
to the computer
yeah good night
get it now yes oh yes hi what is the TI
you know
 you Nvidia
hey you're watching Jays two cents and
I'm wearing a very brightly colored
shirt which means that we're gonna bring
you an affordable graphics card review
actually those two things really have
nothing in common do they I love you
very much I don't think I could have had
a better father and I just wanted the
world to know that thank you take care
of it
that's kind of the point of today's
video I want to talk about how the last
year being self-employed in this YouTube
space has actually been how its treated
me some of the plans moving forward and
basically just have a chat with you guys
it's been a long time since we've done a
video like this and I think it's time
next time we have to talk
oh my god a big head
what's up guys Jase $0.02 here and you
might notice I'm in a space that doesn't
really look very familiar I ran into
someone he invited me in and once you
gonna introduce yourself you guys might
have seen him before
hey hey what's up guys this Terry Crews
here with J 2 cent we told you it was
going down we told you we told you
what's happening and now it is happening
what's up J this over here this
conference area make an eating area and
meeting area whatever we're gonna power
this over here is gonna be like the main
set I wanted to feel kind of like I
don't know like a living room home
feeling setting not J's porn casting
couch as everyone keeps calling it I
would have gone with black leather if
that was the whole idea with that we're
gonna go deliver this to some guy you
guys may have heard of him every now and
then does this thing on the on the TV
his name's Terry Crews
he's a PC gamer who would've thought
I'm expecting a beast first of all I'm
also expecting something way better than
what I did you know again my cable
management is push that power button on
the front on the bottom right there oh
my god wait wait right here on the
bottom on the button there it is we'll
talk about that other power button in a
sec here we go
oh look at this baby
wait wait wait you got to see the old
fries logo that shows up a lot better at
night trust me yeah it's kind of crazy
and how far we've come right but you
know I think one of the best
accomplishments I've gotten so far is
that I now have my very own kitchen to
do all my water cooling stuff in that
doesn't piss off the wife by getting
stains on her counters and well it's her
kitchen must be honest I don't I just
rent it but that's not the biggest
accomplishment to me it's the fact that
I swore this channel would go nowhere
that no one be interested in the opinion
of a guy like me talking about computer
hardware but obviously I was wrong
because there's almost 1.2 million of
you following this channel in that short
amount of time and that's also enabled
me to do some really cool projects like
the one we have coming up here later
this week stay tuned for that we've got
an AMD $500 build versus an Intel $500
build using all new parts and we'll see
who's actually giving you the best value
for your money and we've got some other
stuff here we'll talk about in a second
but look this is the new set right we
just rebuilt all this we've got a
workshop some amazing content coming in
all of this do you guys see behind me is
because of viewers like you and your
support in the last five years have been
absolutely amazing and that's the reason
why I want to give back to you guys
what we have right here and hopefully I
don't drop it oh my gosh it's heavier
than I thought it was going to be this
right here is going to one lucky winner
because I want to give back to the
community so we've got an EVGA supernova
750 g3 power supply that's gonna be
powering our asus strix gtx 1070 power
supply and it's what else we got here we
got a rise in 7 6 1700 X once at 1600
this is a 1700 X CPU we've got 16
gigabytes of g.skill try to z ddr4
memory keeping our CPU cool we've got a
fractal design Celsius s 36 360 red
water cooler and it's all going into an
X 370 Taichi motherboard
and then for storage we've got a 240 gig
SSD from a data as well as a 4 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda hard drive all going
into a fractal design case of the
winners choice the bottom line is this
whole channel exists because I want to
prove to you guys or at least to myself
that it would never go anywhere
obviously I was wrong I mean look at the
hardware we're using now we're bringing
new videos this one's being shot on a
sony a7s mark 2 this is our F s5 which
we got last year amazing camera and then
we just stepped up our main production
camera here to a sony fs7 mark true mark
true mark 2 completely unnecessary stuff
but you know what I enjoy making content
for you guys don't want the tools to
make you the best content possible it's
got to look good I look like crap so it
has to look good because this is face it
I can't get by on subject matter alone
not we have to look at this face now I
got to talk about the boring stuff
though guys after all there are
legalities in giveaways like this look
in the description box of this video
that will take you to a link to the
contest page where you guys can verify
that you are d a subscriber if you're
new here make sure you subscribe there's
also a bonus entry in there for
following on Twitter but I'm not going
to give a bunch of different ways to
enter like daily entries or any of that
we're gonna keep it simple now
unfortunately this giveaway this time
it's only gonna be for us residents I'm
sorry I know that's gonna I can hear the
boos already it sucks but just the cost
of sending the stuff overseas outweighs
the cost of the stuff you're actually
receiving I've shipped a graphics card
to the UK and my last giveaway and it
was half the price of the graphics card
it was ridiculous so and then the taxes
and stuff guys I have no control over
that but I'm sure you understand where
I'm coming from but my obligation to you
guys is to make sure to give you the
best content that I can possibly produce
it's never going to be the best but it's
the best that I can do and a huge thank
you guys for an amazing past 5 years and
I can't wait to see where the next five
years goes and a little bit of
background info here we actually just
brought on our third person that's
insane
somebody I trust you guys will see him
soon but with that said guys it's time
to go thanks for all the amazing times
and here's to some great times coming
forward if you guys know no tell me what
you guys think of the last 5 years in
the kind of content you want to see one
of those channels that listens to the
audience quite a bit but you know what I
don't listen to I know this in the Nick
he tells me throw away your your coffee
cups

that on the channel yeah you see my desk
