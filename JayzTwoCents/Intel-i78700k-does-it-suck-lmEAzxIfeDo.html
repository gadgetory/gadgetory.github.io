launch day for Intel Z 370 chipset which
means both companies have pretty much
all their cards on the table from the
bottom of their stack to the top and so
it makes it a very good time as a buyer
to build a system you're pretty safe
right now that nothing new and top tier
even mate mid level is gonna be getting
launched anytime soon because both sides
have already just shoved all of their
products to market 2017 was a really
exciting year for PC builders or PC
enthusiasts because you have so much
hardware to consider that makes sense on
both sides of the fence
now disclaimer because I have to put
this out there otherwise people come up
with their own like really stupid ideas
of how these videos work yes Intel sent
me the CPU but so did AMD neither of
this company sent me any cash for any
reason or even gave me any input
whatsoever on how this video should be
made this is 100% my idea and my test of
methodology and my opinions I don't know
why that's so hard people understand but
now that that's out of the way let's
talk about this we've got the 8700 K
over here and that's a it's an
interesting CPU for Intel because it's
the first time they put six cores and 12
threads on their main stream CPU we've
seen that plenty of times on the extreme
right X 58 X 79 X 99 X 299 so we've got
right here are two test benches I made
well there's boxes right I make many
perfectly good test benches one is Z 370
featuring 8700 K one is ax 370 gaming
five from Oris which is also gigabyte
featuring a 1700 X now why did I put the
8700 K versus the 1700 X because there's
a lot of weird ways I could have done
this video because this is the $359 CPU
the problem is AMD doesn't have a $359
CPU they have a $200 CPU at $300 CPU and
a $4 CPU so it's kind of like the whole
AMD versus Nvidia thing where they're
constantly like leapfrogging each other
I could have gone core for core which
means I'd be putting the 8700 K versus
of the rise in 1600 X this comes in at
just over $200 this comes in at three
hundred and fifty nine dollars this is
the clear winner in terms of bargain and
in price to performance but still has
good performance
the day AMD was always well there the
performance per dollar King where you
could spend you know money on an FX
platform and it would just get smashed
by anything Intel had to offer passed
the Ivy Bridge series and your your
argument was yeah but it didn't cost a
lot
well now you're actually are getting
really good performance that still
doesn't cost a lot compared to the Intel
variant I still feel like the 1700 X is
still a really good sweet spot in terms
of the X 370 platform but you could save
even more money by going with a 1700 the
difference is I don't have to overclock
this one as far as I would a 1700 and
unfortunately my 1700 s kind of a dud it
doesn't overclock very well so that's
why I came up with this methodology we
won't talk about how weird things are in
the state of affairs right now you can
get the $359 z3 7080 700 K or you could
get the 359 dollars according to Amazon
anyway at three hundred and fifty nine
dollars i7 7800 okay or X whatever it is
thank god think it's a case Q but it's
also a six core 12 thread on the X
platform so it's this weird that you
could have a six core in a 12 core on
both platforms simultaneously yes I know
it's actually it's happened before with
quad cores but this first time it's kind
of happened but six core all right
enough is enough we're gonna do one test
live which is Cinebench then i'm gonna
run through all of my tests overclock it
and then run through my tests again so
that you can see exactly what you get
free money on both sides
one other thing to point out too is this
is not a stacked test where I've got an
air cooler on the AMD build and I've got
a water cooler on the intel build if you
guys have been following any of this and
you know that Intel runs hot 7700 k was
hot the latest CPUs on the X platform
next to 99 and stuff is hot because they
stopped soldering and they're using
thermal interface material between the
heat spreaders now and temperatures were
my limiting factor of how far I could
overclock this on air but temperatures
were not what was limiting risin risin
architecture is what was limiting rise
in so I still had Headroom and
temperatures lots of it left over over
here on the air cooler where the Intel I
had no choice but to take the air cooler
off and put on water just to keep it
under control so we're at stock speeds
right now and we're just gonna do our 15
first 8 core 16 thread
versus six core 12 thread let's see if I
can time this three two one go
that stock speeds this one boosted up to
4.7 that one's sitting at 3.5 looks like
we're up to 3.8 for a second but came
back down to 3.5 but it certainly looks
like that's hard to tell who's winning
we should to be honest we've got a
massive clock differential though it's
almost a gigahertz faster over here than
over there so we got a 15 27 versus a
1559 so both of those scores that's
that's what that's negligent negligible
you're not going to notice a real-world
difference but that's just one test
right what I'm gonna do right now is I'm
gonna go through quite a few tests and
then we'll come back and we'll talk
about
so it's stock speeds it should be no
surprise that the 8700 K best did the
1700 x mean one it's more expensive even
though the 1700 X has more cores core
count isn't everything there's a few
reasons why it one at stock tests and
we'll talk about this because if you're
running a rise in the system there's
some things you need to be aware of one
make sure your system is running high
performance mode on the rise in you know
power options go into high performance
that's important of course we were set
there but the 8700 K is running anywhere
between 900 megahertz to 8 gigahertz a
whole gigahertz faster then the rise end
system and a lot of this stuff core
speed is king versus core count and as
we move into these high core count CPUs
it's gonna take time for programs
starting to catch up again it's kind of
this leapfrog thing right where high
core count I say hi core count dual-core
and quad-core CPUs came out about a
decade ago and then programs had to
catch up and then they caught up and now
we have more cores but the programs
aren't leveraging all those cores so the
core speed matters a lot it's one of the
things to you need to be aware of if
you're running a risin system and that
is memory speed it's no surprise that
memory speed matters with Rison this has
been tested over and over and over but
if you just build the system out right
and you boot into your BIOS check this
out our frequency as you can see is
running on the memory at 2144
technically 2133 and the problem is that
the default base clock speed of ddr4 is
21 33 even like these sticks of RAM I
have in here right here are 3000
megahertz dibs on both sides but both
both of these systems are running at 21
33 because that's the base clock so a
lot of people will build up their system
put it together and just boot it and
leave it because they're like oh I don't
want to overclock I'm afraid but then
they buy this fast RAM and they don't
realize that they're running at the base
clock so we're gonna do right now is
we're gonna go ahead and overclock I
have actually got a profile this is a
3.9 gigahertz overclock profile we're
also running at 29 33 on the megahertz
that's a on the memory that's a big deal
I couldn't actually get it to post
anything faster unfortunately rise
does like fast memory so if you can get
that above 3000 you're only gonna
benefit yourself we're gonna go ahead
and boot that and I'm gonna do now is
also going to go into the Intel system
and I'm gonna overclock this now I had a
choice I had to make with this my chip
is capable of a 5.2 gigahertz with a lot
of volts and gets kind of hot 5.1 it's
capable with it with an AI oh so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run five gigs
because again I'm not sure that's a very
clicky keyboard right get into the BIOS
okay I'm not sure if I was sent to
cherry-pick CPU so I'm not gonna run the
Mac's capable of what I can get on this
although I'm seeing reports of most
people hitting 5 gigahertz or beyond and
up to 30 600 megahertz on the memory
what I'm gonna do is I'm trying to pick
something more middle of the ground
because what you're gonna notice with
with the rise in here by the way is it
power cycles three times whenever I play
this overclock so it's it's kind of
picky but it will it will work anyway
come back over here so just like I
mentioned we're running at 21 33 even
though we have 3,000 megahertz sticks of
RAM in there this is really easy to
overclock it's just put in a multiplier
so in this case I put in 50 Ram is
running at 3200 megahertz and then we've
got CPU voltage I'm running at one point
three six oh I can actually run that at
one point three five because that was
for my voltage for the five point one so
we're just gonna leave that DRAM voltage
is good other than that that's the only
settings we change with the exception of
I'm gonna also don't you know what we're
fine that's it that's all we change
multiplier Ram speed voltage just those
three things and you can achieve five
gigs on 8700 K pretty easily something
else you'll also notice though is I am
running the air cooler over here at 100%
I've got Vardar fans on there which are
high static pressure fans we've got a
ton of air movement there I could feel
the air all the way back here that's why
we're not having any cooling issues on
air even though as you can see right
here come on
we are overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz it
says three point eight nine but is
overclocked three point nine and over
here on the Intel system as you can see
we are running 4.96 or technically five
gigs but we're gonna do now is we're
gonna run through all those tests again
and see what happens to the comparative
results when overclocking is applied
especially memory because we only went
up 500 megahertz on the Rison system we
went up about 300 megahertz
no yeah about 300 megahertz on the Intel
system so not a huge jump in terms of
both but the memory speed was a big deal
on both
so as expected overclocking both CPUs
got us higher scores but we still had a
pretty you know consistent interval
between both CPUs but I still think you
know I can't this isn't one of those
videos where I can say here's a clear
winner because it really depends on what
you're doing the platform's are not
created equal right there's still some
issues with raid and rise in and
although in AMD is making good strides
in getting more native raid support on
Verizon you're still gonna get a more
fluid experience I think on the Intel
platform with things like raid support
vrock and obtain I mean that's that's
kind of a hard sell I don't know if
anyone that would necessarily run out
and buy intel specifically because of
those things but the couple of things I
want to talk about here that the the
premiere render obviously it favors core
clock right core clock we've known this
for a while you add more cores Adobe
doesn't care too much you add core speed
man does it go through the roof it's one
of the reasons why the 79 60 X I'm using
upstairs right now when I do my
rendering with 16 cores and 32 threads
it's really not any faster than my 7900
X which was a 10 core 20 thread so yeah
it just doesn't make that much of a
difference it has everything to do with
speed now the same thing kind of goes
with the 1080i is as well where we
actually saw in both systems when you
overclock the CPU you get better scores
in things like tomb raider and 3d mark
and all of that because even though CPUs
are fast meant that the top-of-the-line
GPUs they're still so fast we're even
something like an eighty seven hundred
KS I really don't want to call it
bottlenecking
but there was an improvement to be had
by increasing the core speed of the chip
one of the things I've kind of noticed
though as I've been playing about the
8700 K comparing it to CPUs I've gotten
to look at in the past like the 7700 the
6700 K is we saw a huge jump in this
generation not only in the core count
but also core speed right 5 gigahertz
which is kind of the magic number like
oh my god 5 gigahertz is never gonna
happen on the current process or the
current silicon is not gonna be capable
of 5 gigs and suddenly now we're seeing
5 gigs with no problem now it makes me
honestly feel like that it's the
industry was indeed holding out or at
least Intel was I mean it kind of seems
that way we're seeing 5 gigs 6 cores 12
threads no problem whatsoever
heck even my 79 80 XE almost hit five
gigs 4.9 no problem so at the end of the
day either either side really has
compelling arguments on which CPU
platform you should go with AMD is more
relevant today than it's ever been
relevant enough to where you're seeing
the kind of improvement increase in one
generation like you just saw right here
with Intel pulled in sooner than the
original roadmap because now we have
competition in the space so I'm not
gonna sit here and say you should buy
Intel or you should buy AMD the Rison
system is still one of my favorites at
this price point because this is $60
less than that so that really makes this
kind of look like a real competitor when
yeah sure it was being beaten by the
8700 K but it should have been that's a
more expensive CPU and you get more
cores here to play around with if you're
looking at doing things like virtual
machines if you just want to do anything
that requires core count over core speed
then maybe this is the more compelling
option but the point of this video
wasn't to walk in here and say buy this
one buy this one right here although you
can you know Amazon links and stuff
description below it there's too many
variables to say which one's right for
you what I will say though it's it's
exciting that we finally have compelling
platforms on both sides that's the
reason why this exists today
don't forget this exists today because
this did so well otherwise you'd still
be waiting until 2018 for that so market
competition happened and we have a
direct result now we're now hopefully
AMD can answer because that's what needs
to happen anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video let me know what
kind of test you think we should do on
CPU CPU is a hard thing to test GPUs are
easy run your games compare them but
CPUs are kind of tough there's a lot of
different workloads so let me know what
you guys think I should include in this
and when we do the 8,400
I'll make sure to include that anybody
thinks for watching today's video as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
