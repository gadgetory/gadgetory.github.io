doing a long awaited video way overdue
but yeah we're finally getting around to
that and that is the complete
overclocking guide to Pascal that's your
GTX 1060 1070 1080 Titan XP and
potentially in the future a GTX 1080 Ti
which everyone seems to swear is right
around the corner but that doesn't
really matter today because it's still
gonna ply to any of the Pascal GPUs both
right now and future so with that said
let's go ahead and show you how to pull
the most juice out of a GT X 1080 both
with fps and power consumption and get
all the FPS hell yeah man we want we
want all the FPS we want to literally
crack our screen because we are just
sending so many frames to it if you if
you don't want that honey you've come to
the wrong video man with its unique
freeform modular system the new master
casemaker v from cooler master allows
unparalleled flexibility with its
adjustable internal layout and exterior
customization options learn more about
how you can start customizing your own
case by following the link down in the
description so this video might end up
being a little bit longer than the norm
and for that very reason I want people
to be able to come back and reference
this video as a source for refreshing
their your minds later on if you try to
change your overclock so with that said
I'm gonna be putting timestamps down in
the description of the various chapters
of this video so that you can come back
and watch it later or skip ahead now if
you already know some of the basics and
you just curious as to what kind of
results we get today for the sake of
this demo so with that out of the way
let's move forward you're going to need
some tools here obviously you're needing
a Pascal GPU this isn't going to work on
AMD guys sorry it's also not going to
work on the Maxwell or older GPUs this
is purely Pascal overclocking guide
some of what you'll see will work on
Maxwell but the GPU boost three stuff
we're going to talk about nope not at
all so make sure you got a Pascal GPU if
you want to get Pascal knowledge if you
want fill your brain with some Pascal
yeah all right you're also going to need
an overclocking utility the two major
ones are msi afterburner and EVGA
precision XOC I am using precision X
precision X OC is pretty polished
compared to when it first launched so
we'll be using that for the sake of
today's video
and then I'm using heaven benchmark just
for this video but if I were actually
trying to find max over clocks right now
I would be checking out like 11
different programs because you'll find
you might be stable in one and not the
other
causing you to have to reduce your
clocks until you can find stability in
your entire gaming library so keep that
in mind if you're testing and you get a
crash in heaven but you don't get a
crash in Valley or 3dmark
that's normal you just have to you have
to dial in that overclock that works in
all of your programs and that's half the
fun and it could take hours days weeks
months sometimes to find that max
overclock the first thing you going to
do here is you're going to right click
on your desktop go to Nvidia control
panel and by default we're going to be
changing the power mode because by
default it is set to optimal power which
means give me some good performance but
let's make things nice and efficient
well if you're watching this video you
don't care about efficiency you care
about all that fps bragging rights so
we're going to switch that to prefer
maximum performance you'll hit apply
mines and up there because already had
it there now you're ready to go you've
got Nvidia on the right page here we
want more power I don't care about all
the watts
screw the Watts we want the powers so
this is precision X say hi get
acquainted you got me spending some time
in here for a while especially when
you're finding your max overclocks let's
go ahead and talk about some things here
so you understand and get some basic
things set up on the left here these are
your menu hot links you've got hardware
monitoring and this is where you can
monitor various things happening with
your card I these are the things I
recommend monitoring by the way to the
very basics power percentage that's your
power your power target memory clock if
you're going to be overclocking your
memory GPU usage we want to make sure
we're under load or what our load
percentage is GPU voltage that's kind of
a given power limit this isn't set to
either 0 or 1 so this is an on or off
monitor if this ever hits one it means
your power percentage maxed out and the
card ended up throttling itself due to
power limit so we just want to see if we
ever hit one chances are you won't
especially if you have an AI B card or
something above a Founders Edition
because they give you more power
percentage to play around with so this
never hits one GPU clock it's kind of
the whole point of this video and our
temperatures obviously we want all the
FPS but we
want to blow up our graphics card at
least not yet so we want to go ahead and
make sure that we keep the temperatures
under control memory usage not important
for overclocking only important if you
want to know how much memory is being
used in your games it's always fun to
play around that at different
resolutions to see how it responds and
then of course fan speed that's only
going to matter if you have an
air-cooled card if you're doing this
with a water-cooled Pascal card this is
not really going to matter a whole lot
especially if it's a full water block
because then you have no fan so there's
no point monitoring zero all the time
now you can change what's being
monitored right here by a couple of
things you can click OSD settings up
here in the menu or you can just
right-click in the graph and then go to
properties and this will show you
everything that you're monitoring so
these are all the possible things you
could monitor a lot of is fluff you
don't really need to look at and then if
you want to show up in the monitor you
make sure your graphics card is
highlighted here however many graphics
cards you have you can monitor each one
individually obviously I only have one
GT X 1080 classified in here right now
so I've got it showing up in the monitor
which is here and on screen display
which is the overlay inside of the games
so you can turn it on for both or for
one or vice versa however you want it to
be and you can also change the color of
each individual item inside of the color
palette right there so you can have
different things be different colors but
it's labeled in OSD choice I just leave
it white not that big of a deal and then
if you look down here you can toggle OSD
on and off by hitting f12 or you can
rebind that key to something else the K
here stands for K Boost we'll talk about
that in a minute it's something you can
use to find your stable overclock or at
least find out what your max clock
attempt is going to be before you start
but I don't recommend using it full time
but we'll talk about that when we're
ready over here you can obviously see
the graphics cards that are currently
installed have 110 a Declassified in
there it doesn't say classified but
trust me it is you can tell because this
number is going to go pretty high right
there and then for those of you with
air-cooled cards like this one this is
going to be a big deal for you right
here this is where you can control your
fan if you click the curve button it'll
bring up another menu you can play with
your fan curve right here you can make
it really sharp you can make it you know
quiet obviously if you're overclocking
your card we want we are sacrificing
noise for thermals so get used to it
it's going to be loud it needs to be
loud you want to keep it cool but these
fans are
meant to run fast so I recommend going
to a hundred percent if you can avoid it
but with that said you are going to be
sacrificing thermals or noise for
thermals so just expect it so looking at
the gauge right here you've got your GPU
clock obviously that's the bread and
butter of all this you've got your
memory clock this tends to freak out a
lot of beginners because they think that
oh my god I'm supposed to have ten
thousand but it's only showing five we
remember guys it is DDR which stands for
double data rate so we are going to see
this number times two so obviously my
effective memory speed right now is ten
thousand ten megahertz not five thousand
five so you got to keep that in mind
whatever number you see here times it by
two and that is your effective voltage
in millivolts and of course our a GPU
temp it's kind of warm in this room
right now so that numbers a little bit
higher than I'd like it to be but
whatever so moving forward there are two
ways that you can overclock your Pascal
graphics card you can just do it
manually here by playing with the
sliders or you can do it using GPU boost
three a GPU boost is nothing more than a
curve that says at various voltage
ratings change my offset or my
additional clock speed I want to add to
the GPU boost to a certain number okay
now I know somewhere out there just went
what what what the heck does that even
mean well here is the factory basic
curve right here you can see it is just
like it sounds it is a curve it is not
straight so what that means is as we get
up here in the higher voltages which by
the way that does cut out at 1093 on
pascal even though they show you can go
all the way to eleven sixty two uh
that's not true you can you have to stop
at ten ninety three nothing above that
is going to take any sort of effect so i
wouldn't worry about trying to tune up
to eleven sixty three it's not going to
happen but as I said it is based on a
curve so if I want to start overclocking
the max clock what I can do is I can
start clicking a little bit higher and
as you can see it adds an offset
whatever the value is that I'm clicking
so however high I'm going above that 200
megahertz 175 125 that is going to be
applied throughout the entire curve on
the basic setting if I go to linear
wherever I click on the highest setting
it's going to create a linear line which
is not going to be a curve like this so
this is probably going to lead to
crashing because you're more likely not
going to be able to add
hundred megahertz to your boost clock
that's that's just not going to happen
or you can do it manually where you set
each individual square and it takes a
lot of time it's not really all that
necessary so to understand how all this
works you have to do a base test so for
that let's go ahead and start up heaven
benchmark we've got our OSD on and let's
go ahead and see what the clock speeds
are let's let it load up here let's let
it gain a little bit of heat and then
let's see what the numbers are you're
not going to know how effective your
overclock is if you don't least have a
base run alright so looking over here at
the left these are the things we're
monitoring you can see our power usage
here is only sitting in the high 70s low
80s
our GPU clock is 2012 our memory clock
is five thousand six or in this case ten
thousand twelve our GPU temperatures at
52 I do have a higher fan curve on there
so that's why you're not it's not going
to go too much higher than about sixty
our memory usage is only a little over a
gig our GPU voltage is at 1.06 three and
my fan speed is at seventy six and as I
mentioned earlier this power limit ever
hits one it means we hit a hundred
percent of our power limit telling us
that we had to throttle based on power
so what you're going to do now is you're
just going to kind of observe you're
going to see what's happening here you
see our voltage is already dropped down
to 1.0 for for from 1.0 6-3 why is that
well the temperatures climbing as this
number goes up this number right here is
going to go down as well as the voltage
because remember the voltage is tied to
the clock so as the clock comes down due
to temperature the voltage will come
down with it that's how it controls its
temperature now 56 57 58 C is not a lot
but remember that that control it's
dynamic it is going to slowly adjust
itself as temperatures and power changes
it's not going to just be like a hard
sudden drop which would also give you a
hard sudden drop in frames per second
giving you a bad experience so what I
would honestly recommend is let this
thing loop for about 20 minutes to find
what your max numbers are with a base
run and then start adjusting from there
but I'm not going to wait 20 minutes I'm
going to go ahead and quit out of here
so if you want to see how the curve
effects things so then I would go over
here to the 1093 square which is
actually the fourth one over one two
three four and then I would just add
like let's say
a let's just go with a hundred megahertz
apply so now we've just applied that
curve so as you saw if we look over here
at our monitor our GPU clock went up to
twenty twelve or twenty twenty-five as
you can see in our max but then we
settled at nineteen eighty-seven we can
also give ourselves a little bit more
fan speed here
remember you're going to be sacrificing
noise for temperatures so now we've
already got our plus 100 let's go ahead
and start it up again
and just observe and this is what
overclocking with GPU boost or even your
manual settings is going to be a lot of
change this test change this test and if
you crash more than likely it'll either
just say the driver crashed or will hard
lock your system you just restart reach
Ange your settings and start again but
if you look at the core clock we already
hit twenty one hundred and twenty or
twenty one hundred one megahertz at one
point o5o volts by doing nothing more
than clicking that one little square
some people would be more than happy
with this and you're done
but that that that's not me that's
that's just not how I work I mean you
guys should know that by now
right so anyway you will let this loop
and loop and loop let the temperatures
equalize see where it settles out and
there you go now obviously that's not
good enough for me I like to push things
over here on the left hand side right
here you also have a voltage adjuster
where you can tell it add more voltage
now this right here I used to think what
I'm like what is this voltage percent
what is 100 percent mean well what that
means is as you guys saw on that last
test we only hit what 1.0 for 4 to 1.0
500 volts from the test before that 1.06
3 remember I told you 1.09 3 was the max
we didn't see that yet did we what this
little chart is saying right here is
allow the voltage to go percentage of
max being from where it's going to boost
to - how much farther it can go and in
this case it's only about 30 millivolts
so that putting it to 100 even though
it's red and it warned you like try not
to blow up your GPU this is saying allow
it to go to 100% of the available
voltage well since we have a curve here
that tells us allow the GPU to go higher
based on a curve if I up the voltage
what's going to happen
well let's apply it let's ramp up our
fans even higher just in case and let's
start it again let's see if we get more
core o'clock if you remember in the last
run we had a one hundred twenty one
hundred and one megahertz clock is it
going to go higher I don't know I only
did a plus one hundred offset but look
at that and went 220 114 and you can see
it's at one point oh six three volts see
that right here we're looking at OSD so
our fan speeds at 90 our temperatures
are well in check as you guys can see
there's your classified cooler with the
fan turned up it is pretty damn good
what you can see we just gained 13
megahertz or one core step it remember
it steps in 13s it's really kind of
strange but anyway we just gained one
step by doing two things we clicked a
square on the curve and we simply said
let the voltage go farther so as you can
see our voltage is now going to 1.0 7-5
1.08 1 and over time you you will see
that 1.09 3 and our core clock as you
can see right here is staying exactly
where we want we don't want it bouncing
around and stuff and so far that's not
what's happening now the longer we let
the test go it might drop down a step or
two as the temperatures reach the 60s
and here's what I'm gonna do I'm going
to go ahead and go to a manual setting
none of this matters to me I don't game
in this range I game up here so I'm just
going to let this stay factory and I'm
only going to adjust the high end and
I'm going to go plus 150 let's see what
happens with plus 150 it plus 100 got us
2114
what's plus 150 going to do so I just
went all the way across the match range
at plus 150 I guess we'll do a couple
steps we'll do a couple steps down to
like that so now it's just 150 across
the top and the only reason I did manual
is like I said I didn't want it to apply
that plus offset to the lower voltages
and frequencies because it's not that
important so I'm going to right now is
I'm going to try a plus 175 in my manual
range because I are in the manual curve
because I don't want the lower
frequencies to change I'm okay with the
lower frequencies just staying with the
stock boost but I did a plus 175 offset
on the 10:43 and higher frequency so
got to hit apply otherwise it won't save
and if you're curious as to what K
boosts does this button right here will
force the GPU to go to its max o'clock
even at idle so with that said let's go
ahead and see what plus 175 is going to
get us here on the GPU so it's
interesting here as you can see that
that's really just kind of chilling out
at 2114 now no matter what I do and the
voltage is still not going that much
farther so that's one of the reasons why
I'm not a huge fan of GPU boost so even
though I'm adding offset there as you
can see I added an offset of plus 175 it
still stayed the same when I did plus
100 earlier so that should be
seventy-five megahertz faster at the
very least so let's do this and let's go
back to default let's go be here to the
manual tab put this back up because we
need to keep our fan nice and fast
especially on hot days I'm going to
change the power target up to 130 I'm
gonna set the priority to temperature
them saying don't even start to throttle
this GPU until it's 91 C which it's
never going to hit so I'm gonna do here
is I'm going to do the same plus 175
offset and I'm going to hit apply
well now I'm kind of curious as to what
that offsets going to put me at is it
going to immediately crash it's going to
be way too high well if I hit K boost
that's going to force the card into max
o'clock speed at at the desktop or at
idle it's just going to go and as you
can see that's a 20 189 megahertz
overclock which I already know is not
going to work with this card so why
don't I try 150 and hit apply well you
can see it dropped down to 20 164 so
that's what I would use K boosts for you
can use that when doing benchmarks to
find your max overclock but I wouldn't
leave it there all the time because
you're always gonna run your your core
clock in your voltage as high as it
would go so I would turn that off now
that I get out of GPU boost which you
guys just saw no matter what I did to
that curve even in manual
I couldn't it wouldn't allow me to go
any farther than 20 114 which was really
disappointing so now I've taken manual
control which is the other part that I
already showed you on how you can
actually overclock your graphics card so
we saved our settings we got our fan
ramped up and let's go ahead and see
what happens so as you can see now in
heaven we're running at 20 164 megahertz
for
only 85% into the power limit so I could
have still left it at a hundred it's not
drawing more power by raising the power
limit it's just raising the limit but as
you can see we still haven't even pulled
a hundred percent of that 230 watt TDP
so right now if I'm at 80 percent of 230
I'm curious how much is this card
drawing it's probably realistically
drawing somewhere around 184 watts which
is really not it's only 4 watts higher
than what the founders te TDP is but you
can see that we did just step down 1 to
20 152 and this is kind of normal this
is the stuff you're going to see and
that you're going to experience when
you're doing your your overclocking now
why did it do that well look we're at
1.0 6 3 volts we're not a 1.0 9 3 like
we should be so what I want to go and
check right here is did I raise my
voltage nope
see the voltage is still sitting here at
0 so here we are now at 100% hit apply
hit run and what we should theoretically
see here now is a 1.09 3 volt they will
eventually get there after like maybe 30
seconds and it stays at 2164 so here we
are 21 64 and a voltage that 1.0 6 3 and
now we're stepped up to 1.0 1 or 0 8 1
and then you're going to see the 0.93 it
might might show 9 4 on this app but
we're going to notice here is that this
core speed is going to stay it's not
going to fluctuate so there it is you
can see now we're at 1.0 9 4 volts we're
pretty much pushing the card as hard as
it can go
temperatures just hit 60 61 it'll
probably balance out around 63 with the
fans at 90% with this level of overclock
now I can push it slightly farther if I
want but I know that this card isn't
stable above that because I've done lots
of testing with this card already I
already know for a fact that my card is
going to artifact now artifacts are
basically errors in the GPU rendering
it's if you be Greens triangles or black
lines or foot white flashes rainbow
colors anything if you see any of that
even just a little bit then you need to
back it off just until that goes away
but that is basically how you overclock
the Pascal
GPU the memory overclocking is exactly
the same as it always was you can add an
offset and I happen to know for a fact
that most most of the 1080 and 1070
cards can handle a plus 500 on the
memory which is actually a pretty big
deal but guys that's it that's what you
have to tweak that's what you have to
play around with don't get too stingy
with your fan curve you're going to be
sacrificing acoustics for thermals just
get used to it hope you have a case
that's quite enough and can provide
enough air flow for your GPU to stay
cool but you can gain a lot of
additional fps you can typically see
about an extra 5 or 6 fps in a benchmark
by just simply playing with some of
these sliders so it's kind of a big deal
and it's works with all graphics cards
you just don't get GPU boost 3.0 with
anything that's not a Pascal card
alright guys thanks for watching hope
this video helped you guys you guys been
asking me how to overclock a Pascal I
hope this answers all those questions if
it doesn't geez I'm sorry the video is
way too long as it is but it's time to
go
hit me up put down you put down in the
comments what your overclocks are what
card you're running what brand and what
model so that others can kind of get an
idea of what they might see typically
you're going to find 10 80s can hit
about 20 50 you're going to find that 10
seventies clock a little bit higher
because has less CUDA cores hitting
nearly 2200 in many cases but with that
said guys put your results down in the
comments hit me up on Twitter share them
with me I will share them with the world
and together we can raise the FPS Q the
the Sarah McLachlan music alright guys
see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
