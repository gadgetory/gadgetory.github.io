more desirable well you're in luck
because right now you can own your very
own Jace 2 cent swag and immediately be
the cool kid on the block max out your
sex appeal by following the link down
below so what you guys see right here is
way more hours worth of effort and money
hours of money whatever it's it's a it's
a form of measurement there's way more
time and effort into this then I really
want to admit but Steve said in his
video but if I don't have time for this
and he's the motherfucking father of
time well J if you don't have enough
time for this you can call me mother
fucking father time because I'll make
time all day to beat your scores well to
that I say if Steve is the father of
time then I am the mother of invention
you know what I mean something I'm not a
mom that's okay I digress
what you see right here is literally
every crazy experiment we have done in
here kind of come to a final form of an
Octopussy orgy of parts that is about to
decimate Steve score oh yes you guys
thought I was sitting idle had you all
believed in I gave up and I never quit I
never quit sometimes I quit what I'm
really bored that's okay that's besides
I don't get bored this one was fun let's
talk about this setup let's do a live
bench run so you guys can see that not
only are we gonna beat Steve score we're
not gonna do it with a deal into the CPU
we're not using any shunt mods and we're
not doing any crazy profile switching
during the test we are simply going to
turn it on push go not touch a damn
thing
and watch it beat his score okay so
let's take a look at the slush box first
we went as far as we could with AC we're
still using it as you can see over here
we'll talk about that in a second I've
got to eke a 480 cool strain PE
radiators is a 40 mil thick radiators
two of them and they are in this is
actually freezing cold water this is
just melted ice right now we will be
adding more ice there's so much coldness
in here but as you can see I've got them
running in series and we've got some
other tubes in here so we'll talk about
that in a second as well here's the
issue with a slush box unless you keep
it flowing like you have to keep it
flowing through the radiator just like
air has to flow through a radiator to
make it work the other problem is if
it's just sitting on the floor of the
radiator you can't get water to flow
through it because it's sitting through
the floor or the floor the cooler but
rather you can't get water flowing
through it if it's just sitting there so
what I've done and I'm not sure Phil's
probably be able to see this I actually
use long screws on the bottom side of
the rad so it's actually sitting about
this far off the ground what I've got
here is this tube and I'll kind of show
this this is running through a little L
adapter here going down into the bottom
of the rad underneath those screws
because that is now getting jacked up
there we go you see these other tubes
that are going to Steve does this so you
have these other tubes going in here
this is part of a circulation pump you
can see it down there on the ground it's
not actually running right now this is
actually a transfer pump this is what
you would use to move fluid from one
thing to another as you can see I've
wired it up it's very very wet because
of condensation but I've got this wired
up to a power switch which I can turn it
on and off it's very loud
and it is way more than we need it's a
tenth of a horsepower now we've got this
hooked up to it right here as well this
is actually a siphon that is set on top
of the top of the radiator and this is
going to be pulling water through the
radiators to get it to the top now the
reason why we're doing that is we have
the return line on the bottom of the red
as I said and this is pulling water from
the top of the red so we are forcing it
to cycle through the radiator and by
doing such we are able to get our loop
temperature inside of the system down to
about 0.8 C 0.8 C the rest of the system
hasn't really changed other than it
added a second 1600 watt power supply
for just the GPUs the CPU is running on
its own power supply we've got some fans
there going and pushing air down on the
vrm so the graphics cards you're still
my founders edition based or reference
based PCB EVGA x-c ultras I've got a fan
over there pushing air onto my g.skill
memory that's the only thing that's
changed is the memories changed to
g.skill 38 66 ddr4 so we're gonna put
ice in there now cool it down and then
we are going to beat Steve's record on
camera for you guys now I've gone
through well over a hundred pounds of
ice just to get to Steve does this now I
know why he's always going like this in
his videos I've gone through well over a
hundred pounds of ice in fact this is 60
pounds of ice just today so I probably
use 2 or 300 pounds of ice just to
acquire the settings that I'm currently
running and the trial and error and
experimentation trust when I say it is
extremely frustrating I'm eating herion
I want to talk about something real
quick and condensation there is a
serious amount of protection on this
board a lot of people just use Vaseline
and that's good too but I didn't want to
have to deal with cleaning that off so I
actually used neat eraser which you can
get from any craft store it's actually
used in art for removing things like
charcoal pencil and stuff off of
drawings but it also can but the neat
eraser can actually be squished and
stretched and pushed into all the cracks
and crevices which we have used to
surround both GPUs created a barrier of
the
and anywhere the block could possibly
drift we actually have insulation foam
or insulating foam around on top of that
we then have blue shop towels around all
of that and blue shop towels wrapped
around all of the fittings or underneath
them to catch any drips as you guys can
see we also have insulation on all of
our tubing which is specifically meant
for condensation and stuff like AC lines
so we actually don't have any issues
with drips or condensation anywhere
around our components that matter now
condensation is gonna build up on the
metal parts not so much the plastic
parts so things like our plastic
couplers are not going to be problems
when it comes to condensation but of
course condensation could drip off
somewhere else we don't want it that's
one of the reasons why we don't hang the
motherboard upside down when it's right
side up like it is we control where the
fluid goes when it's upside down it
could run along and drip somewhere else
making a bigger problem we're currently
running at 28 C on the CPU in the BIOS
which has a small load on it 51
multiplier or 5.1 gigahertz all core so
it's already higher than Steve's but
you'll see as my CPU score still lacks
behind his a little bit he's getting
that through better means I guess I
don't know I'm running a 34 mesh zero
offset obviously on a V X and we are
running quite a bit of voltage I'm
running 1.4 for 6 on the CPU 2.1 on the
VIN we are running 1.3 adaptive on V
mesh and then all the typical voltage is
the stuff we showed no other videos 4000
megahertz memory 1.65 volts on that 14
14 14 28 on the timings which is
actually tighter than Steve was getting
running a 30 on the teeth ah 15 cwl I
think that's factory then I'm running a
275 a refresh cycles and the 32767
refresh interval which basically means
use up all the memory before it
refreshes anything helps with the test
so it doesn't dump memory and start
restoring in the middle of a test that's
something I did in fact learned through
Steve I knew about memory timings but I
didn't know about that
I believe Steve learned it through
Richie through his forums or patreon so
big circle of knowledge here like a
circle jerk of knowledge it's gonna
spooge all over our system and hopefully
get us a better score oh and it froze
right there you motherfuckers like did
you've seen how many times I've run this
benchmark and that's just
passing this ship whoa a little bit Oh
your mother so Steve thought that he
could beat me but little did he know
that around here we don't give up 3.6 C
on the water oh and it just crashed but
first listen to our sponsor message
today we are on a 1.8 C it just
restarted we almost made it maybe I'll
try it one more time the ice is like
literally melting why it's melted that's
the thing now so
oh it just restarted on me so many
cutaways in this video I could not stand
the fact that you guys could not see a
successful run all in one take I
couldn't live with that
the score is mine and it's legit but I
couldn't stand that you guys couldn't
see that so yeah I've about another
hundred pounds of ice I changed my
cooler setup it's got a drain that way I
can drain water out of it a little bit a
little bit bigger bigger volume of water
I'm currently running 0.8 C in the loop
that's the water temp in the loop
obviously the water temp in the cooler
is zero point like zero actually I put
the probe there it's a zero point zero
but here's the test I'm gonna let it run
I'm a back away from the computer we
actually think the mic might be causing
some interference with it so you're just
gonna hear me talk and you won't have to
see this this creepy image Hey
so anyway I'm not doing any cheating I'm
not doing any profile switching I'm not
not taking any any of those cop-outs
you know because you mice my settings
are stable enough I don't have to I
don't have to sit here and watch the
test run and be like oh here comes this
part where I've got to enable this
profile because I'm Steve and I asked
the cheat no no no my settings are solid
what's gonna let him go we're let them
speak for themselves and now just four
more trash talking at the end when you
guys see who the true leader of the
water-cooling overclockers is we all
know the Bower in kingpin and all those
guys are the true winners so but this is
that's besides the point I digress
I'd also like to point out that this
test is extremely important to keep your
eyes on the prize you're gonna I'm gonna
rhyme all the time because this is
important there are no artifacts in this
test for me well Steve talked about
artifacting and you know parts falling
off your car to drag race you still win
if you cross the finish line first even
if you don't have half your car be much
better it is to win when you have all
your car yeah yeah yeah artifacting not
a micro pop cab you Larry Steve I will
say gt2 though is it's a hard test to
run it is is the bane of my existence
this part right here where it comes up
and around the horse and then goes over
to this little like satellite oh man
this part usually is where it crashes if
it's gonna for artifacts really bad or
stutters
know that though did you see any
artifacts yeah I didn't yeah that looks
pretty damn smooth oh that just don't
crash on the CPU testing please who
sprinkle water holy water ten Hail Marys
max temp right now 55 Celsius on a non
deleted CPU come on baby come on baby
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go all right
would we get what do we get come on come
on come on
fifteen 287 not my highest by any means
you guys saw that the test completed
just fine though so what I'm gonna do
right now is I'm gonna go and show you
guys what the highest I actually
achieved with was and that was a fifteen
thousand three hundred and seven I'll
take it and with that I'll take number
two hmm so up there where it says
congratulations for surpassing 1 million
subscribers let's just pretend that says
J's two cents congratulations for
surpassing that cheater gamers Nexus now
I'm gonna go and take back my single
card victory by even farther because
lioness beat me and then I beat lioness
by a little bit without even trying now
we're gonna really we're just gonna
we're gonna drive Linus into the ground
like a railroad spike
