been watching an awful lot of reruns of
Monster Garage and I've had this idea
playing around in my head that I wanted
to do and it's got absolutely no purpose
or reason it's not even anything
informational the loop is moving anyway
doesn't have anything informational
about it I just want to do it and that
is taking for 480 millimeter radiators
and basically turning a box fan into a
massive overkill external radiator
solution and of course we're gonna test
it but I guess one thing we can prove in
this video is you can definitely exceed
a point of diminishing returns in terms
of your cooling efficiency but you don't
we gotta do we gotta go get some parts
and stuff so yeah I think we need to I
think we need to switch over to this
little guy right here
anything anything hey all right feel
chip
today's video is sponsored by audible
what better time than the summer to
enjoy a good book whether it be
self-help technology fiction in fact I'm
gonna be checking out a book called
soonish it's basically ten emerging
technologies that will improve and/or
ruin everything
and it's by Kelly and Zack whiner Smith
it takes a look at some emerging tech
which I find very very interesting but
the summertime is a perfect time to
enjoy a good book cuz we're gonna be
doing more traveling more sitting around
enjoying some lemonade and the
summertime and right now if you sign up
using my link in the description below

keep
so what you guys waiting for take
audible with you anywhere you go this
summer don't forget to use my link in
the description below or you can just
text jeez 2 cents - 500 500 to get
started today so the box fans have 20
inch blades which is perfect because the
square area of those radiators is 21
inches and so I think it's gonna be
perfect on the actual box family to
build a frame for it but yeah we'll
figure it out
here I feel like there's like an idea
that comes along it's just so bad you
shouldn't do it I was talking about del
Taco
oh dude yes nobody talking about I'm
probably doing this wrong and that's
okay
these fans are not exactly known for
being high pressure
right athletes say that so I've decided
not to use that sheetmetal because it is
too big but check this out we just had
to go with a pool setup it's actually
sucked the radiators too of the back of
the fan and just kind of give you guys
representation of how much pressure
there is there's we're gonna do we're
gonna see if we can't maybe make a frame
to hold these together and then I'm just
I'll just tape it to the fan I don't
care well my idea here is we've got
plenty of this corner stock or this else
top to where I can try and make a frame
like a box frame for this about 27 and a
half inches it leftover and I only need
20 and a half inches of length ladies
that we like to do the eyeball
arithmetic around here
congratulations you made a square
no I didn't it's a rectangle oh yeah how
did you make it for finally we have
another one here I meant to do that see
I was making feet and went perfectly
fine the first time cousin cut it off
okay so rivet gun broke which is like
totally screwing our project and now we
need to get cut off wheels and stuff of
the dremel for that to snows this was a
stupid idea okay I admit it heavy duty
cutting wheels Itanium bits a deeper bit
more sharpies that's how it's supposed
to work I said Starbucks now we just got
to put it all together and also to last
time many of you even though I called it
out myself or mad that I didn't have
temperature probes we actually have a
temperature probe right there on the
pump and is gonna monitor our fluid temp
because what we're looking for here is
to see how much the fluid temps actually
change under load I'm not entirely sure
how many watts a 480 can displace but I
want to guess that we've probably got
2,000 watts worth of cooling capacity
here that means there's nothing this
system with a 1080i and an 8700 k can
throw at it that this wouldn't be able
to handle so there is that smell hmm mm
mortar okay so here's the flow in here
out in out in out
just like fill the saying skip one like
I was and filter that's okay it's really
sturdy though
I'm okay so we're gonna get this filled
and then obviously we'll come back into
our temperature testing that's what the
last eight hours that we've been working
on this so far is lit up too okay so the
room temp here is 71 Fahrenheit that's
twenty one point six six 7c so we've got
the system up and running and let's see
what it's idling at all right so this is
the ambient temp in here right now
twenty one point six sixty seven this is
the flu attempt twenty one point seven
so what does that mean our fluid at
least with nothing being put into it
it's running at ambient no surprise
there the fan is actually on low right
now we've got three settings low medium
and high we're gonna do our first test
on low but in case you guys were curious
about what kind of air flow we're
actually getting on this so we'll go
ahead and start with a cpu test I really
think it's a moot point we actually
calculated it well filled it I guess
twenty-five hundred watts of heat
dissipation it's actually twenty-eight
hundred watts of heat dissipation this
chip is about 125 Watts when overclocked
when was ambient 21-6 I think the AC
kicked on to regulate air out there it
is twenty one six so it's been running
for ten minutes and 36 seconds and our
current is at twenty three point seven
so just over two degrees but check this
out look most of our temps still reach
the 80s and mid 80s on our 8700 k really
shows why you need to delete these
things because even with this much
cooling you can see it still gets pretty
warm but this was also on the lowest
setting so here's what we're gonna do
we're gonna run it for five more minutes
now on the max setting and I want to see
if it comes back down five more minutes
and we only went up like what point
three degrees so we're still twenty four
point one Celsius under load
yeah the CPU not enough to stress this
so now we're going to move over to GPU
because we know GPU puts way more heat
into the loop we're gonna use
superposition we're gonna do 1080p
extreme this is a 1080p monitor and we
are going to just let this run on a loop
now and see what happens to our
temperatures I guess we didn't need to
let it cool down it's doing it on its
own twenty three point nine
26 Celsius under load here in super
position on 1080p extreme and we are of
course overclocked Yuka's here at they
were running out 2012 it's still coming
down look at this so you know the drill
we're gonna let it run or let it do its
test and we'll see what happens
well the temperatures are still coming
down 23.2 and our GPU temperatures still
sitting at 26 C under load this is
colder under load then most systems are
at idle we have got this probably as
close to ambient temperature as we can
get if you guys have any doubt that this
system is working watch what happens
when I turn off the pump watch the
temperature right there 28:33 3741 45:48
GPU boost is like oh my god we're dying
and now once I turn the pump back on
watch the temperature okay obviously
it's working now what about if we turn
the fan off and this shows you still the
effectiveness of passive cooling of this
much radiator it will go up about point
one degree every like three or four
seconds or five seconds
there we go six seconds I don't know but
look at our GPU temperature still
sitting at 28 C under load now we are
just passively cooled the pump is
flowing obviously through these 480 by
480 rad it actually went down 0.1 we're
still under 30 C well passively cooled
that is insane still 71 Fahrenheit just
to show you guys we were dealing with
very consistent temperatures and we're
doing this part in one takes you guys
can see that the test is still going but
it's actually 7:15 p.m. at night right
now it is still going we've had heav'n
running now for two hours two solid
hours we will show you the graph here in
a second coolant temperature is at
twenty two point six
that is one Celsius above ambient
remember ambient was twenty one point
six six seven Celsius one C above
ambient our GPU is still sitting at 26
Celsius still running at two thousand
and twelve megahertz if we look at our
and thus I have to run a graph you will
see that this thing has not been stopped
and well pretty much in forever and
there is our temperature look at just
how flat that is right there and check
out our GPU boost
we've never even fluctuated once so what
can you take away from this video well
you can definitely get your components
to ambient temperature I mean do you
need to know thanks for grabbing that
fella do you need to reduce it to
ambient temperature no but why the heck
not this was only a 16 dollar box panic
fact phil was like I don't think it's
gonna work because the blades are so
separated the pressure is not gonna be
very good mr. CFM fans not pressure fans
Jay yeah quite me Phil anyway with that
said guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching today's video this was just a
fun little experiment to see what would
happen
Phil doesn't want to take it apart he
wants to just disconnect a radiator and
leave it filled probably because it
sounds like his name I don't know I
digress I've lost my mind we've spent
way too much time on this today guys
thanks for watching if you enjoyed this
project please give it a thumbs up if
you didn't like it well you should still
give it a thumbs up because I cut myself
today but that's how things go this is
derivative directly from comments of
people that have suggestions when I said
what should we do with our crazy
summertime and temperatures and water
cooling videos this is one of them so if
you have any suggestions for us and
things that we should try comment down
below hit me up on Twitter or Instagram
you would have seen us behind the scenes
building this on Instagram so make sure
you guys are following there but give me
your suggestions we'll do the best we
can to implement them thanks for
watching guys and I will see you in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
