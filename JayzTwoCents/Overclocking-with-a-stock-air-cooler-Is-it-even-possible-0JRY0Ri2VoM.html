gonna move forward with some risin
coverage here regarding cooling because
cooling is one of those things that even
if you aren't overclocking your computer
you can never go wrong with having more
cooling than you need so why even you no
chance it which is why the stock coolers
that typically come with your CPUs
they're good for testing they're good
for getting the system up and running
but usually people will opt to get an
inexpensive tower cooler like the hyper
212 Evo from Coolermaster or even an AI
oh so like NZXT or fractal design cooler
master or whatever because they just
want a little bit more cooling than what
stock can offer them but AMD when they
were when they launched Rison last year
launched the Wraiths cooler which was
just getting rave reviews I'm sorry
through views rated reviews as to being
a great factory cooler well this year
they stepped it up with the 2000 series
even further and offered the prism
cooler with the 2700 X so today we're
going to use the prism cooler and see
just how much cooling you're actually
getting with it and can you even
overclock by using the stock cooler
typically that's a big fat no no but
today we're gonna do a yes yes and we're
gonna try it out the new cooler master H
500 P mesh white provides maximum
airflow sleek design and elegant
tempered glass giving you the ultimate
platform to show off your next build
learn more about the new H 500 P by
heading to cooler master calm so they're
actually including the Wraiths cooler
with the 2600 X which previously this is
what you got with the 1800 X which was
the top tier the top dog of the stack
but now the 2700 X is the top dog as you
can see I snuck an unboxing it is a
clearly different cooler and I have
already tested this cooler that's why
you're not going to see the stock
thermal paste on here I will be using
some of the cooler master master gel pro
just a basic thermal compound probably
very comparable to what would be
pre-installed as you can see right here
but if we go ahead and take a look at
both of these coolers you can see that
the Wraiths cooler is very similar to
kind of like how the intel cooler is
it's just a big aluminum chunk with all
of these heat fins carved into it and
it's got a copper core and then you've
got a fan
there you got a fan right here that
blows down through this
the air comes through the fins and then
goes out the sides which actually offers
a little bit of cooling to your RAM and
your power delivery as well that's why
these down fire coolers are actually
pretty good when you've got a tower
cooler kind of mounted here on the
motherboard pulling air through the side
the air never really makes it down to
the components which means you've got to
have good case cooling in mind when it
comes to cooling the power delivery in
the heat scene surround it but when
you've got this down fire cooler like
this you can see as the air comes out
the bottom then you get good cooling for
the components around it but if we take
a look at the prism cooler here you'll
notice a couple of extra things one we
have got a copper base and one two three
four copper heat pipes now the heat
pipes are going to give you better
transfer of heat to the heat sink or the
fins themselves the fins do nothing but
offer surface area to give more spread
of the heat allowing it to absorb more
heat and then the fan again fires down
through all of these fins giving you
better cooling again for your
motherboard components one thing I'm not
a fan of though with this cooler already
as you can see it retains the factory
super-annoying clip style I would kind
of wish that they had used the old style
here which has these screws that screw
down on the backplate on the motherboard
I wish it found a way to do that with
the prison cooler but I digress so I
guess they're assuming a lot of people
are going to definitely hang on to these
because they've invested the money to
make it RGB and to also improve the
amount of cooling that this can offer so
that you don't have to add more money to
your budget to get your system up and
running you have a cooler that will get
the job done out of the box but you know
we got to do now we have to test this to
see whether or not truly does get the
job done well didn't turn off
immediately that's a good sign had
enough of that last week
if you broke it okay so you guys
remember that last video where we killed
our SSD yeah that was totally on us
we've talked to Corsair turns out
somehow someway we have no idea how it
happened some of you guys already
figured it out it was a wrong SATA cable
and the problem is the box it came from
was from a PSU we have it used in over a
year so we have no idea how it got put
in the wrong box
so I digress on that that was totally us
that killed it so I just wanted to put
that out there it's important to say but
here we are all factory settings it's
currently sitting at 4.1 gigahertz
remember this has the new sense mi which
is going to try and look for a self
overclock kind of like how GPU boost
works and we're gonna just kind of keep
an eye on temps and see what happens the
fan curve is also set to the standard
factory fan curve so that's something
else we can do - we could play the fan
curve a little bit to see where we go
but it's also important to note we
dropped down to three point nine seven
five which is still an overclock from
the base I believe three point seven
gigahertz is the base so it is applying
a little bit of an overclock but it's
still lower than when we were with it
with the water cooler the water cooler
when we did our last video overclocking
actually went to four point zero seven
five so we're about a hundred megahertz
lower than we were getting with just
putting on an air cooler or a water
cooler so that's something worth keeping
in mind so the test is getting ready to
finish here we're at 89% but our
temperature has locked at 68 see now
based on what I hear with the acoustics
of the fan it still doesn't sound like
it's at a hundred percent but it is
totally kept it at 68 C thirty-nine
hundred and fifty megahertz across the
board one point three 375 volts you know
I think I'm gonna skip the turbo setting
altogether and I'm just gonna set the
cooler at a hundred percent to see what
our with factory settings what our
lowest temperatures are and then of
course we have to see how far we can
bump up the overclock to where the
cooler is just no longer adequate also
remember we are in an open air test
bench so this is the best case scenario
the only thing controlling the
temperature of the CPU at this point is
the cooler zone capability so I'm just
gonna go and put this fan - a hundred
percent yeah it's loud the rpm run at
100% almost 4,000 rpm start the blender
at this point I wanna stick a piece of
paper in there something worth pointing
out is look our core speed is higher so
we might see our temperatures still
reach the same temps as before but we're
gonna get faster clocks as we're doing
it's like rap 4.0 across the board or
before we were at three point nine five
zero we are indeed getting faster core
speed by just turning up our fan curve
and the test is finished now so crazy
enough it was only not even one C lower
now yeah you guys could probably argue
like well J you left all of the auto
overclocking features on you know you
left sin semi on so that's not really a
fair test well I think would be unfair
for me to turn that stuff off because no
one's gonna buy this chip and go and
turn that stuff off that's why people
buy this stuff is the advanced you know
risin features and self overclocking and
all of that but now the real question is
can we actually push the clocks and the
voltages with this running on its max
speed so that's what I'm gonna do now
I'm going to leave it at max speed and
I'm going to see how far we can actually
go we're just gonna adjust our
multiplier ratio here crazy part is I
know I can't hit 4.2 without going up to
like 1.4 two volts but we want to see
where this where the limits are of this
cooler I'm not sure 4.2 is gonna be
doable to be honest all right the moment
I hit render 56 57 58 60 61 oh yeah I
locked up and locked and I was gonna
happen it's the only guy do all right
thought that was gonna happen so you
know we have to do next is bump up the
voltage okay here we go 1.3 8 volts we
got a little bit farther last time we
froze way down here alright we're gonna
go to 1.4 what do you think just go
straight 1.45 and then pull it back
we'll just do it does it do it I think
it's just gonna I think it's just gonna
go straight to like the 80s and then
start to throttle now we are already at
75 76 77 no 4.2 all the way across the
board nine ninety point seven five this
still says 4.2 though like I don't think
it is throttled yeah I'm gonna do
mid test and see what happens here oh
there goes opening up test manager was
just enough what do you think we're sake
of science just try 1:45 if I blow it up
I promise I won't ask AMD for another
one I'll just buy it I said wait five
tests manage you're gonna work right now
plenty of tasks managed you're like
bricks it does I want to compare the
core speed and see if it's really
throttling okay so I think we got our
answer we can't match a i/o performance
with the prism cooler but I think you'd
have to agree the prison cooler is doing
a pretty darn good job considering the
task that we're throwing at it I'm gonna
let it cool down a little bit and then
we're gonna take it off and see what the
spread did okay well I mean it's not
terrible you know we have to do now to
really make this a valid test and we
should probably throw on another air
cooler real quick what do you think so
I'm going to use the Noctua
what is this the NH u 12s se - a m4
it's actually a specific cooler that was
designed for Rison during the first
launch it but one of the things that I
actually really like about this cooler
is one yes it has the heat pipes
obviously but it's got a base on here
which is very very flat you can see it's
reflective like a mirror which gives us
better contact with the cooler but it
also doesn't use the stupid plastic
retaining brackets that I told you I
hate it takes these pieces of crap off
and then it uses its own mounting system
so that you get just the best torque and
mounting possible as you drop them all
over the floor and then probably lose
them see last time we hit what 95 or 96
see before crashed so test about to
finish ninety point two five but you
know the the impressive side to this
though is that this knocked to a cooler
was only about five C cooler the five C
cooler than the prism so what can you
take from this video this is a lot
better than the Wraiths cool I wouldn't
even try this test with the Wraith
cooler something else that's important
to keep in mind to those most people are
not going to be running the loads on
their system like blender I mean we all
I think there's a lot of people out
there that are aspiring content creators
but most of the time things like gaming
regular surfing of the internet light
workloads they're not going to put this
kind of heat into your system under
gaming
I don't let's find out real quick
actually but you can see right here it's
locked at thirty four point eight eight
like it hasn't moved at all which is
kind of crazy so and we're still running
1.5 volts but guys that was just us kind
of taking a look at the prism cooler
here to see how well it actually
performs the Wraith cooler made a heck
of a splash last year and it looks like
the prism cooler adding RGB flavor and
giving us some pretty decent cooling
Headroom I did not expect it to be
within five C of the Noctua cooler I
really didn't see that coming so guys
I'm gonna go I'm gonna get out of here
let me know if there's any other content
you want us to cover for Rison I saw
your last video with a lot of your
comments and we'll definitely try and
incorporate as much of that as possible
but if you're looking to do so look
minor overclocking with your prism
cooler on your 2700 X definitely capable
and as you go down the stack and there's
less cores the cooling only improves and
this is also a worthwhile cooler for any
a m3 or m4 CPU so including your
bulldozer your FX CPUs and your
piledriver stuff like 8350 SAT 370 is
because it uses that factory retention
so as much as I hate this bracket this
little clips it actually gives it more
compatibility with older CPUs so we're
gonna go guys thanks for watching
today's video make sure you let us know
how you thought about this video down
below if you think we did something
wrong we should test it in some other
way definitely let me know we'll try to
improve our methods and if you guys are
new around here once you hit that
subscribe button
as always guys we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
