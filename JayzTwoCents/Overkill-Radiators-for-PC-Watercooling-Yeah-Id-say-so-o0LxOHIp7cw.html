you've watched my channel long enough
you know I love to water cool and you
know I like to go extreme from time to
time I've got a quadrat and a triple rad
in my system right now radiators are one
of those things that have been around
for a long long time and I'm not talking
about computer radiators remember
computer radiators are just an adapted
technology that had been used in
automotive engines and generators and
anything that needs to cool water goes
through a radiator or cool any sort of
fluid glister radiator transmissions and
cars power steering it's all cooled by a
radiator and air to air cooling air to
radiator through route you already there
works hopefully the guys over at aqua
tuning sent me a product that is just
beyond extreme when it comes to cooling
and without let me just go ahead and
just show you this product is so new it
has no label on it Jayda my first white
box unboxing guys I'm so excited I've
reached that point where I get something
before it's even branded and there it is
Oh wrap inside here we have a radiator
obviously and you have some stainless
steel screws right there there's nothing
else in the box there's no brand label
there's no manual there's nothing and
that's because I don't think they've
even gotten that far with it but they
know how much I love water cooling and
they went ahead and sent it to me now so
what we are about to take a look at is
an extreme high-pressure capable water
cooling radiator and here it is as you
can see this radiator is aluminum or
aluminium so you don't blame me from the
UK aluminium guys we we say it
differently here there's a different
letter spelling here you have here an
aluminum radiator with
of brass and a brass court I believe are
it's all aluminum actually that is solid
aluminum and it makes this thing
extremely high pressure tolerable I want
to say five bar I may be wrong but the
bottom line is this can handle enough
pressure from an automotive like a
motorcycle or a snowboard snowboard a
snowmobile it is way more than you need
for computer cooling but what's
interesting about this I want to show
you as you see how the internal rows are
tubular tubular and there is one two
three four or five six seven eight or
one two three four five there's a lot
there's like 15 rows of those tubes in
there because they're they're layered
there's you know they're all throughout
here so that means that it's also
extremely high flow if you're going with
an extremely high end water cooling
system this is something that you may
want to consider in fact a aqua computer
is made radiators very similar to this
but this is just the beefiest radiator
in fact I almost feel like sticking this
in my car and because I used to I used
to do heavily modified cars in the past
this is the kind of thing I would have
put on my car as like a transmission
cooler or a power steering cooler or
something like that this is insane I
mean it is extremely high quality and
these black pieces here these are just
aesthetic plates put on here to make
through the radiator more attractive I
mean look even the fittings on here
where you screw in your fittings are
brass and welded right to the radiator
itself I mean god this is industrial
grade why they sent it to me I think I
just want me to ship you guys water
cooling is not going away in fact it is
evolving just like everything else when
it comes to the PC world so now I think
they might have been playing a little
bit of a joke on me at the same time
because not only did they send me this
huge radiator at the same time they sent
me this radiator this is a radiator just
open it up stop it cool you got this
there's all your hardware this is a
cutest little thing ever look at finis
it's so tiny it's a triple red for forty
millimeter fans it's 45 millimeters
thick it is thicker than it is wide it
is crazy it looks like a harmonica
anyway it's got quarter-inch Barb's
already on there but I think this is
just goes to show that I've got this
huge 45 millimeter thick quadrat in
there and you can also get this
itty-bitty little guy and I asked him I
said what what do you want me to do with
this I mean I can't I can't really use
this I said what practical applications
could you really use with this and they
said they sell out of these all the time
and people are using these in their RC
hobbies so it just goes to show water
coins stuff for PC is it obviously not
just PC you can use it anywhere your
imagination allows or you have fluid
that you need to cool this looks like a
pretty badass little radiator if you
want to stick it in maybe a quarter
scale RC car and keep the thing nice and
cool pretty awesome if you need
something that can tolerate high
pressure check this bad boy out
I don't know it's called I can't tell
you what's called it's just a high
pressure radiator it's not branded it's
that new it's really cool
go put it in a Volkswagen see you guys
next time
