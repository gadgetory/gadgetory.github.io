let me bring you a pointless video well
one more pointless than they normally
are but I digress that's besides the
point
cuts points do you want to be cooler you
want to be more desirable you know what
guys I got new merch
it's available now crowd me calm /jc
sense we got zip up hoodies we got
tri-blend we got a new logo I digress
since 2012 it's at the Grist logo you
guys been asking for that anyway all
right guys live it up we can all kinds
of stuff zip up hoodies beanies polos
don't take my word for it cuz obviously
I can't do this ad so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks so this is the 28th ETI
XC ultra from EVGA you can still see
this is a card we use we were battling
Stephen for the SLI you know world
record and stuff you can still see some
of the neat eraser kind of jammed in
there to protect it from condensation
and stuff but you know this is a
reference PCB it's the exact same PCB as
the founders cart I heard that the
founders card is actually RGB and
considering the EVGA card uses the exact
same plug in the exact same spot
obviously and this is an RGB card it got
me wondering is the founder's cooler
going to work and actually give us RGB
when plugged into the EVGA card see what
I mean toilets sweaty it's about RGB and
we're taking a good cooler off and
putting one that looks good but is
performs mediocre on here to see whether
or not RGB lights up yeah that's the
whole point in today's video and we're
gonna do it so I'm not gonna fully
assemble this card I'm only gonna put a
few I'm obviously thermal paste on here
lots of it
that should work so I'm not gonna put
all the screws in this I'm just gonna
put enough to hold it all together
because we just need to boot it up the
rumor was something along the lines of
the RGB was implemented and was put on
the card but the white wasn't uniform
enough or something for Jensen's taste
and he got kind of bent out of shape
about it so he basically ordered that
everyone just disabled the RGB and ship
it with the typical NVIDIA green color
and that's exactly as you know today
you've seen all the founders reviews
they go up and it's just got that
typical pale green Nvidia color and I'm
curious as to what this would look like
if they had actually launched it with
the RGB in place I've thoroughly cooled
my beard so what I've created here is a
triple slot founders Edition card it
looks ridiculous and yes I know I could
change out this bracket but I'm not
gonna because I'm putting it back to
stock but we're gonna go ahead and test
it now and oh wow check it out I just
happen to have a computer sitting right
here what luck yeah I just put it all
back together
I'm sure someone caught it I didn't plug
in the LED everything we do around his
first take first try we never make
mistakes okay so the first thing I got
right here while loading px1 is this
proceed to update LED firmware please
close all 3d applications meaning games
and stuff so obviously the EVGA software
is detecting like hey the LEDs are not
acting right so if I click start on this
firmware update failed failed okay well
so but look at that it just turned like
a pink color he's so wet from failed so
obviously the colors just changed let me
bring up the software here okay where'd
you go you're like totally shut down
there we go okay so led up here at the
top move that the color is set to pink
so let's set this to back to Nvidia
green and see if that works
so obviously the RGB LEDs in their work
this is pretty close to white on the
screen though so what does the white
LEDs look like is the rumor I heard was
that white was the whole reason why they
did didn't ship that looks pretty damn
white to me I know but you guys it looks
even
it doesn't look blotchy what does it
look like with it a and B red sure AMD
red shall we yeah there you go
apply that's like actual blue blue see
that looks very purpley like a violet
huh
so maybe the balance they are talking
about of why they didn't ship with RGB
isn't necessarily because of the white
but that blue does not look like blue
obviously your monitors and the camera
and the lighting and all that's gonna
affect the way you guys see it but it
definitely doesn't look blue to me this
is orange that looks like a very peachy
white color there we go I mean a police
car it's blue and red or we're in
England so the moral of today's video is
there's obviously more functionality
baked into your $800 and $1200 graphics
cards than you even know because it is
disabled from the factory so even if
custom BIOS come out from the XOC of the
extreme overclock community I have no
idea how you would control it because
EVGA is obviously controlling this card
maybe the EVGA founders or software
could control the founders card if it's
unlocked maybe we'll test that in the
future with our actual founders card so
again a pointless video they just wanted
to make to kind of see whether or not
this worked and find out with you guys
so thanks for watching if you have more
video ideas make sure you let me know
because this one came directly from the
inbox of people telling me hey did you
know the 20 ATT I actually has RGB I was
like no that's actually kind of neat
maybe I should test it I thought how
would I test it I don't know ah but I do
have the EVGA card which uses the exact
same header so as you can see it
obviously works
RGB is just made up of three different
LEDs a white LED no oh man RGB IG babe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
