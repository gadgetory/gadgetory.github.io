update you guys haven't checked out the
nvidia garage video you guys can go to
their channel i'll link it down below
and you can see what we did but i'm
still not done tweaking this system this
is the old motherboard and CPU from the
skunkworks like revision for this is the
x99 classified from EVGA it's also got
my Intel 69 50 X processor which you
should know by now is a truly soldered
IHS which is why there's a little hole
on there that's so that some of the
gasses can get out when they heat it up
and the solder actually solidifies this
was amazing on temperatures it was an
amazing overclocker but now that I've
got a 79 60 XE in here I am dealing with
some very funky temperatures that has
probably forced me to have to deal it
now so as we're gonna do today we're
gonna test before and after certainly
not the first time anyone's done D
lidding on YouTube but it's gonna be the
first time I'm officially showing you
guys with the exception of the live
stream we did with the 79 80 XE we're
gonna see whether or not it's worth
voiding that warranty so let's keep our
fingers crossed because I have to take
the system apart again if I break it
EVGA offers a full range of components
including video cards motherboards power
supplies cases and peripherals
regardless of your needs EVGA sure to
have you covered to see what you GA can
do for your next build head to EVGA calm
now before I do lit it I kind of want to
show you guys what I'm dealing with here
now I'm running 4.6 gigahertz which is
definitely no slouch on a 16 core
processor but the voltage I'm using to
run that's not that high and the
temperatures we're seeing are very high
now one of the tests I like to do is
Cinebench it's a Navy X instruction and
so it it definitely could hammer the PC
and I can see what the temperatures are
going to spike to long before the
coolant is ever saturated so what that
means is the temperature is going to
shoot up to a really high number and
then as the coolant gets hotter if
you're running a long term AVX
instruction then it's only gonna get
hotter from there if that makes sense so
if you see the temp suit up immediately
that's before the water has even gotten
hot
that's heat being trapped in the package
itself and never making it to the loop
so we've got hardware monitor open right
here you can see we're idling our cores
down in the 20s but that's because I
have balance mode going for power and
that specifically because of temperature
so right now we're idling at 25 23 ish
on the course 1.3 to 1.4 gigahertz on
the CPU because of balance mode but as
soon as I run this test our temperatures
as you can see right here 60 80 84 85 86
87 89 you see our cores are hitting 80s
almost 90s and there's a 90 see right
there's a 90 see on the package and our
score is decent inside of Cinebench I
remember this is with fairly low voltage
our voltage did hit one point two eight
one point two seven which is higher than
stock obviously which runs out like one
point one eight ish or something like
that but on skunkworks I was actually
able to run one point three five and
four point nine daily on that on the 69
50x now yes I know we have more core
density in here but I also know what
temperature's we were able to achieve on
the 79 ad XE once we deal edit it even
on standard cooling so I decided to go
ahead and do it with skunkworks and show
you guys sort of the process yes I am
well aware that that completely avoids a
warranty which is something you guys
should keep in mind if you're gonna be
doing this but skunkworks kind of keeps
its hardware long-term that's why this
has been running ever since launch in
the 16:9 50 XE this is gonna destroy its
resale but I don't Reese all my parts
I'm sure you guys have kind of noticed
so this is my personal rig and I want to
get as much out of it as I possibly can
and if I for some reason do destroy the
CPU which is always a risk when you D
lid I do have another Sonia 80 XE I can
stick in there which I don't really want
to you though or we've got the 99 80 XE
coming which is always an option let's
go ahead and take a look at OCC T as
well which is a long term test and I'm
gonna show you what happens when I go to
small data set small data set is
something that tends to cause problems
in terms of I know for whatever reason
small data set is more tasking of your
systems we've got a large data set it's
not quite as is taxing I want say
tasking it's like white as taxing on
your system but I'm gonna show you what
happens here because I can't push the
voltage any higher you guys just saw
what was happening at Cinebench we're
gonna hit t.j.maxx of 105 if I push the
voltage any higher than our
is we're actually under volting the cpu
which means when we run this particular
task Oh Phil's running into things and
there goes did you catch it okay since
you're busy running into walls back
there so what we just dealt with right
there is actually an under volt
situation where the CPU run ran out of
power and it ran out of power so
dramatically it didn't even have time to
blue screen and kind of catch itself it
just immediately shuts off the system
and restarts with this error code on the
motherboard so that's hopefully what
we're going to eliminate I'm not gonna
change any of my settings I'm just going
to deal with it put it back in there and
compare the results
fortunately the CPU loop is the easiest
one the drain so you can learn a lot
from the spread pattern of your thermal
paste and check this out you can see how
we have an uneven spot on this IHS see
how it's more spread out from there mean
it's real thin in the center you can see
the same thing right there very thin in
the center more spread out to the side
so we actually think that this is may
not be perfectly flat we know that the
blocks are flat and I could actually use
a straight edge to show that but the IHS
not something that was a problem I think
all that recently I haven't heard a lot
of people complaining about IHS is not
being flat but that's where lapping came
in laughing of water you know blocks
lapping of air coolers lapping of IHS
a--'s and I'm thinking that something
I'm gonna do today on top of the D lid
you wanna know how its high centered how
it's got a dome in the middle do that so
here's the 69 50 X not deleted obviously
cuz it's soldered that is more or less
what we would expect not a top
there's anyone cringing at this now when
you lap something you need to use glass
because glass is perfectly flat like I
couldn't do this on the table cuz it's
not flat enough now I still have the the
cover on this tempered glass right here
because I don't want to scratch the
glass we're gonna tape down sandpaper
and lap it but because the glass is
flatter than the table watch how much it
spins on the glass whoa
look that Intel what are you doing okay
so here's what we're gonna do we're
gonna go ahead and put this back in the
system you can see that that copper area
where we sort of went through the top
coating of the IHS that's not gonna hurt
anything we have a theory that maybe
this is our problem we're gonna see what
happens right now and then we will we'll
go from there
I don't want to deal with it I'd love to
get away of just a lot you know quick
lapping on the IHS technically I should
also be lapping the block but the block
we put up a straight edge on it and it's
pretty damn flat so we're just gonna
leave the block alone and see what this
does
well this our Idol temps down in the low
20s so let's go ahead and do a Cinebench
run because we know that that was what
definitely hammered it 70 to 80 81 on
the package 82 83 84 does that that's
already white like 10 C improvement so
without even D letting so far we are
seeing a serious improvement here in
Cinebench I don't feel like I need to do
a deal it'd I'm torn
whatever let's deal with it what the
hell Wow yeah okay so that's what you
kind of expect to see as it's dripping
all over my hand ah ah I mean it's
perfectly flat you can see how the
thickness ladies is all around the
outside though with us being the
Internet I know this wouldn't have been
good enough so you guys are gonna want
me to do lit it and that's what we're
about to do nothing happened here I may
have put a little bit too much alcohol
on the IHS okay so we're deleted now
we've got the gelid XGC extreme under
the IHS and on top of it so here's our
temps right there shooting 65 70 80 81
82 83 82 84 82 that's packaged tent by
the way the cores are sitting in the 60s
and 70s
so not really an improvement with the D
lid versus before which I was kind of
afraid of
you know cuz I just there was no need to
do it honestly but that's okay
these temperatures are still very well
with what I would expect them to be
considering the fact that it is skylake
x which runs very hot and we are running
1.3 volts on this we decided this video
was just to take you guys along for the
ride I think Phil might agree the
biggest improvement we saw here was with
the fixing of the conga convexed IHS
because if it's not making a flat mated
surface and as you saw when we first
took it off you could see that it was
not making good contact except for a
very small portion of the center of the
dye and the IHS is there because it's an
heat spreader it's an heat spreader
because grammer good girder for me it's
an IHS so it's designed to spread the
heat to a larger surface area for more
efficient dissipation of heat and if
it's only doing it over a small
percentage of that obviously that's not
spreading the heat it's focusing the
heat which is bad so guys next time you
do your builds check your CPUs I didn't
I don't necessarily recommend putting it
down like a top and spinning it but if
it spins then you know you have the same
problem we do and a simple lapping with
multi grit sandpaper and stepping it up
and polishing it can give you
improvements as we saw here but it will
probably void your warranty alright guys
thanks for watching and as always we'll
see you in the next one now skunkworks
can be considered done and go home
