planned for today where I messed up one
of my laptop's by trying to overclock it
and I brick didn't could get to boot
I wouldn't post or anything like that
and I disassembled it to you know reset
it all that and I thought this would
make a very useful video I'm sure
there's someone out there that has a
laptop that's not turning on because
something got messed up in the BIOS but
instead of making that super useful
video that actually serves a purpose
somebody sent me a video a while back
showing me where someone had actually
water-cooled an air cooler on a CPU and
I thought that's stupid what why why
would you do that
and then it dawned on me we do stupid
things so why not double down on the
stupid and Ellen to cool our heat sink
rule the games from the Seven Kingdoms
with your iron claw Mouse from your Iron
Throne it has a scroll wheel that looks
like a off-road tire and buttons on the
side and top to do stuff
don't lose grip while doing stuff with
the textured sides and do it in style
with the odd GP learn more Corsair com
so here's our setup right here it's a
AMD 1800 X hooked up to a an Asus x-37b
yeah something like that
well x3 7d I I think I TX bored reason
why it's ITX skills you'll see in a
minute the graphics card it's just a
cheap 1050 without supplemental power or
any PCIe power because we want to be
able to keep it out of the way yeah and
then we have a 850 watt power supply X
we're not really trying to see what
happens with the overclock we're trying
to see what whether or not this
proof-of-concept would even work before
we can determine if it works we have to
first see what our baseline is so we've
actually had our test running here for a
while we're currently at 59 C this will
warm up to approximately 63 64 C at its
hottest as is the latest BIOS so this
isn't showing us the offset this is the
actual physical temperature number but
as you can see it is slowly climbing and
it will max out right around 63 C so
that's gonna be our baseline we are not
going to be doing like I said doing any
overclocking a tempering that that in
fact the fact that I even bought 10
liters of liquid nitrogen
without the purpose of continuing our
rip Steve because we still have to do
that at some point but there Bauer came
in and said rip the world which happens
and that kind of takes some of the wind
out of your sails and some of the liquid
nitrogen out of your pots rips your
sails and then you have no sales and you
can't go forward I don't know somehow
we're gonna take this and the liquid
nitrogen that and that the thing and go
when we were doing our latest rip GN
which was several months ago now we had
the pot with a lot of that the the
vapors overflowing because the liquid
nitrogen gas is heavier than air so it
settles and it falls down and it was
falling on to our EVGA motherboards like
heatsink fans for the vrm and then we
started hearing this really like crazy
kind of a motor noise like I it was like
a grinding sound and we realized we were
freezing the fan the fan bearings and
like the fluid in there because there's
a fluid bearing with freezing until we
would like take a fan and have it blow
up and pull the vapors away then it
would thaw out and it ran perfectly fine
so I thought to myself the VRMs were
being
dreamily cooled as well as the RAM just
the vapors was making it so touching the
RAM was extremely chilly so I got me
thinking what happens if we use vapor to
cool the heatsink now Phil and I
actually have two very different
hypothesis on what's gonna happen here
he thinks it's not gonna cool any better
than when I pointed the air-conditioner
at an air cooled heatsink we did that
once before we plumbed it in the front
of a case it was all the standard air
cooler and stuff and then it ran fairly
cool but we found that there was
obviously an inefficient contact and
conductive or conduction the movement of
hate between the high HS and an air
cooler versus like a water block or
whatever what's making more direct
contact with the metal that's touching
the thing it's cooling this has to go
through the pipes and all that so Phil
thinks it's gonna work about as good as
blowing an air conditioner at a heat
sink I think it's gonna work a little
better I think it's gonna actually cool
the heat sink enough to where it's gonna
get so far below ambient that it's gonna
actually have a slight chilling effect
but no better than water so I'm
expecting it to be probably in the 40
degree range ish at load there's a 50
I'll say 45 40 43 49 now although our
tables kind of scratched and beat up it
has paint and stuff on it I don't want
to damage our table so I'm only gonna
only gonna use something I'm willing to
get rid of that doesn't have any serious
value around here that being of course
the gamers Nexus mod Matt that's
flashing back at me so this is the scary
part you don't want to use gloves
because the if it gets poured on the
gloves that it will burn you more than
if it hit your hand because of the lady
frost effects but if I pour it in this
this is just gonna freeze and you don't
want to touch this without gloves I'm
going to pour the bare hand to handle
this with the rubber glove so that's
rubber this is what we use we'll like
technically this comes with a tube
bending kit for when you touch the hot
tubes but I touch those with my bare
hands too so it still says fan that's
called
okay I just touched it with my finger
essentially what we've done here is a
super ghetto swamp cooler all right so
here's vv2 of the crap lnto air-cooled
setup as you can see it's chambered and
funneled I'm a Phil can get down in
there to show you but it's sort
funnelled and it's gonna have no choice
but to go down through there and yeah so
we're trying to catch all the vapors and
pull it in
it's at 12:10 C 8 7 5 are you ready to
start this test
oh I need more ln 2 that's the problem
there we go now it's not blowing into
the system its current certain to
creating vapor
well 38-7 bill i win my science teacher
gave me an F you believe that you're
like yeah this is this is phase two yeah
start it well the tubes are freezing if
that 21c under load so far well it's
still climbing like I don't think this
is working like we want it to it's not
working look how frozen the cooler is
though you think so look at that
okay let's stop it cuz that didn't work
at all whoa that's the mad scientist
right there well on paper it seemed like
a good idea
we're not done yet we can pour it
through
I know I'm just seeing what happens it's
not really working I'm gonna get Asus a
lot of credit for their build quality
like that heatsink I think like you said
it's toast all right so here's what we
learned
lnto is cold and things that touches it
makes equally as cold and apparently
vapor chambers don't like being really
cold because dipping it in the ln2
didn't work which makes me kind of want
to retry this test with like just one of
these chunks of aluminum but then it's
like then we have to insulate the board
and all that sort of stuff so yeah this
was a this was like kind of a fun one in
my opinion I was bored today like I said
I could have made a super helpful video
about how to bring your laptop back from
the dead if you have a brick bios maybe
we'll just do that later but anyway this
was fun I had fun making it so there's
that alright guys thanks for watching
and hopefully you guys didn't hate this
video too much because we are doing what
a lot of people would call as parts
abuse but anything that doesn't surprise
anyone so we've still got a few litres
of ln2 now we're just gonna kind of play
with it off cameras are freezing things
so I'll see you guys in the next one
well if I let's restate this ridiculous
rig this ridiculous day see and people
think Nvidia and AMD can't work together
this is what we were using to hold up
the box see they're compatible
that was a rubber glow that's crazy like
you can see when Isis it looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
