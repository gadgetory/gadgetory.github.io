and we are in Las Vegas with CES 2015
and I am here at the Aria with MSI's
private suite so let's go ahead and take
it to her all right now you guys have
seen that I can build some pretty crazy
systems we've got here is a James fisler
design MSI gaming rig it fully water
cooled red fluid going everywhere this
makes me feel like guns were chump
change but this is pretty cool I'm
moving on over here we've got a limited
edition in when s frame here with the
MSI x99 create this is if you guys are
in kind of like that monochrome look
maybe a black and white very sleek and
elegant it's also featuring two of the
msi 970 armor graphics cards as you can
see which matched the black and the
white very very sleek I mean everything
about this system is just minimal
looking yet elegant at the same I mean
is this is like the Vegas PC if you
asked me this is just completely elegant
and looks amazing now without a doubt
one of the highlights here the msi is
really showing off is both their type-c
connector which is a USB which are
hoping will become a new standard when
it comes to USB connectivity it's
reversible to replace all the different
micro USB mini USB standard USB but also
we've got here the world's first USB 3.1
connectivity
now recently i did a video where you
guys saw i took a USB 3.1 it through USB
3.0 and did some speed comparisons but
the 3.1 standard is so much faster
they've got a demo unit here showing how
fast that connectivity really is and as
you guys can see it's definitely going
to be something we're looking at a
little bit later in the year i'm
thinking march right march or springtime
guys yeah so definitely be on the
lookout for that that's what MSI's
bringing to the table this year in 2015
when it comes to motherboards msi has
definitely got you connected now here's
that create edition motherboard we
talked about over there in the in wind
system it's got a nice white and black
theme but they've got so many different
options here when it comes to
motherboards on all different price
points different specifications we've
got solid black motherboards here good
job msi on that one I don't think anyone
else is offering a solid black
motherboard which so many people want
but you've got so many different options
here gaming six gaming nine you've got
some other boards like the gaming six
that are even featuring the stream
engine which is going to take the load
off of your CPU if you're doing that
game streaming so you can actually get
better streaming performance without
having to have the top of the line like
59 60 X processors you guys can actually
get a nice smooth stream without
hammering your CPU so guys if you
checking out motherboards and stuff take
a look at MSI they have got more options
on the market than anyone else is
bringing to to the market
now one thing that msi is definitely not
short of is graphics cards options of
course are AMD and NVIDIA board partners
they've got so many different options I
mean look at this we've got the gold
edition here we've got the standard twin
froze or two we've got the new twin
froze or five now this guy I'm holding
right here which I'm a little bit
partial to because of the Nvidia green
you guys know I like Nvidia it's the 970
100m a and this graphics card actually
commemorates their 100 million graphics
cards that have been sold since
inception of doing graphics cards of MSI
so this is a limited edition green it
looks really really nice but brand new
twin frozr 5 is definitely bringing some
really cool things to the market a
single fan will turn based on idle temps
and low temps where the fans will ramp
up and turn on and off as needed really
cool technologies here but if you guys
are doing custom builds you guys are
interested in looking at doing some
color matching definitely check out msi
because they are the only brand on the
market right now that's really bringing
a lot of different color options so guys
this has been JS two cents taking a look
here at the msi suite here in las vegas
make sure you guys stick around for more
coverage and behind-the-scenes kind of
look is you guys notice we're doing
things a little differently here as
always I want to thank all of the
viewers who support it to the CES
fundraiser campaign of course you guys
brought us this coverage this year no
corporate backing just you guys in fewer
back viewer backing miss you guys check
out the description too because there
are some contributors down there who
really made this possible go and check
out their channels and stuff and last
but not least thank you to sennheiser
for providing audio for this trip and as
always guys we'll see you in the net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
