since here we are at the gigabyte slash
or a suite here at CES 2018 and I'm
holding right here when you horas x9
this is the world's thinnest SLI
equipped laptop it's got two gtx 1070
GPUs in there not a max Q a full sized
gtx 1070 two of them eight gigabyte
versions we've got an i7 7820 h k up to
64 gigabytes of 24 hundred megahertz
ddr4 and then of course you can spec it
out with a ton of different storage
options two different display options
here both you HD which is an IPS are
100% Adobe RGB panel as well as a more
gamer centric 1440p or qHD IPS 120 hertz
panel so you can SPECT that out however
you want but really the star of the show
here is how thin this is typically when
you find a gaming laptop that has any
sort of high end GPU discrete solution
in there you'll find they're extremely
thick because they're trying to cram a
massive amount of cooling in there to
keep those chips cool but this has got
to 10 70s and it's maintaining an
extremely thin form factor I mean it's
not the smallest or the lightest laptop
by any means but it's definitely the
most powerful in its class at this
thickness now in keeping these cool you
can see we've got a massive amount of
ventilation right here we've got exhaust
on all four corners we got exhaust
coming out this way this way and out the
rear and it's in taking from right here
on the bottom so it's definitely got a
massive amount of cooling heat pipes
fans for the CPU and the GPU as you
would expect but it's got quad so DIMM
slots in here so you've got a lot of
options in terms of config that you can
outfit this with so if you're the kind
of person that's looking for some sort
of aid I don't know I don't want to say
the term ultra portable but if you were
to look at what comparable desktop
solution would be in this form factor
and shrink it down to this then yeah
it's pretty damn for to portable at that
but if you're looking for an SLI 1070
gaming laptop with an i7 and a lot of
RAM and 100% OB RGB and Q HD or UHD this
is definitely worth taking a look at now
let's
even under a rock you've probably heard
that AMD has shown its new roadmap for
2018 and beyond all the way as far as
2020 and the news n + architecture
coming out including the this it's going
to also include threat River plus and
new stuff but with that of course we
have to have new chipsets and new
platform this I'm holding right here is
the Auris x4 70 gaming 7 Wi-Fi so this
is going to be your new mainstream
platform moving forward on this m+
architecture but if you're already on
Rison and you're concerned about being
able to upgrade will don't worry because
guess what it's actually forward and
backwards compatible now if you are
building a system today and the new CPS
aren't out yet you can actually get an X
470 motherboard like this one right here
from Oris and you can install an older
rise in platform or CPU and then once
the new cpus come out you can upgrade to
this but the gaming sevens got some
pretty subtle brushed aluminum looks
really good some orange accents which
you know you guys know how I feel about
color centric stuff right when they
force you down a certain path of color
but Horace's their color is orange so
there it is but you can see you've got
this nice open heatsink right here on
the power delivery it is a 10 plus 2
power delivery so we've got an 8 pin and
a 4 pin DPS power for your CPU giving
you plenty of juice for overclocking
because Zen plus is then - moving
forward it's supposed to be very good
with overclocking more headroom that we
saw with the original zen architecture
in 2017 of course amphora socket like
you guys would expect the same type of
lighting you would see on any of the
Auris motherboards today so this one
doesn't actually function doesn't turn
on there's no running units I can't show
you but I can show you the earlier
samples for you know the current AM for
stuff and even Intel the DIMM slots
light up you've got some LEDs on the
side right here this is going to be it's
gonna be exciting competition didn't
stop in 2017 we're moving forward with
lots of fighting going on in the CPU
space and of course as consumers we are
going to win when that happens so this
is the first X 470 we've gotten our
hands on here at CES 10 what you guys
think
oh no don't forget of course we've got
some heat sinks right here for our nvme
drives and MDOT two storage solutions so
keeping those nice and cool as well
anyway there's that guys it's been our
coverage here of gigabyte here at CES
2018 of course go to gigabyte comm to
check out more they've got lots of stuff
to show you guys
and again a huge thank you to our
sponsor EVGA for making our coverage of
this year possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
