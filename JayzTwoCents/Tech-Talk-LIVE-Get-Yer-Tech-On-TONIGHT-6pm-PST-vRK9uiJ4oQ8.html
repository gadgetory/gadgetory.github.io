really creepy I must adjust camera must
adjust creme rah oh oh my god you guys
have no idea what I've just gone through
in the last 10 minutes I will fill you
all in in the moment I hate being a
one-man crew let me just tell you that
much right now hate it hate it hate it I
am way too blown out here there we go so
a little more natural may I know I'm a
white guy at all and I've kind of got
the whole pirate stash going on Mego 70s
porno stash let's do that wow what is
happening is this thing working is it on
no hello
ok
think we got this
I think we've got I think we do okay if
you guys can hear me stand up okay danda
all right whoo okay how many people got
here like 20 or some of that right now
okay so i had my stream all ready to go
and everything everything was cool and I
had the scenes all set up and add the
music ready and I had the intro ready
yeah I've been doing it like that for a
few weeks now and I've got things pretty
much under control because I'm becoming
quite the pro at this whole live
streaming thing well at 552 um guess
what literally expires 10 minutes before
my stream my xsplit license expired so
in in that amount of time I had to go in
and update it now what happens with
twitch when you let it when you let it
expire is it decides to then this is
really like in my face isn't it they put
all your settings back to like the basic
setting and its really really annoying
and so I had to go into the last minute
reset up all the scenes like you know
what the picture and the tech talk and
the little Jason static thing there and
the music I had to redo all of that
because guess what when the when the
thing expired it it it for some reason
my file that I had everything saved
under wouldn't show up like I couldn't
load it kept saying it was corrupt I'm
like are you kidding me I've got 10
minutes to reset all this up and i have
a video i want to show and have things i
want to do an xsplit decides to say hey
just a few minutes before your stream
let's go ahead and let the timer run out
so okay fine maybe that's my bad because
I didn't check it so then it's like six
or it's like 557 we're three minutes
before the stream and I do my
preliminary check right I'm able to see
what I'm streaming to youtube prior to
turning it on for you guys so I'm
streaming but it's private you guys
can't see it while I gets a black screen
and then a an error problem turns out
that there was I had a bad USB cable
going from my mic to my hub down there
and then
hub goes into the computer so yeah in
three minutes I was able to diagnose the
problem all the way down to a USB cable
on the mic and this is my day job guys
when I get home from work I don't want
to be fixing these problems I just want
to turn on my and have it go so and
I'm already a little bit moody today I'm
already you know Jay's angry should be
the theme of the day and where the house
my palace oh so there huh and so that
was not a good way to start the stream
no it wasn't but whatever it is what it
is i fixed it i'm happy when it's going
on with my SD card look at this SD card
look at the back of this SD card can you
guys see that me a new control of my
camera you guys can't see the focus
Kenny it's not out of focus you can kind
of see the black spot right there let me
I want I want to focus this hold on I
got this I can do this ok there we go
watch this how the hell did that happen
this is not a cheap SD card me this what
is this the like the plastic divider
between the two pins like do you see are
you seeing this are you seeing this yeah
so it's just one of those days where
everything is going wrong for me oh my
god and now the comments aren't updating
like the last thing I see is oak Oak res
said I stood I haven't seen anything
since that's all I know I could be in
your talking to myself right now which
is not all the entirely uncommon talk to
myself all the time talk to myself in
public talk to myself when I'm in Boston
them on the subway really freaks people
out what's really funny is when you
start having an argument with yourself
it is funny don't without do you think
you are talking to me like that I swear
to god I'm gonna beat the out of
you if you see you do something like
that in public people start to freak out
ok so I'm gonna load up Twitter here
make sure I got Twitter up make sure
that the book faces up that way you guys
can all put your oh now the comments
just all of a sudden flood in are you
serious
this is just the way it is all right
guys a couple of things I want to talk
about today I've been getting because
the HTC One is launched and the galaxy
s4 is launched i get i get the the
question all over again you know j which
one's better iphone 5 or galaxy s3 or
galaxy s4 and I I got to thinking about
it I'm going to tell you guys why I'm
starting to kind of fall out of love
with the iPhone because the iphone was
kind of like a good start to the
smartphone thing because with the
exception of blackberry you know I phone
was the first all touchscreen smartphone
and so they have they have a good place
in that vape kind of pioneered a lot of
stuff but you know Android and the
partners like you know like Samsung and
people who are getting involved I'll
people really some people don't realize
that I have both right here is he boom
look go like you can kind of see you
guys there hi so I come from both worlds
I don't even think this thing is charged
right now and there when I went to CES
in January I really i was really asking
myself because I'm I was on like I was
able to play with so many different
phones i was able to play there's some
of the windows phones and i was able to
play with the lenovo phone i was it with
you which is an Intel phone i was able
to play you know with you bun to phone i
was able to do so much and of course
apple's nowhere to be seen so yes
because they just don't go to see yes
they're too good for CBS because they
have their you know Worldwide Developer
Conference and then I went and I
attended the samsung keynote about you
know the the aqua aqua why they call it
the coolest aquos octa something like
that anyway it's the eight-core
processor and i thought well you know I
don't like the brute force hardware
approach of oh if something's too slow
or we have a problem just throw more
clothes at it i'm not i don't like that
concept but then they unveiled something
that I thought was really really
cool and I'd like to show that to you
guys right now I'm gonna show and I was
at this I was at this this keynote you
guys are about to see a clip from I was
there I saw it in person I got to see it
and and it was really really cool so
anyway go ahead and yes the eggs oh noes
Thank You teku 175 the Exynos octa is
what it was called the eggs inose and
they had the dual the quad nyaka so and
it's probably not going to come out in
the US because for whatever reason
samsung doesn't like to bring the bigger
cores to their US based phones so go
ahead and watch this clip right here and
you guys will see why i'm really
debating on my next go around on my next
iPhone or my next upgrade unless Apple
really bring something out of the bed of
the bullpen why I'm probably going to
end up going with and the new santanu
Samsung device alright guys check this
out and tell me what you think we're so
confident about the market potential of
flexible OLED 'he's we're creating an
entire new line of them under the um--
brand name yuum doesn't just bend the
rules of display technologies it
completely rewrites them take a look at
this flexible OLED prototype our team
was able to make a high resolution
display on extremely thin plastic so
instead of glass so it won't break even
if it's dropped and we can actually bend
the screen
imagine the products you could design
with this that's amazing it really is I
brought something else here today have a
look at this bended yumoto type device
do you see how the screen curves beyond
beyond the edge of the display around
here with this vended display we have
expanded the canvas available for
content content can now flow along the
sides of the device so for example if I
receive an important message
so that flexible screen is and it's not
going to just be awesome for phones it's
going to be awesome for all sorts of
things you know it's like billboards
that you know you have a pillar right
you could have a digital billboard that
wraps around that pillar it's just gonna
I think the concept of this this you
know this youm flexible screen is OLED
display is just going to be awesome and
I really like the idea that and they had
a they had some some concepts of so of
some ways that it could be used and I
didn't get a chance to load up that
portion of the video so if you guys will
bear with me for just one moment I want
to load that up because I think it's
just a really neat clip belated so just
bear with me for one moment because i
want to set that portion of the clip up
we're so confident about the market
potential of flexible OLED work we're so
confident about the market
oh okay just so here's some concepts of
how they see this screen being used hey
dog what uh huh hey what's up with you
in carla has she left you yet oh she did
hello hello
look at my tell
technology it's my thing whoa I need to
get going wow that's amazing can I see
that yeah all in a day's work for
samsung hahaha awesome
hey you should join me for coffee
sometime it's my cards cool hey for
handing out business cards
bye-bye Oh thought he'd never leave
whoa that's amazing
okay so just tell me that that concept
doesn't really make you excited I get to
see that back and CES and it still has a
little bit of weight it sells a little
ways to go because some of the problems
that they were having with the display
right now is that it's kind of getting a
memory in it and what I mean by that is
that flexible screen the reason why he
was holding it the way he was when he
was flexing it like really tight ends is
because when they let it go like prior
to the prior to the show you could kind
of see some like images and stuff of it
it kind of had like an S like a wave
like shape to it because they had been
flexing it around so much it was
starting to form in that so they still
have some work to do to it they said
dude I didn't give any idea of when
something that would be available but I
I thought it was a really really cool
concept and it's something that I
definitely want to consider now because
I I loved the idea of like that smart
wallet and I don't that's what they
would call it but I I thought it was
like a smart wall where you open it up
and you've got your tablet you can
folded clothes and you got your phone
yeah it's gonna be kind of kind of fat
kind of thick but damn you know if you
have you it's kind of like the note but
you can flip it open into like a seven
and a half inch like an ipad mini size
device so i would really like to be able
to see what you guys were saying if
you're saying something but guess what
youtube cuz youtube is stupid uh so has
anybody else excited about that because
I know I sure as hell am somebody wants
to know boo ubud ubuntu addicted wants
to know what I think about the oh yeah
you're going to install XBMC on it I not
played with their seen the Ouya at all
so I couldn't really tell you I'm going
to try and go back to the comments and
see what has been said here as I refresh
because I'd like to start I want to
spend this stream doing some Q&amp;amp;A with
you guys because of the last couple of
weeks you know when I had guests and
stuff on here I don't get as many of the
questions and seen some of that stuff so
let's say Gerard w98 says Jay grape
drink red drink blue drake brown stank
drank or waffles one two three go
waffles I love office taking 175 says
it's an epic concept it is an epic
concept what would you say before that
you said oh what a cheater huh yeah I
kind of I kind of liken myself to the to
the you know the dork in the beginning I
was like look at my tablet what you know
I always thought that was really neat
something I've been wanting to do a
review on that since we're talking about
ces and haven't gotten around to it yet
i'll kind of give you guys a little bit
of a sneak peek here this right here is
the tylt powerplant it was sent to me
it's a fifty two hundred leads 5200
milliamp battery yeah 5200 milliamp
lithium-ion battery it's a portable
battery charger and I have used this
already to charge my wireless headphones
when sometimes up when I'm playing xbox
with friends and I want to talk to
friends on skype while Xbox I'll take my
wireless headphones and I'll walk into
the living room with them and I've had
these died before so what I was able to
do had these died while is playing and
I'm too far away from the clear to plug
them in so I was able to take with the
USB plug right here plug in a standard
micro USB into the headphones and have
the headphones being powered off the
battery while I'm playing with it and so
when i'm going to go ahead and do right
now is since this sense the my galaxy s3
is completely dead right now as you can
see right not turning on completely dead
so i'm going to do right now is I'm just
going to go ahead and pull out the
built-in micro USB plug right here
that's built into it I'm going to plug
this into the bottom of the phone like
such and now we were going to do is
we're going to go ahead and just seat
seat now it's charging you see that red
light right there now it's charging and
there you go and how much battery do we
have on this thing and we're sitting
here at about half a charge it's
normally four LEDs so we're just going
to kind of let this thing charge and see
how much we get out of it while we are
doing our thing here i just thought i'd
show you guys that little piece of
technology that's been awesome when I
was at the zoo we were at Disneyland I
use this thing to keep the GoPro charged
i also had
discharging my wife's iphone 5 when
we're at the zoo I can get to to
complete I phone charges off of this and
still have a half a battery left over so
it's pretty damn awesome let's see if I
can power it up while it's plugged on
right now and yep we've got power there
you go so this right here you guys are
going to see review coming on this I
just haven't gotten around to it yet
i've been running behind on so many
videos that i want to do this is called
the tylt powerplant it's a 5.2 a its a
50 200 million and or 5.2 amp I guess
it's a 5 volt 1 amp output which right
you can use right there this is actually
what charges that right here this little
for you plug a micro USB in there it's
got USB output so you can plug in your
iphone cable or 30 pin your lightning
connector whatever and then this
particular one has a native three and a
half inch another three that so I micro
USB right there that plugs into it so I
love this device it's really really
awesome and I'm getting Oh looks like I
was getting some advertisements send to
my text messages alright lovely try and
refresh the stream here and see what you
guys are saying I don't know if the
comments are going through or maybe you
guys just aren't typing but I'm not
getting nothing here 20 Robo over 9 says
hey Jay you're from the UK a man it's
laid out there you must be a devoted
viewer and I love you for that because i
know it's laid out there jacob kor asek
crow such cars such i'm not sure what
nationality is everything is vibrating
yeah my iphone everything oh my god sort
of be like an adult-film up in here
anyway teku 175 says screw this samsung
galaxy s3 he's still rocking the
t-mobile g1 way to go man get your your
money's worth out of that so we're gonna
go ahead and just move this out of the
way
alright let's check the Twitter see we
got going on the Twitter over here like
I've got some private messages as well
they're private we're not going to talk
about those Oh brighter brighter 1015
said YouTube is broke as hell switch to
twitch nope we got it working obviously
let's see advocare says he's excited for
the stream you can use the hashtag ask
JC sense actually there's a hashtag down
inside the body of the aim of the video
here that says ask your questions via
your favorite social media the very
first one in there is a Twitter it's a
click to tweet so if you click that
it'll go straight to tech talk live
which is a hashtag and you can put all
your questions in there and I will check
that out as we do that there we go ok so
that's up I ask your questions there ask
your questions here facebook whatever
take your chances here I just don't know
how well it's working apparently people
are saying no one's talking and your
eyes were all sitting here watching me
and I've got 37 more minutes to go and
I'm just going to stare at you awkward
yet yeah sorry to feel it awkward didn't
it uh d Rock 42 99 wants to know what is
the worst case you ever built the pc in
EG terrible likes coolermaster excerpt
etc um ok I think honestly the worst
case by default that I've ever used was
the antec p180 to the reason for that
was it had 11 20 millimeter on the top
and had 11 20 millimeter in the back had
one in the front and then like one down
in the bottom by the power supply unit
because it was separated the motherboard
and top was completely separated from
the power supply in the bottom it was
like a floor and for water cooling that
was a pain in the ass but I modified it
and made it very high airflow I made
extra ports for the fans on top got my
water cooling in there and it was fine
after that but I don't like a lot of
what
antec brings to the table I just don't
know what it one of my favorite brands
that I've recently built in fractal
design I really like fractal design gosh
and their build quality is so high and
they're so quiet because most of their
cases are completely sound insulated 12
addicted says so why don't you use media
center software media center software
for what maybe media center software got
to be a little more specific he also
telling me valve release portal no I've
never played portal I was never into
that it's cool that it's released on
Ubuntu that way you guys have some more
game options but anyway Jacob coro coro
sec says do how do I control the speed
of a 3-pin cpu fan you only have two
options really some sort of a step-down
plug kind of like shoot I had one over
here too it's just it's just a plug that
you plug the fan into and then that
would go into a power source which step
it down either 7 volt or 5 volt not all
fans will start on 5 volt by the way or
plug it into a fan controller most
motherboard headers that are 3 pin will
have some sort of a built-in piece of
software for the motherboard at least
Maya case does because all my fans are
controlled off the motherboard including
my radiator fans will have software to
allow you to control them not all of
them so I when I 3-pin fans aren't PWM
fans so you're not going to get you know
any sort of response of control it's
either going to be set at a certain
speed and leave it or turn it all the
way up whereas PWM fans will speed up
and slow down based on the load on the
cpu pwn fans are 4 pin fans by the way
those are the looks like a three pin but
it's a little wider and it's got the
blue wire on there as well yeah those
are PWM fans um oh chris says you like
twitch because you can watch in a larger
screen at higher resolution and the
automatic comments yeah i thinked which
is better for streaming youtube is just
breaking into the streaming world
remember guys the live stream on YouTube
was a beta thing until just recently and
it's still pretty infant compared to
rest of you know live streaming out
there in the internet so bear with it I
keep it here on YouTube because twitch
is a gaming platform and I keep the
gaming on twitch because YouTube is not
a live streaming is not a gaming
platform granted because I'm in the
ocean network as a full screen partner I
can do gaming on my channel if I want
but I'm not a gaming channel so i'm not
going to do that if you guys want to
watch me game do like I did with the
Bioshock series last week and come on to
twitch when I do it I'm going to be
live-streaming tomb raider as the as my
next live let's play by the way um I am
going to be giving away in fact in this
live stream didn't advertise I was gonna
be giving anything away because I just
didn't want people to come for the sake
of getting a giveaway so this is a
secret giveaway where I am going to be
giving you guys somebody in here I
haven't decided how I'm gonna do it yet
it's not gonna be done through twitter
is coming to through comments and i
think i might just pick like a favorite
comment I don't know maybe I'll do a
question like you know why do you guys
why are you subscribed to jay's two
cents or something like that and I'll
pick my favorite answer but I'm going to
be giving you a download key for a tomb
raider for pc so that's like a
fifty-dollar game $55 games up like that
so it's going to be somebody's in this
stream and that's just for simply
showing up today and being a loyal
viewer without being enticed ahead of
time so again a tomb raider for pc i'm
going to be giving that out at the
sometime in this stream and then i will
be met private messaging and decode to
the winner so hope you guys stick around
for that how we doing over here on the
phone where we at now we here at one
percent yay maybe I'd help if I turned
like everything off it was running on
this phone holy crap
oh yeah we're at 1% the moment and my
battery in here is still at half so
we'll see how this does uh sure tube
sure to go sure t'kul 10 11 still what
am I going to start straining tomb
raider probably next week sometime but
the week after that to me kind of busy
because that following weekend i'm going
to be taking a trip to las vegas and so
I've gotten have a lot of things to do
to get ready for that trip so I don't
know if I'll how much time i'll get the
stream might even stream some tonight
holy crap who knows maybe I will maybe I
won't by the way guys the people who are
already staying me please pick me to
pick me for the giveaway that's not
going to get you picked I never picked
the people who say pick me and that's it
because when I do giveaways it's going
to require a little bit of effort kind
of like the people who were sort of like
complaining that it you had to go on
twitter to get the giveaway if all you
have to do it a chance to win something
is put in an email address and click
sign up for something then you know
sorry you got to put a little work in
and get something back if you want and
most almost everything I've ever
received through the YouTube work that
I've been doing when companies send me
product and such I've given back or in
some way giving back to the community so
hey all I ask is that you guys do a
little bit of work and that it be follow
me on Twitter or something along those
lines like the Facebook page I think
that's a pretty fair trade if you ask me
sure to go okay thank you sure to go I
don't like making I don't like
mutilating people's names funny 36 full
says I'm sexy and I think you're blind
so do I like Corsair I'll of course
there I love their fans I love their
cases in fact i even went online today
to check the availability of a 900d
because I want to be buying one with the
earnings from last month i'm even buying
a 900 d i'm gonna be doing a build in
that and making a video out of it of
course and speaking of a build video
mentioned it on twitter and facebook
earlier today that i am going to be i'm
going to hey guys by the way don't give
me the reasons why you guys like Jays
two cents for the
for that give away yet I'm going to tell
you guys when to do it because anything
you guys are saying now chances are i
may not see so just keep that in mind if
you're just now joining i just dropped a
little bit of a surprise and be giving
away a copy of the tomb raider for pc to
one lucky viewer here via the comments
and what you're going to have to do is
tell me why you like Jace to sense what
you like about my channel and i'm going
to pick my favorite answer and i'm going
to give that person a copy of tomb
raider so that's what it is but anyway
I'm going I'm going to be doing a remake
of the how to beat build a pc video that
I did because I watched it and I thought
that then you know it was good for what
it was but still for the basic builder
there's going to be more guidance needed
so I've decided that I'm going to do
that I'm going to redo the video with a
build that I'm picking up the parts for
tomorrow and then it's basically the
exact same parts except for a different
fractal case that I just did with the
7870 and the ud3 and all that it's going
to be the same components just a
different case but I've got the fractal
XLR to the fractal define XLR to case
review coming up and now i'm going to be
doing the fractal design are for case
and they are for is smaller than they
are to what ever since that makes so if
you guys are interested in in really
awesome inexpensive cases that are quiet
and like amazing at repelling dust i
definitely recommend the fractal the
fractal is amazing let's refresh the
twitter here check facebook see anything
is coming over there nothing yet okay
let's get back here to some of the
comments shall we x elements 15 says
he's only 13 and you're building a pc i
hope you read this i am reading that and
I'm more curious as to why it says x
elements 15 if you're only 13 I try to
squeeze in a couple of years on me all
right Tommy Taylor 97 1 overclocked
could you get out of a 3770k using a
corsair h100 you could get 4.5 you could
probably have 4.5 if you have a chip
that doesn't mind a lot of old or
doesn't need a lot of voltage you see
when you overclock processors every
single chip requires a different voltage
frequency and you know it they're not
exactly the same you can't take my 3770k
is that i use and yours and side by side
compare them and get the exact same
results out of the same voltages it just
doesn't work that way as too many
variants is in in all that micron size
you know architecture that's inside
those CPUs so anyway the CP meta says
you and Linus streaming at the same time
double monitor engaged hi Linus and
diesel you know I've never really
watched it Linus live stream I don't
know what it is Linus is one of those
guys I go to for information and I like
his reviews don't know much about him as
a person though he's got so many videos
like 1700 videos but you know it's it's
all unboxings and stuff so I'm just not
that into unboxing videos that's just me
um x elements 15 says look at my
paragraph as i dedicated on why your sub
to you i'm having rewrite that later
when this time has it okay let's see for
you it's a hundred-dollar game what tomb
Raider's $100 game really okay abacar
says i think that one of the main
reasons people watch you besides the
tech is because you have so much in
common with us i know that's the reason
why you do yeah i'm just a regular guy
and that's why i don't like I don't like
the idea of ever becoming a big youtuber
but I kind of would like that in the
same sense that i'd like to be able to
break the mold as one of those youtubers
who seriously like separates himself
between him and his viewers but i also
know it's very unrealistic to think that
I can possibly continue to respond to
every tweet Facebook message private
message both channels just get blown up
every single day with private messages
and comments and it's just impossible
it's absolutely impossible i'm sure you
guys have noticed that I try and reply
to comments the ones that definitely
deserve a response but last month guys I
head over 5,700 comments that's
impossible that's just the check channel
doesn't include the vlog channel or
Twitter or Facebook or any of that stuff
so it's becoming a point to where it's
it's going to be overwhelming and I'm
going to do the best I can so that's why
I'm gonna have to find some way to have
like you know viewer appreciation you
know engagement in some way so 10 we'll
figure it out and that's what the that's
why I like to do the live streams I like
to interact with you now in life and
hopefully I see your comments but you
know it's just it's not always that easy
teku 175 says you're hoping to start off
with a bang and get successful on
YouTube you're only 14 and you're
working off of your parents small income
unfortunately your ages against you it's
honestly against you there's very very
very few successful young miner
youtubers it's just the truth and you
know you're just gonna have to grind it
and develop your style and everything
that way once you're an adult you can
then just kind of fall into your groove
because at 14 you're not going to get
big now but there are there is one
youtuber out there he's 12 and he's got
a few hundred thousand subscribers but
it's such a one-off okay what let's see
the easy says what's your favorite phone
iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy s3 I use my
iphone 5 over the galaxy my problem with
the galaxy is I still find it to be a
horrible on battery life even in battery
saving mode with and there's like no
apps on the thing I've got literally
three applications installed outside of
the preloaded apps so you can't blame
the apps on being the reason why the
batteries die so fast on the thing and
it's still kind of awkward for me to
hold I mean I don't have like girly
hands I have pretty long fingers but I
just I still find it awkward to hold
mostly because of the rounded edges I'm
just so used to the squared you know
design and shape of the iphone where
when I hold this it feels like it's
gonna fall out of my hand all the time
and I don't really like that by the way
the phone is up to eight percent already
awesome and we're down to one battery
light left so we'll see what we get out
of it I guess
so but I there is so much about this
phone though that i truly do like like I
like the screen size I really do um
anyway yeah funny 36 says I know I hate
it when youtubers get so big that they
don't respond to comments and such it's
not that they choose not to respond I
mean I'm I'm good I'm good friends
outside of YouTube with boogie 2988 and
he's got four hundred and four hundred
and forty thousand now I want I want to
put this into perspective for you guys
he's at 440,000 if any of you watch
baseball uh the Los Angeles Angels I
hate the fact they call in los angeles
angels cuz los angeles is crappy like
that the Anaheim Angels a call them what
they really are hat the angel stadium
has 46 thousand seats in it forty-six
thousand and when boogie was kind of
upset yesterday think was yesterday
about that video that someone made a you
know call him out about him being you
know one of those on his high horse type
youtubers and you know that he treats
people like crap and doesn't respond to
people and chooses to ignore them
because he's better than them and this
and that you know get was little bit
down about that but I had sent him this
picture of a packed stadium it was angel
stadium 45,000 people sitting in there
standing room only no seats available
and I said you see this picture are you
looking at this picture and he says yep
I'm looking what am I supposed to see
here he's all I see Stanley Steamer and
she says I see smoke I see baseball and
what am I looking at I said that's angel
stadium there is just under forty five
thousand seats I said your fan base
would require every single seat in 10 of
these stadiums in order to fit in one
place and I said now you tell me anybody
can respond to all of them and he looked
at he says Wow he says that just hit me
like a hammer so right now 10,000 may
not be a huge number but what's the
likelihood that 10,000 people are
sending me a message or calm
or something and I'm doing my best i can
to respond to that but I've already I've
already gotten some people who've gotten
upset because I didn't respond or didn't
respond fast enough or they thought i
was ignoring them I do the best I can
guys and I'm going to continue to do the
best I can I set aside time every single
day to try and catch up on on all of the
all of the messages and such the
comments good luck on that one there's
just too many that come in I have a car
says is it okay if I type your paragraph
on your message one away is ok if you
type up your paragraph on facebook page
the comments don't give you enough room
try and make it fit on the comment i
want to keep it all in one place that
way someone can't say you didn't read me
on twitter you didn't read me on
Facebook or whatever um let's see here
the almighty Kim says cheese cheese
cheese I'm not sure cheese's your you
are in a text stream might seem to be oh
I guess somebody's lost if you're
looking for the Dairy Queen it's down
the left or go turn left go down to the
sign hang a right and then go left at
raywilliamjohnson you'll be good he
hangs out outside the dairy queen all
the time and you know doing autographs
and stuff so mmt g.skill says hey Jay
our users are you looking forward to the
new consoles no I'm not because I'm not
a huge console player in fact I pretty
much dubbed my xbox 360 the Forza 4
blocks because that's all I ever played
on there with my friends as Forza 4 so
yeah whatever I'm happy dr. coffee md
hey I love coffee and you're a doctor of
it so you're like my new hero okay i
love the tech community hope to get into
it yourself someday yeah the tech
community is definitely different on
youtube than other channels that's for
sure we're a lot geekier we have much
smaller fan bases than anyone else but
we all have that in common that we're
nude and we like computers and stuff and
display and we talk megahertz and we
talk ram and we talked about monitors
and keyboards and mouses somebody asked
me what my favorite gaming mouse was
still and i'm still using my mx518 right
here and if you look at the bottom
I want to see I just tried to grab the
mouse that I was holding in my other
hand okay if you hook on the bottom here
you can get it I made it go away okay
let's try this again if you look on the
bottom of my mouse you can see it is
worn to hell look at this look at how
worn out the feet are these feet right
here bent like that's uncomfortable when
I slide the mouse I've got to replace
the feet on these so yeah I think this
mouse has been through it a day and I've
had people think that this mouse is like
dented would you do it your mouth for
what happened it's a design it's smooth
scented and I also like the fact that it
has on the fly at dpi adjustments right
here with these two buttons I could make
it less sensitive and more sensitive so
I still love my mx518 that is my go-to
mouse it's not available anymore really
unless to go to like Amazon or something
so anyway bun too addicted says hey Jay
originally sub to you because of tech
addiction and now I stay because you
have tons of knowledge because I have
tons of knowledge regarding current pc
components yeah and I've mentioned it
already tech addiction is coming back I
mean bringing the breck back here in the
next few weeks so stay tuned for that
and I think I'm it's something I'll be
able to have a lot of fun with now that
I have a fan base that would be willing
to watch it ah yawn odo says you pulled
the feet off your mouse it's actually
smoother now yeah except for this one
here I don't know if it would be a
smooth because of the I could probably
pull this one off the side and try it
right now I'll do it on the stream yeah
there you're a genius I'm just kidding
yeah I pulled that one off the side but
it still that little residue on there
yeah it slides nicely but there I want
to get some of those those nylon feet
like the white nylon that that goes on
here and it slides better yeah I I like
that and you can get it like frozen CPU
or something the CP meta says I was
entering something and need to do one of
those picture letter number things it's
a J's to see tap what Jays two cents ah
ok up confused uh
x ailments 15 says Jays are you a
computer engineer at side of YouTube I a
man i am a lot of things outside of
YouTube but at my I do officially in my
career capacity yes I do work with
networks and servers and computers and
hardware and software and quality
assurance I do a lot of stuff eat eat
ochita j should i leave my desktop on
all day or turn it on turn it off and on
I don't leave my computer on ever won
because I'm water-cooled but even if I
did have an air-cooled computer I would
never leave it on simply because one why
continue to put all that current through
one your meter and pay for it through
the electricity company and two why just
add all of that time spent on your hard
drive spinning if you have a mechanical
drive and just for it to sit there I
don't understand it ubuntu addicted do
you support any linux and unix servers
we used to however now we are all
running windows servers and VMS and such
we do not have any Linux or UNIX any
longer XL is 15 what university of
college hard for it because i really
love tech and i want to be when I grew
up mmm I'm not sure where you live but
you need to find computer science
programs near you let's see what too
addicted again how did you come up with
your original entry of graphics you tell
about the one with the flying in likes
week bubbles and stuff that was all done
on I did that on PowerPoint actually you
can do a lot of animation with
powerpoint i just threw that together
one day and people loved it and I've
kept it I've thought about updating it
to be a little bit more like you know
digitally I guess so it's the same
concept so I haven't I haven't done
anything with that yet but I'm going to
as we got 15 more minutes in the stream
I'm literally getting out of here in the
moment the clock strikes seven because
I'm going shopping with the wife and the
daughter and I'm starving so the Michael
Willis have I yep i have i have you
sewed because i enjoy your videos and I
trust your opinions in your style is
rather entertaining yeah I am a funny
looking guy I'm easy to laugh at I
pretend to be smart and I make a bunch
of funny
she's right Arnold I'll see that makes
you wanna sub right or unsub one of the
two I said was not what okay um no the
red white diagonal lines oh I'm not I'm
not sure I follow you it's just an image
I made in photoshop it was literally a
paintbrush that I stamped over the top
of a white background took like a second
and a half took longer to load up the
program then did to make that image okay
yeah you know what guys it's 14 minutes
I'm gonna end this so go ahead and write
your paragraphs as to why you are sub to
me if you want to win if you want me to
pick your paragraph and win a free pc
copy of Tomb Raider a complete copy now
it is a mature 15 plus age-restricted
gonna have to if any of you guys have
already admitted to me that you're 14
and one guy says he's 13 gonna have to
talk to your mama but not about the game
no okay that was uncalled for okay so go
ahead and start writing those and I'm
just gonna chat a little bit here and
see how far this batteries gotten where
we at right now fifteen percent already
holy crap yeah fifteen percent this
thing is still got a whole battery
charge left on it this thing has already
charged two iphones and a GoPro and now
we're at fifteen percent charged on the
galaxy and you guys saw this thing was
completely dead at the beginning of the
stream so that's the tylt powerplant for
you i will be doing a review on this
it's an amazing device that they were
willing to send me and certainly deserve
that props this is made in china go
figure
ah how many of you guys want well I was
going to say how many of you guys want
me to do a review on these wireless g 9
30 s but I really think that these are
amazing to listen to like there's 7.1
surround the basin these are amazing
just the quality of the sound they are
completely over the ear your ear fits
all the way inside here so they are
noise cancelling 100% noise canceling
but the microphone on this thing oh my
god it sounds like I'm talking through a
tin can into a walkie-talkie being
streamed over dial-up that's how bad
this microphone sounds it's horrible and
i went to the logitech forms and tried
to find out from them if there was
something i was doing wrong and it
turned out that there were tons and tons
and tons of help tickets that have been
started on the forum about that
particular headset and their their
excuse was if because of the 7.1
bandwidth and the amount of data being
sent over the wireless signal for the
bandwidth that they had to had to reduce
the quality of the microphone down to 16
k and because of that the microphone
took a hit in order to have better sound
quality so people said okay well then
how come when we plug it in and we run
it wired it doesn't get any better and
there was no response yeah because the
logitech has horrible microphones just
like the microphone built into this guy
right here is a piece of crap all right
let's go ahead guys I'm going to start
reading the little B little bit of these
out loud and then i'm going to pick a
winner here when we got 10 minutes left
in the stream so i'm gonna start at the
beginning first one written here jacob
kor asek i hope of saying your name

x elements 15-6 goddamn it and he's the
13 year old such a potty mouth techies
1756 go down to see my long paragraph my
parents let me play anything and support
your dream Aaron Hill says I like what
happened over here I just actually got
texted by my my see this is how Jays two
cents this this is how lucky I am that I
have a connection at microcenter so that
I this guy that messages got right there
says all right everything is pulled
aside and waiting in the cart in the
back just go to the department and ask
for your stuff I don't have to use their
online like you know why all this
instead of the side and pay us ahead of
time sort of thing at microcenter I have
a person at microcenter that I call in
contact and tell him what I want he sets
it aside and he gives me like a really
good deal on some of this stuff like it
you know the we're not gonna discuss the
price on the label we're going to
discuss you know that deal sort of thing
so there are so many benefits to this
and I'm really lucky for so it really
makes me be able to give some of the
people I bike or build computers for a
really good deal because I'm able to
pass on that deal so it's just excited
because I'm going to pick up those parts
tomorrow and just confirm that they're
ready to go alright so Aaron Hill says I
like Jace two cents because i think you
have a great addiction like me and
computers and you have a great responses
EG i had trouble choosing and video GPU
for AMD and i see a video on it the same
night see that's my telepathy I know I'm
like okay mmm people are thinking about

okay in front of a lot of people Tom
Taylor 97 since 12 create his own
computer and he found my advice to be
helpful and unbiased after watching a
fever videos I thought you were really
entertaining and subbed and I never miss
a video I appreciate that I appreciate
the people who never missed videos
because a lot of work goes into him
bullmastiff says he has an HP compaq
presario cq56 2 gigabytes ram celeron
dual-core and it lags certainly when you
edit in the timing of eclipses musical
tonight Mary any suggestions to be great
yeah getting ditched the seller on man
you're stressing the hell out of that
thing that's that's the honest answer t3
schism says hey Jay I'm sub because I
enjoy your structured opinions and
overall knowledge regarding technology i
also like how wise you are in general
and how you interact with the fans
actively i try and then if you saw it
earlier it said it's getting freakin
hard Tally's taxi says hey jay i got it
late and and couldn't hold a signal so
I'll catch you later after you replay it
hope you take care hope all is well hey
tell tallies taxi he's a blogger like me
so if you click his name it'll take you
to his channel to check it out he's
really into a weight-loss journey like I
am so you know if you're looking for
advice on weight loss and just what it's
like to go through it makes you check
out my blog in his grift oz I'm
originally subbed for the videos like
the CPUs and GPUs and you look at my
other videos and love them have a good
sense of humor but i'm also an informal
at the same time yeah i try and beat
informal and inform it at the same time
uh let's see Kryptos had this big
smaller to you yeah but fate fennel
fennel says his dad works at microcenter
gets great discounts yeah microcenter
does have it gives good discounts to the
public to giggy giggy PM says I found
you through boogie started watching your
tech page and i love the amazing work
tutorials and fun and have this same
stuff i love your vlog channel is
fantastic also I'm really relatable hey
thank you I think I've been losing a lot
of boogie subs Lee's the ones that have
come in because I still get more subs at
the end of the day but the you know I
still lose anywhere between 25 and 30
times a day but I you know I'll gain
like 70 a day but I lost 30 so that
means a hundred people really click
Subscribe that day but 30 or 35 of them
clicked unlike our unsub so it is what
it is I I was feeling a little down
about that one day I went the book you
know was like man I've lost like 2,000
subscribers since I've started I was
like what am i doing wrong he's are you
not doing anything wrong people one sub
it's just wait it is people unsub every
single day and so I said yeah but two
thousand and he goes hold on and he goes
he looks at his he says you know a
hundred thousand people have
unsubscribed to me since I've started
I'm like okay so I guess to thousands
really not that bad so anyway um you're
also subbed for my stash that stash is
getting shaved off when i'm done with
this i ran out of time shaving so i was
like oh i'll do the whole jack sparrow
thing for a bit I look French oh ok uh
Brian what why are there only be 54
people watching that's unacceptable
that's all right it's 50 people I'm
happy or watching jeez okay bryan
pearsall says i'm a subscriber because
your unbiased hilarious and he never Lou
and I never lose my already short
attention span ironically hate pennies
but your two cents are worth more than
anything else they're indian head penny
so they're worth like 5 cents apiece so
really should be JS ten cents yep but
then it you know I can't even make a
phone call on ten cents so ubuntu says
you subscribe because your vast
knowledge on current PC components your
cooling knowledge and overclocking
definitely an overclocker
I'd vaccaro's dad's typing haha I didn't
even know he posted a picture on
facebook yeah it's a scary resemblance
I'm tell you that much MTG skill says
I'm subscribed because you care for your
subs in your knowledge of Technology and
it uses its uses and application and my
hair are you that guy I love that you
stream on many occasions and connected
your subs yes I try the light stream at
least once a week either a thursday or
friday but yeah Jacob says you are a
first youtuber I've done live streams
with and if I do miss them i still like
to watch the whole thing i've noticed
i'll still get like almost a thousand
plays on the on the replay so that's
kind of exciting sorry had to respond to
a message there ok how do i feel what
AMD processors processors at the moment
I love my pile driver my 8350 I've got
the thing up to five point one four gig
stable I run it at 4.8 every day and the
next one's supposed to be better because
steam steam roller is apparently rumored
to no longer have shared l2 cache
between modules see there's four modules
inside the pile driver and the bulldozer
and there's two cores per module but
each module has one cache set up with
LTE l2 cache so those two processors
that have their cores that have to use
the same cache apparently they split
finally so it's going to be eight
physical cores eight individual cash for
each core which is supposed to
incredibly increase the single threaded
or the single core performance on that
which I'm really excited about anyway I
like how people were continuing now it's
like everyone's trying to one-up each
other I this wasn't like a kiss JS but
on I just this is consider this rd how's
that that's my average words per minute
106 words per minute 0 errors I just
took a test earlier today in the purple
panda 279 70s I currently have one and
I'm looking to upgrade your build is it
worth to depends what do you play if you
play on a 1080p monitor no it's not
worth it i'd put the money into
something else y de for people leave
much done them people come and go all
the time their connection could have
died the mom could be yelling at them
their wife could be yelling at them they
could have accidentally clicked on
no ichi that says he subbed after
watching me a boogies channel you
interact with the viewers and your view
videos are awesome okra is a second we
got two more minutes okay as a second
paragraph is also you are hilarious and
you can actually give us a straight
