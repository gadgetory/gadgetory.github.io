learning opportunity just sort of
presents itself yo J the define are six
in white you think fine are six in white
okay okay it's an arsenic but it's not
new in fact it's not even all white I
mean what's with the black front really
coming from the guy with the black and
white car black hood black boy that's
different it's the same that's not the
same exact same thing not the same fine
change it then how with the custom wrap
from slick wraps front panel whole case
whatever you want even custom designs us
that's right we did do that video about
the custom wrapped our six choose any of
their existing designs or customize your
own upload it and they'll make it for
you see wow you really can make these
custom with rats
okay so what you see right here are the
pumps out of skunkworks these are over
well about four years old
ish they're laying D five pumps even
though they say alpha cool on there they
are all D fives are made by the same
manufacturer by laying so you have a PWM
version and a standard this is the one
that does not oh I should pray that
little knob back in I digress
these are all made by the same companies
doesn't matter what brand they are but
what you're about to see me do will
apply to any defy PWM or standard you
know dial variable they're called Vario
they're var I of area whatever not
beside the point so we just did a update
to skunkworks oh you guys I don't know
when this video is going live but you
may have seen it or you're gonna see it
soon I did my my system flush used the
proper cleaner in there got all the
green out it was running perfectly clear
did my video filled the loops and yeah
we're not about my business came back
about three days later turned on my
system and was in the BIOS actually
gonna set up fans and stuff on
skunkworks who had done fan profiles yet
and notice that my temperatures were
rising at about one degree every two to
three seconds which is usually
indicative of the really poor flow rate
or no flow at all and then my system my
79 60 X at stock speed stock voltage
point eight volts was actually resting
at about 65 degrees Celsius on water I'm
like nope something's not right here
then I noticed if I touch the bottom of
the pump like right here with it in the
system I didn't feel any vibration which
told me the pump wasn't running then it
done I mean neither of them was running
and I thought did I mess up the polarity
on the wires or something now I know I
didn't touch the wires the same MO let's
pin out they've always been then it
dawned on me I was hearing the
click-click-click-click
inside of the pump which I've heard
before which meant dead pump so I
decided this opportunity to take it
apart because I actually fixed one I'm
going to show you how I did it today
what the problems were and the kind of
things you need to think about with
long-term use of vanity fluids I'm call
them vanity fluids like Mayhem's pastel
pretty much Hillview especially the view
this is actually the true flute which is
another pastel fluid because although I
was pretty sure I prepped the system
there's some nooks and crannies that you
just can't get to with a cleaner that
requires disassembly yes I know this is
probably why you don't water cool but
it's okay it's a learning opportunity so
I can help you guys now I don't
recommend this but I'm gonna show you
guys right now that this pump is working
and then I'll show you a nonworking one
right here the reason why I don't
recommend this is this is the d5 this is
just a magnet this just just rests on a
magnet it's got a little bearing right
there which is still kind of dirty as
you can see it's one thing we'll be
showing her here that little like nylon
bearing it's a whole ball bearing that
rests on this and it spins on a magnetic
field as this spins fluid is drawn into
the center of this core and then it gets
pushed out the sides as you can see
those veins in there and that is
actually how a pump works so as you can
see I can spin this moves around freely
it's not stuck and when I turn it on you
can see it starts up and it spins so
when I turn it off if we take a look at
that bearing hook it turned black it
turned black that's because we have
buildup and gunk inside of this floating
they call it in power it is an impeller
yes but it's the whole piece because
it's floating on a magnet I don't know
what it's called but that's besides the
point so obviously we need to clean that
out so let me show you what's happening
over here on this pump that's not
working
hopefully the mic will pick it up
right there so that's the pump basically
starting and stopping and starting and
stopping now my initial thoughts when I
heard that because I felt I've dealt
with this before and I'm on a d5 pump
long time ago in fact when I was doing
the redness build it was a bad
out-of-the-box pump thought maybe there
was a short or something in there and
that's what I was kind of expecting with
this one but that ended up not being the
case so I'm going to take this apart now
and show you exactly what we found
inside now I ran this system for three
days with a prep assistant prep in a
cleaner Mayhem's blitz cleaning solute
has been through here before but if you
recall this particular system has gone
through quite a few versioning of
versions versioning whatever you want
it's had yellow it's had the yellow turn
brown it's had the yellow reinstalled
and turned brown again it is had orange
that turned brown there's a theme there
we have had the original green fluid
there was more of an emerald green and I
changed the color now to more of a
regular pastel eat green and then this
is the most latest green that we're
putting in there so over the last four
years this has had quite the various
changes of fluid and every single time I
always made sure I cleaned out the
system with distilled water and
solutions until it ran perfectly clear
no matter what product is on the market
no matter what any man offend
manufacturer will tell you you're gonna
leak it all over your table that's there
we go there's that no matter what any
manufacturer tells you there is no
perfect product out there I'm sorry and
there and if I'm not gonna like that I'm
saying this you know hey factures
everywhere hey J for exposing this trade
secret there is absolutely no fluid
cleaner out there that is going to do
the job of a disassembly you have to
disassemble it sometimes so this is what
it looks like on the inside of the pump
right there you can see how sediment has
sort of kind of rested in between the
o-ring and the housing and you can get
an idea of how old this this pumping
system is to this this ek you know X res
csq isn't even available anymore so
we're gonna go ahead and take this pump
apart but that's the o-ring from the
other
do you see how gunked-up that is you can
see the outside the o-rings to clean
because that's where it was actually
pushing up against the outside of the
housing but look at the inside where all
the fluid touches look at all that
buildup on there there's even still
orange on there and I haven't had this
system orange in a long time
and I ran a couple different types of
fluids when it was orange and not all of
them were pastel so you can see it sort
of builds up let's take this one off the
sate we got this one's actually not as
bad that's not as bad as all I'm gonna
assume this is the GPU
no that's the CPU one so hey well there
you go but this one right here this is
one I've already cleaned mostly you can
see I can sort of spin that and it's got
a little bit of rotation now watch this
when I go to start it under power
obviously it's not moving and you can
hear it making that click sound sound
again oh it's trying move that do you
see a try but I'm not even gonna touch
this one yet I already had it it's gonna
be hard for Phil because he's working
the camera he got to spin this one by
hand and I told him I wanted him to feel
how stuck this one is dude that friction
right it feels like the motor is on and
resisting yeah now watch happens when I
take it off you ready it gets built up
in there and that is what's keeping it
from being able to spin now if we just
sort of dry this out a little bit more
get that bearing nice and clean it
should start right up now so what what
if otherwise been just thrown away is
now ready for service almost ready I got
to do some take some distilled water
take a bottle brush clean it out however
whatever method you want to use to clean
it just clean out the inside there where
all the gunk can get built up and rides
on this little white it's a bearing but
the bearing doesn't move because this
piece is moving so like a reverse
bearing if you will but that is I just
we decided to make this impromptu video
because I wanted to show you guys
especially if you have a d5 what could
have looked like bad pumps that ends up
in the trash and these are like 80 bucks
apiece that's not cheap is now gonna be
living on inside of skunk works so
thanks for watching today's video share
this video with someone that you may
have if you if you've seen someone on
forums or whatever complain of a d5 that
stopped working
have them check this it's very rare that
these clumps die the electronics and
Easy's these are industrial pumps these
pumps were designed for purposes other
than computers it's just laying realize
that hey people are using the art pumps
and retrofitting them for computers why
don't we make a housing which can it
knows that ugly plastic housing so that
they can just plug it into their
computers in the 12-volt while wires are
already there so these are industrial
grade they are meant to last in four
years does use but usually not enough to
kill them unless you really don't take
you know good care of it so alright
thanks for watching guys go fix your
pumps share with people who you think
would help and as always we'll see you
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
