here at the convention center finally on
day three by heading to in win something
I'm always looking forward to what
anyone as they show something new first
we've got to thank our sponsor and of
course that is Corsair in the Corsair
one high-performance desktop PC the
i-140 I 160 and I 180 to be found in the
link in description below anyone is a
brand that I've said this before so
forgive me if you already heard this is
a brand that they've they started off
making some basic chassis x' and stuff
and then throughout the years eventually
they became like the premier brand of
innovation as far as I'm concerned when
it comes to let's just make something
who cares what it costs we're just gonna
make it why the held on like that
chassis over there but that's not new we
saw that a copy text last year this
right here is the new 9 to 8 they say
they heard me when I complain not really
complained but just I personally didn't
use in winch a C's for a lot of my
builds until the D Frame 2.0 because of
the FET or the D frame not too pretty or
whatever it's the D frame because it
didn't fit more than one radiator and
because I like to use multiple graphics
cards high court count CPUs and just
water cool all the things a single 360
normally wouldn't get the job done for
me so they kind of took what I said and
on the chassis I'm assuming they were
already designing and just went balls to
the wall with it so this particular
chassis can fit well pretty much ATX
micro ATX ITX holy crap TX my holy crap
TX I mean of course it's got the Dominus
extreme in there which you've seen all
over CES which is just this massively
large motherboard in fact I'd even off
the top of my head what the form factor
is but it's got two 24-pin power supply
cables on this so it's got three of
their 140 millimeter crown RGB fans
family saw on Twitter that they said
they were gonna send to us because I
said the Polaris although great fan not
enough static pressure they're like
we've got a fan for you you're gonna
want to check out I can feel the air all
the way
back here so yeah that's what they're
using all their ads you can do dual 420
millimeter radiators so that's three 140
millimeter fans on the top side by side
so that shows you how wide the chassis
is which is probably the only complaint
having not built in it I can't really
give you a full in-depth list of
opinions on the chassis but my only
observation of something I think might
be something I don't like is just the
width but you got you can't compromise
you can't say well we're gonna put a
dual 4:20 side-by-side and still make it
narrow I mean just math it doesn't work
that way right look how wide I am I'd
like to be narrower but I can so
whatever I digress here we go right here
we also have a 20 80 TI Strix card that
is sitting vertical because it does have
native vertical mount built into it and
of course you can go horizontal if you
want we have three 140 millimeter fans
exhausting air on the back like I said
the 2 420 is on the top bringing air up
but it comes to air flow I'm gonna
hopefully I apologize ahead of time if
this drops it won't hopefully so when
you put this on right here you can see
that you have a gap all around it so it
brings an air off the sides you've got
this beautiful laser-cut piece of
aluminum solid piece of aluminum all the
way around you guys remember the S frame
that was a one-piece one flat piece of
aluminum that they then use a head print
freak press brake on there to bend well
they've done basically the same thing so
it basically seams right here comes all
the way up and around back to this side
well right here actually and then you've
got a solid bottom piece in fact let's
go take a look at the backside because
there's just as much information and
design
basically love put into the backside as
the front so you know I'm a fan of fans
but they have a fan made of six fans
that's being powered by only three of
the fans because apparently six fans was
too much and it was dangerous so
remember that dual 24-pin I mentioned on
that motherboard obviously have to have
dual power supply so you can see right
here we have our power supply blackest
black kids so it does come with both
brackets so for this chassis in fact
this case has so much room in it they
did dual reservoir with pump in the
front and added another reservoir where
the tower res in the back that's why
you're seeing so much crazy water flow
because these pumps are also running
full speed all the parts are supplied by
ek that part obviously the water clean
parts don't come with the chassis but
they're showing what you could do with
it
so if you don't want to run both power
supplies obviously you take one of the
brackets out and you have more room on
the back to mouth more hard drives and
stuff in there there may not be native
support on the back of the motherboard
tray that's threaded but of course with
some double-sided tape you can do
anything but it does have two and a half
inch and three and a half inch hard
drive and SSD support on the motherboard
tray holes drilled you can use your
screws and mount them there so this is
what happens I think when you have an
amazing design team that's kind of like
how do we one-up ourselves well you come
up with the nine to eight that's how you
do it anyway guys thanks for watching
our coverage here CES 2019 oh I forgot
to mention the thumb screws these are
not outsourced these are CNC milled
thumb screws out of aluminum the amount
of effort they put into just a thumb
screw
alright guys check out how insane n1 is
by going to in wyndcomm but you guys can
also check out the rest of our CES
coverage and of course a huge negative
