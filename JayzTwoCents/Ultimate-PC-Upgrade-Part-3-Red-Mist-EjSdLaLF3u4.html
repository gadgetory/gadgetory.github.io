just gonna go ahead and frickin dive
right in the mastercase 5 and mastercase
5 pro from Coolermaster combines
modularity with creativity giving you
the freedom to build it your way make it
yours by clicking the link down in the
description all right so the new ek
radiators for my client build here red
mist
are in and I'm not going to actually
flush these out of the system I'm gonna
do a full system flush once everything
is in and I'm going to end up using like
the Blitz Pro probably end up using the
Blitz Pro even though a lot of folks say
you can get away without flushing the ek
rads I'm not even gonna take that chance
but anyway changing out the radiators
here is gonna be really easy there's no
tubing or anything hooked up to it which
is why I waited obviously to do the
tubing up here in the compartment
because the radiators are slightly
different slightly thicker etc etc so
we're gonna get that done today we are
going to at the very least get all the
PE TG loop done because remember I use
PT G as a template on cutting the glass
and this is going to be a glass loop
when all is said and done we have a lot
of glass and I'm not talking about meth
I am talking about glass tubing in fact
let me show you how much we got so we
actually have two of these tubes full of
the glass tubing so we've got way more
than enough here but at the very least
like I said I get the PE T G loop done
might change the runs a little bit I
have it the runs it sounds like the
computer ate too much Taco Bell but I
might change it up just a little bit I
haven't exactly decided how I want to do
it yet alright anyway I got like I said
I got a lot to do and very little time
to get it done today I have some
out-of-town company coming in no it's
not Jerry but I got to get this done so
let's let's go
okay so I apologize about how crappy
this video is you guys deserve so much
more than I'm actually providing you in
this video but I am out of time I just
am by myself today I've got out-of-town
guests coming I know I'm repeating
myself I gotta get to the gym I just
have too much getting on I stopped edit
this video and yeah this is one of those
videos I did and edited the same day it
went up so there's a lot of time I don't
have the grammars hard words or things
and whatever
don't judge me so the loop is mocked up
and it's all mocked up with PE T G and I
say mocked up because I'm not using
fittings for the bends simply because
I'm being lazy but because we are doing
glass tubing like I said at the start of
this video and you use PE tee at least I
use PE tee G to get all of my
measurements that way I'm going cutting
the glass once and not wasting glass so
here it is right here now I do have
obviously soft tubing going down the
backside of the case and soft tubing in
the basement just like it was setup
before and you guys can check out the
old videos if you want to know exactly
what I mean but I think it looks really
good right here I've got this pipe
running directly underneath this
reservoir and I just got lucky that
these fittings turned out to be exactly
the right height very this is actually
identical to the way I did it in skunk
works that's how I it's how it kind of
knew that was going to work out to be
honest with you and this is all exactly
the same right here as skunk works but
anyway I think it turned out pretty damn
good now before I get out of here
showing you guys you know some of the
close-ups and stuff I want to show you
two tools that I use to cut ptg one is
fairly expensive one is fairly
inexpensive but they're both going to
give you the same result now this guy
right here this is uh this is really
just an industrial cutter tool that you
can I believe bill Owen is selling these
I believe mods ooh and other other
modders are selling this tool but
literally this is not specific to water
cooling this is just specific to plastic
tube cutting and you basically just
clamp that down and then one gets all
the way through you push that button and
it retracts but when it comes to cutting
the PE TG it's actually
very very simple there you go cuts all
the way through you can retract it that
way the problem is this tool here is
fairly pricey now I've also got this guy
here and I've had this thing for years
and it's actually a little bit dull you
guys saw me use this to cut the soft
tubing this is just a cobalt AKA lowe's
brand of again soft tubing cutter you
can get this in the plumbing section and
this is the same exact thing with PE TG
you just put it where you want
pull it real hard now they're gonna fly
away obviously because they're small
pieces but pull it real hard and okay I
kept them from flying that's good it
cuts it straight through with a very
nice straight cut I like that a lot
in fact I like this tool more than the
expensive guy so when I use my
inexpensive soft tubing cutter here
which this was like 15 bucks it's
perfect every single time I don't know
why I've never tried to use this in the
future because or in the past because
I've had this thing for years because
this is how I cut all myself to me I
just finally thought like wait a minute
blade is pretty sharp it feels the same
as that guy how much force does it take
to cut this thing well not too much now
you can't do that with acrylic do you do
that with acrylic you're just gonna
shatter it so it has to be PE TG tubing
or soft tubing now unfortunately there's
something here that's really bugging me
and I can't do anything about it and
that being the fact that the bits power
nickel plating and the Primo chill
nickel plating as well as the ek nickel
plating don't match the the the bits
power is actual a little bit more
brilliant it's actually a little bit
more clear anyway guys I like I said I
know you guys deserve a better video
than when I gave you today I apologize
for the shitty quality I'll do better in
the future you guys deserve better
anyway time to get out of here tell me
what you guys think about this loop
obviously I haven't put the connector
pieces here between the GPUs let yet I'm
not sure I'm gonna be able to get glass
cut that small so we're gonna have to
figure that out anyway time to go thanks
for watching I'll do better in the next
video please don't dislike this one
simply because the production value of
it sucked anyway see you guys later
thanks for watching don't unsub
unless you really feel like you want to
then hit that button anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
