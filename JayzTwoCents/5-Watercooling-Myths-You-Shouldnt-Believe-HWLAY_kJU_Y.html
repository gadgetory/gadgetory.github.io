here and you know last week I did a five
pc myths explained video and you guys
really liked it and I asked you what do
you guys want me to do and kind of
follow up with that series and
overwhelmingly you guys said please do a
water cooling version well I've actually
done that back in 2014 but here we are
three years later does no problem doing
it again right we can recycle content
around here remember reduce reuse
recycle so I would do things around here
we reuse my can I just read up load it
with today's date cooler masters master
key Pro series of keyboards offer
sixteen point seven million color RGB
genuine interior switches a variety of
sizes as well as surface mounted
controls allowing full customization
without the need for stand-alone
software learn more by following the
link down below ok so there's going to
be in no particular order but these are
five water cooling myths that I hear all
the time that I just want to try and
debunk the first one being a larger
reservoir gives you lower temperatures
now that's bupkus say bupkus why are you
looking at me like that when I say
bupkus that kiss means it's not good
it's wrong larger reservoirs do not
increase your cooling capacity
whatsoever all it does is take a little
bit longer for your system to reach its
max temperatures but the reservoir and
the amount of fluid in your system have
absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the
minimum and maximum temperatures that
you're going to achieve what a larger
reservoir really does is it makes it a
lot easier to fill your system and to
bleed out the air having a large
reservoir to feed the pump allowing it
to kind of prime the system more easily
without having to constantly refill it
makes it just a whole lot easier and
simpler for the Builder but it doesn't
do anything for temperatures now here's
one I think we've all heard a million
times and my inbox always has these
crazy suggestions about adding a ton of
radiators to a system to see what will
happen and that is adding more radiators
to your loop will lower your
temperatures now that's not necessarily
true because once you exceed the amount
of thermal capacity that you need for
the components in your system and they
might have heat being produced then
everything beyond that is just lost you
can't possibly go lower the room
temperature either when you're dealing
with water cooling is remember you have
an air to water exchanger so the air
temperature going through your radiator
possibly cool the fluid below what that
air temperature is which is going to be
your ambient temperatures now that
doesn't necessarily mean adding more
radiators couldn't be beneficial though
you heck you can have extra radiators
and slow your fans down to increase your
thermal capacity because remember not
only is the radiator responsible for
removing the heat from the fluid the
fans and the air is responsible for
removing the heat from the radiator so
you could add more radiator surface area
and have slower fans for a much more
silent system but you are never going to
get more cool than you are in the
environment that the system is in that's
also another thing here going to talk
about real quick kind of a bonus add-on
to this myth is adding water cooling
means you're not going to heat up your
space or your room or your office as
much and to that I would say you're
probably going to heat it up more
because you're more efficiently removing
that heat from the component to the
atmosphere
so having water-cooled systems is also
not mean doesn't mean you're going to
have a cooler room having water-cooled
systems it's probably going to heat your
room up even more so here's one I don't
hear that often anymore but it's still
worth mentioning because I heard it a
lot in the beginning when water cooling
was really starting to take off as a
genre amongst PC and busiest and that
being non-conductive fluids are safe if
they leak that's only a half-truth
because they do become conductive over
time the longer they spend touching
metals and moving through the system the
more ions they grab and collect and
because it wants to be charged it's just
like a nature of fluid to want to be
charged with ions and they can become
conductive over time now how long it
takes for that to happen and the level
of conductivity it will gain over time
is going to has way too many factors for
me able to answer that for you today but
the point here is I want to tell you
that non conductive fluids are only safe
in the beginning of their lifespan but
the longer they run in your system the
more dangerous they can become in the
event of a leak remember while water
cooling is an inherent risk when you're
dealing with fluids leaks are never good
even with a non conductive fluid now a
lot of people for this very reason will
run pure deionized or distilled water
they seem to think it's the most safe
and as long as you have some sort of an
anti corrosive anti growth inhibitor in
there then distilled water is still one
of the cheapest and safest fluids to use
in your water cooling loops now this
next one's going to be a little bit
controversial that being done
we'll gunk up your system well that's
only a partial truth once again because
there are so many factors here the type
of fluid you're using the concentrate of
the fluid you leave using with premix
was it a concentrate did you mix it
yourself did you use distilled water to
use tap water
what kind of died to use and how much
did you use so there's so many different
factors in that now if you go with some
sort of a pre-mixed coolant or die
you're probably not going to have a
problem because a manufacturer mixed it
to the proper parts per million but if
you start mixing things yourself and
coming up with custom colors you could
create some sort of pH imbalance in your
system that could promote growth which
would ultimately cause all sorts of
problems in your system so it really
comes down to you to be well I don't
know you really do your due diligence on
what's safe and what's not typically in
my experience darker colors like reds
oranges yellows and yellow is based off
a red dye by the way guys that's going
to typically give you a little bit more
of a problem than your lighter colors
like light green light blue and white
I've never had a problem with any of
those colors so honestly here if you're
a beginner I would recommend just
getting pre-mixed non concentrated fluid
pour it in and call it a day now this
next myth is one that we hear all the
time it is going to be argued forever
until the end of time and that's never
going to change and that being that loop
order matters I'm here to tell you that
it doesn't matter the only thing that
has any benefit whatsoever is putting
your reservoir in front of the pump and
higher than the pump which makes priming
your system easier but once the system
is primed in all the air is out of it
you could flip your case upside down as
long as the air stays out of the loop
and it would still pump no problem
whatsoever how do you think a i/os work
you can flip those around in any
orientation and they still work that's
the only thing that matters and it has
to do with making it easier on you to
get your system primed a lot of people
tend to think if you have your GPU
before your cpu in terms of loop order
that you're going to heat your CPU up
under load and it's just going to get
hot what that doesn't matter and I will
be doing a video showing you different
loop orders and documenting the
temperatures and showing you that it
makes negligible difference it's not
going to heat up parts as it moves over
them what's going to happen is your
system is going to equalize at a certain
temperature based on the amount of Watts
that can be dissipated
on your radiator service area but don't
go too big on your radiators remember
what we said in the other myth there is
a diminishing return there but once
you've exceeded the amount of cooling
capacity you need to keep the components
in your system cool that's where the
temperature is going to equalize that
regardless of the order of components
now there are things that can make some
minut differences two temperatures and
that being something like parallel loop
versus a series loop and that's a whole
different topic for a different day but
once again your radiator is what
determines your temperatures not the
order of your loop anyway guys you guys
requested this video and I went ahead
and did it I really am having fun doing
these myth videos and and the really
important ones like I just talked about
loop order they're going to get
follow-up videos where we actually show
it in action on the differences and the
tangible differences and how it really
boils down in real-world scenarios so
that's that thanks for watching guys and
remember if you have myths that you want
me to talk about and really good ones to
actually either do mythbuster type
scenarios on then guys make sure you
tell me down in the comments or head on
over to Twitter at juice 2 cents and let
me know that's why this video is even
made today because it was a highly
popular requested one on the last 5 pc
myths that we talked about thanks for
watching guys as always I appreciate
your views they mean a lot around here
and of course we will see you in the
next one you done back there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
