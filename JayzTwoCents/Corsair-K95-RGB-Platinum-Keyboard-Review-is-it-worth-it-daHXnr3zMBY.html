flagship keyboard the k95 RGB platinum
we took a look at this it's kind of a
first look at CES and as ice and of the
k70 in k70 RGB that i've been using for
quite a while I'm kind of curious to see
whether or not well I'm excited about
this one they bring a few new features
and bring back some old ones that people
kind of complain that they were gone so
let's go ahead and crack her open play
around with it let's see exactly what
Corsair is bringing to the table hey
that's a pun didn't mean to do that
whatever go tit now I'm going to start
with the wrist rest because this is one
of my favorite features it's removable
of course that's a big deal it's got
some of its own rubber on the bottom
here to make it an anti-slip and of
course it has got as I showed at CES the
Magnetic reversible wrist pad here so
some people like a more textured pad and
some people like a more smooth pad well
now you can just choose the one you want
flip it around stick it in the groove
and it's going to stay because it's
magnetic
the only kind of sucks about this
rubberized texture here is it does pick
up dust and fingerprints and dirt really
quickly I've been handling it here for
only a few seconds and it's already got
dirt on it so you're probably cleaning
this quite often the only other thing
you get inside the box here is of course
the warranty information here for
Corsair make sure you fill out your
warranties because that way if something
breaks how so they're going to know that
you bought it legitimately so all right
well let's uh this crap out of here and
let's look at the keyboard here she is
right in here and all of her spectrum
waving goodness now this is the part
that kind of turns a lot of people off I
think with RGB is they think oh my god
stop Abbadon all the RGB let's talk
about this here for a second people
complained when there was a color scheme
because what if you didn't want that
color
well RGB was a thing now because you can
customize the color to be whatever you
want anyway one of the first things you
might notice that's quite a bit
different with this Platinum keyboard
versus the standard k95 RGB that was
before this one is you have one row of
macro keys right here instead of three
now there is also onboard memory on this
you can say three user profiles to this
that go with you wherever you go
one of my major complaints I had
especially with the k70 RGB the color
profile I would load didn't actually
work until it was plugged into a
computer that had Corsair link on there
to allow it to load the profile it was
slaved on the machine not on the
keyboard and that was a huge mistake in
my opinion now it's saved on the
keyboard three customizable profiles
that you can put on there yourself but
as you can see when it's off it looks
quite weak and stealthy and we turn it
on it's like well check out all of those
colors I mean you got three brightness
controls right there but you got the
usual suspects when it comes to buttons
you've got your profile key your
brightness key and your windows luck and
then over here you've got mute you've
got a volume rocker as well as a well
it's actually a volume dial I'm not
really a rocker bit of dial and then of
course the multimedia function keys it
does anyone actually use those every
keyboard I think I've ever owned has had
them but I don't think I've ever used it
even once one thing I think is kind of
neat though is even the Corsair logo is
RGB so you can control that what really
stinks is when a company gives you
lighting control but then there's some
parts of the keyboard that doesn't
actually change color like for instance
if you had RGB control here but the logo
always shined red or the multimedia keys
always shined red or shone red whatever
the right term would be and it was shown
I don't know words are hard okay then it
kind of defeats the purpose of having
RGB if you forced with another color
down your throat
whatever hi digress we talked about a
little bit at CES and on the back here
you have a channel that's kind of a
cross channel here so you can control
which side of the keyboard it comes out
of this is actually designed for corded
headphone users that you can have the
headphone cord come out the middle of
the keyboard and not be routed around it
which can get in the way of your mouse
and if you're a competitive gamer then
maybe that would bother you having the
mouse routed around your keyboard it's
never bothered me but it's a function
that's there nonetheless so you can take
advantage of it but as you can see on
the back of the keyboard here we have a
USB pass-through they brought that back
thank you that's been gone ever since
they started RGB they talked about all
those bandwidth of the cable or
something for whatever reason they
didn't have a pass through USB anymore
thank goodness that's back then with the
I think it could have made it even
cooler as if there was a built-in SD
slot but that's because I built content
creation and so I was always looking for
SD cards I'm looking for places to stick
it you might also notice here you have
some edge lighting that's kind of new
right this is new to the Platinum Series
this right here what appears to be just
a spectrum wave of LEDs Ashley has nine
teen zones that can be controlled and
colors that change with almost endless
customization you can control what these
do in Corsair link and it gives you a
full complete control of the lighting
like I talked about I mean if this was
always spectrum wave and no matter what
you change the colors to that would kind
of stink but it would also kind of think
if this was just a solid color you can
make it a solid color if you want but
it's cool because you can change this in
19 different zones some other things
worth mentioning here that are actually
kind of almost not worth mentioning it's
got all the functions you'd expect of a
mechanical keyboard and key rollover
anti-ghosting all that stuff in fact
that doesn't even seem like a marketing
point Newmark is every single mechanical
keyboard on the market has it but it has
it some as well at least mention it now
one of the neat things about Corsair and
its ecosystem with the Corsair link is
this can actually sync with any other
coarser RGB products that you have in
your computer your water coolers your
mice your keyboards your void headsets
whatever so you can have one piece of
software that controls everything so if
you want kind of a unified color scheme
then that's something you can actually
do anyway let's do this real quick let's
go ahead and do a quick typing test and
then I guess that will pretty much wrap
things up now I'm not going to be doing
the typing test with the intention of
accuracy in there I'm not the fastest or
the most accurate typer but I kind of
want to see how the MX speed switches
feel and I'm also checking for things
like noise I've never typed on the MX
speed so let's go and see how they sound
to test the audio on this I have a
shotgun mic actually mounted right here
right in front of my face but I'm kind
of using the same distance that your
head would be to the keyboard to try and
gauge the sound of course your volume
levels in them you're going to vary but
here is how the switches sound now the
speed switch has a little bit less
travel I'm used to typing on Browns
which have a tactile hump and a little
bit more travel so I'm probably pushing
pretty hard on the keyboard but anyway I
think that it feels pretty nice
okay let's talk about undoubtably the
most subjective portion of the review
and net bean price this is a $200
keyboard and I know right now that that
sounds super expensive and it is trust
me that's a lot of money on keyboards
most expensive keyboard I've taken a
look at coming through here with the
exception of the taupe race which
keyboard from coolermaster we took a
look at a couple years ago but you get a
lot for this though you get a
aircraft-grade aluminum construction
it doesn't creak it doesn't twist it's
flat I've had keyboards where I go do
the review and I put them down and
they're like rocking and teetering
because they're twisted or somehow it
just feels like quality it does so at
least you get that the case 70 in k70
RGB keyboards I've had those since they
launched they're still going you get the
longevity and the life out of them so
you could buy 200 our keyboard and
probably last you five years no problem
but pricing is one of those things you
have to decide for yourself if it's
worth it I can't do that for you I must
say
seems like hoarser is listening they
change some things that the audience
wanted and now you can find it on the K
95 platinum I guess the question is
going to be whether or not some of the
features we're looking at here are going
to trickle down to say a K 70 platinum
who knows
I've got no word on that so that's just
speculation and wishful thinking
realistically anyway guys time to go
thanks for watching today's video where
I take a look at the K 95 Platinum tell
me in the comments section what you
think about this keyboard versus the
price point let me know if you think
it's on point or if you think it's way
off and why also to let me know what
keyboard you're using and why that's a
also a big gauge in all of this hit that
like button if you guys liked it if you
disliked it then you know it could do
and if you got lost on the way to a
better channel and you found this one by
mistake once you hit that subscribe
button I make videos and I do think what
I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
