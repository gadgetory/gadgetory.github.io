companies needed to make all the one
water cooling kits for graphics cards
but not just the ones like the crack in
that you can buy and put on the graphics
card manufacturers need to start making
these and shipping them with the cards
and what do you know now a lot of
different companies are actually doing
that so today we're gonna be taking a
look at one company doing that power
color on their new 390x devil now the
devil is their top - your card it's kind
of like their no-holds-barred we're not
holding anything back we're gonna do
everything we can to make this the best
390x we possibly can
and what do you know they slapped an
all-in-one water cooling unit on that
thing so let's go ahead and see how well
this thing performs the mastercase 5 and
mastercase 5 pro from Coolermaster
combines modularity with creativity
giving you the freedom to build it your
way make it yours by clicking the link
down in the description so there it is
right there in all of its glory the
Radeon r9 390x devil hybrid from power
color before we talk about the cooler on
this thing because that's really what
the focus of this video is going to be
about there's a lot of 390 X's out there
a lot of 390x videos and this ones here
is going to offer you know power colors
twist on the overclocking the memory
speed but obviously the cooling is
really the star of the show on the devil
390x and the core clock on this thing is
factory overclocked to 1,100 megahertz
but obviously we're going to push that
farther so we will be doing stock test
and overclock tests on this so the
memory on this thing is running at 1525
megahertz times four for a 60 100
megahertz effective and then of course
that memory is operating on a wide 512
bit memory bus GPU power is supplied by
an 8 pin and a 6 pin PCI Express power
cable so it's not running a dual 8 pin
like a lot of other 390 X's are so
that's gonna be compatible with a lot
more psus although pretty much every psu
that you buy in the last 5 years it's
gonna have at least an 8 pin and a 6 pin
most of them are gonna have dual 8 pins
or even you know crossfire and sli
compatible so plenty of PCI Express
power you don't have to worry about that
but you can see here we do have a fan on
the shroud so we're gonna go ahead and
move on over to the cooler and some of
the aesthetics of the card because again
like I said that's the star of the show
now it does have a fan here that is
blowing down on the power
so it's blowing down on the VRMs &amp;amp;
MOSFETs and the caps the chokes so
you're gonna be keeping power delivery
as cool as possible which tends to be
really quite honestly the weak point and
a lot of Radeon graphics cards they are
very power hungry they get very hot and
the VRMs typically are the part that
starts to get the most degradation over
time with heat because a lot of the air
coolers are not adequately cooling the
vrm so even though we've got a water
block in here that's cooling the GPU we
have a blowdown fan here or push down
fan that is giving active cooling to
heat sinks that are stuck onto the vrm
and power delivery and then the air is
escaping out of the side right here and
on both sides of the fan here because
you can see it is angled a little bit so
it's not flat on the card so that we
have adequate airflow now for memory
cooling they do have a heat plate on
here that is going to be touching all of
the memory through heat pads and then
the memory heat is going to be
dissipated again through this blowdown
or this push down the fan now the memory
doesn't tend to get too too hot so it's
not going to be a big deal that it's not
more actively cooled but it is nice to
see that they put at least that heat
spreader on there so that you're not
dealing with chips just sitting there
kind of fending for themselves there is
going to be heat transfer through heat
pads that we can see attached to those
RAM chips now the backplate on this
thing as you can see it does cover the
full length of the card you've got kind
of a three-tone thing going on here more
of a blood-red gunmetal color and then a
black it is a brushed look to it so it
does look very very nice when it comes
to the metal quality the colors are
going to be something that is going to
be completely subjective I'm not a fan
of the three tone color I think just
brushed metal looks the best personally
but maybe this is more what you're into
you might have a clash with some
aesthetic builds depending on you know
what it is you're looking for in a
backplate because after all once you put
this in your system at least in
traditional cases that's gonna be what
you see the most not this part right
here now for the radiator and the tubing
to the block it looks like it is using a
quarter inch inner diameter hose which
is smaller than what I've seen other
brands using but that would be more than
enough to keep this unit cool because
you're not going to be having long
distances where the smaller inner
diameter can increase the actual head
pressure of the of the pump but that's
not going to be a problem on something
this size once again something I do like
to see though is the radiator fan is
being supplied power by the GPU so you
don't have to worry about trying to find
another header on your motherboard or
converting this to a molex adapter to
try and power your fan and then having
it run at constant speeds of you know
it's too fast or too slow it is going to
be an intelligent fan that ramps up and
slows down with the load of the GPU as
well as the fan on the cooler so these
are being smart controlled by the fan
curve built in with the software and you
can control the speed of the fans by
messing around with either MSI
Afterburner or catalyst control center
you can actually control the fans the
last thing to mention aesthetically is
it does not light up there are no lights
on this thing there's no bling and the
shroud is made out of like an ABS
plastic it's not exactly the most
elegant looking of designs but we'll
kind of come around to that at the end
because what matters now is how well
does the damn thing perform so we're
gonna go ahead and show some slides on
this one we'll talk about a couple key
points at the end of it I don't think
there's a reason to actually do a
walkthrough of the charts like we
typically do I keep this video a little
bit more concise and then we'll talk
about my opinion on the card at the end
okay so at the time of making this video
and as of new egg pricing the 390x devil
hybrid from power color comes in at 499
dollars so that puts it pretty much
right in gtx 980 territory now the GPU
core actually got all the way up to
twelve hundred and fifteen megahertz
which is amongst the fastest of any AMG
GPU i've had come through here now
obviously your results may vary when it
comes to the overclocking this is an
above-average overclocker of all the r9
cards I've had come through here so
that's something to keep in mind you may
not get up to 12:15 but the overclocking
results that you see on here which puts
this card right up with like the fury
the air-cooled fury not the fury X but
the air-cooled fury and the Nano
obviously on an on HBM card showed that
keeping the core cool an active cooling
VRMs allowed me some pretty decent
Headroom on overclocking which really
brought this card up into a very good
category of performance pushing it you
know trading blows with the 980
classified as well as keeping things
nice and cooled the thing on this the
core on this never got hotter than 58
degrees Celsius while overclocked and
when we weren't overclocked we never got
any hotter than about 54 so you can see
we only went up 4 degrees Celsius on the
max temperature but we gained quite a
bit more performance now although the
390 X is a great performer it's still
not a solution for single GPU 4k gaming
1440p 1080p high ret high refresh rate
like 144 hertz panels no problem
whatsoever 1440p still again very
respectable FPS 60 and sometimes up 7080
FPS depending on the game the card is
doing fantastic now we're gonna kind of
switch into the subjective mode here
where you can disagree with me and you
probably will and that's perfectly okay
but I don't like the looks of the cooler
I feel like the card performs very very
well but it's diluted a little bit by
what looks like a very cheesy cooler I
think they could have come up with a
better design maybe a more premium
material but ABS plastic gives it sort
of a kind of a flimsy feel where you
have a nice metal backplate and then the
front saw
plastic so the waiting of it feels kind
of awkward it feels very hollow which I
guess makes sense there's no giant you
know heat pipes and copper coolers on
there but I do think that the delivery
of the aesthetics could have been better
maybe even even a white or even a red
LED I know I've given another company's
 before in the past we're having
colors on their coolers but being the
devil theme I feel like given the way
other devil cards looked in the past I
feel like they take a step backwards
when it comes to the aesthetics of the
card and you may agree with me you may
not but this that's just purely my
opinion on that but in terms of
performance you can't deny that this is
one of the best 390 X's out there when
it comes to performance I really wasn't
expecting it to reach fury levels on
performance once overclocked but it
certainly was so the last thing I want
to mention is the acoustics the
acoustics of the card were extremely
quiet the fan when it ramped up a you
know didn't ramp up a lot but because
it's a high static pressure fan on there
and we have a high density rate fin
density radiator cooling was great so
the fan didn't have to ramp up a lot the
high static pressure we had no problems
pushing air through the - density of the
120 millimeter by 30 millimeter radiator
the fan on the shroud didn't really seem
to change acoustics at all the only
thing I ever noticed making any real
noticeable noise in the test system was
the water pump for the CPU the card was
pretty much dead silent which is what
you would expect
and speaking of acoustics coil whine was
not an issue on this card which it has
been on some other 390 and 380 series
cards that have come through here where
the only time I heard any sort of coil
whine or inductor noise whatsoever was
when I was in a menu that had super high
FPS like far cry 4 menu had like 20 500
FPS of course the inductor was screaming
on the card but once we got into
gameplay there was absolutely no noise
whatsoever coming from the inductors
which is a good thing
you make them quiet by removing the fans
and then massive heat sinks then you can
really tell if the inductors make a
noise but that wasn't an issue on this
so there you go guys if you've got the
budget and you're looking for an R 9
390x that's water-cooled look no farther
than the power color devil because it is
a great performer at low acoustics and
high overclocking potential so there you
go guys if you
this video you know what to do share it
like it share it with someone you think
it might help and as always guys we will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
