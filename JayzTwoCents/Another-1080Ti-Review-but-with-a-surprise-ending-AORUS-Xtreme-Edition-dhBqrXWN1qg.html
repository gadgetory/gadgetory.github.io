ready here what's up ladies and
gentlemen or lady and gentlemen if I'm
being real we've got another 1080p eye
to take a look at here there is no lack
of 1080p is anytime new graphics card
comes comes out we've got a bajillion
different flavors took a look at today
it's the arse expert gaming Edition now
even though I've got two graphics cards
on the desk right here I don't have to
1080 TI's one's a 1080 and one's a 1080i
and the reason why I'm doing that is
they made some minor changes between the
two that's going to take a quick tour
around the car to make sure I got the
1080 TI there that's they look very
similar obviously but they're not the
same so one of the most identifiable
traits of a norris graphics card is the
inclusion of a copper block we'll call
it block / heatsink on the backside of
the GPU the idea here is it kind of made
it like a super backplate where they
actually using copper to allow some of
the heat to just pay off the back side
of the card I've always said back lights
are good as long as you have thermal
conductivity or a thermal pad or
something back there they obviously took
it a step farther you've also got this
white we'll call it the martyr your goal
now finger burrs reference their logo on
the back that does light up and then on
the face of the card the part you
actually look at which is like that
you've got the RS logo which is again
RGB get a fan stop logo which lights up
to tell you the fans are not turning
because it's got 0 rpm idle mode and it
looks like that's about it on the front
of the card we'll call it the front the
fan side found fan shroud side of the
card you've got an X here that lights up
because remember to texture it is also
RGB you have three fans here the center
fan actually overlaps the front to fan
so I'm assuming that's for the biggest
most amount of static pressure you can
get through these fins because there are
a lot of fins as you guys can see we've
got one two three four five what appear
to be five millimeter possibly six
millimeter heat pipes and then of course
all of your components that matter are
indeed touching the the heatsink there
are VRMs our memory as well as our GPU
core and it looks like it's a copper
base so it
not just like an aluminum base or a
steel base it's definitely a copper base
that is touching on there okay so what's
different than between the 1080 P I and
the 1080 rather than obviously just the
GPU core well these curds if you
remember not just this one but all pesco
cards invidious huge marketing push was
to be already if you are ready now
you've got V r-rated graphics cards we
already motherboards I don't know what
that bat crap is I've even seen VR ready
memory I mean Kyle did a really good
skit but put VR and anything and
suddenly it's some more sales worthy but
I digress I'm on a tangent here if we
take a look at the 1080 you can see on
the backside here we've got two HDMI
ports on the back side of the card and
that's for hooking up your HMDs like
your vive and your oculus some people
have both and instead of having to
switch them out they want to give you
lots of HDMI options so that you can
have them all plugged in at the same
time the problem is when they had it
facing inside of the case that makes it
really awkward to plug into I mean
that's cool and all but yeah that it
makes it kinda hard to plug in so what
they do is they removed one from the
interior facing side of the card
technically the back of the card from
here so you can see we've only got one
on this and now we've moved it to the
output side of the card so you actually
got six outputs here on the 1080i you've
got a DVI to HDMI 2.0 and then three
DisplayPort so you can see compared to
the 1080 obviously that it's not on
there now you do have to make a choice
though you can't have you can't use the
DVI and the HDMI too at the same time so
there is a trade-off like that and
obviously that has to do with you know
display controller and whatnot so I
don't know if that's the limitation of
the core or what but just worth noting
you can't have them hooked up at the
same time so with that said before I
start talking about build quality and
stuff like that let's put it through the
paces its compared to the other 1080p
eyes I've already had come through here
on things like firestrike times by
temperatures and core speeds and all
that gaming wise guys they they pretty
much are going to scale the same so
let's just see how this does I'm really
curious let me tell you why this is
actually I forgot to mention it this is
a three slot card I talked about two
slot in two and a half slots this is a
three slot card
I mean that is insane look at the girth
on this coconut monkey would be proud
are you proud oh yeah yeah yeah it's all
about links so it's links link
so as you guys saw it pretty much
compares with every other 1080p eye out
there there's such a minut difference
between them but what makes them
different obviously is they're cooler
implementation and they're software this
right here is the former OC guru it's
now the Auris graphics engine and of
course we do have a monitoring piece of
software here but let me show you what
really sucks about this and I want you
getting close on this so I want you to
see this this right here is showing
obviously we had a max of 2000 and a min
of 1807 but as soon as this part of the
vlog moves off the chart the min max
changes it only shows you what's min max
for the section then it's actually
visible on the chart whereas something
like MSI Afterburner shows you min Matt
max for any period that the the log has
actually been open so that's obviously
better but watch this right here watch
when we start to move off the chart here
as soon as this section right here which
is 2,000 drops off our max will change
to 1807 so if you were doing a long
testing that would obviously would be
very useful and boom you see that so
that piece of software is obviously
useless you also can't adjust the range
it just goes to 2,000 so if it over
clock this card and it goes to 2025 or
2050 then the little line is just going
to go off the chart I mean so yeah also
to these modes right here and this
applies to all companies that are doing
this this is stupid these modes I don't
know why anyone would want to slow down
their card and no matter what you're
going to want all the performance right
so OC mode should be the default out of
the box as far as I'm concerned and if
you want to go farther than manually
overclock it with something like MSI
Afterburner or EVGA precision X they are
far superior pieces of software as far
as I'm concerned the only reason you
should use this would be to control the
lighting on the card if its proprietary
sometimes the built-in like MSI lighting
or even the EVGA precision X lighting
features can kind of communicate with
the card but that's hit or miss so that
would be the only reason I would ever
recommend even installing this software
now in terms of temperatures we saw all
the way up to about 67 68 C depending on
the load 4k obviously is a higher load
but you can control the fan curve
an MSI Afterburner again or precision
EXO I would definitely do that
and only one up to 47% fan speed during
it the highest low which got to almost
70 see the problem is it made no audible
noise in terms of fan delays on an
open-air test bench you could get away
with much higher fan curve have lower
temperatures better GPU boost experience
and not have a really invasive
acoustical experience so I think that
everyone should be bumping up their fan
curves now you guys are always asking me
about things like coil one and I can
tell you that for the win three cards
did not have coil whine my Strix card
did not have coil whine and neither did
my msi card the founders edition card I
don't recall had any coil line either
what I'm going to show you right now is
what this card sounds like this is what
the card sounds like right now in 2d
mode just on the desktop and that's what
the card sounds like when it's in 3d
mode so you can hear there's a little
bit of coil line you probably wouldn't
hear in a case but you guys would ask me
to do coil whine test so there you go
if we go ahead and turn it off
that's what it sounds like in 2d mode so
it's really not that bad that leaves me
with one topic left to talk about and
that is build quality you guys remember
when I got the gigabyte card basically
the Xtreme before they went to orous and
I did a whole video about we're fixing
the fans on it because the fans couldn't
turn well what had happened is when it
was put in the box and they put all the
packing on it they shoved the cooler
down so hard they squished it and when
they squished it the fans couldn't turn
that's because they're using although a
metal shroud it's a very very thin
aluminum piece of metal so you can see
here there's all kinds of flex right
like that you see how much that can move
I'm not using a lot of force but I know
I'm kind of a strong guy but I'm not
using a lot of force with that and when
you when you hold it it's waiting and
waiting things and heavy things mean
quality right but that the problem is
you could feel the weight but you can
also feel the Flex so you're kind of
going doesn't feel all that strong MLE I
know that's gonna make some people
cringe but it has to be said it has to
be shown this metal needs to be changed
out with something else I would take a
plastic shroud over something that is
this flimsy even if it's metal because
watch this I just went and broke a piece
off the cooler for you guys just to show
you how flimsy the metal really is the
card is great in just about every aspect
except for this anyway that's been my
two cents guys take it for what it is
thanks for watching subscribe if you're
new around here and I'll see you in the
next one yeah I broke that for science I
broke it for science boom
