here and I'm gonna take a look today at
a product that you guys have said over
and over and over again this should go
in skunk works this belongs in skunk
works put this in skunk works well guys
we're not putting it in skunk works but
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at
it anyway and then it's gigabytes x99
you d4p x99 motherboard obviously and
it's kinda black and yellow theme which
obviously is why everyone's like put
this thing in stock works well I'm not
tearing skunk works all apart again a
lot of work I'm lazy the built in res
and water pump mounting locations
improve the air flow and massive
radiator support make the defined s from
fractal design the obvious choice for
water cooling enthusiast the S doesn't
stand for sexy but it should so before
we talk about the motherboard let's go
and talk about what comes in the
packaging you get this kind of a crazy 8
pin CPU power daisy chain thing not
exactly sure what you would use that for
I've never seen one before I'll have to
get back to you on that probably one of
the nicest looking IO shields that I
have ever seen because the thing freakin
lights up I mean that is amazing I wish
I was actually installing this in
something today so that we could light
this bad boy up but it has an LED that
lights along the side and it's got a
clear acrylic cover on here and this
whole thing kind of lights up so it's
illuminated so when you're trying to
plug things in back there it's actually
easy to find there's the power plug for
that right there you do get your
crossfire bridge because of course this
is an SLI and the crossfire capable
motherboard you get some really slick
braided SATA cables which is really nice
I've never seen that come with the
motherboard before either usually just
get the rubberized kind of generic
looking ones but you've got one that's a
dual 180 plug and then one that's a 180
with a 90 plug that's really you get
four of those because here's another
package of them now this motherboard is
compatible with up to four-way SLI so
you get your little flexible SLI bridge
you get two different 3-way SLI bridges
here with two different spacing
configurations which I think it's kind
of odd but anyway you do get two of
those and then you've got your four-way
SLI bridge they're all rigid bridges as
well so they're not going
to bend or move around and they can
actually give a little bit more support
to your GPU and then of course you have
your product manuals and driver disk and
case badges but of course here is the
star of the show right here now I think
it is an extremely slick looking design
I mean it's all black it's a matte black
with just a couple of gold and yellow
accents where it matters so it gives you
that nice black and yellow theme but it
doesn't overpower you with too much
yellow for PCI Express connectivity
you've got two PCI Express 3.0 or gen 3
16 X 2 3.0 8 X and then you've got one
two three PCI Express One X so you've
got a lot of compatibility on here for
expand a bit or expansion cards things
like sound cards and network cards and
raid cards and things like that
you've also got on the bottom here
exhilarating spread lands which is a
4-pin molex so if you're running three
or four-way configs it's usually
recommended that you plug in exhilarate
our to supply more direct power to the
PCI Express Lanes
that way you're not drawing too much
through the motherboard and you don't
cause a fire or put it up and smoke or
anything like that so it's definitely
recommended now speaking of illumination
the chipset also has a lighted heatsink
on there again I'm gonna have to find
something to build with this thing
because this is just too badass to pass
up it's got a heat pipe that runs from
the chipset up to the vrm cooler as well
so you've got some heat convection there
that's moving the heat away from the
motherboard and one of the ways that
gigabyte is efficiently utilizing space
on this motherboard is they've stacked
the MDOT two slots on this thing so
you've got two m2 that are stacked on
top of each other so you have one on the
bottom and one on top and the only
downside with that it would be my
concern would be airflow because MDOT
two drives can get pretty hot especially
if they're near graphics cards and when
MDOT to drive start getting hot they
start slowing down so I wet I would be a
little bit concerned about that but
obviously I would assume they've done
their test and it shouldn't be that big
of a deal but you also have mSATA slot
on here as well now speaking of hard
drives this thing actually has 10 SATA 3
6 gigabit per second ports on this thing
as well as SATA Express and it's capable
of onboard
controlling for raid zero one five and
ten so you're gonna especially with the
Intel you know chipset controller for
the RAID controller so you're gonna be
getting a lot of connectivity and a lot
of just versatility when it comes to the
hard drive capabilities of this thing
over here you have a CPU button which is
gonna be default CPU mode and overclock
CPU mode where basically you can flip
that switch and kind of get a factory
overclock on your CPU without having to
really do anything these companies like
gigabyte have really started spending a
lot of time using massive samples of
chips that they receive during
engineering phase and they kind of find
what safe overclocks are depending on
kind of the the overall percentages of
overclocking capabilities of the
engineering chips that they receive so
you can flip that switch with confidence
that you're gonna get an overclock it's
more than likely going to be very stable
and it's not going to push your CPU too
hard to where you cause any sort of
damage which you could do in the in the
BIOS especially when you start messing
around with voltages let's go and take a
look at how many fan headers we have on
here it looks like they're all PWM I
don't see any three pinned fan slots so
that's good that means you could have
control of all of your fans if you're
using PWM fans we've got one up here in
the top so let's say we got one two
three four five looks like we've got
five fan slots on this thing which
should be more than enough most of the
time you can run daisy chain fans off of
a single header up to about one amp so
depending on how much amperage your fans
are drawing sometimes you can get three
four or five even six fans on a single
header if they're very low speed low
demand fans I want to keep that in mind
don't think you're gonna go putting like
five jet flows on a single fan head
around this thing you're gonna blow up
the fan header so keep that in mind
now before we wrap up this overview
let's go ahead and talk about what makes
this thing UD in the you d4p well you d
stands for ultra durable and that means
that they use the highest grade
components that they possibly can in
this thing they use a ton of gold
content in the pins of the socket they
use very thick PCB layers on the scene
it's very heavy it's very thick it
doesn't flex easy at all and they use
very high grade components when it comes
to things like the chokes and the
capacitors on this thing which are rated
much much higher than you would find on
main
stream motherboards this definitely has
all the features that I like to see in
motherboards and it makes me excited I
want to build something with this thing
don't know what yet or what I would even
necessarily do with the build but when
you see this level of compassion that
goes into a motherboard design it
definitely makes you want to build
something I mean everything about this
motherboard is just so nice looking and
because it's on the x99 platform you
know you're gonna get great performance
it's got great built in audio it's even
got a little spot right here where if
you're gonna add say a wireless using
the M SATA slot on this thing it's even
got they've even thought ahead and put
on here little antenna mount so that you
don't have to figure out what you're
gonna do with the antennas I mean it's
like every little thing on this
motherboard has been completely well
thought out well there you go guys I
don't do many unboxings but I do like to
unbox things that I think are cool that
especially give you a lot of the
accessories that you might otherwise
have to have purchased or companies that
just think to put things in the box that
you just might need and obviously
gigabytes done that with the amount of
accessories in here and the fact that
this motherboard is so freakin nice it
just deserved to be taking a look at now
the one thing I'm a little bit
disappointed about but I guess it just
has to do with the timing is the fact
that this does not have USB 3.1 it has
tons of USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 with front
connectivity and rear connectivity but
the board actually came out before the
USB 3.1 standard was kind of becoming
you know more mainstream like we're
seeing now and more motherboards coming
out especially with all the motherboards
at Computex it seemed like they were all
featuring USB 3.1 unfortunately this guy
doesn't but I wouldn't be surprised if
there's a revision of this in the future
adding USB 3.1 so it's really kind of
the only thing missing from this
motherboard other than well I guess Rams
CPU mother you know graphics card and
all that sort of stuff dad jokes I know
all right so tell me what you guys think
of this you d4p from gigabyte it's got I
mean the illumination on there is really
nice it looks good it's gonna look good
in any build you put it in as long as
you you know stick to it black
components on top of it or other yellow
components kind of like I've done with
skunk works over here
what motherboard are you guys using what
do you look for in motherboards what's
what's the major selling point that
makes you want them
the board motherboards sir they're not
glamorous and they're kind of tedious to
shop for but when it comes to
motherboards they really do hold a lot
of stake in the performance of your
machine so there's definitely something
you shouldn't scrimp on so tell me what
you guys think of today's video hope you
guys have enjoyed this unboxing and
overview I don't do a lot of unboxings
and stuff but I thought that this guy
was worth it so I went ahead and did it
for you guys as always thanks for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
