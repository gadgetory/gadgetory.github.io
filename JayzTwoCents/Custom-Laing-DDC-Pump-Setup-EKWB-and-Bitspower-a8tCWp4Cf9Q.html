cents here and I have been promising you
guys forever that I was going to be
doing more water cooling stuff on this
channel and it may be a bit late but
damn it later is better than never
now I recently took a look here at the
fan texts into primo case and how it can
be configured incredibly overkill when
it comes to water cooling and radiators
but we're going to move be moving on to
right now is some stuff I'm going to be
doing here in preparation for my parfume
veer 1.0 case build that I'm doing which
is an extremely small all acrylic mini
ITX case it's actually an inverted mini
ITX what we're doing a full review on
this case as well as a completely custom
and most challenging water cooling build
I have ever attempted
not even on just on this channel but
ever the amount of hardware we're going
to be cramming inside here obviously
this case is female the amount of
hardware we're going to be cramming
inside this case and the amount of water
cooling stuff that's going in there on
top of it is insane with its improved
radiator support and legendary noise
optimization the new defined r54 fractal
design is a PC builders dream come true
click the link in the description to
learn more if you want to know more
about this parvum veer 1.0 what you guys
are just going to have to wait for my
review today we're going to be talking
about my preparation for the pump that's
going in this thing which happens to be
a laying DDC pump right here with the
PWM control and 12 volt circuit but as
you can see it's pretty ugly and not a
whole lot going on with it
this would you know fit in there but
it's pretty atrocious when it comes to
appearance now a lot of companies have
recognized that this is a very popular
pump but that it needs a little bit of
work so we're going to be adding a
couple of different things on here we're
gonna be adding a nickel-plated
heatsink housing for the bottom that
also has anti vibration mount we are
going to be putting on the bitts power
upgrade kit 150 d DC top and reservoir
combo as well as the palm top that's
needed to mount the reservoir combo to
that now I do recognize that there are
pumps that come with some of this stuff
pre-installed but because I have some
pretty specific needs on what I need for
this case and how I need it to be
configured
had decided to order these parts myself
individually that way I can put them
together the way I want knowing that
they're going to fit and how I'm going
to be configuring this case especially
when it comes to this so I guess what
we're going to do now is I'm just going
to probably time-lapse or do some b-roll
footage of the actual installation and
then we'll talk about everything at the
end
well there we go the Assembly of my
blankey cabe its power well it kind of
looks like a penis pump I'm not gonna
lie
and you know this thing is actually
pretty big compared to the case in fact
you can see right there compared to the
case it's it's pretty big but it's
actually not gonna be mounted like that
it's gonna be mounted like this on its
side I know what you're thinking don't
worry it'll all make sense in fact this
is not the first time somebody has done
that in this case I've seen a couple of
build lugs and several people have
actually mounted this thing on its side
down here in the bottom of the case and
you know it's really the only way it
makes sense in there I don't like to
follow suit necessarily or copy other
people but the people who've done this
before me have figured out that that
makes the most sense assembly on this
thing is extremely easy as you saw the
pump it's contained inside just this
plastic housing here just Hollow it's
nothing more than you know a clamshell
that goes around the pump itself so
we've got the pump inside the heat sink
down here these pumps actually get
pretty damn hot so there's a heat sink
even a thermal pad on there you saw get
installed so that the heat can be
radiated out of the bottom rather than
dumping all that heat inside the loop we
got palm material bits power top here
for the laying DDC and then we've got
the reservoir mount 150 millimeter long
reservoir mount for the top of that if
we didn't put this mount on there than
we would would have just had an inlet on
the top and an outlet right here but now
we can actually have the multi fitting
up here on the top this is actually a
different top that I put on here that
came from my original 900 D build where
I had the bits power single tubular
reservoir normally the top that's on
here is a single with the or a single
fitting on the top but because I need to
have also an inlet on here as well as a
fill port I went ahead and put my multi
fitting top on there so as you can see
now I've got options but yeah this is
going to pretty much fill up the whole
bottom of the case down there but you
guys get an idea now just how small this
case is and possibly just how big this
thing is I mean I guess I could have
found an even smaller tube the problem
is I couldn't find the DDC top kit on
here with the 80 millimeter res that
they sell as the d5 kit which I thought
was really strange at least on
performance pcs website I couldn't find
it but I can actually buy a new acrylic
tube that's a shorter one if I want put
the top on so I don't think I'm going to
have any fitment issues down there I've
got plenty of room between the fan and
radiator I do have a 80 millimeter fan
on the back that's going to go there
that I have to be mindful of if I need
to then I'll just rush delivery me a
shorter acrylic tube on there so there
you go guys are pretty simple just
showing you guys a assembly of the pump
that's going inside this build not doing
a build vlog of this because really it's
going to be it's going to be very very
complicated and I know it would probably
make an interesting blog but it would
make things a bit more complicated for
me to record it so I hope you guys just
enjoy some of this along the way sort of
thing that I'm showing you here some of
the parts and stuff individually but not
really like a series like we did with
skunk works so anyway guys there we go
lang DTC has a lot of options one of the
most popular pumps on the market the
laying DTC in the Lang d5 tons and tons
of aftermarket options from ek excess PC
bits power we're some of the other
brands out there that make stuff but it
was kind of like the main three alpha
cool also makes some phobia they believe
it's making some as well which is
technically also alpha cool so there we
go guys tell me what you think of my new
laying DDC penis pump
whatever don't judge me anyway following
social media if you guys want to
interact and as always thanks for
watching and damn these lights are
bright it's late at night and I should
go to bed
surprise I installed this thing without
damaging it considering it's late
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
