wad and the cable wad configurator if
you want custom cables for your computer
and you want them custom-made with your
colors and your choices and your configs
you can do that on the cable mod
configurator that support all major
brands of PS use both modular and semi
modular and you can have cable
extensions made but the best part is
previously they offered aluminum cable
combs and only black and white but now
you can get them in various color so if
you want to take your system to the next
step and really make it pop get some
custom cables and make them your way
with the cable mod configurator you can
start playing around at that by using
the link in the description below
alright here comes our first video in
our new shop that we will need to do
some rearranging and so now I'm gonna do
this that's okay that's okay I'm get to
work on a computer in this space for the
first time it happens to be my personal
rig skunk works no we're not updating it
yet now we're not changing out any of
the parts technically and no I'm not
copying latest with this personal rig
update I recently did my update on this
when I went to 28 et eyes and a 79 60 X
which I deleted and remember GeForce
garage actually featured this on their
channel but here's the problem if we get
it here nice and tight something's sort
of happening here and I don't know if
it's fluid or it's my tube so get in
here fill I want people to see this up
close as you can see the bends right
here they almost look like cracks right
and this is PE TG fluid you can see it
here but it's got kind of a white
substance to it what's happening right
here but it's not happening in this tube
this tube this tube it's not happening
in the reservoirs there's a little bit
of what looks like it could be a
potential build-up happening inside the
blocks we'll get a insert shot of that
so you guys can see but this is the pre
mode chill true fluid technically it's
the view fluid without all the
pearlescent crap and I've heard mixed
reviews on this and I wanted to try it
out I don't think we're clogging or
anything like that but what I do know is
that when I redid the GPU loop with an
GeForce garage and I put in the 2080 TI
I had to do new tubing runs for here and
here although no this tumor has stayed
the same I think but because of board
spacing that's also why this little
doohickey is like this this little keep
tube because it didn't line up because
the EK blocks moved over where the
terminals were they use to be farther
back but that's because of this bridge
it design so everyone do today we're
gonna drain the loop and I clean out
some of the dust it's kind of dusty and
we're gonna just the CPU loop anyway and
we're gonna take a look at these tubes
and I'm probably if this turns out to be
the tube and it's not any sort of like
something building up in there then
we'll probably rebend all of the CPU
loop tubes so yeah let's go ahead and
get this guy sort of wiped down cleaned
up and ready to drain
so here's my theory on this I feel like
there's no such thing as an opaque fluid
on the market that is going to be
problem free if you guys remember the
video and maybe I'll have failed you a
little just kind of a little overlay
here at that last video where we got it
ready for the reception of the twenty
atti cards we drained the system it was
there was staining we had to get all the
old fluid out and we mixed new fluid for
it it's interesting because both of
these reservoirs you can see there's
still a little bit of what looks like
something against this wall but there
was something else going on with this
reservoir but that's that's a different
topic both these fluids came from the
same batch meaning they were mixed into
one giant one gallon jug that then both
were filled off of this one did not have
settling as you can see right here in
the bottom of this tube but this
reservoir has some settled on the side
of it and as you can see all the
vertical surfaces of the tube sat that
way so also to this system has set off
for most of its updated life because I
haven't just haven't had time life it
life and work and been in the way and I
don't have time to do gaming and stuff
so I haven't heat cycle did I haven't
really done anything with this system
but I find it odd that one loop is doing
it and not the other the other thing too
is when it does run the GPU loop
definitely gets warmer than the CPU loop
so I don't know if temperature has
something to do with keeping it kind of
ready to go so here's what I'm gonna do
now I'm gonna take out these tubes I'm
gonna take out this reservoir and I'm
gonna clean it and then I'm gonna bend
new tubes and put them in and it's just
so strange I mean this is the kind of
stuff we saw with the view not with the
treu this is like I said earlier this
true view would view it this true fluid
is the primo chill view without the
crazy sparkly stuff so that's just
interesting the other thing you have to
think about is there has to be some
solid properties to the fluid otherwise
you'd be able to see through it right so
what I ultimately want to do is I think
I want to go back to a clear see-through
fluid and I don't think that's gonna
happen today
and that kind of sucks which means I'm
gonna have to just band-aid this by
replacing the tubes that are affected
and cleaning out the reservoir just to
get me by so if I were let's say a
system integrator and I'm building this
custom or I'm working on someone's
system and they're like what do you
recommend I do I would of course be like
why I recommend you replace the fluid
and disassemble the blocks and
toothbrush them clean and all that sort
of stuff
we just don't have time to do that today
so that's why today I am doing the do as
I say not as I do
method of replacing my tubes that are
affected here my block looks all right
there's a little bit Phil can even get
in there so you can see there's a little
bit of buildup in the fins right there
but I noticed that even when the when
the build was new and I drained it for
the first time when I wanted to change
something so I'm gonna show right now as
I'm actually gonna blow in the loop the
opposite direction so that those come up
and you'll see that they actually come
loose where actual deposits like buildup
and sludge doesn't come loose Wow well
so by putting a fitting on here with a
tube and then putting that into the tank
like I should over my mic catch can
technically and then blowing on it real
hard a bunch of times you can see like
the little bubbly foam stuff just comes
right out so I don't I don't believe
that to be build up at all because true
build-up and sludge does not come off
like that it sticks I think it's nasty
so one of one of the reasons why I don't
think it actually gummed up in the
system technically like it cause any
sort of temperature or flow problems
because I saw no issues with
temperatures our flow is you can see Lia
it's really soft so as you can see it's
just sort of like a really fine powder
and then when I you can see it kind of
building up on my fingers here if I
wanted to give you a best explanation of
what the consistency of it feels like
it's if you sanded something with like
2,000 grit sandpaper and the dust you
would sort of get off that that's about
the thickness and the mind
Micron's size of this if I had to make a
guess just based on the way it feels but
like I said when I've had like when I
had the Mayhem's fluid like the yellow
stuff failing me and it just turned
completely nasty this would not have
happened I would not have been able to
just take a paper towel sort of force it
into the tube like this just spinning
around a little bit
and then see it like start to come off
that would not happen with before so it
looks like what I was seeing through the
UV filter which was looking like cracks
and stuff was probably you know it's
just the build-up so I'm reminded of
something I saw on the forums years ago
I don't know what the plastic is made
out of in this push down tube one of
these melted in the guy's too into the
guy's reservoir
completely just just melted and deformed
and everything and caused a massive mess
in his system because pieces of it mixed
in with the fluid and then redeposit it
all throughout the system and I don't
know what the outcome was of that I know
there was a lot of ek blaming fluids and
people blaming ek and people blaming
radiators it and then the blaming game
starts right now this is just
speculation I have no data to go off of
but I just thinking about that article
and I'm going I wonder if there's some
sort of reaction happening with this
okay so I'm going to use these as
templates to rebend and look at that
what was I just saying about ptg
softening and changing shape I've seen
people see bubbles complete meltdowns
well look at that that squished it
didn't it didn't bubble out it squished
in which it's kind of funny because
that's where it's under clamping force
for the compression fitting so I'm
wondering if it softened somehow and if
this tubing is having a reaction to this
fluid but I don't know if it's this
fluid specifically because this these
particular tubes have been in the system
for like the last three revisions of
this build seen tons of different types
of fluid I know that Lea Harrington
watching this right now if he's watching
is I told you I told you because I had
the conversation with him like online
once just kind of responding one of his
posts I'm like I never had that problem
happened he's like you do you will you
just wait you will I'm like that one's
for you Lea I don't have any acrylic
tubing so that's stuff to your PTD
so here are the new tubes versus the old
tubes you can see just how bad they are
compared to the nice nuclear tubing
obviously this one doesn't have the
bulge on it so here's what I'm gonna be
gaining out of this at least I have a
clean reservoir and I'm not gonna have
to see the discoloration in the tubing
which is was really being like it looks
so obvious with the black lighting in
here because I'm using cable mod UV
lighting and just a little bit of white
lights kind of mixed in with it and of
course the RGB lighting set to white on
all my components so now we're going to
put it back together and fill it and
then that's gonna be it I mean we'll
talk a little bit more at the end about
my recommendations about anyone else
that could be experiencing this and
again any discussion about what's
causing this would be pure speculation I
have no data to go off of so we want to
kind of keep that to a minimum but let's
go ahead an put it back together now
it's no it's honestly pretty painless I
mean that's the first time we got to
sort of use our new shop to do anything
and I'm glad it was involving my
personal build so anyway in terms of
just speculation of what's causing it
we were kind of thinking about this
off-camera and the best way to describe
the Powder us trying to show you was it
was definitely fluid but it had it
reminded me of soft tubing and
plasticizer plasticizer is used in soft
you mean to keep it soft it keeps it
malleable and it's one of those things
that's what it reminded me of the film
on the inside and just the way it felt
the way that that that push down tube
kind of was feeling made me think a
plasticizer and I'm wondering if somehow
because that piece of tubing is what was
roughest and and just had it felt all
pitted and stuff and as you saw it was
smooth once I cleaned it it took a lot
longer than all the other parts I'm
wondering if that was somehow leeching
plasticizer or if it even exists on that
tube I have no idea what it's made out
of it doesn't feel the same as acrylic
like acrylic tubing it feels lighter
almost like it's a piece of plastic
rather than it being acrylic or ptg or
anything like that so it makes me wonder
if that could have been what was causing
the issue in that particular loop
because what still throws us for a loop
huh is the fact that the GPU loop is not
doing it there's a little bit of
sediment inside the blocks but that's
expected when you use any sort of an
opaque fluid like this but they're the
same components the same block materials
the same coatings the same manufacturers
even of all the parts and I I can't
really put my finger on what's causing
it so we're just gonna now play with
this system as it sits I don't the deal
with those ugly pieces showing up in
there anymore those those corners that
looked all weird in those bends and the
loops look like two different colors
because the CPU loop was just filled
which means it's aerated so it's still
got a mixture of like millions of little
tiny bubbles in there which is why it
looks lighter so anyway I'm happy I got
to use my shop for my system we've got
some stuff we're gonna build we finally
brought we didn't bring the Dominus
Board with us but we did bring the CPU
we forgot the Dominus board because we
got CPU block and cooling stuff for that
so you know what that means
it means rip GN might happen again hey
that rhymes
well I really am jay-z what do you know
alright quit YouTube I'm gonna go be a
rapper
remembering mmm-mmm-mmm Jagan mumble I
know what's gonna happen right now when
I turn it on like this it's something
Zuzu go flying out of there well ok it
turns I said I like that I have more
than one workbench</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
