by following the links down below
obviously I am talking about the asu's
GT X 1080 Ti Poseidon this is a card you
guys have asked me to do a review on
I've actually had it in the office now
for a couple of weeks and I decide to
wait for the hole water cooling you know
summertime videos that I like to do
before we actually decided to go ahead
and dive into this now that's no pun
intended but we are diving into this
we're going to test this in a few
different ways we're going to see how it
performs on air we're going to tale
performs on water and of course we're
going to check out some overclocking and
see if we gain any sort of Headroom on
air or water when it comes to
overclocking or for kind of hard cap yet
some of the other limitations that exist
on the GPUs before we ever reach any
sort of thermal limit right here on the
box they're pretty forthcoming with what
you could expect they're only showing a
five seed drop over founders and that
probably seems a little bit
disappointing if you're to buy a card
like this and expect to just stick it on
in your PC let the fans do their job and
expect it to be cooler than the well
seventy eight fee that they are showing
right here that's that's probably
nothing to really brag about now if you
put it on water they're saying you could
expect a thirty C drop in temperatures
over the founder's card for the
temperature sitting right around 53
again not as cool as some of them even
the hybrid cards that we've seen that
stayed deep into the 40s with a
dedicated water block but obviously none
of those cards can do with this one can
which allows you the flexibility of
deciding whether or not you want water
or you want air question is though if
you're going to stick with one or the
other
are you really kind of doing yourself a
disservice let's go through the review
and find out
okay so we've had this running now for a
while looks like we're hitting about 75
see imbalances anywhere between 73 to 75
and that makes sense consuming we're in
an open air test bench so you put this
in a case you might rise a couple of
degrees and see these 78 that it's
talking about our max temperatures it
says 75 just like I said we actually did
reach a core clock 12 2012 so that's not
too bad but we were running once
temperatures reached up to the 75 C we
stayed at a very consistent nineteen
hundred and seventy-four that's actually
not bad remember we are in the OSI mode
though go to overclocking let's see what
we can max out on air I've had quite a
few 1080 T eyes come through the studio
so far and I've got some more waiting to
be reviewed and more on the way but if
there's something I've learned while
watching other people's reviews and yeah
I'm a nerd out over the stuff and I like
to see what other people are saying as
well as I can tell you that most of them
will hit about 20 20 some of the good
ones will hit 20 50 and very rarely
where they go higher than that like a 20
63 but let me tell you right now that
this card but Poseidon right now on air
now granted I'm using a manual fan curve
I've got it set to 90% because we are
overclocking it and pushed everything to
the right it's sitting at 58 C it'll
probably hit around 63 C at two thousand
and eighty eight megahertz these GPUs do
not like to go anywhere near 2100 this
one actually hit 20 101 not wasn't
perfectly stable but if I tried to do 20
101 with any other card that came
through here so far if I tried to go
anything over like 2050 they would just
instant crash when I would start to
benchmark but this one's still running
right now 20 88 and it's got a 6061 C
right now so the air cooler can clearly
do its job if you ramped up the fan
speed that should be that should be
pretty self-evident with any air cooled
card but right now if we take a look at
the curve on here you can see there it
is right there 20 88 and there's our 20
101 I told you about right there so it
did run 20 101 you can see the system
still running we were able we had a
slight hiccup it basically goes black
screen but it comes back it doesn't
completely hard crash and we're locked
up but there we are right there at 20 88
that is highly impressive remember we're
not even on water yet so obviously the
results on air were pretty damn good so
let's go and put it on water and let's
see what happens I it's going to be hard
I don't imagine it going any higher than
the twenty eighty eight I think there's
other things that are factoring here
with our limitation but obviously cool
part is you can water cool and you don't
have to take it apart that's nice
you guys just let me do one of those
ridiculous things I think I've ever had
to do since water cooling by gas taping
my fans to the radiator because when I
grab the stuff in the shop I forgot to
grab the screws for the radiator fan but
hey it works and if anything it's kind
of sealing up some of the gaps so anyway
here we are we've got our temporary loop
set up with the Poseidon I turn the fans
off because I'm going to do this in two
different ways - I want to test it with
the fans off just the GPU block I don't
know why anyone would do that but I want
to see what the temperatures like with
just the GPU block now check out the
idle temp that came down already 23
degrees on idle we came down to 32 C
remember it was idling at 55 C with the
fans off so that's kind of neat but yeah
so here's were going to do we are going
to go ahead and let Valley benchmark run
once again and I do have the overclock
applied the last overclock that we did
the 2088 that one is currently applied
right now so we're gonna leave all those
settings except for the fan off and I
want to see where the temperatures are
going to max out then I'm going to turn
the fans on while it's running and see
the temps come down at all and then
we'll see if the overclocking improved
so looks like we capped out at 51 C and
I am now going to turn on the radiator
fans also - something important to point
out is I only have these fans running at
50% and an audible 50% on an eighteen
hundred and fifty
p.m. fans so we're running roughly nine
hundred to a thousand rpm so let's do
this let me go ahead and click on the
fan on the GPU I'll put it at sixty
percent they're pretty quiet so I'm just
going to let this run now and see if the
temperatures come down and with the GPU
fans going it dropped down to about
forty eight C so we're seeing about two
to three C drop what the fans running at
a conservative sixty percent inaudible
you can't even really hear them remember
this radiator right here it's running
only at 50% and it's pretty warm it's
pretty saturated so I'm gonna do now is
I'm just going to let these fans go
balls to the wall and let's see how far
it comes down then and at our twenty
eighty eight o'clock if you're willing
to sacrifice some noise and the fans at
100 percent right here our temperatures
came all the way down to 42 C so what
does that mean well it means that
whatever rating they're putting on the
box is obviously pretty conservative on
the waterblock there's lots of different
factors here open air test benches that
the chats you've got fans you have sides
of radiator but obviously here were the
240 1850 rpm fans and leaving the fans
on the GPU just kind of doing its own
thing we came all the way down to 42 C
so you can see the range there right it
can go as high as like the 50s or as low
as like 41 42 depending on your setup
and it's the next thing to test here is
whether or not we can get any more
overclock now we can do this live
instead of having to cut the camera and
go through all the process because I've
got it set to where it was max stable
right now on air so the moment we do
this you can see our Mex cluck old soo
if I close it it went away but anyway
we'll leave that open here so let's go
ahead and go up one more step we'll just
add one step to this remember it's GPU
clock goes in steps on NVIDIA not one
megahertz at a time like a and D so
let's see what happens
will it run 2101 without crashing like I
said
21:01 on air just air would go for a
little while like this but then it would
kind of black screen and come back and
still run 2101 every now and then we get
like a the application is crashed
warning
but I think I think Nick would agree
that we are so far farther into this
test we've been getting with 2101 well
so I guess that's not the quietest setup
obviously but that's because I right now
I'm testing its max cooling capacity 41
C on water that's roughly what you get
with a custom block so as you can see
you can definitely tune this thing to
get better performance in terms of
cooling so that I think they're numbers
on the Box are extremely conservative we
have a crash did on this normally we
would crash by now now I would also test
the stability test like this by letting
a loop run for at least an hour without
a crash but I'm curious now if we can go
higher because we've already seen by
simply adding water to it and letting it
cool itself down and BRM is included
VRMs are water-cooled on this as well at
the full cover block obviously there's
some benefit to be had there so because
you can see it right there though 21:01
is what we ran in that little bit of a
test right there I don't have a single
1080 Ti that's come anywhere near that
so far what's the next steps going to be
like 2114 2113 it didn't crash it oh
there it goes okay so we got a little
bit we got a little bit farther let's
see if it comes back nope okay so I
think it's fair to say that this card is
already performing admirably definitely
I mean it's the fastest GPU I've had
come in here yet temperatures are good I
mean on the air-cooled temps as long as
you run the fans a little bit higher
than whatever their factory curve is you
can definitely get the temp slower than
that 78 C they show on the bus and
depending on the size of the rad and the
type of fans you put on there you can
get all the way down to 41 C on water
and overclocked that's insane
anyway guys I'm gonna go now tell me
what you guys think about the Poseidon
card it's been missing in action ever
since the 780ti it came back with a
vengeance it's got a heck of a lot of
design input our philosophy on there the
barbs looks better the Infinity window
looks cool it's got a glowing logo on
the backside and I think it would accent
pretty much any system and would look
great in there the Infinity windows
definitely in
touch that's for sure so yeah tell me
what you guys think and as always thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one man 21:01</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
