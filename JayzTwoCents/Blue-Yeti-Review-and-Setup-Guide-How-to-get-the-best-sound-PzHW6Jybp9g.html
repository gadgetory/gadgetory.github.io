here and I'm gonna answer the question
that I have been asked over and over and
over again
what mic do I recommend for podcasting
live streamers and people who want to
record audio today we're going to take a
look at the legendary blue Yeti all
thanks to mass drop you're looking at
starting up a stream or a youtube
channel or something this is where you
kind of want to start actually this is
where I started my youtube channel with
I think my third video I went out and
bought a blue Yeti I still have it
actually but we're taking a look at a
brand new one right here out of the box
sent over by mass drops make sure you
guys head on over there sign up it's
entirely free link is in the description
show huge shout out to master up thanks
for sponsoring today's video now I don't
get a kickback or anything on any of
those sales just want to put that out
there this is just a free giving back to
the community for you guys now the blue
Yeti as you can see it's it's it's not
blue
that's just the company name but the
Yeti is a legendary microphone it has
been around for a while and it is
definitely one of the go-to microphones
if you ask anyone about good audio for
YouTube now what makes it really nice is
the fact that it is a USB interface mic
it's entirely plug and play Windows will
pick it up regardless of what version of
Windows you're using you can couple it
with a free program like audacity which
as you can see is running right now and
you can be up and running with some
amazing quality audio but it's got a lot
of different functions on there it's not
just a microphone in fact if you take a
look at the bottom of this thing it
actually has a headphone monitoring jack
on there so that you can hear all the
audio that you're recording as you
record it so you can tell but too much
background noise you can tell if there's
a terrible hissing of your levels or
gains are way too high and it also has
standard threading on there for things
like a mic boom or a death stand or
something so you guys can get a custom
mounted up however you want and as I
mentioned it is a USB interface so it's
got that right
the usb-cable plenty long to reach
pretty much anywhere on your desk now as
you can see here it is also rotatable
and it's got a pretty decent stand with
rubber feet on the bottom so it's not
going to go anywhere and on the back you
can see we've got some knobs and dials
and things we'll talk about those in a
second now one of the things that I
think I get asked most common about this
mic is how do you set it up to get
amazing audio well guys it's actually
really simple the way I set mine up on
the back as I go just a little bit past
halfway on the gain and make sure you
are on a cardioid pattern that's the one
that looks like an upside-down heart
you've got stereo which is left right
you've got a circle which is
omnidirectional that's where it's going
to pick up everything around it equally
you've got cardioid which is where it's
only going to pick up the sound
signatures for what's right directly in
front of it and it's going to cancel
anything behind it and then you have got
interview mode basically that means it's
going to pick up equally anything in
front of it and anything behind it so if
you're trying to do some sort of an
interview or something you set this
directly between you and your subject at
equal distances and you'll get equal
audio so kind of like a two channel
audio thing you can flatten it and post
and get equal sound so that's what makes
this microphone so freaking legendary is
the fact that it has all of those
functions built in most are either going
to be a cardioid or an omnidirectional
or maybe both very very few microphones
at this price point give you all of that
now one of the newbie mistakes I see
people make with the Yeti is they do
this they talk into the top of it
well the Yeti is a site address
microphone what that means is you want
to talk to the label now another thing
that makes it really neat especially for
streamers is it's got this mute button
right here if you touch it to mute you
can see it starts flashing that means
your mute is active and if you're a
solid red that means that you are then
recording audio as you can see here with
audacity going if we push that in it's
flashing now you can see we have
flattened out on there we are no longer
actually recording any audio if we hit
that again now we are recording audio
once again you have a control knob on
the front here our volume knob to
control the monitor so that if you're
listening to the
the actual microphone you can hear what
you're recording as I mentioned earlier
but it takes it one step further because
the computer will actually recognize the
blue Yeti as a sound card so not only
will you hear yourself you will also
hear your game or your system sounds
because you can go right into the system
sound settings like I have set up right
here and if you go to playback you will
actually see oops I'm still in the
settings there you will see under
playback that the speaker's yeti stereo
microphone and you can turn this thing
into a sound card store whatever
headphones you have plugged into the
three-and-a-half millimeter jack on the
bottom also becomes your reference sound
and speakers and headphones so for
streamers that's a huge deal because it
means you can hear your game and you can
hear yourself so you're not screaming
like a lot of streamers do when they put
on headphones because of the active
noise-cancelling or even just noise
isolation built into many headphones
you're not gonna be screaming now this
wouldn't be much of a microphone test if
I didn't actually let you guys hear the
microphone now I want to point something
out here I'm recording it in audacity
right now I'm not going to be doing any
post-processing no compression no noise
removal exactly as it is in the room
right now skunkworks is running we are
recording here it's on the desk
no shock mount and have a fan running
over there blowing at me because I'm fat
and I get hot pretty easy with all the
lights in here so through the magic of
editing let's go ahead and switch over
to the Yeti alright guys now I'm talking
to you here on the blue Yeti on the
cardioid pickup pattern now the blue
Yeti is pretty damn legendary if you ask
me because they can pick up all sorts of
vocal ranges even if you start to get
really low like Ahnold and get really
into it and very mad and angry to pick
it up but as you can hear unfortunately
the bass starts to get a little bit
peaky a little bit cut off and you start
to hit clipping so yeah unfortunately it
does not have any sort of built-in um
compression in there so you don't or
limiter in there so you don't start
getting too peaky or as I mentioned
clipping so you guys are going to have
to do some tuning on there now for my
settings I am running the microphone
properties in Windows at 70 with the mic
gain on the mic just a little bit past
halfway as I've already mentioned now
the cardioid pickup pattern is good for
interviews or excuse me
for dialogue like I mentioned if we talk
to the back of it it's going to sound a
little bit ugly and distant because it
turns off that part of the pickup
pattern now let's go ahead and check out
the interview now as you can see with me
talking to the back of it it's going to
hear me a lot more clearer it's also
going to hear me pretty damn good from
the front and from the side it's going
to sound quite a bit more muffled now if
we pick up the omni what cardioid now we
pick up the omnidirectional we can talk
all the way around it and it's going to
sound the same well with the exception
of the handling noise and then you have
stereo if I talk to it from the front
I'm equally in both of your ears if
you're wearing headphones headphone
users I'm apologize this is about to get
very weird because now I'm in the right
side of your head now I'm in the left
side of your head now I'm just in your
head alright we're back on the cardioid
so I figure we will just go ahead and
laugh and with one of the cons of this
microphone and that is even though it's
a big giant thing it does not actually
have any sort of shock mount capsule
built into it so that means tapping on
the desk yeah it picked up every bit of
that if you're a gamer or your streamer
and you get mad and you bang your desk
it's pretty terrible so I highly
recommend getting yourself the blue Yeti
shock mount for it and putting it on a
desk boom or something like that and
getting it off your desk these little
rubber feet on the bottom don't do crap
for in fact if I just put my hand on the
microphone you hear that yeah yeah you
hear that start to get it start to sound
a little bit handily but anyways there
you go guys Jays 2 cents taking a look
at the blue Yeti from mass drop and as
always guys check out the forums the
forums are up and running it's actually
turning out to be a pretty damn big
community we've already got nearly 2,000
people signed up in just a few days and
it's actually pretty active I'm happy to
see that those forums are a good place
for us to grow a community and help each
other out in PC tech and
all of that goodness so I'm going to go
ahead and get on out of here and we're
going to get a little bit crazy here we
will talk we'll do a little Barry man a
little or manat anyway guys see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
