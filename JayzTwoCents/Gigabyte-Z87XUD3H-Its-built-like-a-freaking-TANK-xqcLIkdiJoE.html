cents and hold on to your butts because
today we're going to take a look at the
z87 X u t 3h motherboard from gigabyte
now the u d stands for altra durable and
that's exactly what you get here on this
motherboard from gigabyte with its very
heavy and robust heat sinks it's all
digital CPU power design and a dual BIOS
keeping things nice and safe and that's
what they mean by ultra durable five
plus has all the use ultra cool ultra
performance ultra safe and ultra USB 3
plus with 10 USB 3.0 ports that's a lot
of ports for all your 3.0 devices now
this motherboard is so feature packed
let's go ahead and talk about some of
the best features on this motherboard it
has durable black solid capacitors as
gold plated pins for you CPU it has an
Intel land with a high ESD protection
it's got digital IR power design for
your CPU UEFI BIOS it's got DVI hdmi
displayport output for all your AP use
tons of USB 4k support it's got six fan
connectors and the list just goes on and
on but before we talk about the rest of
those features let's go ahead and just
see what you get inside the box when you
open the box you have the motherboard
sitting here in this anti-static bag
right on top look at the size of those
heat sinks you could just see that
they're built with quality right off the
bat
underneath the motherboard tray you will
find a host of accessories that come
with this motherboard you've got your
driver and software disc you have your
users manual for everything you need to
know about the motherboard and if you
don't speak English you do have a
multilingual
installation guidebook here included
with this motherboard of course you have
your i/o shield for the back of your
case and you have four SATA connectors
here too that have 90-degree plugs and
two that have straight plugs and of
course you have your sli bridge and your
traditional gigabyte case badge now we
all know that this is the real reason
why you're watching this video is you
want to take a look at some up-close
glamour shots look at it in all of its
glory and the size of the heat sinks are
just massive this motherboard has a
really awesome looking matte black
finish to it which is gonna look good in
any case color that you may choose the
blue PCBs used to kind of clash with
some color combinations and now with
this black PCB it fits in just about any
design now when it unbox this
motherboard I was a bit surprised at
just how heavy it turned out to be but
that has to do with how heavy the heat
sinks are
every single heat generating portion of
this motherboard the VRMs the chipset
and everything on this motherboard that
generates heat has its own heatsink and
it's very high quality and very durable
this motherboard takes all of the
guesswork out on where all of those
pesky plugs go because everything is
clearly labeled right on the motherboard
you don't even have to look it up in the
manual to try and figure out where the
various plugs go because it's all right
there labeled for you even the back of
the motherboard shows the level of
quality and detail that has gone into
the design of this motherboard all the
solder 's are perfect and the matte
black PCB is just really kick-ass lookin
as far as interface and goes you have a
4 8 and 16 X PCI Express Lanes giving
you sli and crossfire support in two way
you have 3 x 1x PCI Express slots and
even an old-school PCI slot in case you
have an old peripheral that you're not
ready to get rid of you can still use it
with this motherboard when it comes to
your rear i/o you have a lot going on a
channel HD audio your land 8 USB 3.0
ports 2 of which also are eSATA and your
ps2 ports but if you're using onboard
graphics you're also hooked up with DVI
VGA DisplayPort and HDMI and of course
you have your digital optical output for
your sound
now there's an awful lot of features on
this motherboard to try and cover in one
video but I've told you about the main
features on this motherboard so let's go
ahead and hook it up stress test it and
let's just see exactly what we're
getting here is results with this
gigabyte z87 xu d3h motherboard well I
think it's a really solid board and
gigabyte is definitely known for having
very durable boards of all the
motherboards I've tested on the market
and over the years I've been buying
motherboards for client builds for
myself gigabyte has always gone above
and beyond when it comes to give you the
robustness that you would robustness I'm
not sure that's a word but it is today
the robustness that you would expect
from a mid-range motherboard I mean this
is a mid-range motherboard but it gives
you a lot of high range high-end
features the PCB just looks amazing but
the stability of the board is what I
cared about most in this video from the
time I started shooting it till now is
actually a week in the making the system
is running right over there being fully
stressed tested right now in eighth
sixty-four I've tested it in OC CT I've
tested it in prime95 and it is just
beyond solid in fact I was able to get
4.6 gigahertz out of my 46 70k with this
board where with the some of the other
boards that I was using was getting
about 4.4 stable so I was able to
increase the overclock by 200 megahertz
stable now when you do overclocking
there's a lot of things you have to
worry about when it comes to stress on
the board you've got to worry about the
the VRMs being overheated you got to
worry about the chips that being
overheated because there's a lot going
on when you overclock rather than just
pushing the socket and the CPU well
while fully testing this thing at full
load for two hours prior to starting
this video right now the motherboard
loaded at 33 degrees Celsius that's load
now it's sitting idle at if I'd won it
would my notes say it sits idle at about
30 degrees Celsius so you're talking
only three degrees jump and that's
definitely got to have something to do
with the ultra-durable heatsink design
on this when it comes to the V RMS and
the chipset now the V RM is one of the
really important components when it
comes to motherboard stability when it
comes to overclocking and getting nice
clean power delivered to your CPU and
the digi BRM the digital vrm built into
this is outstanding now when it comes to
gaming performance the motherboard isn't
directly responsible for frames per
second however it is indirectly
responsible for frames per second now
what do I mean by that the motherboard
controls the CPU or it backbones the CPU
so if you're able to get a stronger
overclock out of it which in this case I
got an extra 200 megahertz it did help
in games like Battlefield for Skyrim and
let's see Metro 33 games that were able
to really push the envelope to the
processors limits we're seeing an
improvement by about 4 frames per second
on average because of the fact that we
got a higher stable overclock out of
this now overclocking on this was a
cinch I mean it really is easy to
overclock nowadays when you have UEFI
BIOS
such but the u.s. UEFI BIOS on this
board it's a little bit different than
some of the other boards that I've used
I've used a lot of UEFI BIOS so it takes
some getting used to but you know
there's a little bit of a learning curve
in there the way the menus are laid out
but once you get used to it it's no
different than any other UEFI BIOS so
you just have a nice visual display of
all of the settings and it's easy to
tweak in fact whenever I did have a BIOS
failure or should say an overclock
failure because of my BIOS settings the
motherboard automatically detected that
and reverted its settings and brought me
back to the settings of Lunny fix it
based on a predetermined number of
failed attempted boots so it does make
it very overclocker friendly which leads
me back to what I said in the beginning
though where if it had a clear CMOS
button on the back it would be a lot
easier to reset those settings if you
had to go that route because of a failed
overclock I do really like the overall
feature set on this motherboard and at
the time of filming this board is coming
in at about 150 9 bucks which makes this
thing and absolute contender if you're
looking at building a gaming rig that is
either for a forty seven 70 or forty six
70 K and you want something that's beefy
and you know it's gonna last a long time
and you know that it's going to give you
the durability that you're looking for I
mean they call it ultra durable for a
reason and I have to just say that for
the last week I had been stressing the
hell out of the system I mean it has
been any time I've been working over
here I've had a 264 running or prime95
in fact this motherboard has spent
pretty much from the moment I installed
it either gaming or being stressed
tested just trying to make it break
because the last thing I want to do is
say it's a great product if it was out
there failing and for me this thing just
absolutely lives up to my standards so
if you're looking for a motherboard that
has just got all of the features that
you want to have expandability sli or
crossfire and you're running a new Ivy
Bridge and or excuse me a new Haswell
system and you want something that is
just in the last two years and years
just like my gigabyte ds3 hanging on the
wall over there that's that motherboard
that I've had hanging on the wall some
people have wondered what that is
that is a gigabyte ds3 and it was an LGA
775 board and it's hanging on the wall
because of sentimental value it was the
best overclocking motherboard I've ever
experienced getting an 80 percent
overclock out of my old East 6300 1.86
Peter Hertz Core 2 Duo that spent its
entire life overclocked to three point
four - and it still works if I had some
ddr2 RAM I would hook it up to show you
when it comes to durability gigabyte is
a brand that you can trust and so this
is a motherboard that I am using day to
day now and I'm confident in saying that
if you're building a computer and you're
looking for a nice mid-range board that
would fit all of your needs of
overclocking and gaming and
expandability definitely check out the
z87 ex-beauty 3h it's definitely a good
buy guys I hope you've enjoyed this
video I hope it's giving you some
information on guarding motherboards and
some of the features on this particular
motherboard if there's something you
want to know and maybe I didn't cover it
in this video
