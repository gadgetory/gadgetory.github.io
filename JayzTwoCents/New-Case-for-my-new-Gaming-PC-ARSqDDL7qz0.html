it's time to start preparing for a new
personal build I know a lot of you guys
are wondering where the hell is post
Malone stuff that's not coming until
after his album drops we're talking
early next year and all that stuff so
it's time to prepare for it but with
that said it's time to do a built for me
because you guys know skunk works is a
bit well I didn't want take it apart and
I don't want to update it I'm gonna keep
that together right here to the studio
and build a new system for home which
means we had to have a new chassis and I
think I got it it's heavy
I hope it's already all put together
course there's new light loop RGB fans
features 16 independent RGB LEDs across
two separate light loops allowing users
to create unique and custom lighting
effects perfect for both air cooling as
well as radiators the corsair light loop
RGB fans are an excellent choice for
that ultra custom look learn more by
clicking the link below alright if
you've been following me for any length
of time then you already know that I am
a huge car enthusiast and ever since the
D frames
first launched a couple years ago I had
to have one problem was I couldn't
afford it now and they were limited
edition and they were really hard to get
your hands on but that's all changed
I've got one now
and it's D frame 2.0 so there's actually
been some changes here and I just really
been a fan of in--when lately especially
since doing when doing their Terry Crews
build look at the way they pack stuff
this is this is a this is definitely
whoa check it out I got my own
membership card now terry has one now I
got one the way they pack stuff just
says they care about you and your
hard-earned money these are all the
cables and stuff because these also
include their own power supplies love it
or hate it the problem is they're fairly
designed specifically with their cases
in mind the you can't just plop in your
own PSU
there we go reason for that is at least
with the way it was on the tattoo point
Oh is it's not a standard form factor if
you can see right here the screw holes
are a straight up right rectangular
they're not offset like they are in
standard PS use look is that fan on that
guy holy hell so this is the power
supply it comes with the D frame it's a
1000 65 watt it's got plexi window on
the side so you could see in it just
looks really good I like I like that
vent though the cool thing is since this
hangs on the back of the case as you'll
see this definitely gives it a a very
aggressive kind of a racecar radiator
look because that's one of the reasons
why I wanted the D frame to me it looks
like a roll cage and that's what I love
about it most is it just it looks very
automotive to me and this has ever been
a time that I really hope I don't drop
something as now because the tempered
glass side panels are on them on it
already there we go this is heavy time
for the unveiling now here's the thing
these come in multiple colors they come
in white and blue they come in black and
gold which is on the box right here this
is not the one I chose that's the black
and gold one they've been showing off
and they also come with a black and
green well I think it's pretty obvious
which one I went with look at that oh
this is amazing
well would you just look at it look at
debts oh my god it's
what I didn't even know it did that well
what do you know now I guess it feels
more like a feels more like a fighter
jet right it's just when the canopy
comes down so the glass on this is
lightly tinted very lightly Carl -
anodized jeez it's just the amount of
detail that went into it see right here
this is all laser-cut anodized D frame
these are limited edition so they're
numbered whenever is this one actually
this one does have a number on it so
okay maybe they're not numbered but I
digress sort of accessories you get some
extra feet which is kind of nice ease or
rubber so that keeps them from sliding
around you know it's awesome though is
to keep the feet from rotating or moving
it's got this little kind of a peg or
nipple or just kind of a a penis I guess
actually yeah that keeps it from turning
so we got some extra feet for the bottom
right there we got some zip ties to keep
things as orderly as possible we got
some extra screws so that's to hold the
glass on we got some extra rubber
grommets which is for the glass see we
got our PSU and all of our standoffs
screws and of course a of course a
cleaning cloth for the glass and then
these are the cables for the power
supply right here and this is what
obviously were me changing so they are
flats style cables they are not sleeved
or anything they're just black
insulation on there and pretty standard
this is the kind of thing you would see
with any other power supply usually you
know does it matter if it's Corsair EVGA
or whatever they kind of look like this
so yeah nothing special there that's why
we definitely a case like this certainly
deserves a custom set of cables and you
know that that's gonna happen the other
part that you guys are probably
wondering is if I'm not using the stuff
from skunk works what am I going to be
putting in here and that sort of been my
struggle skunk works has a lot of
horsepower in it's got a 69 50 X oh jeez
okay got it let's put this safely away
okay nobody go near this box it's got
the glass in it okay so check this out
we'll talk about hardware in a second
here but this case is fairly inverted
with a graphics card to go up here on
top and you kind of bring your cables
out through the back right here your PSU
mounts in this box right here so that's
why I was saying with the way the fan
goes
it's got a very automotive kind of a
feel as it's in there so that's gonna
look really cool and then just the welds
even the welds on this you're gonna
assume these are robot welded and not a
human welding all of these but the welds
are perfect the anodizing or powder
coating absolutely flawless on this
which is why I wanted this guy right
here now you can see it's got room for a
360 right on the bottom well the cool
thing is we can actually mount a 360 rad
on the front as well it's got these
really interesting sort of mounts right
here so what I'll probably have to do is
some I might to do some custom work on
this but that's never scared me so if I
have to do that I believe I can move
this band up they do that pictures
really show a 360 right on the front and
a 360 right on the bottom and that's my
goal that's what I'm gonna go for
because let's talk about hardware here
for the new the new build I I don't even
know what I'm gonna call it be honest
we'll come up with something just
yesterday the new Titan VIII launched
stands for Volta you guys were waiting
for Volta it's a three thousand dollar
graphics card don't think I'm getting
one per review I don't know if anyone is
to be honest because last time they
launched a three thousand dollar
graphics card they didn't send any for
review that being the Titans II they say
that that card is a complete they say
that card is built from the ground up
for machine learning and they've said
that like all along ever since Nvidia
got into the deep learning game they've
said that and then they end up you know
cutting it down a little bit and calling
it a gamer card even though it's the
same core but this time around it
actually made some architectural changes
that specifically are tailored towards
science and deep learning and all of
that I have no idea how well it's been
performing gaming if I can get my hands
on one determine if they're any good or
not then I might actually consider it
but I'm thinking about doing an 8700 K
this because I don't really do wait a
minute
I get it now when you have that aha
moment how many of you guys are
screaming right now at the thing going
it's not you're not supposed to do that
he actually still comes off why I
figured it out better late than never
hey so I'm thinking 8700 K and the
reason for that is it's not quite as
demanding in terms of power as the X 299
stuff any direction I went with skunk
works on a higher end CPU would mean
more cores and the problem is that does
not compute to a better gaming
experience very rarely especially when I
have 10 cores 20 threads already on that
I've got 79 80 XE back here 16 or no 18
cores 36 threads complete waste when it
comes to gaming there's nothing I'm
doing at home that's can utilize that
kind of power
79 60 X upstairs using as my editing rig
at home I have occasionally do some live
streaming occasionally so that's why I
think the 8700 K would be perfect it's
not quite as power demanding sure it's
warm but we can do some things to fix
that I don't think about going with a
new Maximus formula when it comes out I
think it's should have one on the way
but doing a full cover block on that and
of course water cooling all of this
don't need massive amounts of storage so
all these will go don't need these
that's why I'm gonna put the radiator in
the front because it's just gonna be a
gaming rig and I want to build a
kick-ass gaming rig the problem is I
don't know what to do about graphics
cards because we are coming up soon on
possibly main stream Volta coming if
ever I don't know if there's ever if
there ever gonna feel that there's a
need for it in the gaming world I'm sure
they will I don't think Titan VIII is
gonna be it though because just cost a
performance on that for gaming if I go
SLI you guys know I like SLI that's
$6,000 in graphics cards plus tax let's
just call it 6600 it's ridiculous it's a
ridiculous amount of price to
performance but this looks this looks
fantastic now you know we're gonna need
to do here we're gonna also have to do
some custom wiring because everything is
visible just like we did with the Terry
Crews build there's glass on both sides
there's nowhere to hide wiring we are
going to have to have our custom length
custom sleeved cables I might give it a
shot I might try and do it myself I also
might just bring in my good friend Joe
with sanctum
to see what we can do here so anyway
that's it that's just kind of a quick
video to show you guys here what's
happening like I said the post Malone
video has been postponed that's what
we're actually calling I'm calling the
project postponed not like because it's
delayed but P wned like you got pwned
that's what I'm calling it and once his
albums out and we see all of the details
and and the flare then we'll figure out
what we're gonna do there's been a lot
of people who've built in the D frame
lots of inspiration out there I'm gonna
try and come up with my own take on it
but I'm gonna go tone do you think about
the black and the green I think it looks
real good I'm probably gonna stick with
the green theme inside obviously but
yeah I know there's lots of great cases
out there but this is one that I have
just been drooling over for a while now
now that I finally got my own huge thank
you to in wind for hooking me up with
this for sure alright guys I'm gonna go
thanks for watching and as always I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
