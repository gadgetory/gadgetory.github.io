VPN a service I've been using for a long
time and it's becoming more relevant
than ever as we will talk about in
today's video obviously with the passing
of the European Union a directive on
copyright and specifically article 13
we'll be talking about that in today's
video so we're probably going to see a
huge rise in VPN traffic here in the
near future because of net neutrality
and now article 13 but fortunately Nord
VPN has you covered with thousands of
servers of more than 61 countries
including you guessed it Europe in fact
Nord VPN even has a campaign going right
now to bring awareness to this ongoing
issue with a fight the meme ban with
memes competition taking place in fact
you guys can find a link down the
description below it's designed to make
people aware of what is happening and
what we are talking about in today's
video but not only all of this it's just
good practice to protect and encrypt
your data when you connect to the
internet with military-grade encryption
you can bet that the ISPs and the
governments and all these other entities
will not be spying on your data in fact
new users you sign up for Nord VPN using
my offer code J's two cents at checkout
can save 75% off a three-year membership
that is a very small price to pay to
maintain the open freedom of your
internet experience so you guys waiting
for start taking things serious and
shove it to article 13 by signing up for
Nord VPN using my link in the
description below well I've just spent
the last day or so benchmarking the
brand-new gtx 1650 from nvidia a card
that if you look at other reviews really
is kind of confusing because it's it's
like why does it even exist
we're gonna I mean all right I don't
know where to start with this one
Nvidia is great at many things it's
great at building high-end graphics
cards at a price premium but spoiler
alert it's also great at building
mediocre cards in the low end to mid
range and also a price premium so here's
the thing when I started benchmarking in
1650 I was a little upset like everyone
else because we received the cards from
the AIB
about a week a week in half in advance
and it's one of those things where like
typically we get them in advance because
we get advanced drivers which is why I
was kind of confused as to why they
withheld drivers from press reviewers
until retail launch so it's kind of like
why do we have cards early if they are
basically paperweight so we couldn't do
anything with them so I actually went to
Twitter and I said well and video
withheld drivers which usually means
they're hiding something in this case
having now reviewed the 1050 the 570 and
the 1650 compared to of course is 1660
and the other cards that we tested over
the years there's more than one thing
they're hiding as far as I'm concerned
now before we can actually talk about
these cards you have to see the
performance so that you're on the same
page as I am and caught up as to where
these cards are sort of stack up so
let's just go ahead and rock out with
your charts out
I tested this EVGA GTX 16:50 after
starting to test with our MSI 16:50 now
both of these cards are above reference
nvidia doesn't actually have a reference
or founders edition 16:50 nor do they
have a reference sixteen sixty or
sixteen sixty TI the reference cards
start or the founders cards start at
2060 enough because of course our TX is
their you know their golden child and
that's the only one they truly care
about and i think that shows entirely on
this lineup both of these cards are also
using supplemental six pin power which
means that these are not as low as the
performance that they could possibly be
these are slightly better slightly
factory overclocked and overclockable
graphics cards not relying just on the
pci express power slot or the twelve
volt that comes to the power or the PCIe
slot which is about 75 watts so these
are able to draw significantly more if
you start to overclock them now in our
test I did not overclock them at all
these were out of the box settings no
power curve tweak no fan curve tweak
nothing like that so in terms of
temperatures it's important to note that
these cards are as you would expect
extremely cool running it like high 50s
to low 60s under their stock fan curves
no throttling whatsoever they both sat
right around 1950 to 1935 because GPU
boost 4.0 it went significantly higher
than the clocks that were advertised so
that's how GPU boost works we talked
about every time blah blah blah broken
record but it's not to say it cuz people
still don't seem to understand that so I
went ahead and went back and tested our
1050 now the only 10 50s I have are the
MSI very basic as you can see cards with
no power plugs no multiple fans or
anything like that and this card is
actually still available right now on
the market now the performance gap that
I saw between the 1650 in the 1660 was
so significant that I went ahead and
went back and tested my rx 570 now the
risk of sounding like AMD had anything
to do with us including the rx 570 in
our benchmarks that is 100% untrue
because I saw that other people are
testing with the 570 and the reason for
that is because the 570 is cheaper than
a 1650 now although the Radeon team and
the marketing team is really pushing the
570 right now
that's because this is the card that is
closest in price to the 1650 which is
the one that makes the most sense to
compare if we want to do both sides of
the fence that's why we included the RX
570 so no conspiracy theories about AMD
saying hey include our card here's a
here's a $20 bill under the table know
that none of that happened whatsoever
well I had a couple zeros maybe so the
570 that we included though was the red
devil from power color this is of course
a custom PCB with 1/8 in power and
triple fan and super long and heat pipes
and all that and someone might go well
gee that's not fair it's extremely fair
because this card is still cheaper than
the 1650 and decimating it and pretty
much every single test that we did and I
say pretty much it did it did decimate
the 1650 in every test and slid right in
between the 1650 in the 1660 for cheaper
than the 1650 it's a four gigabyte card
and although it doesn't have what some
might say is some of the features of the
Nvidia card like it doesn't have g-sync
well so why it has free Sinkin there are
more free sinc panels for cheaper on the
market so you're still getting adaptive
sync at the lesser price than the 1650s
you see online all the time well in
video well they will the price come down
with the price coming down you never see
a price adjustment down at the lower end
they never do they never adjust pricing
but if I bought a five seventy at full
retail which was roughly 200 maybe 219
something like that for the 4 gig card
this is a 4 gig and now it's available
for 139 the prices always slide everyone
knows the price is gonna slide so if you
early adopt Radeon you definitely pay
full price and then you kind of get
screwed later because it comes down in
price quite a bit so AMD does indeed
slide the price down and they definitely
did that with this launch and yeah if
you bought one of these a few months ago
it might kind of sting because he could
have gotten the cheaper cheaper than
what you're paying right now the other
thing that is really disappointing about
the 1650 and I mentioned the reason why
they didn't show us these drivers ahead
of time is because Nvidia is probably
hiding something well yeah they're
hiding the fact that is being decimated
by the mid-range and low-end Radeon
cards I mean it's sad I started
comparing the numbers and so
by order and this card the 1650 slid
right in at around the 380 X margin or
the area which is over three almost four
years old that's pre Polaris and this
card wasn't even able to keep up with
the 570 Polaris again at a cheaper price
point now the reason why you didn't see
the msi on our charts is because when I
first started my testing I started
getting black screen flickering all over
the place and I went though that's
inside maybe we got a bad card
unfortunately I couldn't let them know
prior to launch because we didn't have
drivers for me to test it and they also
told me in the email both both EVGA and
msi obviously we're like hey we don't
have drivers nvidia would be sending
those you know the the way they sent
them was their own download website for
everyone to grab on launch day so I
couldn't say hey is this what's wrong
with your card then a hook up the EVGA
card and notice the same black screen
flickering issue when testing time spy
it was isolated to time spy I didn't
experience it in any of my other tests
including dx12 tests like shadow the
Tomb Raider and anywhere else I turned
on dx12 to see if the problem persisted
it was isolated to time spy so already
there is there's some issues happening
with this card on that particular test
so that's why time spy was emitted from
our test entirely it got a big fat fail
in that particular test so this brings
us onto the discussion regarding the
cards value there really isn't
there was really no value with this card
as far as I'm concerned it's got a
hundred and fifty dollar MSRP you can
get this read double card before I
believe it was 129 139 available right
now on Newegg 170 dollars or $60 for
this card so this card is $20 cheaper
than this one and significantly faster
up till like 20% faster in our tests we
want to see what the performance value
is like it's like that that's what it's
like if we want to make a chart out of
these two cards there you go okay but J
touring touring is so good blah blah
blah what about the Nvidia encoder
returing it's amazing if you want to OBS
and and and use one of these cards as an
encoder
that's the other thing in videos hiding
it's using the Volta encoder they didn't
even include the touring encoder with
their touring architecture on this I
think it's a stat boosting card so that
they can say look at how many touring
cards we have out in the wild
hoping that people won't look at the
Radeon
offering at the lower pricepoint
thinking that while nvidia is just
faster than AMD well that's true once
you start going above the five hundred
dollar price point nvidia is faster but
they also have a terrible value
extremely terrible value at this price
point so I kind of feel bad for the AI
B's if you are know the truth the AI B's
are forced to make these cards that's
the agreement they are the manufacturers
for these lower end tiers and the higher
in tiers of course they can't say you
know Nvidia we're not gonna make a 1650
you can't do that it's and it's in their
contract in their agreement but they
have to make the cards so they do the
best they can with coming up with these
custom designs these power plugs and all
of that and unfortunately it wasn't
nearly enough guys at the end of the day
this card shouldn't exist and I swear to
God if Nvidia who cares if Nvidia makes
a 1650 T I'm gonna lose my shit I swear
to god I'm gonna lose my if they make a
1650 ti so if we look at the product
stack from Nvidia its 1650 1660 1660 ti
2060 2070 28:28 e TI and they tighten RT
x so here's my official conclusion
it doesn't need to exist it shouldn't
exist
it's Nvidia is completely out of touch
low-end and mid-range market where
they're charging a premium for nothing
there's no value to it whatsoever for
the first time in a long time we can say
Nvidia welcome to two years ago for your
competitor oh and if you guys bought a
1650 because their reviews weren't
available to tell you well you got duped
you got duped by the green machine and
well I would probably use that return
policy but apparently AMD me paid me to
say all this and the video pays me to
say this and blah blah blah blah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
