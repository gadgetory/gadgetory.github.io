on youtube and today I decided I'm going
to bring you a brand new series to my
channel where I talk about some of the
coolest apps that you can possibly
install on your iOS device iPhone iPod
iPad and we're not going to talk about
any of that Google Android speak with
you run rust Yoda these words you speak
to the dark side dude dude I was just
talking to my viewers about a new series
I'm gonna be bringing about iPhone mmm
and some of the coolest Android you must
include I know but I like iPhone do or
do not
alright there is no Drive which is why
I'm gonna be bringing you a brand new
series on my channel where I talk about
the coolest apps that you can possibly
install on your iPhone and your Android
device hey guys little tip stay to the
end of the video where I put up a link
to the news broadcast that I was in
called my news remix on Fox TV in
Orlando you don't wanna miss that
while perusing through the app store I
happen to come across an app called
system activity manager and when you
open it up this is what you see here you
see a pie chart you see some information
regarding the amount of memory that's
being used in real time you can see the
percentage of switching there you can
see the amount of free memory available
in scale of a whole one of the things
that Apple really likes to boast about
itself is the fact that it has superb
memory management in multitasking this
chart will show you right off the bat
that over 515 megabytes of the one
gigabyte of available memory or ram is
being utilized right now quite a bit of
that memory is put in in active mode
where it is considered available to apps
that were used in recent history leaving
only one hundred and four megabytes
available to new tasks taxes tasks on
the phone and I guess that could be sort
of a tax couldn't it as you can see on
the little slider chart right here we
are down in the red what that means it's
gonna take applications longer to load
and it's gonna take the phone a little
bit more battery to do its tasks so what
do you get here in this application you
get a memory tab you have disk space
information the really cool part about
this app is it gives you full battery
stats when you open up the battery stats
right here it gives you a list and a
checklist of things to do to keep your
battery maintained how to keep your
your life running as long as possible
and what you can do to stop sucking down
all of the juice out of your phone that
means don't leave on your Bluetooth
don't leave on your Wi-Fi when you're
not using it don't sit there and watch
pornography all day long unless you're
plugged into the cord then Who am I to
judge I don't judge watch this channel
children do I know Yoda it's a it's a
joke I'm with you it's the comedy is not
he's never never gets off my back but it
tells you right here how much you can
expect to get out of your phone based on
different tasks what I think is really
cool about this application is if you
look right here under the recharge time
it tells you how long it will take your
phone to charge to full if you go over
here to the network settings tells you
everything you'd like to know about your
network but the process is part right
here is really cool it tells you
everything you need to know about the
current running process we are now down
to 40 megabytes thirty-nine megabytes of
available memory on the phone so if I
want to free up some of that space this
little round button here with the arrows
right above my finger you touch that and
then the phone then works its magic or
the app I should say works its magic and
look at all the utilize memory coming
back to the phone look at our memory 606
megabytes available now so if you guys
use an iPhone and you came from Android
and you missed your beloved task manager
the little robot guy that will shut down
apps for you go ahead and download this
bad boy it's got a free version with an
ad down at the bottom or for $0.99 you
can have the full version which is what
I downloaded here's this activity
manager there it is right there one of
the things I wish that this did have was
maybe some sort of an auto functionality
where every 15 or 20 minutes it can
automatically run itself just like the
Android versions but to catch it on it's
on Apple here it is check it out and as
I promised
or should I say is that little runt Yoda
made me promise to do is I'm including
Android in this little spiel one of my
favorite Android apps is this app right
here called Wi-Fi analyzer if you're
like me you're always setting up
wireless networks and stuff and you need
a utility to help you choose what the
best channel is this free application
gives you all sorts of information about
what's going on with Wi-Fi in your area
I'd only does it give you a little chart
here that shows you the signal strength
all the different wi-fi's in your area
it also shows you what channel they're
running on so if you want to get a
little bit of information here about
what's going on with your Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi
is in your area Wi-Fi analyzer is a
perfect app it's absolutely free this is
really cool right here because it shows
you which channels have the best signal
so if you're setting up a Wi-Fi you can
check right here using this app on your
Android what has the best signal
strength and as you can see right here
channel 11 would be the best signal
strength if you were setting up a new
Wi-Fi right here in this area you also
get a little bit of a graph here that
shows you know what's going on in the
area and this one's really neat here
it's like it's like a little meter that
shows you how strong the signal is so if
you click down here and you touch on the
different networks you can see exactly
how strong the signals are so there you
go this is Wi-Fi analyzer it's got some
settings here you can change all sorts
of different things you can look at 2.45
gigahertz you can give us again
intervals you can give it open network
indicator you are setting up some sort
of a wireless network Wi-Fi analyzer
should definitely be in your repertoire
of different applications on your phone
so if you've got an Android check out
Wi-Fi analyzer and if you've got an
iPhone make sure you check out sis
activity manager there you have it guys
whether or not you own an Android or an
Apple device I'm gonna start bringing
you a new series where I talk about
different kinds of apps that are both
free and paid and what should make their
way onto your smart phone device and if
you're new to my channel do yourself a
favor check out some of my other videos
I have 70 some-odd other videos on this
channel with great content that you
should all be checking out and coming up
later this week I'm going to be doing a
gaming build an $850 budget gaming bill
as well as I'm gonna be rebuilding the
water cooling setup in my computer so
it's gonna be really cool it's going to
cover all the basics you need to know
for building a computer and I will see
you guys next time
