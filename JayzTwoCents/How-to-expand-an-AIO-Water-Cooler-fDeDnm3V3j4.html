the struggles of custom water cooling is
it just too hard
do you wish there was an easier way well
stay tuned for the following sponsored
message from fractal design you know I
think I just stuff in your foot okay you
know I don't think water cooling is
really all that hard hi I'm James P Fenn
master water cooler and I'm Josh from
fractal design now we're going to go
head and talk today about the Celsius s
36 and some of its expandability
properties and show you that know you
can have some custom cooling without all
the headaches that's right it's not that
hard
even NIC can do it now obviously I would
prefer custom water cooling but Josh
maybe you could tell the audience a
little bit about the Celsius s 36
expandability and why they might
consider this that's a very good point
Jay I'm glad that you brought it up
you know liquid cooling especially
open-loop can be very intimidating
there's fittings there's blocks
there's pumps and reservoirs and all
those sorts of things and you know it
can be kind of hard to figure out
exactly what you need so some people
want to start off on a simple solution
you know a I actually have one of those
ready to go right here that we kind of
assembled off-camera before we started
today you're always prepared Jay how do
the boys down but you know to be very
intimidating to start your own open-loop
build some people want to start and then
have the system grow with them and what
selfie fest 36 or s 24 you can do just
that
now we actually did a video earlier
about how to install this so if you guys
want to start there go and check out
that video but the focus today is
showing you just how easy you can
actually open this up and add some parts
to it so what do you say we get started
it sounds like a great idea Jay so what
we're going to do today is we're going
to take this average PC you might find
in typical home at air-cooled on the cpu
who's got an air-cooled GPU and we're
going to convert this over to awesome
by using this guy right here so what do
we need to do to actually get started
I'm glad you asked Jay we could start
with how about a reservoir okay we're
going to need something to put fluid in
and make it easier to bleed so we got
one of those sounds great graphics card
grab this card absolutely otherwise
what's the point of expanding it so
there's our GPU what do you think what's
next well we need a way to connect all
this together right so how about some
fittings I always carry around fittings
in my pocket oh it's a need to have
without it okay what are we missing her
from I'm tubing oh yes absolutely we got
some of that right here again about
tools we mean tools wise ah maybe a
wrench okay where do we need a wrench oh
we want to loosen the fittings and
tighten them up securely got one of
those right here whether we need ah a
screwdriver perhaps Oh got one of those
too funny okay um something to cut the
tubing scissors yeah what's the first
thing we have to do that we've got our
tools and our parts I'm glad you asked
the first step is we're going to drain
the current radiator that way we make
room for our expansion don't you mean we
can't just reuse the fluid that's dirty
in there you could reuse the fluid but
there's not going to be enough since
we're expanding we're going to have more
surface area more tubing lengths so we
want to make sure that it's completely
full so we don't have any nasty air
pockets in it so then we're actually
missing something cooling I'll get it
I'll be right back
ah there we go I don't do right there
now the fluids that we're using right
here is actually a fluid that's designed
for mixed metals like aluminum and
coppers and nickel so you want to make
sure any fluid that you use is going to
have some sort of corrosion inhibitor
that's probably most important thing
moving forward okay we've got everything
now we need to start draining this rig
what do you think we should maybe get
someone who's not involved or used to
this to try this to see how easy it is I
think they'd be great with you being the
wonderful super supreme master liquid
cooler that you are things like this are
always gonna be easy for you yeah they
wish to grab somebody from the audience
if anybody out there wants to try and
show just how easy it is show of hands
show of hands out there Oh
let's keep looking anybody out there oh
there's a lot of people interested Jake
hey how about you with the blue hair ah
okay so you have never done anything
like this before never never okay well
here's we're going to we're going to go
ahead and get you to we need something
to actually put the fluid in right yeah
wonky okay we got a bucket there okay
are you going to do is you take these
pliers and you're just going to loosen
this fitting right here now does it
matter which tube they actually remove
yes actually what we want to do is the
pwm cable runs through this tube right
here the tube on the right and we want
to keep that there so you can still have
your fan hub working so the pump can
communicate with the fans give you the
best possible cooling and that's also
the outlet from the pump courage is
knowing exactly so when you're running
someone's out of a
bore into a pump we want to make sure
we're getting fresh cool water coming in
through the inlet so we are going to
remove the inlet to okay and what I want
you to do is take the pliers put them on
the grooves of the fitting right there
and just give that a little turn to the
left so that's loose there you go just
like that now we've basically the
easiest part to do next just do it by
hand if you hold this upright you won't
get as much fluid spill but you want to
use a bucket or something underneath
that way you don't get too much of it
falling down on your workspace okay now
that you got that loose go ahead and
just take it all the way off there ya go
gonna hold the pump up everything mmm I
can smell the intake okay okay it looks
like we have all the fluid drained out
of the radiator that wasn't too hard was
about oh no no hard at all okay Jay what
should be the next step well you know
this is the part where you probably want
to plan out your loop now it doesn't
matter if it's an AI o that you're
expanding or it's a custom loop the only
thing that truly matters in terms of
order is that your reservoir is directly
feeding your pump so this is the tube
right here whether we keep the tube or
take it off we're going to connect that
to our reservoir and then the rest we
can just kind of plan based on what is
ascetically pleasing sounds good should
we go to the case let's do it
okay so let's hear a round of applause
for our sister Anna thank you very much
now I've gone ahead and taken all of the
air cooled parts out of the system
prepared for our installation here now
what it actually supported like what
CPUs can we use with it actually you can
use all the latest and greatest CPUs
including AMD's new rising process oh
cool so have no problems attaching to
our m4 socket here with our rising 1700
X that's correct the bracket extra chips
in the box
that's right rising support out of the
box as some people have already noted
the tubing doesn't actually remove from
the pump way of that it's for added
durability Jay okay so we've got our
inlet tube right here loose from the
radiator we're going to have our tubing
basically the route is going to go
reservoir to pump pump to radiator
radiator to GPU which we have to connect
the tubing and a GPU back to the
reservoir so I'm going to easy enough
okay let's go and start by well if for a
graphics card in first it sounds like a
good idea
now because we just drain this system
there's going to be some residual
moisture right few drips we don't want
that happening inside of our case so I'm
going to go ahead and just add the
tubing to the radiator now and get that
lock down that way any drips that might
occur can just go ahead and well not
hurt our component now that's the
standard G quarter thread right yeah it
is but the only thing you have to be
mindful of is making sure that the
sizing of your tubing and your fittings
are the same now we're going to be going
with a soft tubing here because well we
have to retain our soft tubing right
here at the pump so you couldn't
technically do a rigid portion of this
loop it just makes more sense to use
some sort of a soft tubing so now we've
got our tubing on there we're not
worried about any drips inside the
system I'm going to go ahead and mount
the radiator in place now I want to put
the tubing in the front I find that
there's more clearance doing it that way
and I just it's just more of a
preference we you can do this however
you want but yeah this is pretty much me
one of those things that is purely at
your discretion
now while J finishes putting the last
screw on the radiator I'll go ahead and
get to the reservoir that's next item
you want to install correct jack
absolutely now the nice thing about the
define as is it actually has integrated
reservoir mounts right on the backside
of the case including brackets if you
need them now I'm just going to use the
bracket direction included with the
reservoir that I'm using right here but
she definitely has some flexibility if
you need it now while J does that one of
the important things about the to
finance the fact that you do not have to
get your reservoir mount
perfect the first time
as he honestly did not and as we can see
Jay is finishing mounting the CPU block
on the am for socket and E rising
processor what next Jack well you know
we're not that far from actually being
done we're going to go ahead and we're
going to take the tubing here coming out
of the reservoir or the radiator and
we're just kind of think about order
here and like I said the only it really
matters is that our reservoir it's
beating our pump now obviously it looks
a little bit off access there in terms
of height but we'll talk about how to
combat that in a second so the way the
order is going to be in this loop is
it's going to go from reservoir to CPU
pump CPU pump to radiator radiator to
GPU and GPU back to the reservoir now
one of the things that you'll notice is
that the standard tubing length on the
Celsius units is ample enough to reach
almost any mounting location inside the
case it's actually pretty long alright
it looks like we got our tubing in there
and well everything's hooked up now look
at that well that's great J but what are
the paper columns for like I went the
blood off the reservoir I bled on it
really great Patrol well the fittings
are sharp okay I bleed in every building
I'm here myself
because we've actually opened up this
kit and now we put some parts together
leeks are always a chance minimal chance
but it's possible so what we're going to
do next is we're going to line some of
the components that we've just put
together with paper towels nearby so
that we can check for leaks sounds great
does that make it easier to identify the
leaks or just to soak up the liquid or
how does that work
actually both you can identify where the
leak is coming from and if you have a
colored fluid it actually makes it
easier to spot on the paper towel now
there's actually another device we like
to use which is just a 24-pin PSU jumper
so that we don't have to turn on the
whole system but just the power supply
to get the pump going so that we can
actually start to get our filling and
our testing which I think we should do
next
sounds great we got some fluid in there
everything seems tight we're not seeing
any leaks I think it looks pretty good
consuming the fact that it's an a i/o
turned into a custom loop well I agree
it does look pretty good J but I'm no
expert here I just don't see how that
water is going to make it into the pump
you know that's a very astute
observation Josh because he's right you
do have to have the reservoir higher
than the pump to be able to feed it in
priming the system now there's two
things you can do you can actually
rotate the case like this and get the
reservoir higher than the pump and it's
easier to prime that way or we're going
to do today is we're just going to lay
the case flat on its back we're going to
unhook our reservoir from the bracket
and because we have flex tubing we can
actually just hold it upright which is
going to give us the height that we need
well as you can see Josh we've got
everything together we've got our fluid
in there the lines of blood I've even
added a little bit of blue dye for that
fractal design touch everything staying
nice and cool the CPU are 1700 X is
sitting at right around 55 C under load
and our GP right now which is a GTX 1080
under stress test is sitting at a
comfortable 47 C not that I think that
is pretty impressive but you know you
shouldn't take our word for it can we
get a member of the audience up here to
put their hand on and tell Sarang how
about you come on up sorry okay what
stairs okay you're good hey Kyle should
I get right on in there oh that's so
cool so cool well I think that about
wraps it up today thank you for joining
us Josh is there anything you'd like to
leave with our audience members here
before you go well Jay I think you did a
great job expanding the loop and I think
it just goes to show that you can start
with something simple like an AI oh and
let it grow with you and come up with
something like this and you know at
first I was kind of like I don't know
about the black tube but I kind of liked
the fact that we have two different
colors here one for the CPU and one for
the GPU get a little bit of that custom
touch very minimalistic all right well
guys thanks for watching today's video
obviously we're just having a little bit
of fun kind of poking at that whole
infomercial thing but honestly this is
something take worth taking a look at
the 360 you handle GPU no problems and
it doesn't really cost the time that
said thanks for watching we'll see you
in the next one while supplies last the
blood sacrifices must be made
oops is gluing don't look at me like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
