your jokes get it out of the way so we
can get into today's topic without all
of the the jokes go and make them make
them good if you're going to at least
want to laugh when I read them what's up
guys Jase two cents here and after
experiencing plenty of demos and then
heading to e3 lately where I kind of got
to see the latest and greatest coming
our way when it comes to virtual reality
obviously the HTC vive is out the oculus
rift is still trying to make it out to
people who bought them and then Sony
coming out with its VR later this year I
was like you know what I'm sick and
tired of not being on this bandwagon so
I hit it over to Micro Center last week
and I spent 800 bucks on my own HTC vive
yeah 800 bucks it's not cheap which is
why I'm making this video I had no
intentions of making a video I just
wanted to enjoy it but the morning I
enjoyed it the more I wanted to share it
with you guys and help you decide
whether or not this is something you
should spend your money on this cost as
much as most people's entire computer
setup so is it worth it well guys let's
talk about setup and let's talk about
well how it is yeah that's what we're
gonna do today
what are you doing
ice thought it's time for an upgrade
that's little J's Xbox ah much better
how did you even get in here yes made a
key last time I was here no big deal
well I could go for a drink right about
now though I kind of feel like you've
already done this whole living room
thing before no there's a different
channel these are horrible man well you
are breaking and entering
no not I've witnesses the new defined
nan OS from fractal design supports
full-size power supplies full-length
graphics cards room for a complete
custom water loop and heck even room for
a couple of freeloaders click the link
in the description for more details
fractal Josh not included we should
order pizza
now everyone talks about the vibe it's
so cool virtual reality is here it's lag
free etc etc but not enough people are
talking about the setup so that's where
I'm going to start today's video because
the setup is the most important part
considering it is responsible for the
entire experience of the yard if you
have a poor setup your VR experience is
going to be poor and everyone
complaining about this or that should
probably be making sure they actually
set the thing up properly before they
start taking to the forums and bitching
I think more people need to do that
about all kinds of things not just the
vibe but I digress
obviously HTC includes everything you
need to enjoy enjoy VR it's got two base
stations it's got obviously the headset
it's got both of the hand held devices
the hand wands I know what they actually
call them it's got power cords power
plugs thang extension cables it even
comes with a set of earbuds so that you
can hear in VR what's the point of
having sound coming from one space if
you're moving freely it doesn't work
that way so stereo is actually very very
important when it comes to VR now first
things first we're setting up your vibe
you need to determine where your space
is going to be where are you going to
play it it supports three modes sitting
standing and room scale now obviously
I'm set up for room scale in the setup
process for any of the three is going to
be the same so where as I'm showing you
room scale here you can apply this to
any of the three options now when
decide where you want to set up your
vibe you want to make sure you're clear
any obstructions
now although tripping and falling will
be funny and laughing and everyone's
hahaha yo you fell on your face it's not
funny to just you know cause damage to
an $800 unit and unless you are
extremely rich and you can just afford
to buy these from end-on-end
I don't think you should you should go
falling down so make sure your space is
obstructed from any sort of trip hazards
now the cord itself is also a trip
hazard but we'll talk about that a
little bit later in the setup but once
you've got your space identified and
where you want to play you're going to
want to set up the base stations in two
opposing corners of that space so
diagonally
that's at least ideal now you do want
these things to be in optical range of
each other you want them to be able to
see each other and you want to mount
these at least six and a half feet off
the ground because you don't want any
sort of eye level obstructions other
bookshelves may be chairs or couches to
cause them to not be able to track
properly so the higher they are the more
head level or above the better they're
going to track so keep that in mind but
when you place these in the corners of
your space you also want them to be
facing down at about a 45 degree angle
because they do have a sort of a cone
shape at which they can track and so you
want these to be your like how do caning
each other of you will let's imagine
that in VR woojae coming at you there
alright that was really stupid so you
want these to account for about a 120
degree angle of width and then about a
45 degree angle down so that they are
kind of covering the entire rectangle
that you're setting up especially in my
case for room scale now you want them to
be too far apart anything more than
about 15 feet apart it's going to warn
you that they're going to have some
problems seeing each other optically
which means I could have used a cable to
connect the two but again the cable
wasn't long enough to do that so I just
ended up moving one to the bookshelf and
then all of the tracking issues I had
went away and everything worked pretty
flawlessly now because I don't want wife
aggro I want the set up to look clean I
ended up going over to Lowe's and buying
some small channelings so that I could
put basically make a frame around my
white window with the white channeling
and then the wire is pretty much hidden
with the exception of where it sticks
out at the bottom and then plugs into
the wall but that's a lot less of an
eyesore than having a black cable draped
across a beige wall go and spend the
twenty bucks or whatever this cost
it makes things a whole lot easier so
once the base stations are installed you
go ahead and plug the link box into your
system using the included HDMI cable the
power cable and as well as a USB
extension cable and you want to plug all
those into the black side or the side
that's not Orange
and it goes into your PC the side that's
orange is dedicated for your headset now
you can plug those same plugs from the
headset into the link box on the orange
side and then that's going to control
the headset itself so the next thing
you're going to do is you're going to
install steamvr and that's a free
download obviously and that is a
software that's going to control the
headset it's also going to link any of
your games with steam that support VR
automatically and it's going to say play
in VR if the option is there now the
next thing you have to do is actually
set up your play area so what you're
going to do is you can take your headset
set it in the middle of the room you're
going to take the controllers set them
on the floor and launch the VR room
setup it's a pretty simple program it
actually guides you through setting up
your space it's very very easy at one
point you're going to actually trace the
room with the controller while holding
the button so it's going to learn the
boundaries and it could set up the
chaperone grid which keeps you from
running into things and as long as you
do a proper set up and you make sure
that that space is unobstructed every
time you play then you're not going to
have any sort of problem now the cool
thing about the headset is it actually
has its own audio three-and-a-half
millimeter plug attached to it so not
only can you use the earbuds with shake
which they come with I don't actually
recommend it when the sound quality was
okay but the earbuds tend to fall out
and the last thing you want to do is go
sherry earbuds with other people because
you know you're going to want to play
this with other people and share the
experience with them so I just ended up
using a set of headphones I think in
this case I used a set of HyperX cloud
twos and then just use those because
it's a lot easier to share headphones
that it is to share earbuds that's just
disgusting especially in the summer but
now that you're set up you can actually
enjoy some free stuff that comes with VR
now with HTC vive comes the lab and the
lab is really cool it's got a bunch of
different stations where you can take an
orb and put it on your head and
experience a bunch of different things
there's a game called longbow which is
really really fun in fact I've spent so
much time on that where you pretty much
are it's like a tower defense game
you're an archer standing on this tower
you can set the arrows
fire you can blow up TNT barrels as
hordes or waves of horde come at you and
try and beat down the castle gates and
your job is obviously to shoot them with
the bow and arrow
now you got to have be strategic about
this they come in different positions
here and you want to use you know the
various things that are in the map for
you to help blow them up sparingly
because you only get it once each wave
and every time a wave starts then you
can you get a reset on those but that is
a super fun game it's like VR tower
defense and it actually gets tired you
keep drawing this bow you keep knocking
the arrow and drawing this bow and you
get tired because even though you're in
VR you forget that it's just free space
you actually are flexing as you pull
this bow back and you're kind of going
man this is this is getting this is
getting hard here and yeah that's what
she said but it's a lot of fun and it's
actually a good amount of exercise
depending on what you're playing you
you're up and out of a chair which is a
good thing
now another game that I tried out and it
is it's just one of the things that I
always thought would make VR extremely
cool is a game called a chair in a room
today you will perform simple memory
test
in front of you is a ball and three cups
I would like you to hide the ball under
any of the cups move it around and
reveal the ball I will observe your
progress
basically it's like living a horror
movie now you would think oh the
graphics aren't that great but once you
put on VR the graphics it takes a second
place to the immersion and you can
imagine things like jump scares or games
where objects move on their own and it
gets very loud you have a headset on and
it's loud and things are jumping at you
and it you react accordingly and
sometimes you forget you're in fear in
fact I almost fell in coconut monkey was
laughing at me because this thing
happened and I jumped and I almost fell
over and it was you forget you totally
forget you're in VR which is I think a
testament to how good the experience is
because if you can forget you're in VR
then it's doing its job if you're
constantly thinking to yourself oh
whatever and this VR okay it's laggy
then the experience just isn't going to
be very good you're going to you're
going to forget that you're in VR or
you're going to forget that you are
playing a game you're going to be stuck
on the shitty experience but that hasn't
been the case with the HTC vive now I am
3ds sensitive
I don't watch 3d movies I have a 3d TV I
never turn on 3d I don't go to 3d movies
they give me a headache and I think
that's because I'm very farsighted and
when you take something and stick it on
your face that can tend to mess with
someone has vision like mine
very very very farsighted and putting
something close to me tends to cause me
a lot of optical issues but that doesn't
happen with the vibe and that's why I
went out and bought it because every
demo I went and experienced it was just
constantly a good experience no
headaches no issues whatsoever
that game I just told you about called a
chair in a room I spent four hours on it
last night four hours in VR and didn't
have any issues whatsoever other than
the fact that I kept jumping and
screaming like a girl and yeah it's so
good and it's so scary not the game but
the experience that the experience of
being in this horror game you watch it
on the screen as someone's playing it
because you can mirror the screen and
you can see and hear what they hear and
see what they see it's not the same
whatsoever there's this level coconut
monkey was playing in it it's like dark
and attend this Chapel and the lighting
is real bad no flashlight and you're
looking around he's he's like no what I
want to do is I wanna do this because
coconut monkeys kind of a bit kind of a
chicken kind of a baby you know huh I
love the guy but I can say that he's
he's really a chicken he doesn't watch
scary movies he doesn't like roller
coasters or any of that stuff so at one
point is like no can't do this took the
headset off and I'm going you big baby
what the heck's the problem this isn't
all that whoa okay yeah this is a hell
of a lot scarier in VR than it is
because when you're in a room like this
and it's lip and you're looking at a
screen and you're moving a mouse you're
like oh yeah it's you're focusing on
this spot but you still are cognizant
the fact that you're in a lit room is
for whatever you put the headset on it's
dark
the sound is is very realistic that the
sound is in VR as well so it's tracking
of when you move your head and where
it's coming from is extremely accurate
just like it is in real life
yeah it really starts to screw with you
what I find interesting about the vibe
though is when I show my friends the
vibe and they try it out they're like
woah this is so cool oh wow the only
thing and you're enjoying it because you
have a history to pay how old you are
you have a history of games and
evolution to where my day the first
console I ever owned was an in
television and then an Atari 2600 and
then a Commodore 64 and and schr an NES
I'm an SNES and NES a Nintendo
Entertainment System and I see how far
we've come and I look at this and I go
this is just so freakishly unimaginable
I can't believe I'm experiencing this
but what's funny is when I take my
seven-year-old Little J bring her up
here and put it on and she starts
playing it she just immediately starts
playing the game and it's like yeah this
is cool neat oh look bow and arrow yeah
that's cool whoa look a puppy you know
she doesn't get all oh and all like wow
this is so cool because she doesn't have
she doesn't have any sort of of real
baseline to determine where we've
come from so to her this really cool
stuff is just normal it's just normal to
her so I really found that interesting I
kind of thought my daughter's going like
wow but no the older the person who
tries it out the more wow they are and
it's funny too because I said I should
get my dad to try this because my dad's
turning 74 and it's like what would he
think of this and it's funny my wife
goes you might give him a heart attack
so don't know make him play the scary
games now I know this isn't like an
in-depth guide to the HTC vive I just
kind of wanted to share my experience to
show you what the setup was like and
hopefully allow you guys to determine
whether or not this is something that's
worth it to you it's not cheap by any
means 800 bucks like I said that's as
much as most people have to spend on
their entire computer setup and your
computer has to be able to run it as
well so it's a minimum of $100
investment if your computer is already
ready for VR and the better the graphics
cards and stuff you have for VR the
better the experience is going to be
right now I have it running off the 1080
amp though or the zotac amp extreme and
I have no issues with fps or drop frames
or any of that but again you know if
you're if you're running a lower-end
graphics card you're going to have a
lower-end VR experience which you can't
blame on the headset so definitely run
the VR experience app in the steam to
make sure your VR ready and at least go
from there because if you have to spend
800 bucks on the headset and another 3
or 400 bucks on a graphics card then
you've got to update other stuff then
you're looking at a lot of money and
only you can answer whether or not
that's worth it anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video hope you've
learned something about the vibe today
if you want to see anything specific
with the vibe let me know I might even
consider doing some live streaming with
the vibe because it's it is ridiculously
fun and I wish everybody could
experience this so yeah if you guys have
an opportunity to go and try one at some
sort of a gaming event or anywhere
they're showing off the vibe do it trust
me at least do it to see whether or not
you're sensitive to it and whether it
makes you sick I'm usually sensitive it
doesn't make me sick
so that's what made this a whole lot of
fun anyway guys thanks for watching as
always I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
