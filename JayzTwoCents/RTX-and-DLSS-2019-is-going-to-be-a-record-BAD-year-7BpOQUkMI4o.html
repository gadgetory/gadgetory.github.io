since you know r-tx launched and it's
only taken that long to finally get one
title that has both features that being
obviously DXR ray-tracing and dl SS or
deep learn to / simply deep learned deep
learning a deep learning was it learning
like a work deep learning so by the time
you get it it's already learned it yeah
well tell ya it works and we're not to
be worth it I got new merch it's
available now crowd me calm /jc sense we
got zip up hoodies we got tri-blend we
got a new logo I digress since 2012 it's
at the wrist logo you guys been asking
for that anyway well guys live it up we
can all kinds of stuff zip up hoodies
beanies polos don't take my word for it
cuz obviously I can't do this ed so just
look in the description below and you
guys will find the link thanks okay so
before we get into the live testing here
which we have you have to understand hit
this is six months this is six months in
the making this I think gamers are
they're just sick of waiting we want
titles to take advantage of the hardware
that's sitting here up until this point
if you weren't playing battlefield 5 you
had arty cores and tensor cores sitting
in your card doing nothing great idea on
our DX card well we had Final Fantasy 15
come out with DL SS okay final fantasy
15 it's cool and all mostly a console
game I don't think I heard a lot of
people really talk about it we've had
Metro Exodus which we got to see demos
of last year when we were at PAX that's
not even using full raytrace for
reflections it's using ray tracing for
global illumination it's using that to
try and raytrace the lights and make the
lighting more realistic like a like an H
Bao on on steroids basically then we
have battlefield 5 which launched with
DX R and then DL SS came much later
which is kind of like right now so we're
gonna go ahead and do some live testing
on this we are using a 4k panel and a 20
atti now I've got a huge rant I'm gonna
talk about like we'll just get in here
right now and show you so you can see it
firsthand so you have to have the latest
Nvidia driver installed to take
vengeance I think it's for 1891 or
something like that whatever the latest
driver is at least February 13th or
later should
have these new features plus it's a 20
gigabyte update for battlefield 5 anyway
if we take a look at the settings here
you can know some differences so if we
basic of course this is all pretty much
the same unchanged go to advanced now
you've got this Nvidia DL SS now the
problem is this and this is the start of
my rant is tied into DXR so if you
disabled DXR you lose DL SS now Phil and
I we're talking about this a little bit
offline and we think that DL SS falls
under some sort of a toolset that's a
part of those DXR features obviously you
need the x12 enabled as well so we I
would love for someone from video to
chime in as to why DXR needs to be on 4
DL SS to work we just can't figure out
why that feature has to be enabled
other than Nvidia is just really forcing
you to enable DXR my problem with this
is the thing I was looking forward to
most since last September when all of
this was announced was or was August it
was like August something right crap I
wanted to take advantage of an improved
super sampling the biggest hit you can
take to any post-processing is anti
aliasing and super sampling those are
the two things that can give you the
biggest impact in your performance and
my thought was like screw DXR if I don't
care about that but I just want the
improvement of having those 500 and semi
tensor cores in the 28 ETI doing
something then we can enable it get the
improvement and then we don't worry
about the XR but it's tight in now so
now you're forced to take the initial
hit of DXR and even though the scene is
improved with the LSS on as you will see
it's nowhere near what it is with those
features off entirely so it's just
really disappointing the XR is on right
now we are running for K and D LSS is
currently on so this is a static image
we go here we get a little bit more in
the distance so ya 64 65 okay so
obviously 62 to 65 plus minus 3 so now
if we go in here and we just disabled DL
SS or the deep learning super sampling
watch happens to our fps
so there's definitely an improvement
here I mean quite a bit from 48 to 65
looks like we're hovering more so around
51
49 I mean I wouldn't consider this very
playable is all right so it's pretty
obvious that DL SS is doing something I
just kind of wish it was doing something
with DXR off C soon as we go 1080 watch
this DL SS is off but the thing is
apparently the 20 60 or whatever like
the other cards other than a 20 80 TI
are able to do it while we have the 20
60 installed now which is a 350 dollar
mid-range mid high-end range card but
like I just said the 1080p deal SS does
work with that card as you can see which
has me going again Nvidia please answer
the question why can't you deal with the
20 80 TI why not give it to this card I
don't understand why that is it's
obvious that they can do it at the
resolution because of the 2060
okay so 2060 now same settings as we cut
off with article 20 DTI off everything
in ultra medium on DX are raytrace and
then ultra still and FX amount this card
I don't feel like was ever really
intended for ultra everything but as you
can see right now with ray tracing and
stuff on I mean this is actually not
terrible now the sad part is this card
was getting like 110 hundred 20 FPS in
battlefield 5 with DXR off we're getting
about the same FPS as we were with the
28 ET out got we're getting a roughly
the same fps and 1080p as we were
getting with the 20 80 TI in 4k a couple
of FPS higher than that but if we go
ahead and disabled ELSS now not nearly
as much a performance hit do you see
this so as you can see a multiplayer
though obviously the FPS is higher we
talked about this in our previous video
about ray tracing is the fact that
they've prioritized the frame rates for
multiplayer because that's obviously
more important and as such we are
getting in 1080p in battlefield 5 with
ray tracing on all right so this is DL
SS off we're getting currently 57 to 60
fps so you can see a lot of detail here
just really got
you see this look how fuzzy all of this
is okay so a little cutaway here we
decide to do a little more digging while
we're at in this video well Phil
specifically so he gets all the credit
on this he found on the forums and
reddit that ultra wide was scaling
terribly with the LSS so he showed you
how the 1080 on the 2060 was very fuzzy
on the ultra wide it was even worse the
moment you just you enabled ELSS it just
goes like completely through a fog
filter it just looks smudged and smeared
what we also found on the forum's was
that if you were to just disabled the
LSS and just take your resolution scale
and drop it down to 80% you get back all
of the sharpness you can't even tell
that we're running at 80 percent and you
get back all the performance that you
would have lost my not turning on DL SS
this feature sucks now one other thing
that we just noticed here is that you
can only enabled ELSS with the native
aspect ratio so you can't drop down to a
1440 to have black bar on the sides of
DL SS enabled it only will enable the
option if you're running in the native
aspect ratio so we put the 20 atti back
in because we realized like well I
didn't do multiplayer testing with the
2080 TI plus we want to know if the
scaling looked as poured but if you look
at the textures and stuff like it right
here I mean everything looks good so
okay so the FPS though if we look you
know member we are playing people always
say why do you look cuz I'm actually
playing on my account now and I have my
my loadout over the bushes I mean it's
pretty impressive regardless of the rant
I'm about to give that we can play 4k
multiplayer with DXR on what DL SS and
looking out the distance here getting
almost a hundred of PS alright so it's
pretty obvious why the 2060 and the 2070
yet 1080p DX r with DL SS whereas the
2080 20 Ti and the Titan get 1440 nm
only the 1080 looked pretty bad so we're
hoping that the DL SS will improve
here's that here's the bottom line
I'm really really just concerned about
the fact that this feels a lot like when
you go into a dealership and you go to
buy a car and you're like I want the HID
headlights well sir that comes in the
premium package in and that you get the
headlights and the leather steering
wheel the heated steering wheel the
leather interior the chilled cupholders
the wine chiller in the back you know
all the things you don't care about I
just want the headlights but you don't
get it if you don't buy the package
unfortunately I feel like I hope I'm
wrong about this I've no doubt that
video will probably reach out after
seeing this but I feel like they're
forcing you to turn on DXR because they
know people like me are gonna only use
the LSS and not care about the XR I look
I feel like the honeymoon period is over
I feel like six months is gone by a lot
of people work at that ooh and AW and
Phil and I were talking about this when
we did our video about ray tracing real
time ray tracing in RTX I was one of the
few people that was like I am a nerd I
love the advancement in technologies I
love the fact that we could have real
time ray tracing which is something that
didn't seem possible in terms of gaming
so we were in this honeymoon period like
this is so cool do people not get it
does it not understand what they're
getting that's kind of worn off because
here we are six months later and the
whole thing I was looking forward to the
whole time which I said from day one is
DL SS screw ray tracing just give me del
SS they're forcing it on and down your
throat I think because I think they know
most people just won't enable it when I
play battlefield 5 with my friends and
we squad up it's not on I turn it on
sometimes in multi and single player but
I've complete the campaign so there's no
point anymore I don't go back and play
it so it stays off in real time and I
can tell you now even in skunk works
it's gonna stay off full time because DL
SS at this point is just not worth it
and so for me the honeymoon period is
kind of over and I'm kind of done with
it I get it real time ray tracing it's
here I just still have to give this a
big fat like I don't see the point in
running out and buying it wanna know the
truth you have no choice
pretty much Pascale cards have kind of
gone through the roof in terms of
pricing because they don't make them
anymore so availability continues to go
down so third parties are raking in the
dough by raising the prices on those
which means eventually you have no
choice but to buy the
if you're gonna buy a new card if you're
stuck buying a new card if you don't buy
an EMV card that is and then at the end
of the day everyone will have our TX
cards or raytrace enabled cards or
whether AMD comes out with one or not in
the future because eventually this will
be all that you can buy then in game
developers might catch up but at the end
of the day I'm just like over it I'm
kind of whatever DXR is going to stay
off which means I'm not gonna get DL SS
which means feature is that you've paid
for tensor cores and RT cores you have
two choices take the hit which is
massive or don't turn on the features
you paid for Nvidia 2019</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
