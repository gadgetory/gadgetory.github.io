Jays two cents and this is part two of
project red mist or aka project overkill
or just project jealousy I think project
jealousy would have probably been a more
appropriate name because I am jealous of
what you see behind you and it's just
barely started to come together and it's
not too late for me to to take this and
run away to Mexico and live like a king
is it you know I mean he I mean he
doesn't know where I live
he'll think alright guys so let's go
ahead and talk about what's happened
since part 1 part 1 if you recall was an
introductory video of all the parts that
we're going to be using in project red
mist now what I did first besides just
obviously doing her bench testing and
making sure everything worked was we
went ahead and installed all of the
water blocks that we're going to need to
put on all of the parts now as I
mentioned we are doing the motherboard
full cover water block here from ek for
the motherboards at South Bridge and the
vrm cooler as well as water cooling the
graphics cards the GTX 780 T is now I
want to talk about something real quick
with the 780 t is since the 295x2 from
AMD has launched which is going to be
their competitor to nvidia x' titans E
or Titans dupit however you want to say
that I guess would be a more appropriate
name these cards were already purchased
before that card was even teased guys so
a lot of you well I would say a lot but
some of you were certainly like hey why
didn't you go with the you know the
295x2 they didn't make a whole lot of
sense well you know I'm not convinced
that even if we had known about the card
at the time this build was being put
together I don't think we would have
gone with it I have never personally had
good experience with dual GPU cards over
two separate cards in SLI and whereas
this may bench slightly lower on the
benchmarks compared to you know what's
already been shown on some of these
benchmarks with the 295x2 this
this looks a whole lot cooler it just
having one card with a full cover block
on there whether it be a dual card or
not just doesn't look as cool as two
cards so I mean come on let's face it
part of this project is this isn't a
practical bill there's nothing practical
about this so I just wanted to address
that but what we did as I mentioned
already was we got the blocks on all of
our parts and got them bench tested to
make sure all the RAM modules work CPU
works and the graphics card work so what
we're going to do next is I'm pretty
much just going to tell you what I'm
planning on doing next part of that of
this build and to do that we need to
kind of we need to get a little bit
closer and I don't think you guys have a
problem getting closer to this beast so
let's go ahead and let's move on in come
on don't be shy just see you in the back
stop pushing you'll get up here just
relax we're all going to have our turn
single-file let's let's get a little
closer now what I think strikes all of
us immediately when we take a look at
this thing is just how much room there
is in here for activities the guy that
I'm building this for actually said he
needed a place to park his car and I
think that in here would actually be a
perfect dual purpose case you know this
SMA 8 from case labs is a perfect place
to house your computer and a garage a
separate detached garage from your house
so so as you can see we've got the GTX
780 s here with their full cover blocks
on there sexy as hell with that back
plate our Dominator Ram looks really
really good the aluminum is a little out
of place I'm debating doing something
custom with this I just haven't made up
my mind yet on that but we'll figure it
out later
we've got the ek supremacy block on
there I had some questions because of
some stuff I put up on Instagram that
you guys should be following by the ways
I put a lot of the build stuff that is
happening up on Instagram actually they
asked why I was still using the stock
block on this well this this is not the
stock block what you see here is a
plastic cover as part of the thermal
shield that is part of ASUS Maximus six
full cover here so that's just a plastic
decorative piece that is over the block
which I removed why did I remove the
block that was already built in well it
was an aluminum block and I'm not happy
with
we I don't like mixing aluminum in my
loops you have a hard time finding any
sort of diehard water cooler who's
willing to put aluminum mixed in with
any other metals in their loop it's just
not a good idea regardless of what
anyone will tell you that is the way I
feel and that is never going to change
so with all of this space over here I'm
trying to decide how I want to mount the
reservoirs I mean here are the
reservoirs is about to knock them over
right there now I could do what
everybody does which is putting them you
know side by side like this nice and
spaced out probably probably about right
there even with the top of the
motherboard or maybe even space might a
little bit more to fill in that space
but what I can't decide I want to do is
if I want to mount the pump directly
under them like everyone seems to do or
if I want to hide the pumps away down in
the basement I'm a little more inclined
to doing the the pump here up on top
where it's visible the only problem with
that is that because of the way the
pumps get really close to this mid plate
here it's going to be it's gonna be
impossible to adjust the speed once it's
mounted and when you're flushing the
system it's a lot easier to speed it up
and slow down speed it up and slow it
down when you're actually bleeding and
filling the system so not entirely sure
how I want to go about that yet now the
nice thing about the ek multi rez is you
can see here the res x3 is you've got
all kinds of ports on there to use so no
matter what we're covered on what we
need to do but it's going to look really
slick
especially when you have white coolant
and red coolant in these side-by-side
now one thing I did encounter that I
didn't really I mean I knew about it I
didn't think too much about it but I've
got to figure out how I want to handle
this is the Southbridge block is right
here in between both of the graphics
cards and this is going to be a
different loop from the graphics cards
so I have to figure out how I'm going to
do this I mean I don't know if I want to
bring the tubes up and over and down
into the mid plate and then have them
come back out somewhere else or if I
just kind of want to bend them up over
and around squared and have a nice you
know squared because all the bends I
want I want the bends to be square I
don't want them to be like 45s I want
them to be nice and square because that
just looks bad
considering everything in this case is
square so I have not determined how I'm
best going to handle this part right
here obviously we'll figure that out
together as we do this build lock the
other complication with that is if I
bring it up and over the RAM it's got to
come open over high enough and then down
into the CPU block to where you can
still get to the RAM and replace it if
you need to now there's not going to be
anything practical about replacing parts
in this build when it comes to the the
tubing because there's nothing practical
about having water cooling parts anyway
when it comes to replacing like one of
these graphics cards took a shit or the
CPU took a shit or the motherboard no
matter what you're going to have to take
it all apart to get it out that's a
downside of water cooling and you just
have to learn to live with that so
that's where we are with this build so
far and you know I the next thing I'm
going to tackle is probably get the
lower radiator assembly together get the
drain ports in and it's it's now time to
do a lot of planning planning is key
when it comes to these types of builds
because you don't want to take the time
to do something and just have to start
all over that takes a toll on your your
time your pocketbook and your morale
with the build and when you're dealing
with high-end parts like this you don't
want to have any mistakes so what do you
guys think should I put the res right
here side by side I mean I could do them
front and back like that but then one
res is going to be blocking the other
which is going to have all this empty
space that'll look silly because we do
have the extra large window on here that
is pretty much the whole thing is the
window not sure I want to do it I'm
really I really am leaning towards this
I thought about maybe doing them
staggered like that and having the pumps
down below but I'm just not sure what
would you guys do nice and even would
you do it staggered somehow I mean we
could technically even if we wanted do
these sideways and bring the acrylic
tubing however we want because that's
the cool thing about these multi reza's
is we can do them however we want as
long as the level is above the port so
we could even do it like like that if we
wanted so I just can't make up my mind
I'm gonna get on out of here guys if you
want to talk about this bill take it to
Twitter or the forum over at JC sense
comm or take it right here in the
comments if you like but with that said
I'm going to get the hell on
here and as always see you guys on
social media and I'll see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
