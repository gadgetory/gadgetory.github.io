here in today's video is sponsored by HP
and they sent me their new color
laserjet pro of m47 7 to check out and
see exactly what all the hubbub is about
if you've already gotten this far into
the video you're probably thinking what
the heck J a printer video I mean are
you just trying to copy wendell or what
of course I'm copying Wendell that
dude's smart but when I was approached
by HP NASA if I wanted to check out the
printer I really wanted to check this
out for a couple of reasons one as I
mentioned sort of in the home workspace
tour video what you guys can check out
on the card that's going to pop out here
I mentioned that I'm now working
entirely from home and I didn't have a
printer and standard home grade printers
that are designed more for like photo
printing or maybe some documents just
don't cut it with the amount of paper
I still use now yeah we live in a
digital age but a lot of businesses are
still relying on paper and the printer
is not going anywhere for quite some
time now as some of you may know I
worked in IT for nearly 10 years and
there was nothing more frustrating than
dealing with printer issues which is why
the idea of reviewing a printer that is
new and is supposed to be extremely
stable and extremely easy to use and
very user friendly so you don't end up
bashing the thing to death kind of like
the scene in office space so I really
was interested and taking this thing a
you know for tests bin and seeing
exactly how well it performs
there's actually three models to this
printer I am taking a look at the fnw
and it's got some pretty neat features
in here but we're going to be kind of
going through a setup seeing how easy it
connects to the network you can even do
printing from your mobile device which
is a huge deal when I worked in IT we
used mobile printers actually by HP with
hundreds of end-users using HP ePrint to
print out documents and stuff that we
were supplying customers in the field so
we had field support that we were doing
an IT and it was a big deal to have
software that was stable so I'm really
excited to see that HP over all of the
years have stuck with HP eprint and
continued to evolve we'll talk about HP
ePrint and how it integrates with this
guy a little bit in the video but there
is a lot of a subject matter that we
could get into when it comes to a
so I'm kind of going to take a workflow
here through the review of the things
that interest me now obviously this
video can't be all-encompassing
otherwise it would be like four hours
long to try and cover every little bit
of features in here so the first thing
we're going to do here is we're going to
put it on the desk and kind of get it
off my little display here we're going
to set it up to the network we're going
to see how easy that works I'm going to
try and do it completely wirelessly
although it does hook up to an Ethernet
and it does have wireless connectivity
but let's say you want to put this in a
room that doesn't have Ethernet
obviously Wireless is going to be you
know a very bonus feature especially if
you don't have internet in all of your
rooms which is kind of nice too in small
businesses if you are leasing or renting
a space that doesn't have Ethernet in
every single room the last thing you
want to do is pay to run Ethernet there
when it can do it wirelessly so let's go
ahead and take a look at the display and
get into the setup and talk about some
of the features so let's take a quick
tour around the exterior and as you can
see with my hands right here I don't
have a banana sorry for reference guys
you can see that this is a very compact
design but don't let size fool you it is
very very powerful starting on the top
right here is the adjustable feed tray
for your double-sided copier which is
very very nice feature and then
underneath that you do have the lift up
here for the scan bed which actually has
a glass that goes all the way to the
edge which makes sliding your paper off
of the scan bed really easy color
touchscreen display makes interacting
with the printer very very simple this
is what we're going to do next when we
do the setup show you how that works
underneath the touchscreen display right
here there is a USB dongle and you can
use that to actually print from USB and
scan and save to USB so you don't even
have to have a computer hooked up to
this to save your documents to I mean
yeah you can't email it to yourself you
can fax it to yourself but the nice
thing is that you could just on the go
quick put in a USB Drive you can print
your Word documents from there and you
can also scan and save your documents
onto USB as well and then right here on
the bottom this is where you feed your
ream of paper I think one of the most
frustrating things about dealing with
printers is changing the ink or toner
usually it's just a complete pain in the
butt and nobody ever looks forward to
having to do it
well the m47 7 is very very simple it's
got a button right here you push the
door opens up move that down grab the
blue handle pull it back and
access all of your toners remember there
are four toner cartridges in here
because you have black yellow magenta
and cayenne that's how you're able to
get all of that amazing print quality
for LaserJet that does all the color and
did an amazing job at printing some
picture quality you'll see that it was
absolutely stunning for being a LaserJet
now move it around to the back of the
unit this is your phone line JAC this is
going to be for faxing it also has a
handset port so that's where you're
going to be plugging in your fax line if
you are still using a fax and not using
a fax over Internet from top to bottom
here it is a USB 2.0 port for connecting
your USB devices has a firewire port and
then of course the Ethernet and then
rounding off the walk around we have the
access port right here for paper jam
clearing this is actually a big deal
because clearing paper jams which you
know will happen over time can sometimes
be just completely annoying depending on
how deep you have to dig into the
printer HP did a fantastic job right
here of making all of the rollers easily
accessible by simply opening up this
back door clearing your paper and then
closing it back up and you're ready to
go
the laser jet has come a long way over
the years where LaserJet used to only be
black and laser jet was awesome because
it fed and it printed very very fast but
I had the trade-off of not having color
well HP actually uses four toners in
this particular model so you can get
color so you've got your black your chi
on your magenta and your yellow and
those toners are actually rated up to
1200 pages per toner before you actually
have to change those now the print speed
on this is actually advertised for black
at 28 pages per minute or just over two
seconds per page it's actually pretty
damn fast and it's rated up to 50,000
prints per month so you can see that
this is seriously designed for some
heavy-duty print work now the paper tray
here holds 250 sheets of standard weight
paper now I'm using the HP ultra white
it is a 20-pound paper weight so
obviously the amount of paper that can
be held down there is going to depend
entirely on you know the weight of the
paper that you are using but it's pretty
easy you just slide it on in there set
this guy up against there
close it now clearly I am not connected
to the wireless so let's go ahead and
see how hard that is you got Wi-Fi
Direct Connect so I'd be directly
connecting to any of your wireless
devices like your phones or your tablets
wireless network well I guess I touch
didn't realize I did so we can see our
status is off so let's go ahead and
connect using the wireless setup wizard
it located my Wireless right there it
doesn't look like it uses five gigahertz
so it's a 2.4 gigahertz wireless radio
built in here and I guess I have to go
and put in my password sorry guys you
don't get to know that the touchscreen
is really responsive I like it it's
unlike some touchscreens where when you
touch it it's a little bit of a delay
delay or lag from when it registers but
it actually does a pretty good job and
you can see it connected wirelessly with
absolutely no problems now HP eprint
works on pretty much all your major
platforms I'm using the iOS version
right here I am connected to the
Internet and now we have to go ahead and
find our printer so I haven't done
anything except launch the app as you
can see we found our printer immediately
with our IP address for the printer and
there it is now what's neat about the HP
ePrint software with this printer is you
can actually print stuff directly from
your email you can put in your email
information here and pull documents
straight from your email so you don't
even have to you know save it to iBooks
or anything like that it all works
directly from here you can access your
cloud directly from the web but you can
even access your photo role and print
photos from this guy now this is a
laserjet printer so I don't know how
well the photo quality would be
obviously it's not its main objective
but we'll print a color photo too to see
you know just how well it actually does
now even though this isn't a photo
printer I want to go ahead and try and
print a photo I'm just curious as to how
it's going to look so let's go ahead and
I'm gonna go ahead and print this
awesome picture of this Z yeah guys you
know me I'm obsessed with disease but it
also has an all-in-one remote app that's
cool you should try that later so it got
the printer I got the paper in the
spooler pretty quickly and it's actually
already printing so it's only been a
couple of seconds and obviously that's
going to work anywhere from within the
network
Wow for LaserJet on regular paper that's
really not bad holy heck uh Wow
man okay I'm impressed I'm taking a look
at the display here obviously there's a
lot of different things you can do you
can copy scan you can see the print jobs
that are on the USB Drive on the USB
Drive right here this is how you access
those print jobs you can send a
traditional fax you can also see the
contents of the USB Drive supplies you
can see what apps are available on here
enable the web service print to the
Terms of Use okay so let's go ahead and
print the Terms of Use what's kind of
neat about that is printing it is your
way of accepting it now the manage
button is where you can find more apps
and download it directly from the
internet since we are connected to the
Internet here private print you can
actually set up a password or a passcode
so that you can do private printing from
here so this is in a shared space and
you don't want other people being able
to access your print jobs let's say you
work with sensitive documents you do
accounting or something like that you
can actually lock those documents then
of course scan to email that's probably
the one I'll use the most often
especially like right now I have to scan
tax documents at least last year's taxes
and that's like 20 pages or something
like that and I don't but I was like how
am I going to do that well now obviously
I can scan it and email it which is one
of the reasons why I wanted a printer
like this and then of course under your
setup you've got all sorts of stuff here
you can see printer reports
self-diagnostics if you're having a
problem it'll check itself out set up a
fax if you actually have fax number and
stuff system set up service network
quick forms things that you can print so
for instance let's say you are out of
like lined paper for your kid to use for
homework well you can say let's go ahead
and print no child rule let's print some
child rule Network paper right here or
you know writing paper let's just do
let's do 5 copies now let's check the
speed of this let's do 10 copies
BAM print us some papers for our kids to
use this is really neat actually
especially with little J she's always
running out of school paper so as you
can see it says printing us if you can
see that look at that and that neat it
is printing us child rule paper right
there so it's got that the line
specifically the child would use
and we printed 10 pages that it's coming
out pretty fast so go fast that prints
it's one of the things I've always loved
about Laser Jets just how fast they are
so as you can see there we go we have
just printed out child rule I mean you
can even do graph paper you can even
make yourself a checklist let's say 1
column 2 column let's do a two column
checklist here let's just do one copy to
see if that looks like the wife's always
giving me honeydew's I have a feeling
now the honey-do list is going to be a
lot more common since now she can
literally just print out the checklist
thanks HP now one thing I want to point
out here is just how incredibly even
this print and how find this prints I
don't see if I can even get get in here
but look at how fine that is and how
even it is it's perfectly straight as
you can see by the edges up here on the
top it's not crooked it didn't feed
crooked at all that is actually very
impressive on the print quality HP says
it's got a very fast
copy bed so let's go ahead and test that
let's see just how fast this thing will
actually copy so let's do we'll do color
because we do have a color picture in
there I'm curious as to how well it's
going to work and then let's just go
ahead and say go color and it will also
do two sided copy as well so if you had
double sided paper it will recognize
that there's stuff on both sides and you
can tell it what to do with that you can
actually take both sides of that and
split it onto separate papers or have it
also print the same way that it was
being fed so if it was double-sided it
would actually go ahead and do it
double-sided so there we go it looks
just as good as the original
so the original is on the right the new
one is on the left
in fact it's actually probably slightly
darker but it's perfectly clean it
doesn't look blotchy or anything like
that alright one last test before final
thoughts let's see how well the color
scanner works on here do home and copy
color there is the copy and there is the
original so it's maybe slightly lighter
on just a little bit but man for a copy
holy hell I wish we had this when I was
working in ITR
our printer sucked so obviously the
LaserJet has come a long way in fact
when the last times I owned a laser jet
was years ago and it literally was
nothing more than blazing fast black and
white text copying and printing it
couldn't do the level of color detailed
copying and scanning and printing that
this is achieving so HP has definitely
really taken the LaserJet a long way but
what I really love about the m47 7 is it
does exactly what I need a printer to do
not only take my paper and make more
paper by copying scanning and printing
stuff from digital format but it takes
stuff that's in paper format and makes
it digital and I can send it into the
cloud I could send it to Google Drive I
can digital fax it email it everything a
big expensive giant bulky constantly
breaking down industrial grade printer
right here in this tiny little form
factor that fits right here on my desk
now this is going to be permanently
residing down in the tech center area of
the house that I built well I guess I
didn't build it but I dubbed it the Tech
Center area and it's gonna be easily
accessible for through via our phones
and our laptops and stuff and that's
exactly what I needed in a printer
something that was simple not too noisy
once it's done printing the fan in there
just pretty much kicks off its not super
noisy and it doesn't put off a ton of
heat actually this thing has been on for
about an hour now takes longer to shoot
these videos and I think people realize
but I've been doing test prints and
stuff learning how to use it and trying
to show you guys you know some of the
basics here but it didn't throw a ton of
heat off into the room the door is
closed it could get hot in here very
quickly but that wasn't the case yeah
when it was printing you could certainly
smell that fresh printer smell but it
didn't linger and it's not really you
know it's not intrusive so I'm very very
impressed with this printer guys I hope
you've enjoyed this video I know it's a
little different but believe it or not
this is something that is a big deal to
me and if it's a big deal to me it's a
video that I'm going to do otherwise I
wouldn't have even accepted the
sponsorship for this video so tell me
what you guys think if you work in IT
speak up in the comments I'm curious as
to how many people watching this are
interested in a very versatile very
flexible very powerful small form-factor
printer like this
it's weighty it's 48 pounds
but as you can see right here it's not
really all that big which makes it
really easy to fit anywhere in a tight
space that you might not have you know a
lot of room for a big printer this is
something you definitely need to
consider anyway guys time to go thanks
for watching today's video let me know
what you thought and as always I will
see you in the next J's $0.02 video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
