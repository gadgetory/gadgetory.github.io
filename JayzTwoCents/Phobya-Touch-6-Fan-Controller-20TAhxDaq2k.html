watching J's two cents and today we're
going to take a look at the touch six
fan controller from phobia like most
other packages the box is made out of
cardboard and it flips open here it's
got a picture of a device on the front
kind of neat
you've got your manual inside we're men
we don't need this we'll just go ahead
and set that aside you've got six long
braided and sleeve temperature probes
right here very nice very attractive and
you've got six fan extension cables here
and these are what you're gonna plug
your fans into surprisingly and add just
like the temperature probes these are
sleeved very very nice a lot of fan
controllers in this price range don't
include sleeved fans so Bravo phobia for
that and they're very long gives you a
nice reach which is very important
you've got your fan controller power
cable over here but it's not as long as
I think it should be this is kind of a
problem but hey you know it's sleeved
once again so it's nice and stealthy and
of course you've got your anti-static
bag and you've got some mounting screws
over here and some double-sided tape for
your temperature probes and opening this
up right here pull this thing out you've
got your fan controller it's made out of
ABS type plastic but it does have kind
of a brushed aluminum look to it it's
very attractive I'd think this would go
good in just about any case you can put
it in and what taking a look here at the
fan cables they're very long which is
good especially to a big case like my
900 D and you also have a little sticker
here that tells you which fan controller
slot you're plugged into which is very
important for our settings now taking a
look at the front you can see they went
with kind of a cheap digitizer so you
can see the outlines of the different
touch sensors on the screen it doesn't
really show when it's lit up it doesn't
really show unless light shining right
on it but it might turn off some people
now one thing that some people might
find very annoying is it's got this beep
when you touch it it goes beep beep beep
is very loud and very obnoxious but if
you pull out this little beep on/off
jumper right here on the
Exide no more beep problem solved when
it comes to the PCB on the back it does
seem very well constructed there's no
ugly soldering points it does seem like
it was very well put together
unfortunately fans one through six on
the ports seemed just kind of
sporadically stuck on here in the last
two five and six kind of seemed like an
afterthought when you turn on the fan
controller automatically the fan
controller is in the off position so
you're going to have to hit that power
button every single time you want to
make a change now we're watching this
video I thought that maybe I wasn't very
clear on this point so I'm going to go
ahead and clarify what I mean by having
to turn it on every time the fan
controller is going to automatically by
default start with whatever the settings
were that you saved it with last so just
because the fan controller starts in the
off position doesn't mean you have to go
through and reset all your settings
you've got your six fans here
represented by little fan icons and the
little icon will spin if that particular
fan is actually reading some sort of an
RPM you've got your rpms here on the
left the M stands for manual and you've
got your fan speed there which is by
default set to 70% now when you touch
the little m over here or just to the
left of it technically it switches it to
automatic mode which is then going to
use the temperature probe to set its fan
speeds pushing on the little buttons on
the bottom here you control the fan
speed in five percent increments when
you're in manual mode and obviously 100
percent is as fast as it can go because
you know five percent is max so as you
go down here you see you have to push
the little little Halfmoon circle
buttons on the left and 40% is minimum
and you can see that the new percentage
is represented there by lower rpm speeds
and you can physically see the fan in
the background slowing down and 700 rpm
there you go now you might think that
pushing the arrows right here the left
arrow and the right arrow would be what
controls the speed but as you can see
that cycle through the different fans so
you have to choose and touch those tiny
little buttons on the very end there
those Halfmoon circles right there next
to the 70% and on the left so they can
get difficult to touch if you don't
really have a fingernail or you have
really fat fingers like I do and it kind
of gets annoying but if you set it to
automatic here as you can see because
there is no temperature probe setup by
default it goes all the way up to one
% but as you can see when we're in
automatic mode touching the percentage
up and down here makes absolutely no
difference because it's going to be
based off temperature and if you go back
to manual mode then you have full
control over the controller once again
now I have a temperature probe set up
here you can see if you touch the RPM
you switch between voltage output and
RPM reading so if you were to turn this
down you can see that the voltage is
output is going to change all the way
down to 5 volts so you can choose
whether or not you want to monitor
voltage or you want to monitor the RPMs
based on just touching that little
readout now touching the temperature
sensor up here on the top right you can
switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit so
depending on what part of the world you
live in you may want Fahrenheit or
Celsius and if you set that to automatic
because 23 degrees Celsius is so low
by default it goes down to 40% because
now it sees a temperature it went to 100
earlier because I had no temperature
probe plugged in and it thought the
thing was overheating though my god we
got to go fast so it ramped the fans up
all the way mein gott this little lock
icon that's blinking here if you just
let that blink for 5 seconds the fan
controller will automatically lock and
there you go ok guys now let's go ahead
and take a look at my personal rig here
as you can see it is installed in my 900
D and I do have it hooked up to control
a lot of fans in this case I've got 11
fans in here but the four main fans here
on my quad radiator are being controlled
by the motherboard and the CPU load but
it is important to point out that the
fan controller can handle up to 30 watts
per channel and because it can handle 30
watts per channel I've got these three
fans back here on the triple rad being
controlled by just one channel on the
fan controller now with all that said
there is a couple of things I don't like
about this fan controller I don't like
the digitizer that they use because I
don't like the fact that you can see the
squares on the screen I don't like the
fact that it turns off every single time
that you restart it because I think it
with a fan controller you kind of want
the flashy graphics and that that you
know the little fan spinning around and
whatnot and too I think the power cable
should have been longer last con is the
beep the beep is super annoying they
should have either used a quieter piezo
beeper in there or just not had it beep
whatsoever now when it comes to
strengths on this fan controller it can
handle three
a channel that is HUGE you can plug lots
of fans into one header using splitters
if you need to especially if you don't
have super high rpm fans that pull a lot
of watts or amps and you can really
customize how this fan controller
controls the fans in your case you can
also use three pin LED lighting on this
fan controller and use it to dim the
lighting if you want it doesn't control
just fans but overall I think this is a
great value this is a great fan
controller it retails for about forty
four dollars on aqua tunings website and
fobia has really done a good job with
bringing you a nice digital fan
controller here at a low cost and it's
gonna it's going to last you years that
it feels robust it's very well put
together and I don't see any problems
with using this fan controller in my
custom rig and now I can hear all you
