really good job at helping me prioritize
the things that are worth my time in
life now to get your free book and trial
membership again head to audible.com
slash Jays two cents JY z TW o cen PS or
better yet just click the link down the
description now ever since moving into
the studio I've been using my lg UC 87 C
which is an amazing 34 inch ultra wide
IPS 60 Hertz panel it does a fantastic
job but I want a little bit more power
to take advantage of all the frames per
second so that's why I'm going to be
using the asus rog swift PG 3 for 8 now
it's also a 34 inch ultra wide 34 40 by
1440p IPS panel but it's a hundred kurtz
of power but you know it's better than 1
PG 3 4 8 2 PG 348
it's still going oh my god
that was way taller than I thought was
going to be now the UFC 87 is a pretty
good monitor in fact that's one of the
reasons why I kept it after review the
color accuracy bit of it
fantastic for content creation in fact
I'm going to be keeping that it might
end up being nixed monitor now
unfortunately though the LG does not
feed your g-sync
or high refresh rate which are things
that a snob likes me care a lot about
and that's where these guys come in you
the care in there oh
and so I need a vacuum cleaner what was
that oh it's a little cover there's
little covers they're not gonna be able
to be centered like one's going to have
to be here and ones have to be here and
it's going to block the system and I'm
cool with that
I kind of wish I had a wider desk now we
look based though have you ever seen a
company put so much effort into the base
I mean the predator base is nice but
this is even better it has a light that
shines down to external power brick that
kind of said here's the light on the
bottom this actually shines through
right there that's how you get the light
that shines out underneath the base but
instead of having an external cable they
run a ribbon cable right down through
the middle and it contacts right here
when you put the base on so soon as you
take the base you pop that guy in there
it's all contact base and now the
lighting isn't it that's pretty neat I
like that poor guys scratched this is
what happens when I get review stuff you
just got to get it in there into it my
wife always says so oh man these are
actually kind of weighty
there's one right there and you can see
it rotates on the base we got some
swivel action and once we power it up
theoretically we'll have some lighting
action one down one to go
I can not pull Linus and break it in
some way again the problem with stuff
that gets sent to me
you know for review sometimes reviewers
don't put them back the way they're
supposed to go like is the whole screwed
missing from that right there I believe
a piece of the cover is missing too so
once all the cables are in this is
actually a cover for that but we don't
need to put that in yet none of the
cables in there can't look a gift horse
in the mouth
right these were after all technically
not sent for review they were sent
because I asked for them to have them
and they obliged so I am grateful I
think we're good they're just dirty very
dirty
I'm telling you I was killing the
industry like we're like Bob you know
monitors on your desk pack them up
you're done sorry Bob Bob in marketing
but they're mine now
powerful to sell serious now don't
surrender the cables do you have what it
takes to do this and are you being
honest with yourself whether or not you
have what it takes to be me cameraman
for J's $0.02 not done with parting and
do cable management mass importance
still mine still sucks it's unfortunate
the parts are fighting back if I put
this one sort of a tangled there then I
could potentially like I can push this
over slightly I'm ok with one being in
an angle one being straight and look I
need technically I need a wider desk
dude look at this unboxing just give it
the extra my boxing supply is that
heading up in the chair did you do that
or did I do that why did I do that
let's get a finger and find the hole
hole oh there it is
but you need to move okay I thought
about making you do this edit but now I
don't want you to because I know you'll
leave all that in to embarrass me okay I
did almost feel like I'm going to have
to Center them and go with a curb setup
like that like I know they got a choice
don't know the truth what do you think
of that though like I mean remember I
spend way more time editing than I do
gaming so having the real estate for
editing right now is first and foremost
but I mean gamey like this give myself
some slack but if I'm going to game I
can either game like that are me I can
turn in game like that that's not a
problem that doesn't bug me I know what
do you guys think do you guys think I
should leave it like this or do think I
should get an arm and like mount them on
top of each other
what does that could be kind of neat but
then it was like a big square panel
good news is they work bad news is that
the DisplayPort cable I have for this
monitor is not long enough to reach even
right there so I have to bring one of
the ones that have from home what's kind
of suck I should have grabbed him this
morning I was in the shop even I have
ten-foot cables which would be better
like I kind of wish I was able to sit
right in front of the panel's but even
this big like 63 inch desk from Ikea
it's still not wide enough for 2 34 inch
ultra wide panels I guess basic math
would have told me that going into this
but that's a front that's okay I'm okay
with this there's all this real estate
but if you think that I should get some
sort of a monitor arm like the let the
air go stand that I use at home I can
actually put panels on top of each other
with that ones so let me know down in
the comments if you think I should leave
it like this or if you think I should
stack them on top of each other I'm kind
of leaning towards stacking them because
I still need to get like professional
monitor speakers or monitors for the
audio editing and I have room for them
on the desk because as this sits right
now I have no room for them on the desk
so go ahead and give your opinions down
below I'm pretty sure I'm going to lean
towards stacking them though but now
I've got all this extra real estate for
editing which is something I've been
missing since moving here anyway guys
thanks for watching today's video some
fun stuff coming up the Terry Crews
video has been shot so we just have to
edit that and I may or may not have
of some merch coming up which people
have been bugging the crap out of me to
start offering so there is that anyway
time ago thanks for watching guys and as
always we'll see you in the next and I
make this get all the FPS all the foot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
