with me if I was to say that I was a
graphics snob in fact just the
background of this entire video so far
should probably prove that point that's
why today we're going to look at a
product that I probably a year ago would
have never bothered with but I think
this is something that's gonna blow your
mind because it's certainly made mine
feel a little bit Swizzle if that's even
the right it feels like somebody took a
stick in my brain and stirred it up
because I didn't even think technology
like this was even possible
now I've already taken a look at the r7
250 in the past there's nothing new to
my channel in fact I think it's a great
graphics card when it comes in well
under $100 if you're an extreme budget
builder or you want to get a gaming
experience or just get into gaming PC
for the first time and you don't have a
lot of money to spend you can get some
pretty impressive gameplay graphics and
graphics settings out of the r7 250 so
why are we taking a look at an R 7 250
again today well that's because we are
taking a look at sapphires ultimate
passive silent cooling that's right they
have built a graphics card out of the r7
250 that has absolutely no fans on it
this thing is 100% silent now I looked
at that and I said how is that even
possible with how demanding current
titles are and the fact that so many
graphics cards are battling heat how on
earth could they put together a graphics
card that still gives us maintainable
frame rates without actually cooking
itself to death now if you guys haven't
heard of sapphire they are - AMD as EVGA
is - Nvidia they only deal with AMD
boards they're only an AMD partner and
they pretty much specialize in anything
when it comes to Radeon graphics cards
now it's got the standard stuff we're
not going to go over too much specs it's
got one gigabyte of gddr5 it's got 0
core power a PP acceleration GC +
architecture HDMI outputs all the usual
stuff you'd come to expect of course I
can run on the mantle API now the
testing I did today was utilizing mantle
on the tests I did where it could be
used but I
really started wondering where exactly
does this graphics card fit in and who
should be buying this so I've actually
got a couple of recommendations of where
this card fits in but I've got to say
the performance legitimately shocked me
now inside the box comes the usual stuff
drivers connectors and they even give
you an HDMI high-speed cable it's 1.8
meters long that's kind of neat and that
kind of starts to give you an indication
of where this card really belongs now
here it is right here I actually think
that this is a very attractive cooler I
mean it's got tons and tons of fins it's
got four heat pipes on it
they look like six millimeter heat pipes
I could be wrong but I believe they're
six millimeter we've got DisplayPort
HDMI port and a single DVID port now you
can see here that the heatsink actually
wraps around the top and to the back of
the card slightly allowing the heat to
actually dissipate up because if you've
got the heatsink only sitting on the
bottom and it's in the standard case
oriented like this instead of maybe like
that then you're going to find that he
could get trapped but those heat pipes
are actually driving the heat to these
sinks here which is also dissipating it
into the case allowing your case cooling
to take care of the heat now when it
comes to the actual core spec on this it
is an 800 megahertz core I'm actually
surprised at that because I thought to
myself well they'd probably gone ahead
and conservatively placed the core on
this to in manageable speed where it's
not going to cook itself to death I'm
going to circle back to temperatures at
the end of this video because I think
that that's what most of us are going to
be most interested in now I'm going to
go ahead and just kind of set this on
the side over here and I'm going to
refer to my notes here when it comes to
frames per second now you guys have kind
of complained that I haven't done enough
modern a title our triple-a titles when
it comes to my testing I'm working on it
guys I'm actually I mean the process are
completely rebuilding my test rig I need
more storage space alright guys so idle
Tim so I'll go ahead and tell you that
idle at right around 36 degrees Celsius
now 36 degrees Celsius is actually
something that it's pretty good but
again temperatures are going to depend
entirely upon your case flow so if
you're gonna have terrible case flow you
could potentially have some cooling
problems with this card I just want to
put that out there I am using the arc XL
with all fan spots actually utilized in
the case but at slow speeds so just want
to put that out there all right so for
valley
mark we got a four ninety that's not
like crazy right four ninety isn't
anything like to go bragging about but
here is where I started to change my
methodology on the testing I did a four
ninety but it maxed out at 50 degrees
Celsius with no fan no fan on this thing
at all and it maxed out at 50 degrees
Celsius now here's the thing that's cool
about that that's exactly where the msi
version of the r7 250 set on
temperatures with a fan so I went okay I
had no intentions of overclocking this
graphics card I didn't consider it
overclockable because I thought well
it's got no fans so if I overclock it
it's just going to cook itself to death
so you know what I did I went ahead and
just maxed out the sliders on MSI
Afterburner to see what would happen now
max overclock allowable without enabling
the unofficial overclocking limits where
it extends the limits and I don't want
to do that for this test I wanted to be
fair to the card was a max of 900
megahertz so that's where we said it we
said at 900 megahertz and we left the
memory pretty much where it was now when
it overclocked at the valley benchmark
score jump from 490 up to 549 it's
actually a pretty decent jump
considering percentage-wise now bf4 on
ultra settings on let's face it this is
not an ultra ready card I just want to
see how it would do gave me a pretty
locked framerate at 24 fps now I went
ahead and put this card where it belongs
in fact I let Battlefield detect the
card and put what the recommended
settings were it recommended medium
which is kind of cool I expected it to
recommend low a recommended medium and I
got a lot framerate at 60 frames per
second now vsync wasn't on and again
this is with mantle 14.7 but with the
vsync turned off it actually capped out
and just stuck at 60 frames per second
sometimes going up to 65 never go and
going lower than 55 and at medium
graphics on Battlefield 4 it actually
looked fantastic and I thought of course
battlefield to fill battlefield 4 must
be cooking the card and temperatures
were actually sitting at well you got to
wait till the end of the video tomb
raider ultimate settings give me a 17
point 2 FPS on the benchmark obviously
once again this is not an ultimate
graphics card so I know
want to put technically it is I guess it
says ultimate on the box well we'll get
back to that ultimate settings on Tomb
Raider they were kicking the cards but
set it down to normal fifty five point
three frames per second average on the
benchmark fantastic alright so dirt
three on alternate why am i doing dirt
three well I still think it's a very
pretty game I still think it's relevant
on entry level graphics cards like this
because it's a cheap game lots of people
play it and it does have some decent eye
candy dirt three ultra 42 frames per
second pretty good it kind of shows that
the game is aged a little bit doesn't
have a lot of resource requirements and
on the medium settings 89 frames per
second so here's what this is telling me
this is telling me if you have a very
strict budget and you need to spend less
than $100 on a graphics card and you
actually want something that is a
hundred percent silent this is something
you should definitely be looking at now
with all of these tests while
overclocked temperatures never exceeded
54 degrees Celsius with no frickin fan
anywhere on the PCB that was a little
unexpected I've gotta admit guys I did
not expect that type of performance now
where does this fit in I've already
mentioned the ultra budget-minded gamer
who's looking for silent but where else
would silent come in handy
I remember that one point 8 meter HDMI
cable they gave you I think this is by
far the perfect solution if you're
building a home theater PC and you want
to be able to upscale to 4k this thing
can do 4k resolution has a display core
that can handle it but I think that this
is the perfect graphics card for a
multimedia PC and in fact I've been
wanting to build one for quite awhile
now and I've got the hardware to do it
and I've got the parts for it so what
I'm going to do actually in the future
is I'm going to build a multimedia home
theater PC and this is what's going to
be driving the graphics on it I think
those are the two places if it's ultra
cheap PC gaming people who want to break
into PC to have a lot to spend and they
want silence and home theater pcs you
have to take a look at this graphics
card if that is what you're looking for
the price point on is fantastic and it
can play games to boot
guys that has been the Sapphire ultimate
r7 250 graphics card had no idea what to
expect going into this video I'm sure
glad I took a look at it because it it
truly surprised me very little things
surprised me anymore when it comes to
I'm pretty I have a pretty good idea of
it going into a review of an expectation
and usually being pretty much on on
point today I was way off I thought this
thing was going to probably get up to 70
maybe even 80 degrees Celsius but that
just goes to show exactly how efficient
the r7 series is especially this guy
with this cooler and this many heat
pipes the future of gaming is definitely
looking like a nice cool efficient one
when it comes to graphics cards Jase two
cents guys follow on Twitter if you have
any questions thanks for watching the
videos hit that like button if you liked
today's video - if you didn't you can
also hit that dislike button it lets me
know what it is you guys do and don't
like on the channel I may get the heck
on out of here and as you've noticed
I've got a little bit different here
monitors set up behind me where we take
a look at the Ergo tech widescreen
gaming forum edition of their three plus
one monitor stand and as you can see I
am utilizing all those bad boys look at
that in the future guys as always I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
