lost track of how many times I've
stopped and started the camera how's
Jerry do this all the time like Jerry's
gotten a probe just standing sitting in
front of the camera and pouring his
heart out to everybody
ah that guy's such a I got such a shill
for what I don't know is shilling for
something so I just want to talk to you
guys all right I want you to hear me out
and I want you to listen to the whole
video might be I know how long it's
going to be but guys I'm gonna say some
things that are important and I want you
to listen okay I don't give a about
the like button I don't care about the
dislike button I don't even care about
the comments I'm probably not even going
to read the comments if you want to know
the truth the comments section here on
YouTube is just the cesspool of humanity
it is so full of negativity it's not
even funny it makes me feel bad cuz I
mean some of your some of you guys are
must be dealing with some really gnarly
 because the I said gnarly I'm an
eighties kid deal with it so many guys
must really be going through some hard
times with how much you just hate people
how much you hate the world man you guys
are like the Joker you just want to see
 burn I started this channel to
prove that it would never go anywhere
and as somebody who's had a tough time
with bullying growing up I get my fam I
want to reiterate my family dynamic was
good my parents were good to me my
sister was rough on me but sibling
rivalry is it's not that uncommon I had
to deal with literally torture in school
physical torture as well until I finally
stood up for myself cracked a dude's jaw
and then things got better from that
point because I literally something
changed in me that day and if you've
watched my dream draw my life something
changed in me that day and I no longer
take from people I don't and some
of you love that about me and a lot of
you hate that about me a lot of you hate
that when someone comes at me is like
Jay you're such a dick hole
you're a fat prick you're such an idiot
and when when I when I see that comment
and I respond to it and I tell them what
a what a you know what I truly think of
them and if you're one those people that
come at me or like Jay you have to be
nice you had a you you hear held to a
higher standard than him no that I
don't deal with double standards I am a
do unto you as you do unto me kind of
person you treat me good man I will give
you the shirt off my back I will give
you every dollar in my wallet and I will
it and I'll never ask for it back but if
you treat me wrong man I will come at
you as hard as you've given it to me
threefold so it's hard for me to
disengage
from a lot of the negativity and I hate
the fact that there is so such a loud
minority you hear it all the time the
silent majority the silent majority
Latino they'll spend 5 10 20 hours on
some of these videos depending on what
we're doing is it so much to ask that
for your favorite youtuber you just
click the like button it takes one
second leave a positive comment some of
us spend hours and hours making this
content and if you liked it like spend
10 seconds leaving a positive comment
stop being silent because all that does
is leave us having to deal with the only
people that are speaking up which are
the haters and the aggressive
criticizers now criticism is okay I've
made changes on this channel due to
criticism people say I don't know how to
take criticism I take criticism very
well the way you deliver your criticism
is going to determine the entire dynamic
of how that criticism is received I hate
the fact that there's days I wake up and
I start thinking about how to back away
from all of this because I'm sick and
tired of having to deal with the double
standards that are out there in terms of
the comments and the criticism but I
still love making videos for you guys I
do and it's I want to get I want to get
back to where I would be so excited to
make a video and you hear here youtubers
say this all the time and it's those
whiney and I know there's new mortgage
I'm so stressed out videos and that's
not the point of this video I'm just
discussing with you guys but I used to
literally come home from work throw down
my backpack and would just go to the
office shut the door and not come out
until the middle of the night because I
love making videos for you guys but I
mean I have to why am i why am i eyes
look like this because I spend so much
time dedicated to making videos working
overtime even like throughout the entire
day the only time I can even find time
to game me anymore is late at night when
everyone's asleep and so I stay up late
because I want to play some games and
then I get up in the morning my eyes
look like this no matter how much Visine
I use so if you guys see my eyes like
this it's usually because I made some
sort of a dedication to the channel that
I'm paying for it physically I pay for
it with lack of sleep and a diet that's
constantly proper and improper all the
time you know I mean I lost 70 pounds
last year and I'm still told Jay you're
fat Jay you got flabby arm so guess what
I used to weigh 500 pounds will 494
close enough I swore
I hit 500 I was going to put a bullet in
my head and I was dead serious dead
serious as a pun I think right I've lost
over 250 pounds and I still deal with
weight comments I have lost more than
some overweight males weight and I still
take criticism for the way that I look
because you know what when you wreck
your body like I did there's there's
issues and for me it sucks I've got
someone is underarm flab but you know
what I lift weights three times a week I
ride my bike I try to eat right I've
lost a lot of weight and I'm strong I'm
healthy I can go from 50-plus miles on a
bike ride no problem and yet people
still come at me trying to make health
comments towards not as much as they
used to because last year I was I was
quite plump I've come down quite a bit
since last year but I mean this is this
what I'm saying I'm put yourself in my
shoes for once try it
it's not easy put yourself in my shoes
imagine you've spent seven years and
you've lost 200 and over 250 pounds and
then someone makes a your fat comic
could you imagine like how up
that is to say to someone the problem is
more people make they don't stop to
think about these comments they just put
them out there and whatever I guess it
is what it is that's what happens when
you make your living on the end of the
Internet but you know what sucks though
is I made this channel dedicated to the
consumer I'm still dedicated to the
consumer I am a consumer you guys think
everything I gets for free it's not I'm
a consumer I buy things and I still go
to youtube to find references on things
I want to buy I still stand in the
middle of Micro Center on my smartphone
looking up reviews on something even
though I'm a reviewer because I don't
take only my opinion into account I
don't only take my reviews into account
and I tell people all the time look at
multiple reviews don't just take what I
say for it but yet people want to call
me a shill or a sell hour or i√≠m doing
is damage control for a company like
this whole EBG a thing the whole point
of that video was to tell you that hey
if you have one of these cards don't
freak out EVGA is going to RMA if
there's a problem they're going to fix
it this is what they're telling me and I
want to show you how to apply the fix if
you didn't want to wait for the RMA but
now people were claiming that I'm doing
damage control that's a sponsored video
that I took money to make them look
better I'm gonna take a dime for that I
don't even put an ad on that video I
mean it's like my dedication that
everything has to do with the audio
and yet I still have to deal with these
false claims and it sucks because that's
an attack an attack on integrity and
integrity is everything as far as I'm
concerned unfortunately it hurts you
guys now because before all of this came
about before all of the vrm thing I had
already worked out because as I'm
getting closer to a million subscribers
I want to start giving away more things
and I want to lead to a big giveaway
that I am planning was planning I'm
decide we're gonna do with that anymore
a huge giveaway that I wanted to do and
I sent this message to EVGA guys I was
going to give away three graphics cards
a 10 60 at 1017 to 1080 and EVGA and I
were going to collaborate on that
because I'm a huge fan of EVGA I've been
I have been a customer of theirs
since the what 2003 and 2003 a customer
guys it's only recently that I've been
able to actually have any sort of a
relationship with them which is really
really awesome but look this is what I
wrote this is what I wrote to Jacob but
EVGA you ready I said I feel like I need
to restructure my giveaway coming up due
to the constant claims that I am only
doing damage control for EVGA the timing
isn't very good and giving away three
EVGA GPUs will only strengthen that
false claim so I plan to give away three
graphics cards and now I'm cancelled it
I've cancelled it because of the false
claims out there and it's one of those
deals where the the minority ruined it
for the majority Gannett I'm doing the
Donald Trump thing I mean I know if he
does like kung-fu on the weekends but
anyway god this election sucks - oh my
god now people like to say things like
Jay you don't live in the real world
you've got a big house you've got a nice
car and you you're surrounded by stuff
you know you don't know what it's like
to be a hard-working person who has to
who has to earn their money that that's
got to be the stupidest statement I
think I've ever heard I'm guarantee I
put more hours into this content than
most people put in that they're nine to
five and what's that saying self
employments the only jobs some will work
80 hours to avoid working forty hours
that holds true here my freshman year in
high school we lost our house my parents
went bankrupt
my father was self-employed most of my
childhood after he got out of the
military
and man there was some serious ups and
downs financially so for anyone that
would make any sort of comment that I
don't know what it's like to struggle I
know what it's like to get free food
from the church when we were growing up
I know what it's like to have to I
actually worked with my parents to try
and earn money for the family when I was
like 12 okay we were doing we were doing
volunteer work at the church in exchange
for food so don't tell me I don't know
what it's like to have to live near the
bottom so forgive me if I don't feel bad
for working myself up through the ranks
of shitty jobs that paid minimum wage to
jobs that paid mediocrity to a little
bit better and then spent 10 years
building up my portfolio with a company
the where I worked myself up to middle
ish management if you will and then made
a name for myself here where I was
actually able to make my own living and
control my own finances so yeah forgive
me for spending nearly 20 years of my
life doing that so anyway moving forward
I just I couldn't I could not make
another video I could not get into a
creative mindset until I made this video
because it's bugging me it's it's
bugging me you can tell if you know if
you follow up me enough and you watch my
vlog channel you know what this is this
is called trichotillomania it's a
nervous disorder or nervous condition
where you hair pool and you don't
realize you're doing it so I'll sit
there on the computer or whatever if I'm
driving and I'll just be kind of sitting
there like one of the hair pull it out
pull it out pull it and you don't
realize you're doing it okay if you've
ever people who have nervous twitches
don't realize they're doing it so don't
be like Jared's with thought doing
that's the stupidest thing you could say
to somebody but anyway I don't realize
I'm doing it so then what do I do I take
a razor and I shave it because I'm like
well it gets all spotted and it looks
ridiculous so I shave it and worked
overtime it works its way back and now
I've got to deal with two months of J
what the hell's going on with your
hairline while I let it grow back only
to repeat the cycle which I had been
doing since I was like 12 yeah I started
this when I was 12 guys trust me
that's what 23 years I'm trying ok it's
not easy it's just not but here's the
thing I still continue to put myself in
front of the camera ridicule and all I
never wanted to I never wanted to be
famous I only did this channel to prove
to Josh you know who you are that this
would
never work and it did and all I want you
guys to understand is my devotion is
always going to be to the audience the
audience first there is no brand out
there that could pay me enough to give
up my integrity
none not NVIDIA not EVGA not AMD
definite IMD but hey nobody has enough
money to buy me you can't if you guys
could only see the amount of money I'll
leave on the table if you could see the
amount of money I leave on the table I
have no doubt so many of you calling me
a sellout or a shill would jump at that
opportunity because we are talking
thousands of dollars a week I don't take
I limit my income significantly compared
to what it could be if I was willing to
do pre rose and post roles and marquees
and pop ups and like some other
youtubers do if I was willing to do that
I would be living in a house twice as
big and I'd be driving a GTR my wife be
driving Mercedes whatever it is that she
wants I wouldn't be driving a used 370z
I can say that if only you guys knew but
yet I'm still a shill I'm still a
sellout right you know the difference is
here I control the ads when I when I
sell an ad spot I control it I control
what the product is I control the
verbage when it goes live I control how
often you guys get to see it where it
appears Adsense is okay wait let me tell
you let me tell you a little secret
about Adsense because of the popularity
of adblock in it being so easily - such
an easy extension to plug into your
browser's I last month was the highest
viewed month I've ever had on my channel
okay just over five million views I
usually sit in the three or four just
over five do you know how many of those
views were monetizable 1.6 that's a
point guys six million 1.6 million out
of over 5 million do the percentage math
of how many people are blocking our
income potential and that's okay though
it's okay because
Adsense and AdWords really sucks they
put the wrong ads in front of you guys
Google doesn't have a clue as to how to
take the tags that we put in our videos
and sync that up with with ads and
that's ok but let me tell you something
right now and this is the blunt abrasive
Jay coming out and you may not like what
I'm about to say listen to me if you use
adblock and then you bitch and complain
that I put an ad in the video that makes
you a jerk it makes you a jerk because
I'm telling you it's fine to use adblock
but it's not okay to block the ads and
then complain that I have to make a
living here for content you consume for
free it's not okay it's not it's not
okay to do it to me or anyone else so
you just have to deal with it because
the ads aren't going anywhere but at
least you can take some solace in the
fact that I control them I only put ads
in the things that I'm relative or that
I care about yeah I did a Norton ad I
paid for that ad dearly and I I didn't
do another one and I know what not to do
in the future you see somebody who only
cares about money and selling out would
be like god I don't care look at the
amount of money that is there's a lot of
zeros on that ad so if you got yeah it's
sad how many people I know complaining
about selling out and shilling god man
they would sell themselves in a
heartbeat if they saw some of these
dollar signs and I'm leaving on the
freaking table because I don't I don't
like ads myself and I want to control
them and that's that's that's how this
is that's how this works that's how this
whole game works and I think for some of
the abuse I take it's perfectly worth it
and acceptable anyway guys I'm going to
go I couldn't I could not get into a
creative mindset until I made this video
this has been boiling up and boiling
over and affecting more than just my
attitude here regarding the channels
perfecting attitude in my daily life and
I don't like that so here's what I'm
going to do I'm going to take this put
it on the channel I'm going to do some
minimal editing to it send it up and I'm
going for a bike ride and then tomorrow
if you're still here I would do the best
I can to make you guys entertained and
if you decide to leave because you like
what you hear in this video well then
I'm only left with supporters anyway so
I don't see how I'm losing there all
right guys thanks for watching see you
