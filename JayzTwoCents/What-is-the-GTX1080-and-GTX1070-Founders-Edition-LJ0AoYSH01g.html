back from the Nvidia event in Austin
Texas where Nvidia flew us out and gave
us the whole Texas experience then took
us over to the nightclub where they were
hosting the live event and livestream
hopefully you guys saw and if you didn't
you can check it out on invidious
YouTube page where they dropped the
bombshell of the 1080 and the 1070 and
yeah
there was a lot to be said that day now
this video is not going to be
all-inclusive 1080 there's a lot of
things I cannot talk about under NDA but
I chose one specific topic to talk about
today that there seems to be a huge
disconnect between the viewers and those
people who actually are in the know on
what exactly the founders edition card
is so we're going to talk about that
today and hopefully put some of those
rumors to rest the Licht max to 120 and
240 from enter max is another awesome
choice of AI Oh liquid coolers for
gamers and enthusiasts without breaking
the bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more now unless you have literally
been living under a rock since Friday
night and you have no idea what I'm
talking about
or perhaps you actually have a life and
you're not glued to your screen
face-planted against the glass going
gimme-gimme-gimme on new graphics card
launches and you actually go outside and
do things then you would know that the
1080 and 1070 launched and Gen Sun
showed a screen slide of what pricing
was going to look like and for the first
time in Nvidia history we've actually
seen two tiers of pricing for both of
those cards the 1080 and 1070 now quite
literally in the audience we all of us
pressed for sitting amongst each other I
had awesomesauce Kyle to my left and I
had Luke from line of tech tips to my
right and when pricing went up we
literally looked each other were like
what the hell is the founders card
now when Jensen showed the live 3d
rendering demo and showed a massive
overclock of 20 114 megahertz and RAM
running on an effective 11,000 megahertz
we were all looking each other going
okay so obviously this is the founders
card you know it might seem a little
deceptive to be thinking wow and
off-the-shelf GPU is going to be pulling
this kind of performance because
we saw the temperature sitting at 67 C
under load and we're like him yeah
there's a there's a little bit of a
magic and little little trickery
happening right here but bombshell guys
if that was yes the founders edition
card but what the hell is the founders
edition card because we really had to
know is it going to be something like
the kingpin edition here right from EVGA
they take the stock design of the 980ti
reference and then they put their spin
on it custom PCBs back plates and all
that sort of stuff and you get this
massively you know well performing but
bit pricey card obviously the founders
editions can be something like that
right well guys I have the founders
edition card right here are you ready
there it is the 1080 founders edition
card yeah looks an awful lot like
reference right I mean it has a
backplate so did the 980 though not the
980ti but the 980 headed backplate but
that's it right there
that is the founders edition card so
what is it
well when press got a chance to do Q&amp;amp;A
with a lot of the staff we're in video
we kept asking so what's the difference
between the founders Edition card and
the $5.99 card and the answer was
nothing it's exactly the same this is
the founders card so basically you can
take the word reference which has always
been used in the past right you've had
your reference Titan or essentially
really the Titan is the only Titan they
didn't allow board partners to go in and
make custom designs so the Titan really
was a founders edition card you also
have the 980ti right here right
reference designed and then we came out
with custom 980ti s as you see right
here
but here's effectively what has just
happened you have the reference model
being replaced with the word founders
edition right this is the reference
design card 599 r su v 699 bucks and
then you have the custom board partner
cards $599 so obviously we were very
confused going wait wait what what
what's happening here which one performs
better
well the basically the answer that we
got was that the founders Edition card
is they don't want to use the right word
reference anymore
it is the I'm holding the wrong card it
gets a little confusing quite obviously
when they look the same
but the founders edition card quite
literally is the card designed by Nvidia
it is using what they said is premium
components the best components that they
can get in here it is not Bend it is not
cherry picked and it is not GPU units
like the oh the Pascal GP 104 that is
being held back and going these are the
best ones we're going to keep it for
ourselves we're going to charge $100
more no Nvidia for the first time is
actually going to remain in the retail
space for the life of the card and they
are going to be offering this card for
life well the life of the 1018 as long
as it's relevant anyway but why if board
partners are going to be out there doing
custom designs and they quite literally
could be faster than this why would
anyone pay $100 more for this we kept
asking that question over and over
it was probably asked five or six
different ways the same question with
the same well different words but the
same question and we quite honestly kept
getting the answer of because Nvidia
wants to continue to offer what they
consider to be the their design what
they developed and then essentially sold
to the board partners or leased or
however that business model works
because they think that this is this is
the founder they founded this card they
want to keep it sold but at the same
time they don't want to compete with the
board partners what point would there be
if they were undercutting EVGA MSI
gigabyte ZOTAC and we're selling them
cheaper that really would be I know kind
of a slap to the face of your board
partners which are out there really
pushing the designs now the board
partners are going to be free obviously
to do whatever they want so yes as
confusing as it really seems you could
quite honestly buy the reference aka
founders 1080i did more expensive price
now why would you want to do that well
here's what typically happens on these
launches you guys have all seen this in
the past before 980ti launches right
here's 980ti these are the only cards
available at like on launch day some
board partners got custom designs out
there on launch day but they get very
little time to actually work with this
because NVIDIA wants to keep it under
wraps and I wanted to get leaked all the
leaks happen no matter what and they
want to you know they want to keep the
card basically in-house as long as they
can so board partners and
Chile will launch the reference style
but then after a couple of months I get
their custom cards out you know again we
use EVGA because I have it sitting right
here they start with their ACX cards and
then they start doing custom classifieds
and kingpins and stuff and then they
stop selling this guy right here
well NVIDIA feels that this guy belongs
in the market space as long as possible
and they are going to basically stay in
retail where you can order this card
direct from Nvidia again at a premium
price of six hundred ninety nine dollars
at launch now if you're sitting there
scratching your head going that's really
weird then you basically are sharing the
emotion that I think pretty much
everyone in the room felt when that was
the way that it was explained now there
are going to be instances where the
blower style like this is going to be
needed small form-factor cases that
don't have a lot of airflow you're going
to need a blower style card you put
cards in there with multiple fans it's
going to heat up there are instance in
fact there I've heard a lot of
conversations where some of the media
were going well that's just stupid why
the heck would you want to blower why
would you blah blah blah blah blah and
it it actually was really starting to
make me mad listening to this and I
finally stepped in and was like guys
there's a time when this cooler is
needed okay there are a small form
factor is becoming a bigger thing there
are times when you need an exhausting
fan and I can see where this fits in its
marketplace and so I basically stepped
in and did the Jays a dickhole thing and
was like look just stop there are times
this is needed as a system builder
myself I can understand this maybe you
don't build systems I don't know but I
do see where it belongs I think what
confused a lot of us was the pricing
model on it so basically to recap the
founders Edition is the reference
edition and basically the MSRP of $5.99
for the board partners is probably going
to be better worded in my opinion as map
or minimum advertised price where that's
where Nvidia is setting the floor for
pricing I don't know if that's exactly
which is manufacturer suggested retail
price but you could go below that I
don't think they will but what's going
to end up happening here I think is that
that six hundred $99 price point you are
going to start to see custom board
designs in there where they're not more
expensive than the reference so I guess
time is going to tell on whether or not
this is a
good business model or not again it's
when the first times nvidia has stayed
in the retail space after launch and not
just been and ODM or OEM designer and
manufacturer of the book the reference
board and then leasing selling however
they work that model like I said to the
board partners where they put their spin
on it and Nvidia supplies the chips that
models staying the same but NVIDIA is
staying in the space with their own
founders Edition card so that leads me
to the question how do you guys feel
about this how do you feel about the
founders edition card being referenced I
for one am excited the fact that what we
saw was obvious on that demo 2114
megahertz 67 degrees Celsius under load
and eleven thousand megahertz gddr5 X
based on a let's call it what it is a
reference design that means we could see
potentially a lot more so yeah I'm
pretty excited about that now they said
that the card that we saw on demo was
not cherry picked it was not hand picked
it came out of a pallet of carts I just
grabbed one put it in the machine for
the demo and didn't even overclock it
until shortly before the demo so yeah if
that's the type of overclocking we're
going to see at a GP 104
I am freaking pig sighted and I can't
wait to start seeing what the board
partners are able to do with this so I
hope that puts some of the rumor to rest
about what founders Edition is it's not
some crazy cherry picked hand-picked
custom built card by Nvidia which I I
actually thought it was going to be had
a conversation with Luke and Anthony at
tweak town on the way back from the
event to in fact we even talked about
this in that little roundtable video you
guys saw in Luke's video at Linus tech
tips I have the full like 50 minutes
discussion that took place I had been
given permission to go ahead and upload
that video so I will be editing that
together there's some pauses and some
breaks that we took so I need to edit
that stuff out where we're just kind of
like sitting there scratching our balls
or whatever but I will be putting that
entire discussion up you guys wanted to
hear one thing to keep in mind though is
that discussion took place after the
press event our like the the live stream
but before NDA information was given so
I've got to be very careful about you
know the way
that goes up I don't want any
speculation that's completely wrong to
make it in there is rumor it was a weird
when it took place in the timeline
before it was it was after the t's but
before the actual education and like I
said guys just NDA and stuff that we
cannot talk about until I later date as
it goes with every single launch anyway
I've already asked you guys what do you
think about this idea this concept put
in a script and put it in the
description
edit my video and put it in there for me
No put it in the comments quite honestly
really Nvidia setting pricing lower for
the AIC partners or the board partners
is a good thing if you really think
about that anyway guys time to go
sound off I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
