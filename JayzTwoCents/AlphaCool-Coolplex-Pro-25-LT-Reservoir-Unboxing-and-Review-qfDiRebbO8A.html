cents and if you couldn't tell we had a
lot of a water cooling theme going on
lately on my channel you guys have been
asking and we're taking a look at all
the things necessary and putting
together an awesome water cooling build
and keeping that tradition in that
series alive we're taking a look today
at the Alpha cool Pro 25 LT reservoir
okay guys today we're taking a look at
the Alpha cool 25 LT I believe this is
2500 2500 oh my god it'd be like gallons
of fluid inside of your system this is a
25 250 milliliter reservoir the
packaging it comes in I love Alpha
Cole's packaging it's all the same as
you can see here when you look at other
alpha cool boxes like we have the rads
over there it just I just like the
packaging it looks kind of nice when you
open it up bar on top here inside of a
very high-tech ziplock baggie is your
retaining brackets and by the way I've
never figured out how to open a ziploc
bag quickly so just bear with me here
you have your retaining brackets here
for your reservoir and they work just
like that just like any regular clamp so
you put the resin there and it clamp
shut and there you go and it's got your
hardware that you need to screw it in
there in fact it's got a little nut a
little nut that screws in or pops in
right there and then you screw in from
the back of wherever you're gonna drill
this to mount it so you've got your
retaining brackets high tech foam more
high-tech foam another plastic bag and
then you have your reservoir and nothing
else in the box the reservoir here is
made of acrylic and this is actually a
version 2 of this reservoir they had one
out before but it lacked one thing that
a lot of people kind of complained about
and that one thing being this inner tube
right here which I might add is kind of
scratched looking but it's not really a
problem
it's just aesthetics and it is threaded
so that you can move it to different
ports inside of the top of the reservoir
here now the cool thing about this
reservoir is that it does have multiple
ports on the top so if you're gonna be
doing a build where you need to have
multiple inlets and outlets actually
only have one Inlet or outlet on one
side
it is branded alpha cool on the top on
the bottom here you get your brass plugs
for it and you also get your threaded
hole right here for your fitting now a
lot like I mentioned in the water
cooling the water block these fittings
are awfully close together so if you
wanted to have say a giant half inch
inner diameter compression fitting like
this because of these two plugs right
here this is not gonna fit there's not
at all as you can see right there it
hits the plugs which means you can't
tighten it down so it's kind of
unfortunate but there is a little bit of
a fix for that if you were to use an
extension now keep in mind guys this is
because we're going with half inch do
the biggest fittings they have if you go
with something smaller like a 3/8 inner
diameter you probably won't have that
problem but you can use this extension
fitting like this on the top which would
then allow us to install a fill port or
return port or whatever you want with
that but as I started to mention earlier
and before I got sidetracked the reason
why this tube on the top is important
it's because if you're gonna have a loop
like mine in my 900 D where you want the
return to the res coming in on the top
you can't let the water just cascade
down into the into the reservoir and
bubble around you're gonna aerate your
fluid and you're gonna have bubble and
air nightmares inside your tank inside
your entire loop so what this tube does
is it pushes the fluid down into the
fluid level so that you could still have
room on the top a little bit of air on
the top so you have a place for the air
to bleed out this is absolutely
necessary if you're gonna be running a
return on the top of your reservoir now
if you wanted to have a fill port on the
top and you're using like this and you
have the inlet and outlet on the bottom
then your fill port can be right here on
the top and that can drip down in there
with no problem at all so because this
is a 50 millimeter wipe and they break
everything on the table because this is
a 50 millimeter wide tank and not a 60
millimeter wide which is more common
like with bits power and whatnot this
fits in a lot more
tight spaces that's kind of what she
said but anyway because we're gonna be
putting this in a smaller full tower
case we're gonna be putting this in a
switch NZXT 8 10 this is going to be
perfect
now unfortunately as I mentioned earlier
because the fittings are so close
together on the bottom if you wanted to
do Inlet outlet on the bottom you're
gonna have to use fittings that have a
curve to them like this 45 millimeter
fitting here that way you can as you can
see now you could fit multiples of these
together without any problems at all in
fact let me take off one of these other
plugs so you can see exactly what I mean
the last thing you want to do is have
these giant fittings which look really
cool because half inch tubing being nice
and big you know we all know bigger is
better right in most situations they
would clearly be a fitment issue there
but if you were to go with two of these
45s like this you can see that we have
absolutely no fitment problems
whatsoever so you could have this
mounted in the back wall of your tank
and they could have this really cool
kind of a really Spacey look coming out
of it so this is required if you're
gonna be using big compression fittings
like that if you're using Barb's there's
not gonna be problems at all
Barb's will fit next to each other
without any sort of problems so we're
gonna go ahead and get this installed in
of our build and we're gonna see just
how this thing performs at holding fluid
I mean really it's just holding fluid
with it as long as it doesn't leak we're
good right so let's go ahead and get in
there there you have it guys the loop is
installed it's complete 250 milliliter
reservoir that does the job gives us
plenty of mounting options upside down
right side up tons of different port
options and it holds our fluid without
leaking who could ask for more so if
you're doing a custom water cooling loop
you definitely want to consider this
reservoir at just about 30 bucks
it is absolutely unsurpassed performance
a price ratio so there you have it guys
