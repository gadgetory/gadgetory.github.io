today's video is going to be a little
bit beginner level so if you're one of
my more advanced followers feel free to
come back in the next one or just hang
around if you want you might actually
learn something or you might even just
laugh at me like you guys already do
it's okay I don't mind
I'm used to it the wife laughs at me all
the time today we're going to talk about
overclocking and whether or not it's
safe because I feel like there's a lot
of people out there that are not using
their hardware to its full potential
because they're afraid of something
because of a lot of misinformation is
out there in the world things have
gotten better when it comes to
overclocking and people generally
accepting it hopefully by the end of
today's video you'll be one of those
people as well today's video is
sponsored by Master opt the largest
community commerce platform in the world
and right now they have a massive drop
on the popular AKG K 7 xx mass drop
Edition audiophile headphones at only
199 dollars supplies are limited so
click the link in the description for
the drop details now the first thing you
have to understand is what exactly
overclocking is and that's simply
increasing either the multiplier or the
frequency of your component whether it
be graphics card or CPU or even memory
to get more operations per second to
make it operate faster now that might
have already thrown some people out just
basically think about it this way it's
like putting the gas pedal down farther
on your car let's say your car had a
screw that stopped the gas pedal from
going any farther than that overclocking
is you backing that screw off so that
you can don't and don't guys will make a
joke with screw off come on this is this
is an adult show here but you're going
to allow that gas pedal to go down even
farther because well from the factory
they're actually built to go much faster
than they ship which means you've got a
lot of headroom and free horsepower just
sitting there waiting to be tapped well
Jay if the chips could go faster then
why don't the companies just ship them
at their max speed already well I'm glad
you asked that because you have to
understand how many units are actually
built and shipped we're talking about
hundreds of thousands of video cards
over the last several years and millions
of processors shipped over the last
let's just say the last decade
right millions and millions of
processors and graphics cards and memory
modules and all of that stuff well you
have to think about the RMA or return
merchandise authorization and warranties
that are involved with that whereas a
huge number of those parts can actually
well exceed the factory clocks that
they're being shipped at they have to
think about the failure rate and these
companies like Intel and AMD and NVIDIA
have to make sure they can keep yo good
yields because if they're shipping these
things literally at the limit and
they're breaking left and right and
they're taking back these warranty
returns and having to ship more then
they're just losing money so what
they've decided to do over the last I'd
say over the last five or six years it's
gotten really good maybe far the more
like seven years where these companies
have really started to relax the the
locked functions of these CPUs and
graphics cards now to allow you if you
want to take the risk and they're very
adamant about it being a risk you can
play around with your components and get
more speed if you want but on AMD now
you've got the black edition which has
unlocked voltage and frontside bus
multiplier you can play around with all
that stuff until now has the case queue
and they even sell an additional
warranty so if you blow up your process
or do two overclocking it you get
another one very very inexpensive and
Nvidia and AMD both on the graphics card
sides have really started to implement
good Headroom on the amount of
additional power Target and voltage and
stuff that you can work with again to
try and get better performance at the
trade-off of higher heat and potentially
degrading the lifespan of the product
now I think that's one of the things
that scares people is they hear about
degradation or degrading of the chip and
they think oh my god if I overclock this
every time I turn on my computer I'm
literally just degrading and I'm shaving
life off of it and whereas that might be
true what you're actually doing is
you're shaving it off obviously the tail
end of its lifespan and you might have
turned a chip that would run otherwise
ten or fifteen years and made it maybe
run seven or eight years before it dies
are you planning on upgrading before you
potentially hit that lifespan I'm going
to use an example here of an Intel ISA
300 it was a Core 2 Duo chip it was
clocked at 1.8 6 gigahertz and it was
unlocked
overclocked mine to 3.42 gigahertz that
was an 80% overclock and I've still to
this day never had a chip of a nice if
any type that has achieved that level of
overclocking that was like intel's
pinnacle of overclocking and they've
never been able to get anything that
overclocked nearly as far but the reason
why I'm even mentioning this is that CPU
ran at 3.4 to 24/7 no thermal or no no
turbo clock it just ran you turned it on
it went to 3.42 and it never came down
none of that power balancing crap no the
C states or any of that and that CPU
lasted over seven years the reason why I
say this you know the CPU lasted was
because it was actually the motherboard
that died it was an old LGA 775 socket
and it just wasn't worth replacing by
the time it died so the CPU was still
working actually after seven years and
spending every day of its life
overclocked to that speed with a lot
more voltage going in it than what was
ever shipped from the factory
now that's an example of a great silicon
lottery winner where you get a chip that
overclocks
really really well on the flip side the
lottery loser would be the chip that no
matter how much voltage you give it no
matter how much you try and tweak the
multiplier or the core or the base clock
just won't overclock and that is and you
have no control over that you either get
a great one or you didn't sometimes you
can find one in the middle most of us
have one somewhere in the middle ground
but you always end up hearing about
those people on forums that just
flat-out lost the silicon lottery and
you kind of feel bad for them and then
you all kind of hate the guy that just
absolutely won Mesilla con lottery has
the magical chip that will go to like
five gigahertz plus with hardly any
extra voltage and we all love to hate
that guy trust me so when you overclock
yeah you're shaving off some of the
lifespan but you have to ask yourself
when you're planning on upgrading if
you're if you are on a schedule and you
upgrade your computer every three years
every three years or you buy a graphics
card every other year you're not going
to shave off enough life to even notice
any sort of degradation that in the span
of which you've owned that card or that
that CPU and the telltale sign of
degradation is where your clocks are no
longer stable anymore at that overclock
and you have to start bumping it down
and as you decrease it you start to
decrease some of the load or again
degradation it pushes it back out again
so it's just a balancing act now the
number one killer of overclock
components believe it or not has nothing
to do with the clock speed it has
everything to do with the voltage and
exponential heat that's going to occur
when you start to add voltage and
overclocking to your parts now a lot of
people think it's linear you had X
amount of voltage as temperatures going
to go up on a straight line it doesn't
work that way some chips in fact most
chips a little bit of voltage can be a
sudden spike in temperature where let's
just use for example a 6700 K at 1.3
volts that's kind of hard to get kind of
high on Intel and it might be running at
let's say 75 C under load on a basic
water like Ultima water cooling loop and
then you bump it up to let's say 1.3 to
5 which is just point to 5 0 of a volt
and suddenly it jumps up to 85 C 10 C
jump for just a little bit of voltage
and what you find is as you start to
reach the limits of the CPU the voltage
goes the voltage jumps will give you
much bigger steps of temperature
increase and the whole reason we've been
mentioning this is that means you
obviously have to keep the temperatures
in check so obviously the point here is
to get the best results with
overclocking your CPU you need to have a
really good cooler whether that be like
a Noctua NV 14 or some sort of a 120
millimeter or 240 millimeter water
cooling loop something that's going to
give you better than factory cooling
factory heat sinks that come with Intel
and AMD or garbage literally
paperweights that just belong in the
trash if you think you're going to
overclock does it's not going to happen
with those you need more headroom when
it comes to cooling heat again I'm going
to repeat this is the number one killer
of components even stuff that is an
overclocked factory CPU coolers are
terrible even at factory clocks and I
think everybody should be running some
sort of a custom cooler everyone should
have a dual loop skunkworks in their
system as far as I'm concerned and I
don't think you had to pay for it I
think the world should just give it to
you but I think another thing that makes
people kind of fearful of whether or not
overclocking is safe is in order to find
your max overclock often you're going to
find that
point of failure and it's that failure
point that scares people you've moved
that slider on your afterburner in your
video card and suddenly you went to
launch your game and it completely froze
up no mouse no keyboard nothing working
your restart the computer you start your
game and again it freezes and you start
to freak out a little bit so you just
you wipe the profile and you go I don't
want overclock that scary or with your
CPU you push your overclock a little bit
too far you start up your computer it
clicks on and then it clicks off and it
just starts power cycling it won't go
and you're like oh my god what'd I do I
think I broke it
I broke my computer my mom is gonna kill
me well CPUs are a little bit more
tricky to overclock and fortunately the
clear CMOS button on there is going to
wipe any of your settings that you may
have messed up and it's going to get you
up and running again but you need to be
more careful with CPUs the GPU because
CPU parameters are not going to have
very many safeguards involved to keep
you from blowing it up if you if you try
and boot an x99 chip here like my 59 60
X and you dial in 2.5 volts it's
possibly going to actually let it boot
and then it's just going to fry the CPU
because that is way more voltage and
it's designed to handle and you're
getting into like ln2 liquid nitrogen
cooling territory there but the
motherboards aren't going to keep you
from making that mistake graphics cards
on the other hand overclock and move
those sliders have some fun because
those sliders are set by the bios on how
far they can actually go and that bios
is those bios limits are set by the
factory on where they know it's safe to
play around with it's it's safe to move
that voltage slider all the way to the
right it's safe to put that temperature
limit all the way to the right hopefully
you have an aftermarket card which is
not going to have terrible fans on it
like blower style coolers from you know
the factories and they have nice big
huge heat pipe heat sinks that are going
to keep things nice and cool but bottom
line here guys is you have to try pretty
hard to actually break something when it
comes to your overclocked Senor CPUs
even when I was learning I never broke
anything it was always revert able
revert able and I'm sure that's a word
it could always be reverted and start
over but the bottom line is even a mild
overclock just a small overclock 5% 10%
is that much more power and that much
more performance you're getting for the
same amount of
money and you're missing out if you're
not taking that opportunity to pull more
power out of your components the nice
thing about overclocking though is
typically on graphics cards the
percentage of overclock usually directly
relates to the percentage of performance
increase so if you get a 15% overclock
on your graphics card you can get about
a 15% extra boost in frames per second
it's that it's kind of weird that it
works out fairly linear like that of
course it's going to deviate from that
line a little bit but it's pretty close
it's actually a pretty amazing thing so
if you can know if you have a great
graphics card that over clocks and you
can get 25 extra of percentage of
frequency out of it you're going to get
anywhere between 20 and 25 percent extra
fps so what are you waiting for do it
but with that said guys I'm going to go
ahead and get on out of here I hope this
videos helped put you at ease just a
little bit we will do more overclocking
tutorials here on the more modern stuff
x99 we'll check out some sky like
overclocking and I've been promising
that one forever and I promise more
redness videos are coming I want the
build done I want it out of here I was
just waiting on parts and then I got
really busy and then I went to Austin
and everything got just completely foo
barred but we're going to be back on
track where you get that build finished
and the hell out of my shop
alright guys thanks for watching as
always I'll see you in the next video
oh and follow on Twitter and all that
stuff that's fun too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
