we're going to kind of round out science
week here the week I stayed home from
CES with making our own custom coolants
if you will custom colors and stuff to
kind of show you guys how to do that
you're not always going to find that
exact color that you are after and after
I showed you guys mixing the dye in the
coolant for our the Primo Cho clear that
I'm using inside of skunkworks you guys
requested some more on this topic so
today we're going to go ahead and
continue the week of science water
cooling parts for skunk works were
provided by performance pcs for the
largest online selection of PC modding
and water cooling parts head to
performance pcs calm as you guys can see
here I've already mixed some colors I've
got some green going on here and we'll
mix this again to show you guys how I
did it in my little test loop I figured
before I tear this thing apart one keep
that going but I'm going to go ahead and
show you guys an alternative here to the
pastel because pastel isn't the only
fluid on the market that is opaque in
fact Premo chill makes one they sent
this to me a year ago actually it's been
sitting on the shelf it's the exact same
one that Paul's hardware used in his
arctic panther I had two of these
bottles I gave one to him and that's the
white that he used in his loop I don't
know if he changed it out but the
initial white that was used was this and
I think he might have changed it to the
pastel I'm not entirely sure but this is
the Primo qu yang sickle this one's
actually a prototype the run date on
this one was 130 2015 so this has been
sitting on the shelf for a year but I
figured to go ahead and try it
so we can show you guys how to mix some
custom opaque stuff as well as some
custom clear stuff I'm starting to like
the clear once again because it's kind
of shiny but anyway let's go ahead and
mix this bad boy and show you guys how
we're going to do this today now first
things first the products were using
here as I already said this is the yang
sickle from primo chill again this is a
prototype you're going to want to check
their website for whatever the latest
product is they do still have this on
their website and various different
colors already mixed but it does show
that they're all sold out so I don't
know if maybe they just haven't I mean
this is this was a prototype so I don't
know they're still developing on this
but for
sake of today's video we're just using
this as an example so you're definitely
going to want to check and see exactly
what their current product is in fact
you can even see right here it even says
for testing purposes only that's what it
says right there keep out of reach of
children
definitely don't drink it guys this
isn't milk don't mistake it for milk now
we are using Mayhem's dyes here and like
I said I I like their dye I've been
using their dye for a long time I'll
probably continue to use their dye but
they sent me a lot of different colors
here in fact this was one of their ways
of saying sorry for you know the way
that they were being you know dickholes
on the internet so I've got more dyes
here to play with so this is gonna be
fun we've got a lot of different colors
some UV reactive stuff some non reactive
stuff now the one thing I do like about
the Primo chill here is they're insanely
concentrated liquid premix actually
mixes into a gallon not just a leader
but a gallon so you're going to add this
to your use distilled water and you're
going to add this and this is purified
water but that's because this is just an
empty container I'm using you're going
to mix or add this to the bottle and
then you're going to fill the bottle to
the top and that's going to be basically
your mix so we'll go ahead and do that
now it also says to make sure you shake
up the bottle real good because it could
have had overtime of sitting on the
shelf some stuff fall out to the bottom
did you definitely know what make sure
you shake that up and I've already done
that as well but we did it again for
good measure it looks just like milk
it's what's so cool about this stuff
we've already done that milk test you
guys haven't seen that video make sure
you go and look at it I did it on Monday
of this week and now we are just going
to slowly add our distilled water until
we're at the top kind of sounds like
we're peeing in a bottle here now we're
going to give this a good shake for a
while to make sure it is completely
mixed up make sure that cap doesn't pop
up because it's not a screw cap this is
a pop cap and not like a pop cap bobble
head either and there is our white but
before we do this we're going to go
ahead and drain this loop here and we
are going to play around with some of
the clears to show you guys you know how
much diet takes to clear or to dye clear
fluid versus the opaque stuff the opaque
stuff takes a lot more dye so let's go
ahead and drain this loop and let's
start all over now if we're going to be
using
like distilled water you're still going
to have to add some sort of a biocide I
use PT nuke just in a slow and loop this
size I would use one maybe two drops and
a bigger loop three drops no more than
that
or will dye your tubes and stuff sort of
an aqua color you definitely don't want
that now one of the cool things that's
about these dyes is just like art you
can mix these so that you can get any
custom color that you want so let's do
this let's start with hmmm so let's
going to start with the pink I think the
pink will be kind of neat I don't know
exactly what suspect I've never done a
pink loop so one drop that's how much
one drop will actually change the color
of the loop as you can see that's a very
light sort of a rosy color and as it
mixes in it's going to kind of get
darker it's going to take a little bit
for it all to mix in and then you can
just add more drops to increase the
intensity of the color that's looking
really good I should say UV colors well
I think I should do a loop like this for
a little Jay hmm there will become a
point though we're adding more drops no
longer darkens the color and the
important thing to note about that is
anything more that you add is just
adding unnecessary dye to the fluid so
let's do like three or four more drops
here so as you can see we got sort of a
hot pink there and that's actually kind
of cool looking by itself
now one thing you can also you know
obviously do is this is a UV color so if
we were to add UV light here so let's do
this let me hook up a UV light here real
quick so you can see that it's got a
little bit of UV reaction here as we use
the UV LEDs now UV LEDs are never going
to give off as much UV light as say a
cathode or a true blacklight so keep
that in mind to the intensity here is
going to be affected by the light source
but that's kind of a neat color green is
still ultimately like the best when it
comes to showing off at night when it
comes to UV colors so I'm going to do
now is I'm just going to add a couple of
drops of let's say I don't know blue
let's see what happens I put some of
this ocean blue dye in here now if you
mix non UV dyes with UV dyes you remove
some of the UV
of the loop so as you can see we're sort
of starting to get a custom purpley
color here it's quite dark actually but
also to keep in mind too if you start
adding a lot of these dark colors to
bright colors it's going to ultimately
turn a pretty dark color but that's just
two drops that was just two drops of the
blue and you can see just how much it
actually changed color inside of the
loop but ultimately I want to see how
well we're gonna do with this guy so
let's flush this guy out again all right
so we got the yangtze cool all in here
and i think i want to mix me a nice
green now I'm going to start with the
the regular green here's just a UV green
dye and we've also got the laser green
I'm a huge fan of the laser green but I
don't know how much dye it's gonna
actually take to dye this and start with
the laser green so we'll see how one
drop does here actually was a bit of a
squirt but whatever I squared it into it
but as you can see it sort of absorbs it
up and it doesn't change color all that
much so you've got to use a lot of this
to actually change its colour but as you
can see once you start changing its
color it looks really really good but
you're probably going to end up using
close to an entire bottle to get this
thing to change the color that you want
I don't think it's gonna get much darker
than that though because that quite
honestly is it's it's really bright on
the camera here let me darken that up a
little bit so you can kind of see what
looks closer to what I'm seeing here so
you can see it's not really getting any
darker that's pretty much the colour of
it and as you can see by the cap - it's
a very bright colour on the cap now if
we want to make this darker we can of
course take a darker green and mix that
in there so as you can see we're
starting to get a bit of a sort of like
an Nvidia green going on here
so it changes the tone of it a little
bit now I'm going to take this emerald
green put a couple of drops of that in
there this is going to darken it up just
a tad so now we're starting to really
get that sort of a sort of a ninja
turtle news color going on here that's
pretty cool there we'll let that mix in
that's a pretty neat color right there
actually I like that
now you can't lighten it back up that's
one thing you need to keep in mind is
that you cannot lighten it back up if I
put in more of the brighter green here
you can see nothing's going to happen so
once you go to dark there's no real
going back from that unless you thin it
out and by thinning out you would need
to add more white back into the into the
mix now I've actually got a system here
where I could do that in fact let me go
ahead and demonstrate that now where if
I take and this was the purple that I
drained right here let me widen this out
this was the purple that I drained right
here from the previous you know mix that
we just did but if I take this to my
drain loop here and just kind of you
know put that in the cap right there and
I've got it going under the desk if I
just barely crack the valve here for
draining it this will start to go down
just a little bit and I can start adding
back some white which will get me the
brighter color so that I can kind of
start over if I got a little bit too
dark but in order for this to work you
would have to have a way to be able to
add back to the mix I'm doing right now
as well as have a drain on the bottom
there so now as you can see we've got a
much brighter green that we had just a
second ago now unfortunately we're going
to reuse that purple anyway but look at
the color it turned to now yeah it's
kind of like a kale smoothie color but
now you can see we're much brighter
again and we can kind of start over on
mixing in our color if we wanted if we
wanted to go just maybe quite as dark as
we did a moment ago now it is also a you
this is also a UV dye a lot of what the
ones that we use were UV so let's see
how well it reacts since we did act add
in some that are not UV reactive oh yeah
look at that you can see here you're
getting some pretty cool you get some
pretty cool glow on that it's really
hard to pick up on the camera but yeah
it's it's glowing big-time and then
that's what you would end up with is
this nice glowing fluid here but it
doesn't pick up very good on camera
unfortunately now that method I showed
you for thinning it out is also the same
way I'm flushing out this loop here by
using distilled water I'm barely
cracking the valve just enough for the
LeWitt the fluid level to start to drop
slowly and then I just keep adding water
to the reservoir it takes about two
gallons for loop this size to completely
turn back clear with this sickled stuff
but if I just cracking the valve it's
not all going out the valve as you can
see it's getting thinner even as I'm
talking to you some of its going through
the loop and thinning out more with the
distilled water and then oops I just
build some of it it's going out of the
valve down into my other catch container
so as you can see this is how I've been
actually flushing out these loops in
between and this is a really good way to
make sure you get you know all of the
old color out once it turns completely
clear then you're good to move on to the
next test but you can see just how fast
it's actually changing color here back
to clear another important thing to keep
in mind tune as you can see it's almost
back to completely clear do not let the
level go down so that the pump ends up
going
that's bad you don't want to damage your
pump doing this but you can see this
wasn't really all that hard and if you
have access to the top of the reservoir
you could use it by just using a funnel
at the end of a tube stick the tube in
the reservoir and then as long as your
drain is at the very bottom of your loop
then this is this is actually a really
easy way to flush out your loop you guys
have been asking how I do it this is how
I do it all right let's do this then
let's them let's mix up some custom
color here shall we let's go for I don't
know like a like a gunmetal color so I'm
not sure exactly the I'm just going to
play with this quite honestly I'm just
going to mix it so it's putting some
more emerald green this is a whole
different color to green though than
what I used earlier so it's going to
look much much much different now I'm
going to mix in some blood red your deep
red dye they call it that's a weird
color huh but you can see it starting to
turn a little bit well that's really red
huh um let's try some blue now so
happens we put a little bit of blue dye
in here give it a little bit of metal
tone ah I think we're getting it it's
gonna be kind of hard to see but we're
gonna have to once that all mixes in
yeah we're starting to get a little bit
of a metally color but it's very blue at
the moment so let's try mixing in a
little bit more green stem we'll try a
different shade of green
let's try some of the brighter red color
and see what happens
that
and I think I think we might have gotten
it I know how well the cameras picking
it up but this is like a gunmetal color
here it's add a little bit of yellow to
it just because see what happens hmm I
want to put just a couple of drops of
dark blue in here three drops do that
that's an interesting color to be sure
it's like a it's very grey and how well
it picks up on camera
that is definitely a gray color so you
can even make the the tubes look very
metallic if you wanted all right now I'm
curious in trying to mix one more color
I want to see if I can get a color that
would match skunkworks as new orange
seemed really good so I'm going to start
with the brighter orange color here the
same dye that I used in the what the
Primo Cheil clear the pure clear we're
just going to go ahead make ourselves a
base Orange now I know pastel already
has an orange the problem is that the
orange that they have is way too way too
light you guys know I have a bit of a
burnt orange color going on inside of
skunkworks see this is very similar to
the orange color that they already have
right here you can see I'm using a lot
of orange here the problem with this is
it's just too bright this is just way
too bright so we put a little bit more
orange in here and see if it goes any
darker yeah see it's it's still just a
little bit too bright for what
skunkworks would need but we can darken
that up a little bit by adding in some
reds we mix this into the top some of it
sits at the top with the way that this
reservoir is that's really not a bad
color right there but we need we need a
little bit darker so I'm going to start
with the brighter red here just put a
couple of drops in
that's not too bad
and then I think I'm going to put just
one or two drops of the deep red now I'm
not even going to need the yellow I
don't think one to put two drops of the
deep red in there let that mix in maybe
put a couple drops of yellow just to see
what happens okay more than a couple
drops I guess so this is such a bright
diet expect a whole lot to happen
I was curious still mixing in anyway so
there you go there's a perfect example
of how you can mix your own colors and
not have to really rely on what's
readily available this is like this
color right here actually matches pretty
well with the RAM and the sleeving
so this is a color I would have actually
considered putting into skunkworks
without hesitation but because this is a
prototype fluid you know I'm not going
to do that and as you know the something
in my loop is still causing the pastels
to change color so I'm not going to
bother trying I'm going to let this run
inside this test loop for a bit though
and just kind of see what happens to it
well that's fun I've always wanted to
mix up my own custom colors and stuff
and I really wish that I could use this
in skunk works because I do kind of I do
really like the way that this looks but
again with everything's going on in that
loop I don't want to mess with that
right now but maybe in the future if we
can find some coolant that is going to
play nicely with the copper mix of
metals that's going on in my loop and
not start changing colors on me
especially due to the high heat of the
GPU loop maybe we'll play around doing
this in the future now guys I know I'm
not the first one to ever do this and I
know that there's more videos on YouTube
showing people do this but I figured I'd
have to show my audience because you
guys know I love water cooling and it
just was fun to do I've never actually
sat here and played with this massive
amount of dyes and seeing what colors we
could come up with I mean it's the it's
like any color in the color wheels
possible so I just showed you a few
today but if let's say you're a girl you
want like a purple or a pink or whatever
color if that's more your thing then you
can do that if you want custom Reds or
blues or yellows or greens any tint or
shade of that color it's possible and as
you can see I showed you how you can
kind of recover if you mess up a little
bit and start over without wasting too
much fluid anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video time to get on
out of here and as always if you guys
want
see more scientific type videos like
this Regis are playing around
experimenting let me know what you guys
want to see me do I think one of the
highest recommended tests right now is
different materials for Tim like peanut
butter or Nutella and stuff like that
that sounds awfully messy and I don't
know the ramifications of that getting
down into the sock it could be but I
don't know maybe we'll do it if we get
enough requests maybe we'll do it maybe
I'll take a chance at ruining some
hardware for the sake of science alright
guys time to get out of here thanks for
watching we'll see you in the next video
and I've got multi-coloured fingers now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
