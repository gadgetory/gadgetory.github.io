feels like lately there's been a bit of
an influx in my inbox and influx in the
inbox I okay fine we'll go with it but
there have been a lot of questions
lately in my inbox from people doing
their very first water cooling loops
seeking my advice so today we're going
to be doing my very first top 5 video
ever on this channel and that's Jays top
5 tips for the water cooling beginner if
it's ultra small form-factor with
amazing speed and performance that
you're after then as rocks desk mini is
definitely for you featuring intel's 7th
gen cpus 5x5 building block chassis and
the latest m2 slot technology powered
directly by the cpu allowing for even
greater m2 performance the desk mini pax
big performance in a small package see
the link below for more details now
these are not in any particular order I
could naturally rank these but I sat
here and I thought about this for a
little bit and I actually took down some
notes on things that I think about when
I'm doing a water cooling loop whether
you're beginner or an expert they're
kind of the same thing so what you're
bout to hear is in no particular order
but they are kind of where I rank the
top 5 things to think about when it
comes to creating your water cooling
loop fittings are not created equal I
know there's a lot of misconception out
there where all the fittings are just
made in the same Chinese factory they
put a different logo on there and
they're all the same that's not true
believe me you don't want to mess up on
this because if you're going to form a
leak it's going to happen at your
fitting and you get what you pay for now
when it comes to compression fittings
for soft tubing they are pretty much
similar it's just a barb with a collar
that locks down as long as you get the
correct size tubing in there it's always
going to be a good fit it gets a little
bit different when you talk about rigid
tubing because of the fact that you're
dealing with slightly different
measurements on there with 13 millimeter
or 1/2 inch outer diameter they're not
exactly the same so you want to make
sure you match up those numbers but
trust me when I say they're not created
equal
every company kind of takes a different
approach to the way the o-ring seals
around the tube I personally like to use
primo chills revolver fittings I've used
them in skunk works multiple times I've
used them in the redness build both
times I also use it in the AMD
water-cooled build I just really stand
by their fittings they seem to have the
tightest seal and they have you can tell
how
fitting is grabbing onto a rigid tube by
how hard it is to pull the tube out of
the fitting when it's locked down and
those always have the greatest grip as
far as I'm concerned now there's some
new fittings out on the market too for
monsoon that claim to be leak free okay
well they use the word virtually because
obviously nothing is leak free any
fitting can leak the most expensive
fitting in the cheapest fitting can
develop a leak I mean there are
manufacturer tolerances and defects and
anything that's ever made in the world
so trust me there's no such thing as a
leak free fitting but we will be taking
a look at that in a future video but
remember guys you get what you pay for
the four dollar fittings on ebay might
seem really incentive asset especially
when it comes with the when it comes to
the rotary fittings the 90s and the
twistable fittings and stuff remember
those have seals in there you get what
you pay for so buyer beware
just please think about that if you're
going to spend your money anywhere in
your loop don't cheap out on your
fittings the next topic here is a highly
debated one and that being fans now I
don't mean you guys I mean fans like
fans you put on your radiator because
now you have static pressure optimized
fans which are fans that can keep a high
pressure across resistance aka a
radiator radiator does add a lot of
resistance to the airflow of your fan so
if you take an airflow fan or one that's
optimized for open flow environment and
high CFM they tend to have low static
pressure numbers it has to do with the
type of thin design on the fan so if you
take something like that and put it on a
radiator
you're not going to maintain as much of
an air flow across the fins as you would
with something that has a static
pressure optimized blade design now what
you're going to notice here is if you
use an airflow fan on a radiator what's
going to happen is your systems going to
run fine but the Internet's going to
blow up if you post a picture of your
system and one's going to tell you
you're doing it wrong now ideally you
would want to use a static pressure fan
if you have one but they can sometimes
tend to be a bit more expensive now
there are some fans out there that are
fairly inexpensive like the y8 loon fans
are an amazing fan that's kind of in the
middle you can use them for air flow and
you can use them for static pressure and
they do an amazing job at working on
radiators in fact for the longest time
loon fans were like the budget king of
the world when it came to radiators and
they came in different speeds so you
could get various rpm ranges if you
wanted them
they range for about five or six bucks a
fan that's an amazing price compared to
20 25 or even $30 fans that exists out
there so ignore the internet if you
don't have a lot of money to spend on a
static pressure optimized fan there are
options out there that are going to get
you by and they're only going to be a
couple of degrees at the most difference
between temperatures because the size of
your radiator kind of matters more than
the type of fan that you're using just
ignore the Internet literally well
except me I'm on the Internet but ignore
the comments of people that would just
be like you're not using static pressure
fans guys I'm not using static pressure
fans on skunk works for the 560 rad they
don't make a 140 static pressure fan
with the removable rings like I like to
use Corsair have no idea why you do that
don't stress it go with the fans that
you can afford like I recommend gate
loon an amazing fan for an inexpensive
price another topic that creates a lot
of confusion amongst beginner water
coolers is the idea of conduct non
conductivity non conduct non conductive
fluids there you go on the surface it
sounds like a great idea
Wow if I generate a leak nothing's gonna
break it's not going to destroy anything
if I you know water or the fluid leaks
on my graphics card or my motherboard or
whatever the problem is that's only true
for a little while because as the fluid
is moving through the loop it's touching
metal and metal has ions and fluid loves
ions it's like crack too fluid it wants
it water wants ions that's why you've
heard of things like deionized water
which is pure pure water distilled water
stuff like that but as the loop is
turning and moving and moving and moving
those ions do leach into the fluid which
do raise its conductivity level now it's
not ever going to be as conductive as
something like tap water which has tons
of mineral minerals in it and are is
extremely conductive water itself
inherently is not conductive much it is
the metals and ions and other
contaminants in the water that are
actually conductive so non conductive
fluids work for a little while the
problem is they become conductive over
time which is why it's going to move me
into my next tip here is distilled water
is still the easiest simplest and pretty
much the safest way to go when it comes
to beginning water color loops don't go
out there and spend 40 50 bucks on
high-end fluids like nano fluids and
just pastels and stuff like that
if you want to get up and running and
you want to do it safely and on the
cheap get yourself like distilled water
at the grocery store or if you live in a
country that doesn't have distilled
water deionized water I know there's
always options somewhere Amazon try that
but use but use that add some dyes if
you want to change the color and add a
few drops of a biocide like Petey nuke
or something that's going to kill the
algae that could grow the benefit to
using premix fluids if you have the
budget for it is it has in there growth
inhibitors so that you don't grow algae
or other sorts of organisms inside your
loop and it has anti corrosives in there
so that you don't start corroding the
different types of metals that are in
your loop there's a lot of different
metals happening in your loop and
actually were going to talk about that
next well I'm I'm pretty good at this
whole segue thing aren't I the last tip
I want to mention to you is avoid mixing
metals where possible now it's never
going to be possible to have one type of
metal even if you go with like wow I've
got an all copper radiator I've got an
all copper water block the problem is
you have different types of fittings in
there you have plated fittings
nickel-plated fittings brass fittings
and you've also got stainless steels and
other types of metals in your water pump
and you've got the either the soft fluid
or the ptg of the rigid acrylic there's
different materials going on in your
loop now ideally you would want to avoid
aluminum where possible and that's
another huge debated topic I'm not I'm
not an alchemist so I can't tell you
about the metallurgy and stuff but I
will tell you that aluminum is tends to
be the one that corrodes the worst
especially you mix aluminum with other
metals like copper so we want to avoid
mixing metals where possible even if you
go with all copper stuff on all copper
radiator in an all copper water block
there are different grades of copper
there's different qualities of copper
there's different types of metals mixed
in the copper so you're never going to
get one type of loop so that's we're
using something like premix fluids kind
of touched on and the previous tip comes
in handy is it has an anti corrosive
agent in there with tool cause those
metals to not start to eat away at each
other metals are there like gangs are
always fighting they've got terrific
that territory and they just are like
get off my turf bro and they start
eating each other you've also got nickel
plating right if you've got nickel
plated blocks so you're touching nickel
plating distilled water is the easiest
it's 10th it's not really going to have
any issues with your medals but for a
little extra insurance and if it makes
you have a little bit more peace of mind
which is kind of the hard part to get
for beginner watercoolers is always
terrified something is going to break in
their system then going with some sort
of a prefilled or pre-mixed fluid that
has an anti corrosive in there and an
anti growth agent is going to help with
the mixing of metals in your loop now
those are the five that I came up with
but obviously there are much more than
five tips out there when it comes to
water cooling a lot of you guys that
follow me are veterans so if you think I
missed something or you think there was
something that was worth being mentioned
in this video
bring it up in the comments tell me what
it is or better yet take it over to
Twitter and tell me what you think
should be included in the next series of
5 tips for our next video for 5 tips for
beginning water cores is something we'll
kind of keep going and maybe we'll make
a playlist over time so there it is guys
hope you guys enjoyed today's video if
your beginner I hope it's helped to
answer a couple of questions these are
these are tips I came up with because of
the common questions I'm asked I think
these kind of hit most of those anyway
time to go thanks for watching guys and
don't forget I'm giving away three
graphics cards right now
you guys have no idea what I'm talking
about then you're gonna want to check
this video that just I just slid out
right here trust me it's a it's a big
one we're giving away 10 60 at 10:17 to
1080 you don't want to miss this in its
open world wide time ago good luck and
