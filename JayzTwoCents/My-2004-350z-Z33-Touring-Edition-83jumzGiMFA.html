adjustment now you can po noobs without
boning your wallet click the link in the
description to learn more hey what's up
guys James $0.02 here and we are out of
my office because we are doing well I
don't know if I'd call it a car review
because I'm not really reviewing the car
more or less I'm just telling you guys
about it I wasn't even going to do this
video but damn it you guys were bugging
the out of me saying you want to
know something more about my car alright
so here it is this is my 2004 Nissan
350z in America z33 everywhere else in
the world touring model now this thing
is 11 years old so it's got a lot of
things going on with it that you would
expect to the 11 year old car it's got
some rattles it's got some clunks it's
far from perfect but I almost feel like
that gives the car a little bit of
character okay so let's go ahead and
talk about I guess the performance of
the car how I feel about the car my
plans for the car and one of the reasons
why I didn't even want to do this video
was the fact that the car is not where I
want it to be now I probably overpaid
for this car just a little bit in fact
this car you can get them for right
around ten or eleven thousand now in
good shape this one's got one hundred
nine thousand on it had a hundred eight
thousand when I bought it but the fact
is the drivetrain on this car remains
completely untouched it's got the
factory transmission in it the factory
engine the engine is tight compression
is good no trouble codes in fact he even
had all the receipts for the work he's
done for the car which was a huge thing
as a car guy myself the rear end in this
thing is actually a 3.37
rear end or maybe 3.35 I believe rear
end ratio which is fortunately it's it's
not the 373 is like I was hoping it
would have had but it still gets up and
moves pretty nicely now the thing that
people were really disappointed about
when I talked about this car was the
fact that it is an automatic now I
looked and looked and looked and really
considered getting a six-speed manual
there was a day where I would have been
manual or go home bruh but you know what
I'm older now I'm a little bit more lazy
and
to cruise around with my car and traffic
just is a bitch in this area now the
automatic that's in this thing is
actually more of us it's more of a
semi-automatic now it does have a
completely auto mode and then it has a
semi auto mode where you can actually
shift up and shift down and override the
transmission computer and tell it what
to do it's a little bit sluggish it's
not as crisp as I'd like it to be but
fortunately there are mods that we can
do that will actually fix that problem
in the future
now something I should have probably pre
faced with is I'm a car guy I'm a
computer guy I'm a car guy and recently
a bike guy I like automobiles I like all
cars I'm not one of those fanboys that's
going to be like oh god JDM no screw JDM
it's all about volkswagen or it's all
about Euro or it's all about Honda and
or Nats flying around I like cars and I
like the fact that you can do just about
anything you want with a car with the
right amount of money but this car had
everything I wanted it's got the vq35de
engine which is actually a very solid
engine platform very sought-after you
can do a lot of mods to it they perform
really really well when you do even just
basic boosted mods the supercharged are
still in superchargers vortex turbos
they just wake up like crazy and it
doesn't cost a ton of money the other
thing is it is a legitimate rear-wheel
drive vehicle in fact the carbon fiber
drive shaft in this thing is Factory I
didn't even know that all Nissan 350z
scan from the factory with carbon fiber
drive shots that actually kind of blew
my mind considering you know I'm used to
American rear-wheel drive cars that just
had big giant heavy steel drive shafts
we're getting a lightened drive shaft
was an upgrade don't think you can get
much lighter than the carbon fiber in
this thing now let's go and talk about
the wheels here the wheels are a little
bit of a point of conversation and
they're in their own right because they
are xx R which is like a replica brand I
don't know what I'm gonna do with these
I'm looking at some some Enki rims I'm
also looking at some Konig rims but you
know I'm not tracking this car yet this
car has a lot more work it needs to be
done to it before I can take this thing
on to the track so I'm not too worried
about the fact they're a one-piece cast
rim and not forged yet but you might
notice in there we do have a Brembo kit
now the brakes were one thing that I did
upgrade on this car
okay now the brakes on this car are
actually legitimate Brembos that were
factory for this car but not this exact
car now one of the things that made the
350z or the z33 depending on where you
live kind of unique was the fact that it
had a lot of different skews that went
along with it you had the 350z base the
350z roadster which was the convertible
you had the roadster enthusiast you had
the Roadster track no they didn't do a
track car but they did have the track
car they had the touring they had the
Grand Touring there was a ton of
different models but Nissan knew that
people were going to take this car on
the track so they took a lot of the best
features that they felt people would
have done to the car on their own and
made what they called the 350z track
model which came with the Brembo brakes
and it came with better bushing stiffer
bushings in their bigger sway bars and
everything about the car was beefed up
when it came to the suspension and
that's exactly what I'm doing to this
car now is I'm converting this thing to
a cornering monster now going fast as
fun but I'm more about the turns I've
always been about Canyon carving Road
track I live near Willow Springs I like
to road race that's what I'm all about
so I've already started doing the white
line bushing conversions on this thing
the Brembo brake conversion with the
14-inch front rotors and 12-inch rear
rotors anyway this thing stops on a
freaking dime the only down part is
Brembo brakes are not necessarily the
quietest in fact they're floating pad
they kind of flop around in there a
little bit because they're hanging on to
posts so they do have some trade-offs
whether or not you know they do make
some clicks and things and you just got
a kit use that they kind of give the car
character now before we talk about some
of the interior stuff on this car I just
wanted to kind of show one of the
reasons why I picked this car is this
thing survived 11 years without as much
as an aftermarket intake on this car in
fact you go to the different z33 forums
you'll find out that this is one of the
best factory intakes on any car that's
ever been designed in fact putting what
the quote-unquote cold air intake where
you actually relocate the filter right
here and it's an open fill filament
that's in the engine bay has actually
dyno proven to reduce the horsepower on
this particular model
because of the fact that this car is
pulling in air from in front of the
engine bay from behind the bumper this
right here leads right in from behind
the intake of the front of the bumper
and goes right up into there so it
bypasses all of the heat that's
happening right here in the engine bay
so that's one of the reasons why I
haven't switched this out was because it
would have cost me money to take away
horsepower which really doesn't make a
whole lot of sense now unless you got a
long intake that actually relocates the
pipe through here and down behind the
bumper you're not going to gain anything
but I also don't think that's a good
idea considering one you're going to
expose your filter to water and debris
and to changing the filter or putting
new oil on it when it's behind the
bumper is going to be a complete pain in
the ass all right so let's go and take a
look inside the car alright here's the
interior and it's got just as much
character as the rest of the car does
because it's it's not perfect in fact
one of the first things I had to do to
this car was take out most of the
interior plastics because of the fact
that they were scratched cracked it
actually a factory radio in it which was
really good because a lot of the times
you go to these aftermarket radio shops
and they do a hack job on the wiring so
that didn't have to be worried about but
you can see right here in them you know
I'm the as they almost kill coconut
monkey over there we've got some
scratches and things here I have no idea
how this happened but at some point it
did center-console looks pretty good
though actually now the center console
looks good because I took all the
plastics out and refinished it myself i
sanded it all down eye primer Nate i
repainted it granted I wouldn't have
preferred painting the interior but it
was a much better alternative but the
center cubby here they did have like an
aftermarket TV thing back there and as
you can see this is all messed up it's
broken they hacked out as a big hole
right here with hot glue everywhere so
I've got to replace this cubby
compartment unfortunately because that's
one of the first things people destroy
on the interiors that piece is like a
hundred bucks by itself and usually it's
just a scratched up as anything else but
I did put in a Kenwood receiver here
this is the d/dx 372 BT nothing
expensive it's all touchscreen it does
play DVDs but I didn't hook up the
parking wire because I have no desire to
watch movies in this thing so it can't
movies right now but it could I guess
hooked up that wire I just wanted
something that filled in the double din
looked nice and was touchscreen but
other than that everything inside works
and that was the most important thing
seat heaters which is probably kind of
dumb look at the 57 Chevy that just
drove in actually that's worth looking
at yeah that's nice
see like I said I'm a car guy I like all
automobiles even this camera here this
is badass this lady right here she's got
it going on uh but you know with
everything in here works that even has
leather seat or leather heated seats
because we all know in Southern
California heated seats are a must but
it does have one of the dumbest cup
holder things I think I've ever seen
right here he's got his lab in there
with and that's awesome the dogs like do
you think American bro now the only real
aftermarket part on this car is the HKS
style exhaust pretty much it's an HK as
true dual exhaust that's a knockoff
because it doesn't have HKS stamped on
it anywhere but it's pretty much exactly
the same I want to step further and I
had the resonators removed and I kind of
regret that a little bit because it did
change the exhaust note makes it a lot
more raspy than I like so I'm actually
going to be putting in an nvidia Gemini
dual exhaust on this thing and no that's
not Nvidia like the graphics card its
Nvidia we're going to be doing that soon
actually so I looked at this video as
being more or less kind of a video
before the car is done so I decided to
do it that way I had something to look
back on when the car is done in the next
year or two and can say well the car has
come a long way so with that let's go
ahead and start up the car and let's go
for a ride
now if I said this car wasn't a rough
ride that would be a complete lie with
the polyurethane bushings going in it's
got Megan Racing coil overs the car is
definitely a little bit of a harsher
ride especially with a 32-point
adjustment on there but I like to keep
things nice and stiff not to mention the
car is a lot of fun to drive now I think
overall Nissan did a fantastic job with
this car I've had a lot of fun cars in
the past in fact I had a 92 z28 that was
completely track ready it was all custom
suspension and I had a 95 G SX turbo -
klipse but this car from the factory
seemed to have pretty much everything I
wanted in a car already done to it you
know with the factory strut brace in the
front strep races in the rear the
massive roll bars on this thing
the Tirra Tirra the steering is very
tight everything about this car was
clearly built for handling and I think
it does a fantastic job now the steering
wheel is a little bit stiff at times
they've got speed sensitive steering in
these cars actually where the faster you
go they stiffen up more so that you
don't end up over steering or really
overworking the wheel but at lower
speeds it is kind of hard to turn
actually I recently hurt my right arm
and it made it difficult to actually
drive this car because of how hard it is
to turn the wheel at slower speeds I
mean I think Nissan new ultimately that
people were going to be using this
particular car for a lot of like
days and things like that and so they
just built a car that I think they've
ever won an amazing starting platform
for building a car that's going to be
all-purpose street strip and road racing
or I admit doing the Brembos was
probably the best thing I ever did
because you never know when you have to
stop on a dime
you can't deny though the fact that the
z33 and the vq35de motor and this
platform has just been extremely popular
they built upon it with the 370z but of
course the 370z is much more expensive
but I'm our kit parts for this thing are
abundant there's just tons and tons of
things you can do to these cars
supercharged twin turbos twin screw
chargers you just anything you want to
do to these cars you can and they're
fairly inexpensive to work on now the
initial costs on the car about 10 grand
it's not cheap it's definitely not you
know a person that's on a very fixed
incomes type of hobby but the fact that
this car for about $15,000 ten ten
thousand for the price of the car five
thousand put into the car you would have
a car that would be so much fun to drive
you know this is my weekend car but I
find myself driving it more and more so
unless I want to rack up the miles I
better just start kind of chilling a
little bit but this is an absolute blast
to drive I was a little worried when I
first bought the car that I might have
made a mistake because I'm usually an
American muscle car kind of guy but the
more I think about it now the more I
drive the car I have zero regrets
whatsoever all right well you guys want
to know more about my car I just went
ahead and threw together this little
bonus video I don't even know how good
it's going to turn out but anyway it's
time to get out of here have some fun
burn little more fuel so we'll see you
next time
