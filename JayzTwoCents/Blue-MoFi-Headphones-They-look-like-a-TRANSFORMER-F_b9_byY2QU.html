cents here and if you're a streamer an
aspiring streamer or you watch streamers
you more than likely have heard of Blue
Microphones they make the very popular
mics like the blue snowball and the blue
Yeti and I actually started my channel
with a blue Yeti microphone
well blue microphones is just going by
blue now because they are making more
than just microphones they are now
entering into the well they've done this
a while ago this is a little bit late on
this review so I'm not I know this isn't
just happening but anyway they've
transitioned into also making audiophile
grade headphones like the Mophie right
here Mophie multi I know see why that
would be a wife I'm gonna call this
multi multi but anyway the MOFA here is
probably unlike any other headphone you
have ever seen you're definitely gonna
want to check this out especially if you
love your music and you want to take it
on the go with you because there's some
features in this that are not found in a
lot of headsets and it's something you
should probably take a look at so don't
go anywhere
the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro
from Coolermaster combines modularity
with creativity giving you the freedom
to build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description now on the surface they look
a lot like an aviation headset or
headphones but I want to point out real
quick cuz I know a lot of people are
gonna ask this is not a head set this is
headphones this is made for audio this
is made for music this is not a gaming
headset so no there is no mic jack on it
there is no place to add a mic unless
you put something like a mock mic on it
I have no idea if it works with Razer
surround because I'm not going to test
it with Razer surround this is all about
music and taking your music with you and
taking any device that you plug these
into and creating a better listening
experience now I started to drop here
the chord we're going to take a look at
this first some of the accessories that
come with it this is a 1.2 meter Apple
certified cord so you have all of your
controls on here that do work on Apple
devices you know play pause volume up
volume down and it is keyed on one end
to work specifically with well you see
it's a really long plug because it goes
up right there like that to plug in
the headphones so it is a removable
cable now the reason why it's a
removable cable is because some of the
other accessories that come in the box
are gonna make this so that this is
compatible with a lot of different types
of use scenarios if you will
now I've had these for a while and I've
listened to these quite a bit
it took me a long time to get to this
review but I can tell you now that I
have used these quite a bit to where I'm
comfortable and telling you about my
experience with them now it comes with a
really long three meter cable or
approximately near ten feet that you can
use to hook up to your computer or
another amplifier or stereo or whatever
it also includes your adapter to a
quarter inch jack so that you can use
this with your you know nice and restore
a nice high-end receiver or any receiver
that you want also has your airplane
adapter here so you can listen to these
on the go in the airplane and then it
comes with pretty much a standard micro
USB charging cable with the charging
brick now why would you need to charge
this nope it's not Wireless that was
kind of the first go-to when I saw that
these had a charger and stuff when I
first saw them at CES I thought that
maybe these were convertible to like
bluetooth well no they have they
actually have their own built-in
amplifier now these are designed to
actually take the signal coming in to
them and add a amplification to them so
that you get cleaner richer base crisp
highs and you don't have to crank your
portable device in order to get good
volume out of these
now speaking of cranking the device they
are 42 ohms so they're not incredibly
power demanding when it comes to the ohm
rating but they are you know things like
iPods and iPhones and Android devices
they're not really made to drive nice
high-end headphones because they are
they are very low-power devices so this
thing has its own amplifier in there so
it'll take that raw signal coming out of
your your device that's sending your
music and it's gonna make it sound
amazing but it's also gonna make things
on rehome receivers your computer maybe
a home theater system sound that much
better as well now I've got a lot of
headphones in here that I've compared
these to including other studio-grade
headphones and I have to say that the
bass on these if you're looking for
clean punchy bass nut-nut beats by dre
level of bass that's just stupid but
clean
bass like jazz and a bass drum and a
bass guitar really recreate that sound
and just make it sound natural
these are definitely capable of doing
that and they also have a knob right
here which is the same place where the
plug goes where you can control either
turn the EQ or the amp off and then you
can turn the amp on and on Plus which is
gonna add even more bass to that low end
frequency range if that's what you want
if you're listening into rap or other
pop or other music that has a lot of
bass in it then you can tune these to be
pretty much beats by dre killers when it
comes to being super clear and a ton of
bass now one of the ways of the cheves
that level of bass is the fact that they
are closed back and you've probably
already seen it has got probably the
biggest ear cups I have ever seen made
out of memory foam and leather they are
extremely soft they are extremely
form-fitting and they are just plush as
can freakin be I have never worn a set
of headphones that have this much
comfort around the ear now undoubtedly
you probably noticed this looks more
representative of something out of the
Terminator movie or something out of the
future then you know being audio
headphones but that's because they've
gone with this really sort of mechanical
look here where they've they've stepped
away from the traditional headband with
a spring and a you know clicky slider
for your ear adjustment where everything
on here is hinged well start with the
headband the headband is hinged as you
can see in two different places right
here on either side of the adjustment
where you can adjust the tension on the
headband spring they're also hinged
right here where they meet just above
your ear so you can see as I separate
that they are always going to become
form-fitting to where the ear cups are
facing straight up and down like they're
supposed to be it's not gonna be like
other earphones where they when they get
wide they might start to camber out like
a like a you know stance nation with a
car no they they stay pretty much
straight and you don't have to worry
about going up and down with them or
having any swivel on the ear cups like a
lot of other manufacturers do making
these much more robust and a lot safer
to travel with without fear of breaking
them now in terms of getting the height
set right because I don't slide up and
down they have a separate hinge as you
can see right here that actually goes up
and down like this so you can see if
you've
you've got like the world's biggest head
I mean you see if you've got the world's
biggest head you can wear these so it
really doesn't matter how big or small
your head is yep that one then these are
going to fit you because you can pretty
much set these up however you want them
to be now in terms of comfort on the
headband it uses the same leather in the
same memory foam found down here on the
ear cups up here on the top now these
headphones also feature an auto off
function where even if the physical knob
is turned to on if it's not receiving a
signal then it's gonna turn itself off
to save the battery charging time takes
a couple of hours through a standard
microUSB in the charging brick but you
can also charge it off of battery packs
or your laptop or your computer in fact
that's how I've been charging it rather
than using the ones that were supplied
because I've got enough chargers
floating around this house as it is but
in terms of sound I'm gonna tell you
right now that it definitely makes
things sound great now even if the
amplifier dies do you still get your
sound as if you had been plugged into
any other 42 ohm resistance headset or
head acupoint head some so used to doing
headsets it's not like if the amplifier
dies or the battery dies that you can't
listen to them anymore it's gonna sound
the same as if you plugged in any other
headphones straight to your phone and
the phone is gonna be powering this and
considering they're 42 ohms it's not a
not a super low resistance but it's not
a lot either so your phone can drive
them and even through just the raw input
through the phone through the powered
signal through the phone it sounds
really really good clarity is what
really comes to mind when I'm listening
to these and yeah they've got some punch
in the bass and the mid range is also
really clear but the highs are crystal
they're super crystal vocals sound very
lifelike they're they reproduce all the
range in someone's singing voice whether
they be a like a baritone or a tenor
they sound really really lifelike that's
the best way to put it but it doesn't
add any funky EQ or any you know
surround or anything like that it's just
250 millimeter drivers in a closed back
very sealed off ear cup or ear can
that's gonna make your listening
experience just that much better they're
designed to make your device sound
better and I think they're actually
achieving that the only complaint I have
because
thing is perfect as far as I'm concerned
is regardless of how much I try and
adjust the resistance dial on the top
here how it says increase and decrease
it has to do with the you know the
tension on the you know when you widen
this out they pinch the ever living crap
out of my head and I think that might be
because maybe I just I mean I've tried
them out a lot but I have not used these
you know daily I think if I was to set
these you know say on the box or
something like let's say I did this with
them and just let them sit there for
awhile I think they might loosen up a
little bit but they start to really
squeeze tight on my head and I've got a
fairly narrow head so if you've got a
round head then this is probably gonna
pinch the ever-loving crap out of you in
the beginning but I've talked to other
people who own these and they say that
they do loosen up the spring up here
does loosen up a little bit over time
and they stop squeezing so bad but I
know I have to try a lot of different
headsets and things like for instance
I've got the g.skill the new g.skill
gaming headset over there so that's
what's hooked up right now and and I use
these more often they probably wouldn't
squeeze my head as much but that's
something I'm dealing with so it was
worth at least mentioning it out there
so that's all for today on the blue
Mophie headphones and they really take
your music and give you a better
listening experience and that's what
they're designed to do and they're
designed to do it at an affordable
audiophile level so what that means to
you may be different than what it means
to me in other people so you're just
gonna have to try and find these
somewhere and listen to them before you
buy but if you are interested in
checking out pricing and stuff on this
you can see a link down the description
and a link e to Amazon which is also
gonna be linking to my Amazon affiliate

that is fully that's fully there for you
to use if you don't want to that is okay
as well but they come in at about three
hundred and fifty bucks
