transference
you can't call raccoons Coons that's
race I see that she's what's wrong with
you a Coon's all right that's gonna be
this crap on the watch page that's what
like it let's just take you now I just
hang out what's up Matt is lots of
people in here already
Wow hopefully the audio I'm gonna touch
the mic guys I apologize now okay
hopefully the audio and stuff is okay we
literally like impromptu set this up
last second I think the audios good
because I was having problems when I was
doing the LAN show with Linus
but yeah what's up guys so it is Intel
launch day today oh boy oh boy oh boy oh
boy
yeah I'm pulling up Twitter and all that
so okay funny story I'm sure a lot of
you guys know this already because of
Paul's vlog so Intel just like
completely dropped the ball on the
actual availability of these CPUs now I
got a text from my wife that my CPU
actually arrived about 20 minutes ago at
the house
problem is I'm here at the studio you
know so obviously the reviews on my end
are not going to hit the embargo which
was four hours ago
so Linus already put one up apparently
so I don't know I just want to talk
about a few things here oh I should go
get the we'll get this to x-29 strict
box I wanted to open up grab a knife too
so I just want to do a little bit of a
Q&amp;amp;A with you guys if the chat slows down
at all I guess it never will delay the
audio via the audio and the camera are
coming through is the same feed I can't
delay it well i'ma say
out of sync audio well guess what I
can't do about it I can't even hear
neither audio here
you look like turn the main volume down
oh well I want to hear up how far I
think is get your hands off volumes
right here right whoa
I okay we've got it playing oh I bet you
it's playing over there hold on all
right
Nick doesn't know he's doing I'll bang
guys I knew I should have known better
he right over to the computer was like
and what do I do
my head
Adam worked things
I think so yes huh yes all right so I
learned something just now when you have
when you have the which McCall open
because I had the color corrector going
because member we're shooting on this is
an F s5 right here and it does not come
out of the camera color graded that's
why the color looks kind of weird so we
had to grade it over there on the stream
machine the problem is that when I had
the grading window open the audio was
playing too and I had that machine muted
so we can't hear it gotcha so that
should be better everyone says your fly
is open but oh oh my Wow that's worth it
how to start off my wings on the right
foot meme that I expect there to be
tweets on that Jay your crack is I'm at
least my my what my we'll just save my
expletive John hanging out I find out
see any pictures yet on Twitter I'm
gonna be disappointed
you guys are usually pretty fast at that
next time sexy J fly is open D synched
are we better now D synced again stop I
want you touching things I don't
understand why it's out of sync honestly
because the audio and the video are
coming through the HDMI cable together
yeah idea not nuts okay some people are
saying synced some people were saying
out of saying let me refresh the stream
let's this is just like Tech Talk but
only with better better like
it looks better than Tech Talk okay but
it still has the same quality of Tech
Talk
you might be able to get an audio in the
video or coming HDMI cable together
yeah it's playing twice you know is that
okay you entertain them
oh go you keep them entertained while I
go over there look guys my fly is back
up he good okay so how do I keep you
guys in a contained to the stairs camera
do it or I can have a staring contest I
can move this box here you guys take a
look at it but Jays gonna unbox this I
don't get to unbox it I can look at it
though oh wait it's a Velcro door we can
take a peek won't you look at that the
other program opened that's like check
the volume mixer pick your nose I won't
pick it but you know uh I got there was
something up in uh
yeah yeah that's Ecklie
okay
there was something up
there was something open they're saying
sync was good wait
now I'll have to wait till after the
club cuz I could hear it playing twice
no it's still doing a loop
what happened things happened they say
Jason is to blame the elgato so we're
gonna blame me el gato it's not playing
twice on the stream so ignore it fix
we're good we're good there you go well
I know what's happening here
what happened things happen it's playing
here too
right yes oh I fix did you fix I fix
something did something 24 hours later
might not have ever actually been an
audio audio problem because we had to
browser we had two tabs open with it
playing twice GT okay anyway um hi hi
this is like the first actual attempt at
a professional stream with me no not
with you just oh I mean what that
because other streams I did up there
with just webcam sitting at the desk
right yeah but here I am trying to do
this with like should we take a picture
what this looks like and put it up on
Twitter real quick yeah I mean this is
like ridiculously overkill like not even
necessary but we like doing unnecessary
overkill e things here pick up the lift
but no there what a thing
it's working now right who's still
slightly out of sync though okay except
take a picture my gun cream
yeah keep it there oh I this is bugging
me now the audio is about 200 maybe 150
milliseconds before the video
which I still understand considering
they're coming across in the same stream
like the audio and the video are going
through the HDMI cable to the elgato
capture card OBS is capturing what the
elgato because the elgato turns into a
video display device okay so OBS is
somehow like processing the audio and
the video differently is it because
we're set that to what 30 frames so that
once pic recording at 60 no okay they're
both at 30 I turned off 60 on that but
that wouldn't matter they should be the
same Hertz reading just to do it
see he's saying just do a 200
millisecond delay but they're coming
across as two differents trio same
streams let me see if I can once again
here is once we figure the formula we
just have to like screenshot everything
so if you remember the settings first
attempt at professional stream and we're
working out the bugs but that's okay
mike is in fan yes we know the mic isn't
frame we put it there on purpose to know
you guys because the audio the audio
comes across is video capture device so
join
see the video capture device and an
audio device and saying yeah there's one
stream I can't I can't separate them
that make sense it's kind of funny
because this works one Jerry I used it
at the house with dirt grocery now
announcing I have horrible ideas yeah
well I thought about can you do like a
XLR mic jack adapter and just have the
mic go straight to that like the you
know gato is like the problems you
bouncers constantly like Cheney how much
is sometimes a second so you literally
touch it
hi to the cook and a monkey oh hi hi
guys
rise and use a different program slow
mode for Chaz off this isn't twitch but
is there a slow mode on here okay it's
okay now it works
big laptops yeah this is a thick laptop
it is a thick laptop thick no I said
thick th I see to make our scale look
normal I get it it's working it's fine
it's fixed everyone say it's perfect now
yeah it's good that was us
I'm pretty sure they're just saying it's
good so that will just continue on see
look it's fixed it's fine get on with it
okay it worked
here's what I did I added a 200
millisecond delay okay to the video
stream but the video stream and the
audio stream were together so unless
it's like splitting out the audio when I
go into the audio mixer mm-hmm I think
we're good now so 200 millisecond delay
we're good we're only 23 minutes late
that's okay I said ten o'clock ish ish
yeah that's why you have to a dish it's
a safety feature for both you and your
turn it off and on again okay so let's
check Twitter I want us this guy to be
open fly pictures I'm totally gonna be
disappointed if there's not please get a
smaller laptop there it is
oh look the travelers May coming up well
played all right well played that was
uzp customs j-just flashing 2200 viewers
from his wormhole the audio lag come
from the decoding re-encoding when using
some capture female seconds difference
can create this i understand how my
question my point is that when they're
coming across in the same stream because
what's happening is the elgato it's
splitting the video in the audio okay
but it but it sends it to OBS in a
single stream so it's not like OBS sees
them independently anyway it doesn't
really matter we can talk now
today is X 299 launch day and I don't
think anyone's surprised about that
because the 19th was the embargo the
only problem is Intel didn't actually
send CPUs until until no they said them
Friday okay they arrived today well had
Linus get his well Linus was fortunate
enough to be able to go to the June 6th
workshop that asu's hosted which was a
it was a it was a just Intel workshop we
get to be hands on with the stuff talk
to the engine Intel engineers get your
questions answered and because we've
just gotten back from Computex and we
had work to do I wasn't gonna get on
another plane and go back to San
Francisco so the those that went were
handed a CPU in person now to be fair to
Intel they did tell me like you really
should try and go we will be handing out
CPUs there yeah and my answer to that
was I can't go you have your birthday
you're gonna send
to us right and they're like yes
eventually Oh as a catch
yeah so it was one of those but anyway
I'll move this over as you guys could
probably expect did I just unplug I just
implode something no you just moved the
power strip and kicking all the cables
okay
as you guys would expect the motherboard
started arriving a couple weeks I've got
a week and a half ago yeah and I was
like that that's cool but I like it
there's anything I can put in there we
have the msi board here too don't we
yeah we did I'll grab that ooh oh yeah
this board right here I think I'm gonna
try out first I really like the
aesthetics of it it's the prime X 299
deluxe from Asus Asus always seems to
launch their deluxe line first before
the ROG stuff RG stuff oh it seems to
come later I would like to check out the
new rampage that's for sure at the
antennas on that one this one clearly is
straight time open that somewhere where
my address isn't going to be like all in
full view um also do think it's
important to point out there are no
sponsors for this stream so these are
not sponsored product placements I think
like that this is just I literally had
nothing to put up on launch day so I
figured we talked about it there's
always the big question - especially
right now X - 99 or thread Ripper now
the answer to that still is thread
rippers still needs to be seen we still
need to get thread Ripper in our hands
obviously push the video wait what
push the video of a TV up what are you
talking about here I'm curious J push
the video to a TV off screen that you
can use like a teleprompter cleaner set
we like our set the way it is and I
actually have a teleprompter but we just
don't use it and it's not a TV either we
don't use oh it's on over here maybe
this I don't know I don't know how do
you open this box uh if you guys have
been following my channel long and if
you know I'm really bad at unboxings
like I don't know how to open things
seriously
anyhow I there's no flap there's no
flappy flap like I think this was open
it right here how you do it okay weird
saying oh you've already seen it this is
the replacement he does this we get
something any he goes oh it's like he's
never seen I was a big fan of this boy
it's the second one we've received
remember the first one's bad they were
like don't use it it might blow up your
 so I think you've seen it I didn't
see that we have seen it it's on my
dining room table okay then I have seen
exactly giving you that look right now
um yeah so we have it x2 99 gaming Pro
carbon and then we have the deluxe I
think I'm gonna try out the deluxe first
though this is their little like they
call it a one sheet basically just a
rundown of features in terms of
aesthetic so I think that the deluxe is
gonna win for my opinion okay so let's
talk about this I started to mention
this I can go thread Ripper versus X 299
it should go without saying we got to
get our hands on both before we can
really determine any sort of clear
winner but my disappointments with Intel
are still very very strong
I think the disappointments with Intel
are strong amongst everybody especially
the KD Lake X CPUs which are just like
literally the stupidest concept ever why
you would take a mainstream CPU and plop
it on to a next 299 bored and disabled
so many features which would be
beneficial if they just left them on
mainstream is absolutely asinine and no
reason for that to even exist so that's
a pro Carbon board you guys think that
and here is very black in targeting the
prime next 299 deluxe is both ei TX
usually the there this is like yeah it's
just standard ATX that's cool this is
heavier than that one I expected this
one to be heavier I suspect about the
one to be lighter
no it's heavier
it's heavier tree yeah that is heavier
yeah which is kind of strange now I
don't know if the carbon fiber on here
is a real carbon fiber let's see it
doesn't really look like it that just
looks like plastic carbon fiber ish its
carbon fiber s s what we'll call it
okay so x-29 versus thread ripper to
illogical asking i'm going to be doing a
video actually at the end of this stream
about why I haven't been using my 1,800
X system because unfortunately the
internet being the internet the way it
is everyone likes to form their own
conclusions rather than actually going
to the source to ask these questions and
so I think it's something that needs to
be said because we're still kind of we
still have like temporary setups here
for RPC situations like you're you don't
even have a working desktop right now no
and my desktop was something that was I
just wanted to see what that Cougar case
was like and I just end up throwing all
of my x99 junk in there I say junk but
my xi9 stuff in there and I just kept it
together it's got one one terabyte SSD
in there and that's it I've been working
off of that one terabyte and it's about
full which really sucks we we should get
some hard drives cuz I find a great deal
on terabytes yeah so hey this is like
really stabby like I keep stabbing right
there really shot sharp inside yeah
oh I gotta handle this born I'm being
stabbed so that's the cart pro carbon
and that's the deluxe now the deluxe is
pretty neat because I like the way that
they implemented the RGB on this now RGB
right I think I think we're kind of
reaching the end of the RGB craze where
companies are realizing like okay we
don't have to make these crazy ass super
bright in a new phase flamboyant systems
they just now are starting to kind of
use these subtle accents now so as you
can see all right you can see by the box
hold up the motherboard this is RGB
right here and then under here and
that's it and it looks like it's a like
a strip so you can kind of get some
color fading effect in there
something else it's also important to
note once I'm married finished it so
like when it's off
it looks married yeah it's a reflective
you know kind of a mirror image they're
both wireless that's nice to see
let's see the pro carbon has four PCI
Express ports well looks like we've got
at least look at the back we've got to
16 X 2 8 X and a 2 2 X or maybe 4 X I'm
sorry - 4 X so that's not bad in terms
of connectivity the problem with like
the Z 270 boards in my opinion was when
Nvidia had decided we're no longer going
to officially support 3 and 4 Way SLI a
lot of this lot of these metaphor
motherboard manufacturers started saving
money by putting less PCI Express
expansion slots on their motherboards
because I just figured like well we
don't need as many now there's not as
many GPUs that can go into motherboard
so you start seeing motherboards with
only like 2 PCI Express 16x no 8x and
maybe a couple 4x like these guys the
problem with that was people still use a
lot of expansion cards for things like
raid controllers sound cards capture
cards and it dramatically affected what
you could actually install in it because
as you can see right here right this is
overlapped by GPU and so put a GPU in
here you can't use that you can't use
that like that this is not usable at all
if you're using a dual slot GPU in this
top slot but you can still you could
still fit the m2 at least this one
doesn't look like it hasn't ended up -
of course they do they I think this one
has an adapter though ok like this one's
got 2 m dot 2 s that lay flat right here
I believe one of these might be stacked
and I was screwed ever open that I
believe this is stacked 1 here because
they were like touting about like you
could fit two on top of each other and
I'm like but a lot would you want to
stack the heat anyway uh there's at
least two on the board on this one but I
believe this one also has an expansion
slot to put them check inside the
motherboard box on the accessories
I still prefer to use em - in a PCI
Express card if I can this one right
here it stands straight up and then it's
got a bracket that screws down right
there so there's one right there
because Asus is like pretty big on
connectivity so I would be shocked if
they only did one yeah that's the fan
expansion card so Asus includes usually
these fan expansion headers so you get
an extra one two three four pwm
controlled fan headers which are powered
by molex and has this plug that will
connect to the motherboard they give you
a Thunderbolt three uhm that's cool so
included with the deluxe Thunderbolt 3
interface card it's also USB 3.1 type-a
and a mini DisplayPort
in huh so this can be like a capture try
me thunder DisplayPort or may display
port in is nice so again this would end
up going in one of these antennas yeah
so it ends up going like one of these
slots like this but see this this can't
even go in that so it has to go into one
of these I'm good that is only 2x but
yep that's cool
smoke weed everyday I feel sorry for
your brain I smoked mid only when I play
csgo though oh I get a smoke mid smoke
mid everyday yeah what else comes in
there apart from the antenna to get like
the nestled I get an ROV at the library
but it's still like not a fancy thing
it's just like bare-bones it's a
three-way bridge wait a minute is it why
are they including a 3-way bridge they
want you to go I guess it's for those
folks who just still want to do 3-way
benchmarking because that's about all
that it'll work with yeah that's the
stand the MT like I've shown you right
here so looks like it's only got one
MDOT to spy on anything on the back
there's a two-way bridge
nope nothing on the back cables in tell
us a joke who agrees you know what the
internet is so quick to like jump she
just beat anyone up for any reason under
pop cable right DisplayPort Thunderbolt
evil there and the rest are like you're
cool starter cables that's neat Pete
look over here that was the bridge
that's how this is rich this oh the fan
expend ex-offender alright let's see
what comes in the msi i'm going to be
doing more motherboard like overviews i
don't know how you guys interested in
the motherboard overview stuff like at
all because i feel like i want to show
it powered on and show the bios and
stuff i'm asked that's my personal
opinion on the matter
i like seeing it this one's scratched
did someone scratched it when they were
like testing it because these boards
were hand tested before being sent
oh it's kinda nice but yeah it's scratch
right there and sent the bitches did i
go back
all right let's see what comes with the
other side I'm sitting on top of an
anti-static bag oh my god the Internet's
no this is mine okay pull out right here
so where we got here we've guts via
replacement panels as you can see right
there they've got gold and silver in
here because these panels are meant to
be able to be popped off and you can
replace it with a different one style
they sent me that other box that has my
name like imprinted on them they sent it
to like all the tech youtubers which is
pretty neat but I guess the idea there
is to show that you can get these
customized I don't know if they sell
blank so they all stick MSI on it is a
two-way bridge can you get a
carbon-fiber playing in here or redone
carpet I mean I kind of would have liked
the carbon fiber with your name on with
my name on it yeah I don't like I don't
think MSI's branding looks very good
like gaming Pro it's $2.99 MSI I mean I
do boost this board are you know boosts
my PS how much psi does your audio run
okay so you got your i/o shield cover in
the back looks like these are RGB fans
or lighting headers and then antennas
these all come in a nifty bag how many
people actually keep these bags when
they're done see I'm not set right
especially I felt like that was a silly
question once I posed it so yeah that
know a whole lot comes in the box for
MSI he put that back in the bag work
work in the bird who else
fancies kung pao chicken wall studies oh
I love kung pao chicken little info like
General Tso's chicken get rise in for
the win you know you know my biggest
issue I think regarding rise in being so
good
is all the AMD fanboys finally had like
a drum to beat on mmm and they are
beating the out of that drum I wish
more people were just tech enthusiasts
and actually cared about the tech more
than they did about their favorite brand
but I don't think that's ever going to
happen because that's that would have to
apply to all things in life and
it's never gonna hey you got your
fanboys of everything down to any hobby
if it's a hobby
you're gonna have fun but people are
going to they're just gonna bang on beat
that out of their drum until
everyone's sick and tired of it true
keep up the good work guys thank you sir
hey center singer cuz I know you're like
really upset when it's not centered okay
my bad hey J hard work connects did an
auto overclocking roundup can you do a
comparison is you 270 at X - 9 X 299 is
going to take some mature I'll wait
until I'm thinking that sorry I kind of
like and hate the sound of electronics
crinkling bags crinkling at the same
time I'm sorry like I know I like it
because it's like ooh that means new
stuff but I hate it cuz it's just like
it's kind of like when you're at the
movies you got that guy that's just like
I want to eat my M&amp;amp;Ms one at a time is
that crinkle crinkle is this like chunk
crinkle crinkle crinkle crinkle crinkle
crinkle and then the guys like just sits
there with his hand in the bag between
bites he's just like that's for just
kind of pour it out it's like
eat your candy already yeah okay anyway
I saw I didn't see the roundup video I
saw the he posted one but I didn't watch
it
x-29 is gonna take some time to mature
just like Rison is just now kind of
let's look anything like senator matured
yeah but the problem is you've got these
rushed launches and AMD was a rush to
launch mmm and now Intel is a rush to
launch and when you get these rush
launches guess who gets to be the beta
testers yeah exactly
took the consumer because the beta
tester yeah looking that may be left of
you it locks the blue bear see we do
that okay move laptop final move the
laptop show you yeah
moves a lot higher Stan hey can I get a
happy birthday
have everybody striker um please talk
about sound cards and Dax Jun babies for
the win or in this way
there we go right there mm-hmm okay tell
me what dear this is a phrase right here
Kody hood hey Ken I'm gonna leave it
right here just so that it bugs the
out of you
that's the kind of guy I am
x4 20 is better Russian launches let's
see I'm gonna go in here and I'm going
to see what I can do
about the chat oh I forgot
super chat let's do this okay ray gun
ray gun coconut monkey MVP here need
more Jays fly open that was pretty funny
that was audio blocked payback wat
adblock payback three bucks thanks from
good content thank you sir Andrew
Farriss says Jay bit what Kyle did a
review today on deleted 77 40 K and got
the chip up to five point three
gigahertz are we gonna see this kind of
room on deleted X $2.99 chips the Bauer
did a very good video deleting a rise in
chip which is soldered like he showed
how you could heat it up get to a
certain temperature and the solder will
pop off and then shows as possible
he also highly does not recommend
deleting X $2.99 chips
I'm not going to delete it and the only
reason Kyle even did a deleted review
was because gigabyte gave him the chip
which was already deleted so he had no
choice but to go with it so I think that
was this one that seems he's like well I
got it might as well go with it I have
no plans to do deleting videos
Jonathan green says for everyone's
favorite monkey a heart thanks heart the
may display port on the Thunderbolt is
probably for video / Thunderbolt 3 not
to capture things um well it's
Thunderbolt in to the PC right so I'm
trying to figure out like why you would
need Thunderbolt coming into your PC if
you're not capturing it in some way
sketchy W use that for like high-speed
external drives no Thunderbolt alright
you for thunderbolt yeah I'm talking
about the mini DisplayPort
the mini DisplayPort in on the
Thunderbolt card is probably for video /
Thunderbolt 3 not to capture
hmm so yeah interesting
I've to look into that I've never played
around with a card like that so might in
tech Titan X Maxwell or GT X 1080 the
Titan X was like marginally faster than
1080 but the 1080 is way cooler quieter
and more power efficient so I would go
to 1080 keep up the good work thank you
thanks for making cool videos scar scar
cheer gaming thank you okay so what if I
do this that what if I do like that
that's not kind of hard to read this is
a shitty TN panel James Fox gives us all
kinds of Hearts think different slot
thickness for video cards on SLI bridge
adapter
well they it wasn't yeah I mean it
wasn't spaced the same that's pretty
typical they'll usually space card 1 and
2 out farther apart and then 2 &amp;amp; 3 were
together 2 &amp;amp; 3 were sandwiched yeah
there was no 4 there's no 4 before Way
SLI bridge and neither of those boxes
know what CPUs do you have oh my god I
know how much time I've got to slot is
under heatsink yeah I thought that there
was why not to look at it
hi Jays I'm a huge fan I've learned so
much from you you're welcome but it
scrolled away I'm sorry can i sli two
different brands of it 1080 absolutely
as long as you get one set okay so
here's the problem with like some of the
1080 s right if you get like a founders
card and you want to sli to 1080i or
1080p anders card let's say it's taller
they're not going to line up and you get
the full benefit of SLI you have to use
the HB bridge which is a rigid bridge so
they're not going to meet up they're
going to match so you have to use like
to flex bridges which is better than not
but I would just recommend trying to get
the same card if you can poseidon versus
lightning versus kingdon I don't have a
kingpin you know the Lightning right you
have an Arctic storm and I'm a lightning
either but I have an Arctic storm which
is the zotac ant extreme on water
essentially the Poseidon so far I mean
that's the fastest card
I reviewed yet in terms of I mean it's
probably hand-picked let's just say that
it's probably hand-picked but I would
love to get my hands on another Poseidon
even temporarily just to see like the
retail to see if it's the same level of
overclocking ability be I mean it came
to me like a sealed box it was
completely sealed up right it doesn't
look like it had signs but ever being
used like right you look brand yeah it
did like a retail package it doesn't
think it had ever been used in any way I
open up the X M&amp;amp;Ms hi x9i and I get this
sheet right and this one doesn't have it
but the other one we had especially with
their GPUs will actually show like
product tested the name of the guy that
tested it which benchmark he tested it
with like they're verifying that the
damn thing works before they send it but
that also tells me that they know how
well it's going to perform so how do I
know they didn't just grab one that
performs really well and go here give
him this one good it's going to look
really good on video uh yeah but it
happens every time because the silicon
lottery is still in effect so I'll do a
review of card that's retail or sent by
manufacturer or whatever and then
someone inevitably will email me and be
like you're full of mine didn't go
as far and it's like you're there's no
guarantees and overclocking you're
guaranteed the speed the box says and
that's it mmm maker J recommendations
for car speakers amps head units and
subs uh head units I'm too far removed
from that just well my Bluetooth I have
a sub word for heaven to put in rockford
fosgate
yeah rockford fosgate was like the
back when i was doing but haven't i
haven't actually been i used to work in
car audio but i haven't been in that
scene since 2001 so that's really far
removed like we used to build our DB
drag competition systems with Memphis
audio Memphis audio Baghdad any of them
Memphis audio back then was like a
higher mid-ranged here but I don't think
they stayed there like Eclipse was like
top-of-the-line decks back then but I
don't think a clip still has the same
prestige that it did back then gotcha so
I have no idea who's like who was a who
of who now you know JL Audio was like
cheap back then but now I hear jails
like good stuff so I don't know did you
block the ceiling windows uh yeah nope
we actually have a guy coming in this
week
it was actually requested by Jonathan
Morrison because he's got several units
in this building too that they're
getting they're getting quotes for
motorized shutters up there so that we
can use we can shut them when we want
them shut and open them when we want
them there's times the skylight is great
but there's times it just wrecks what
we're trying to do see how it feels
when you try and read this yes
impossible right hold on oh wait what is
it ah there you go what is the next trip
tradeshow PS Cape of good work the next
trade show we go to you probably won't
be until like that's not even a trade
show but it probably PDX this fall we
next actual like official trade show
would be CES J what would you choose it
is seven twenty six hundred and FX 6300
I would suggest saving your money and
buying something newer honestly if
you're trying to scroll so that we can
read every single one you're insane no
because that's what it looks like you're
trying to do this commandeer Lake okay
which main board manufacturer has the
best utility software like Asus probe or
MSI gaming app command center X boost um
MSI is software's a bit bloaty
like you have to install three pieces of
software to get it all to work mmm I
think Asus has a really good sweet
especially with like the what they call
it the fat of the five aces sweet five
or whatever it's on the blocks to come
up with exactly what they call it but
it's got the auto overclocking feature
it's got the fan curve fan control built
into it I feel like Asus gives you the
most for your money in terms of like the
expansion cards it comes with the like
you saw the Thunderbolt card it also
came with the fan extender card lots of
really cool things building a custom
loop with the single 1080 I should I use
a reference card or is there one you
would recommend see my answer on that
has changed over the years because
back like even like three years ago
companies like ek and bits power and all
them they didn't make blocks for the
custom cards they only made them for the
reference cards but now that they make
blocks for the custom cards like the
Strix card and stuff I say look at the
reviews pick the card you like the most
based on aesthetics and features and
then if it has a block available for it
get that card otherwise if you want to
save a little money I like how you're
like gotcha like I'm talking to ya
that's like he's still learning all this
too so he's like where's your little
notebook looks like a gameboy he has a
notepad that let you see anywhere I gave
you that dinner
yes bunch of sticky notes um so anyway
he he's still learning but the the most
aftermarket cards now are getting good
support with what with blocks mm-hmm so
you could typically on water take a card
that's with better power delivery better
you know board design and get better
performance on water than a reference
now back in the day reference cards on
water we're beating the custom cards
because custom cards and have blocks
available but that's all changed the
game is change the federal three
connector can do video and data without
the mini DP and the card has no video
source if that makes sense okay that's
right right-click 3,000 Ram Trident is
er GB because instability causes
instability with 7700 K 4.8 at 2.8 volts
when Dan adds a lot with an XMP is
activated causes wildlands to crash ASUS
Maximus 9 hero that sounds more like a
statement but try dialing your ran back
to 2666 fun fact that's where I run my
memory on everything mmm
even when I have memory that's like 3200
megahertz I run it at 20 666 because
anything over 20 333 is still an
overclock so this gets unstable no it's
just every piece of software is going to
access hardware in some different way
has to do with AP is and it has to do
with just a lot of different factors it
doesn't mean that you're going to be
able to run even XMP profile without any
issues it's still an overclocked XMP
stands for extreme memory profile and if
you know okay okay so the speeds you see
on these boxes are X and P
profile which is why if you take like
any stick of RAM even if it's even if it
so the new ones are like 4000 mega and
you stick it in next ninety nine system
X 299 we're not talking about any of
that yet so just X X 99 or even a z170
is e 270 you put that Ram in there it's
going to load 23 33 okay or 21 33 I'm
sorry I'm going to 2133 so that's what
it's going to run it that's the base
clock for the memory
oh you're welcome and b67
current screen excluded yeah this stream
is pretty bad
hey J I love your content do you have
any of the new x99 CPUs to do review for
the channel PS remember Yellowstone
works of course I remember yellow skunk
works and I have a seventy nine hundred
X but it's at home and arrived after I
got to the studio today house a little
minute loop doing aluminum and it's
still it's in the kitchen it's just
sitting there we're just gonna let it
sit and then power it back on one day
yeah my CPU cooler has push-pull air
cooler and I can't get both fans to
spend the same speed will is caused an
issue
PS you and the coconut monkey are the
best keep up the work thank you sir
thanks um so your airflow is going to be
more so determined at the slower fan
speeds because this the fans at spinning
slower become the bottleneck I hate that
word really comes yeah right so if you
have if the push fans are spinning
faster and moving more air than the pull
fans is if there was no pressure drop
across the radiator then the slower fans
trying to push air into it are going to
be restrictive to the fans with higher
flow okay so our n is not equal in air
out air out is less than air in which is
going to create a pressure barrier here
but you have pressure drop across the
radiator so my recommendation would be
to put the slower fans on the pull side
and the faster fans on the push side and
that should help balance out some of the
pressure but ideally would still be to
run at least matched rpm fans for the
sake of noise because you could also get
some choppiness sound if you have two
different speed fans like perfect way to
explain that is take two of the same fan
but have one like having hooked up to a
fan controller or your header or
something and slowing down put one at
like 60% and one at like 100
and then stick them against each other
blowing the same direction you'll hear
like a bunch of turbulent chopping and
whooshing sounds because the fans are
not they're not turning at the same rate
or moving the same airflow
you bought a 1080i founders and while
playing overwatch it 283 see should I
lower the power while I wait for an AI
yo KITT yes that's exactly what no
that's exactly where it's set to run
that's exactly where founders card is
set to run out of the box don't lower
the don't lower the power just up your
fan curve speed up your fans a little
bit you're gonna you have a Founders
card you're gonna deal with noise anyway
so speed it up and get the temps down
you'll have better boost clock control
to go answered that here what was that
last one right there this one no the
green one do you think we'll be seeing
em ATX 69 boards I'm pretty sure there
will be there's always been I doubt
we'll see the ITX stuff though you just
you sacrifice too many of the features
that are intended on that platform when
you go with a ITX form factor as well
like on the kb lake stuff the previous
gen is more like the 80 you can find the
wireless adapters on most the smaller
ones you can find it on the big ones
like the only one I found it was like
the ACS booth or it's just picked up the
reason for that though is the smaller
the front factor the more portable the
idea behind the form factor is they want
to have right I thought brands like MSI
and Asus tend to include wireless AC
unlike even the full ATX motherboards
hmm but no you're right though that's
why all mini ITX ports another reason
why mini ITX boards usually have built
on I'm curious if you can figure this
one out
okay Mini ITX motherboards typically
have a wireless built-in and though they
use like an M SATA plug okay which is
it's not that almost looks like MDOT -
but it since 800 okay
and they will use wireless do that can
you can you tell me why I'm sure that
somebody in the audience knows I know
they know the answer this question why
do they include M SATA Wireless I'm
pretty much all ITX boards
and someone educate him for me so they
could keep a small form-factor there's a
very specific hardware reason for this
the chat is absolutely absurd welcome to
the Internet is it's not put so much
intensity on milk CPU no I'm waiting to
see the answer shows that somebody's got
to know this nobody knows or maybe
they're just way behind on the chat
maybe chats way behind hey you guys
somebody's got a nose transfer speed no
that's not it whoa my god PCI slot
numbers there's only one PCI slot pju
slot so could we grab this card in there
how you gonna plug in like a PCIe
wireless card magic gotcha
yeah now that PCI lanes PCIe slots
there's a difference but yeah so that's
why I'm all I met TX ports are just one
slot so you can't put a graphics card in
there now I mean technically if you were
running something on main stream and it
had a GPU like an internal GPU and then
maybe you could have put but it's gonna
happen it's gonna have an M SATA
wireless anyway I don't think I've ever
personally had like seen or felt or
touched an MITx board that didn't have
wireless on mmm SATA only goats here
Matt Matt we should just put a 10-hour a
ten-hour video of goats does that sound
like people the screaming goat screaming
like people ah yeah hey J thanks do you
have my first cooling loop thanks to me
you mean do to me I've cost you money
okay see your quiz I have my fan speed
at 38% in my graphics card is at 36
degrees Celsius which graphics card do
you have I'm going to guess a hybrid
card because the fan speed will still be
there because the fan controls cooling
for the power delivery memory
the GP is being cooled by water which is
why it's only at 36 C so I'm gonna say
it's a hybrid card but which one I don't
know it could be an EVGA hybrid it could
be an MSI hybrid but it's a hybrid card
I'm pretty sure it's mini PCIe who uses
Wireless anyways got a hard I use
Wireless at least at home I have only
one computer hard wired um I have
Godzilla goat video hmm what thing Jake
can you review the msi geforce 1070 ITX
they actually asked befalling to review
it I turned it down if I reviewed every
graphics card that light was was
requested both by you the audience or
the manufacturer this would be nothing
but the GPU Channel and you'd have like
a mine by now I could have a mind now
but I don't want a mine I don't want
them have to mine for two years before I
make any money and then in that two
years everything crashes and guess what
all I did was spend electricity bills
it's not instead it's mini PC you're
right fine you're right jay-z only
thoughts about coffee like nope because
it's all rumor base and I don't talk
about rumors
Jay what is going to be the best
processor for SLI gaming probably still
like a 7700 K not to be confused with
7740 X J can I use ddr3 RAM with i7 yes
you can if the board supports it okay
the 77 point 74 KB Lake does support
ddr3 and ddr4 Oh most of the money board
manufacturers made ddr4 boards only mmm
very very rarely you can find a ddr3
board that's not sure why anyone want to
do that though I think that started with
skylake actually how I feel at the RX
470 480 watch my reviews I reviewed both
of them I reviewed the 460 470 480 and
then I reviewed the 580 this time around
not the 470 we have it up there but
haven't reviewed it
lower the deskey monkeys can raise it
really high but stop right there there
now I was gonna like make it so laptop
just covers our face we'll have to go to
high all we're going to see is our
crotch see why are you doing that
there we go so I have to zip my fly back
up now so watch how high you a minute
now so you're looking no this is
weird-looking look what you did
you're like really low in it now as low
as it'll go I feel tonight I think oh
boy I'm the new West staying there if
there's cuz it's squishing my leg yeah
oh yeah we can't read this how long will
my 4790 look at how you it get hollow in
my 4790k performs still be considered
high end for gaming and when should I
replace it my answer is the same every
time somebody asked me this question
it's time to replace your CPU when it
can't do the tasks you want it to and
the speed at what you want them to do it
I learned that real quick alright it
looks like we're just sitting here now
with a floating laptop x360 e cake it
right on top fans above the intake front
fans intake rear fan exhaust DB pro 900
OC 6700 cable
feels high any thoughts wait CPU creeps
- low 70s check thermal paste no low 70s
is going to be fine on that see if you
remember that TJ Maxx on that CPU is 105
so your 3 or 35 see below TJ Maxx for
that CPU your OCD on a 6700 K water does
not necessarily mean that like okay so
water the longer that you have the
system running mm-hmm it's still gonna
get warm it just takes longer to get
there okay for long gaming sessions or
long testing sessions benchmarks
whatever can we raise it up like another
I'm excited to go too much here the
temps will still get up there but your
case has everything to do with it now
I'm we're actually gonna be talking
about case about about cases and water
cooling which is why I'm not using my
1800 X okay remember Robert I tell you
about why we're not using that PC so I
would look out for that video it might
give you some insight as to why that's
happening do you know why you can't
pre-order the new i9 700 X processor on
Amazon this new egg have the same
exclusive I sneak have some excuse I
don't work for Amazon how would I know
no idea man outgoing components is a
good I'm just throwing my money away
which uh depends on what going
components they are I mean if you ask me
if is it worth buying a 6700 K I would
give you a different answer than if he
asked me if it's worth buying a 6300 FX
mm-hmm both are outgoing hardware so I'm
using to ten eighty right now is it
worth upgrading to to 1080 T eyes um ok
Steve the gamer I kind of feel like that
question it's sort of like me going you
know my car can go 160 miles an hour
right now if I chain in my car and get
this car
I can go 175 it's it worth it how much
what kind of car is it how much money
are you does it matter if the point is
speed yes no I want speed on a budget
[Laughter]
I'm kidding
okay I mean it is palm guess so
no um I mean that's a really silly
question to ask I feel like it's a silly
question because you didn't tell me what
resolution you're gaming at which games
you're playing I mean if he comes back
and says 144 Hertz 1080p I'm going to
say he knows no point because you're
already going to max up the 144 in most
games if not all games with 210 80s
especially if you overclock stays a
little bit if he comes back and says he
has any 60 Hertz panel then I just want
to be like keep your cards by a monitor
so I mean that's that's my brutal but
honest question or answer for you Steve
at least you gave them alternatives if
he says he has a 60 Hertz monitor I
would say sell both of the ten 80s get
it or even buy or even sell one Canadian
buy monitor honestly it took me forever
to go up to 1080p 144 when you had your
900p monitor I have a 1600 by nine
energy yeah and they had 720p TV
he used to gain what well guys when I
met him and he built there he bought his
first computer which was a ibuypower by
the way my dad um yeah he was gaming on
a 720p TV I mean what do you game on now
I have a 1080p 144 Hertz I bought from
you the sous-vide 24 QBE QBE what is
that was that come on I'm like VG 2 for
8 QE QE yeah okay QB e QB yeah that was
a QB e yeah and then you also have the
LG UC 87 see I don't game on that unless
it's like project cars yeah cuz it's
only 60 Hertz but it's IP essence for
content creation and yeah hello from
Greece hi what a 7600 KB enough for 10
ATT I um okay so I did a video 7700
versus 7576 hundred versus 73 50k and
there is indeed with high-end GPUs some
loss of frames per second when you go
for my i7 when I thought but again that
depends entirely on the game game we're
in an era now where developers are
starting to use multi-threading where
they can and where it makes sense
for the longest time games like for the
most part just didn't use more than 4
cores period hyper threading was sitting
there idle they just battled trying
between four cores and it didn't matter
you could say I five and a seven or a
seven I 7 had very similar performance
but that's kind of changing now
you know I think this year is the first
day I'm actually gonna build my own
computer without any help for me yeah
I'm proud of you I know right
um this debate versus X 299 and thread
Ripper like I have a friend you guys you
guys know the owner of red mists right
he's talking about updating again he
just updated last year decks 99 let me
call him tell him right now he's like he
texts me this morning sorry I'm throwing
you under the bus you know who you are
he was like look decided I'm gonna
upgrade to X 299 and sell my current
stuff so what's my answer why he's all
to be honest I want to fancy your
motherboard pants here month - there are
fancy motherboards on the XIII and then
this response that is well unless thread
rippers the latest hottest thing so
here's the problems gonna be really hot
because it's two cores but together I've
trained you well gonna be really hot
savage so uh um there's always gonna be
some later hotter thing coming out you
gotta like this I don't know I see it as
play like we're gonna have thread blazer
which is four of them together I don't
know
Oh would you imagine the dyes like the
size of an iPad yeah you can't miss when
you put that in the socket like it's so
big you'll just be like do you letting
Kay be like X worth it yes but I
recommend you taking a hammer to it
delete it by hammering it using 4k TV on
content creator + rendering if you're
for if you're for if you're 4k TV is set
to four four four color gamut venture or
whatever the problem is a lot of 4k TVs
when you hook them up will only go four
to zero
mmm is this the first year J works on a
card with you we've worked on cars
together I don't know about what you
mean by card flies on your head no it's
not
I excited for thread Ripper I mean I
don't get excited for rumors I guess I
get excited for the ideas of things
I feel like AMD is in a position right
now where they get to kind of just like
chill out for a sec
because Intel went full AMD with this
launch like they just they traded places
man they have literally just fubar
this whole lunch hmm I mean when you
don't get CPUs to reviewers until four
hours after the embargo date when you're
in communication with them in the middle
of May I was in communication with them
in the middle of May regarding expected
delivery times on this when the problem
was they went dark they went dark too a
lot of us reviewers were kind of
chatting amongst ourselves like Hayes
Intel talking to you because they're not
talking to me and it's like no they are
not answering me either like no one's
answering
so we a lot of us were just left like
yeah we got motherboards and now Intel
has just like gone dark like completely
off the grid in terms of communication
we have no cake and and still they
didn't communicate to me that CPUs were
on the way I got the shipping
notification no like I got the shipper
carrier notification so these are so
frustrating I got a 6800 K at four
gigahertz but I'm running a 1080 Ti is
my processor bottlenecked by chance if
so 6800 K is a x99 CPU just so you know
mm-hmm no you're not bottlenecks people
are terrified of this concept of
bottlenecking why why is everyone so
afraid of bottlenecking unless you're
running some like really old or
like an i3 or like a big turbo runs
talking to her you're not gonna be no
cuz you can still run a big turbo until
the ship blows up the point you put this
together your bottleneck the moment you
start but the point is everyone is so
freaking terrified of this concept of
bottlenecking
and it's it's irritating because it's
like we make we make me to defend so
many hours per video especially the
stuff that talked about showing
performance reviews and proving to you
that you're not bottlenecking years
unless you have this just gross
mismatched hardware grossly mismatched
hardware like an x-15 I'm gonna get a
1080 TI and I'm gonna get an a-10 APU
from AMD
yeah you're bottlenecked at that point
you get an i3 your bottlenecked you get
an i-5 you're slowing down a little bit
but you're not bottle necked you are you
are not getting the full performance of
your 1080 TI but you are getting great
performance like bottlenecking will be
when your cpu goes to a hundred percent
usage to try and keep up with the frames
the graphics card is sending to it
the graphics card is handling all of the
video processing and it's telling the
cpu like hey this is what we got and
make it happen on the game and then the
game the cpu is basically like hold on
what hold on I'm not ready and then the
GPU sitting here like did it to do so
GPU usage go down its filing out GPU
usage goes down CPU usage goes up that's
a bottleneck mmm
but when the CPU usage is sitting around
80 75 60 and it's bouncing around your
GPU usage is still at 99 you're not
bottlenecks things are fine okay huge
fan just want to express my gratitude
for all the work you put in this channel
thanks for your content I was inspired
to complete my first liquid-cooled build
you're awesome Jay thank you sir what by
him he's awesome yes yes I have I have
my moments I can't click that there we
go
new Bobo rising in RAM GPU is 8g weight
is G outgoing built under 600 somewhat
prior eight gigs of ram um would it be a
decent build to consider instead of
waiting for the new four new 580 I don't
understand the question James I feel
like you didn't give me enough info new
mobo rising in ram GPU is 8g I
understand no crew I think my 6700 K at
seven gigahertz on ln2 is bottlenecking
my 9500 GT it might be a little bit man
GT stands for fast excuse my ignorance J
I have an AMD FX 8350 I'm willing to
spend around 350 get yourself like a
1500 or
around that range and a motherboard
combo from Newegg or something if you
can or NCIX wherever you live and I
guarantee you you are going to see a
massive improvement even with a fork or
with they call their site SM
simultaneous Multi multi Gnaeus
multi-threading and SMT because they
can't call it hyper threading this Intel
coin right yeah or actually is I think
it's a trademarked but anyway I
guarantee you were going to see a
massive improvement because of the IPC
or instruction per clock improvement
with Rison over 80 320 mm do we need to
do that
upgrade your sister's computer I'm gonna
probably upgrade it anyway because of
the like shutting down issue it was
doing yeah but I think we need to do
that I think we need to take 8320 which
is an 8 core technical aids 4 core
modules a 2 cores per module would they
have shared l2 cache which is why it
like people go like no it's a 4 core no
it's an 8 core well it's because it's
not a true eight quarter I mean to eight
physical cores but they're kind of like
sharing cache I feel like we need to
take like a 1500 which is a fork or a
thread and then we need to take an 80
320 or 18350 and compare the two what I
really wanted was that was rise in three
to come out I wanted the rise in three
four core no SMT just four cores to come
out so we could compare that to i-5 mmm
about 2500 kit 4.7 1080i and a 4k 60
Hertz monitor and no bottleneck that's
because your GPU is on 4k right if you
take your if you put it on 1080p then he
would be bound lucky as 2500 K but at 4k
is 1080 TI is taking on all the load so
the 1080 TI isn't able to send this
massive buffer of frames to the CPU to
handle the Jeep it's balanced gadget
adblock money's also thanks would cost
me 400 pounds and water clean parts is
it films I think is that could be pounds
it could be British pounds it could also
be euro they like the same symbol euros
more of an e like I see with the two
line it's going through it is it so it
looks at me I don't know although the
Amazon Payments I get from the UK have
that symbol so it's pounds could be do I
look European well actually
a way to phrase that question but if I
stop talking like these ya know that's
gonna work hello guys do this now let's
talk about the computers talk about
computers now a 360 degree at 1,700 X
1080 ion water added to 40 Tim's went up
CPU running 45 idle 55 on load GPU 2527
idle 40 load not sure if I put together
the CPU water blocky correct let me know
any solution uh you might have a pump
you'll have a pump issue your water flow
might be way too low it also depends on
the layout of your of your loop it all
spent over case you're using pert
example got a 360 into 240 over there
right yep
I'm it like I said we're soon as I'm
done with the stream here which is going
to be about 10 minutes I'm going to
shoot a video about what motor cooling
goes wrong because of a simple oversight
on my part hours and hours and hours of
work went to waste we have to take
pictures before you disassemble it
actually don't think I wanted to simple
it I actually just kind of feel like I
want to take that to a machine shot
and be like make a big-ass hole in this
fair enough
J really appreciate the content and
bottlenecking I really appreciate the
content and bottlenecking to agree as a
myth like Jay said if it's nine hundred
percent usage on your CPU you're not
bottlenecked if your CPU is six years
old it might be time to upgrade if
you're unhappy
I've though set it before you can game
on a potato if you're ok with potato
frame rates right yeah same thing with
the editing on a potato if you're ok
with it taking four hours to render a
video then it's not time to upgrade if
you're like I am NOT going to sit here
wait four hours for this to render it is
time to upgrade yeah guys who cares
forgot my questions oh hi hi 5820k with
the 1080i and 1080p my GTA 5 gets below
60 FPS on max settings
what's up huh Thursday 20 K the same CPU
yeah we're the 1080i and at 1080 P my
GTA 5 gets below 60 FPS on max settings
what's up I don't know there's lots of
settings of GTA 5 you have the draw
distance really high you could have the
long shadows way too
you could have nostrums there could be
lots of issues on there no mushroom
blood believe it or not doesn't add too
much into the GPU load I mean it does
have to blur out the image as it's
moving but you're also dealing with a
massive world so he's got draw distance
max he's got shadows maxed and he's got
density maxed all those buildings and
all those people in all those cars is
he'd be ready to render all of that so
what's actually slowing now may not be
your GPU might be your CPU now he's got
12 cores for with 12 threads of
performance for the 5820k but if you're
still running stock speeds of a cheapy
overclocked at the 4k or 4k 4 gigs he
would see a pretty significant
improvement what's the most worth it I
wait what's the most worth it x-series
CPU coming for 4770k Haswell CPU which
SEC series X 299 X 99 gnarnia
thanks Federation little st. Louis st.
was just like here at 10 Canadian boom
much love from the San Francisco Bay
Area for you guys any advice for a noob
youtuber like myself consistency
consistency is everything Google
algorithm prefers consistency over
anything else so as long as you're
uploading every other every few days on
a regular basis then you stay up there
in the search rankings if you like to
shotgun out a bunch of videos and then
you disappear for two months and then
you shout out gun out some more and then
you disappear that's that's bad that's
that's that hurts you when it comes to
you too
that's the eurosam yeah okay well they
both look at E and nany NIM thanks for
the donation J I really appreciate the
content Oh we read that yeah read that
one too we read all those are good cool
now you guys were on fire of the
donations today sheesh it all goes to
help pay his salary thanks
and the studio cook of lucky wait wait
did you put the grass plan on the table
I just noticed it
mm-hmm we had to get rid of the IKEA
plant that everyone copies so we we took
out the bamboo tree thing where'd it go
those are here next me yeah okay but
it's kind of off-screen um and we got
that grass plant actually a Hobby Lobby
the reason why I asked you for the
picture of that table mm-hmm okay when
when Nick and I were putting together
the second set over there we were we
went to Ikea of course but we were going
there necessarily to buy like a computer
desk we were gonna buy a table like a
cut like a dining room table okay we
mean okay you were there I'm telling us
yes yes buddy when you went with a wife
no if you're listening I said you and I
when we were building the second set we
went to Ikea okay I had you send me the
picture yesterday of that black picnic
table looking dining room table because
I'm really glad we didn't buy that one
because Jonathan just did another dream
desk set up and used that table oh
that's the problem no I'm not shopping
at IKEA no more so I swear to God every
youtuber in this area is like we gotta
do something we're going to Ikea I'm
going archaea no for now I'm going to
living spaces and going to Hobby Lobby
and one of thrift stores sisters if you
want something like garage sales whether
looking yeah all right
scroll down
figured you stopping at all the ones
that say coconut monkey I know right
she's oh it that's racist you can't call
him coconut monkey yes he can that's
what I named myself fell well he was
totally not listening I know he never
listens this is what I deal with every
day you guys fight like the perfect
couple
like I'm telling a story to them and
you're like okay yeah that's right like
I'm telling you the story about when you
were there I know I want to hear your
end of it but do you really want to hear
my side off the camera maybe do you guys
know how many sentences he starts with
hey what if we it ends with me like this
it's literally like Lego Batman where
you have like all the good ideas and I
finally get like one so when I had said
in the video we did with the ghetto
cooling ideas um you had the idea of
like well what if we put like screen
material on here to keep like the
breeding stuff from getting in yeah and
I was like in the Edit - I was like cook
i'm like 'i had a really good idea and
you're like look i had an idea and i
went we could fix that like i did it out
those sentences right there like so i
played it back for him and it was like
something else you could do is take some
screen material and you were just like
oh but then someone else had a really
good idea that like dwarf or trumped
yours which was a trumped um trumped
your the sign it and sherwood um no he
was like what just go to the Home Depot
and get that air filter materially
air-conditioned cut it mmm I matched the
fan and is stick it against the fan and
that will actually block the best as a
screen material is a little bit big for
blocking dust that would be for blocking
like big pieces of dirt trash getting
blown in oh yeah he's still rocking at
3770k at 4.8 gtx970 I'm running at 240
and at 280 and at 200 dual pumps Oh
dueling pumps are like fighting each
other
my temps still range from 15 C to 68 see
why everyone thinks custom HTML so - it
depends entirely on the environment as a
chair you would recommend for someone
who's 64 for 6 to 8 hours of use a day
where you go ooh whoa
I just made this font like that big I
like I got this okay that work uh is
there a chair you would recommend six to
eight hours a day keep up the good work
I don't have a lot of experience with
chairs when we use the autonomous chairs
up here we still you still have seen the
reviews on those because I'm a snob
wearing men I'm tired of doing reviews
on chairs and then after review is live
like a month later something breaks on
the chair so we're like long-term using
the richer testing but like these chairs
have like little things about them I
don't like like just a random plastic
cover will pop off or the headrest will
just fall down oh yeah those are good
yeah you have a 6600 K and it's not
enough for some of the photoshop and
live streaming I would like to do should
I go with a 6700 K studies 500 K or turn
my I 5 into an HTTP C and go to rise in
1700 that's like you gave me like three
very contrasting off and options here it
sounds like you have to keep the i-5
anyway and you want to upgrade so turn
the i5 into a home theater PC if you
want rise in 1700 in my opinions going
to be better for content creation than
the 6700 or 7700 K because it's 16
threads
No exhibit bad wolf your 380 X will not
do 144 Hertz 1080p J in your opinion
save up or wait for Vegas specs or save
it for 1080i keep up my opinion wait
we're not that far mmm we're not that
far from Vega no at least not consumer
bigger okay four more minutes and we're
going to end the stream Jane net great
fan is it worth upgrading my 600 K yet
mostly do gaming at 1440 and a bit of
photo editing running a 1080i karen
being else i think you're fine with 6700
i agree with that below and 51 is going
to drop
nope in fact you let me tell you what
happens with hardware as it starts to
become obsolete it if people need
particular pieces of hardware to either
repair builds or finish builds so
initially there will be an increase in
price because the FX is a perfect
example when we built that system last
year would be like uber cheap $500 PC
yeah
the 8320 was $79 on Amazon today it's
130 almost almost doubled right it's
like two-thirds extra price right now
right because those aren't being made
anymore that all AMD productions AMD was
still making FX CPUs up until last year
when they were prepping for Rison and
now that those are becoming fewer and
farther and harder to find prices going
up on those so the same thing could
potentially happen with 1156
and olympia and all these other sockets
right so it's hard to say it really is
but it's kind of like Sandy Bridge was
saying it when Intel announced that they
weren't gonna be making Sandy Bridge
anymore it took like two years for
inventory to run out though Sydney
benefit speak up well I see any benefit
going from 4790k it is 7900 x with 1080
sli tenant 1080i sli i already own the
video cards is there any particular
reason why you want to buy a thousand
dollar CPU when you already have one
that's not like terrible he's got he's
on a devil's canyon 4790k
those are really that's what's in that
that little mini ITX water-cooled
fractal build we did yeah okay I again
he didn't say the resolution is gaming
it and resolutions everything when it
comes to SLI because here's the thing
with most games when we do our
benchmarks now with like 1080 T is and
1080s and Titan X's 10x Peas usually the
1440p and 1080p numbers are the same and
why is that because the CPUs
bottlenecked with to 1080 T eyes on
games that can go high refresh rate with
things like battlefield or rise of the
Tomb Raider or stuff like that oh yeah
what would you oh hi VW n Nissan lover
I'm assuming what he said low work real
right read it verbatim Nissan lower what
would you recommend from my loop DDC or
d5 pump right now AEK X 80 240 and PE
360 red and CPU GPU block from ek
because the D to C enough temps around
60 for CPU and 50 for GPA you're not
going to see a temperature drop with
those pumps the d5 pump is about flow
but doesn't have as much head pressure
as a DD C a DD C usually has a higher
flow rate but it doesn't or I'm sorry
has a lower flow rate but it has higher
head pressure so he could go with like
dual DD C's but I don't think he's gonna
I don't think he's necessarily having a
pressure or issue but again there's so
many I can't when people just tell me
the components they have for water
cooling I can't tell them what their
problem is it depends on what fans are
using what case would be using what fan
orientation what are their fan RPMs
what's their ambient temperature I know
if I said it well chassis are they in we
should make like a template like how to
ask his questions like if I don't think
it'll work
oh you could try blazer
alright professional success just say
but by the way love your channel I don't
know if I mean I don't know what that
means that what's the most worth it X
$2.99 CPU the one you don't buy
thank you for your videos gives me the
opportunity to take part with hardware
when I can't afford some of them news
flash we can't afford them either we're
just fortunate that they send to us
[Laughter]
alright it's time to go guys um so that
pretty much ends it thanks for hanging
out with us today we got videos to shoot
and accidentally let my daughter's
Disneyland pass expire so I have to run
to Disneyland tomorrow to renew it
otherwise I could've done it online
cuz I'm stupid our past so don't expire
on the same day in my defense ours
it'll stay longer than hers we're gonna
go guys thanks for hanging out with us
today over 3300 of you um hope you got I
think it's a neat looking livestream all
right just let start our videos yeah it
would be nice so for us to have a
dedicated livestream so I think we need
like the red well they wanted real quick
though before we get out of here as I'm
gonna unhook the camera little peek
you're gonna get a sneak peek of what
we're doing of what the place looks like
what we're doing what it looks like can
you not hear that's a laptop we're
streaming on in case you can't hear him
you
great oh there you go
we need to get a plug saver for this
like Athena attaches to it so it doesn't
blow
it's just now moving on this one
that's the 1800 x build that you're
looking at Hey it gives like it no
signal they're just getting the no
signal right now yeah all right time to
go thanks for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
