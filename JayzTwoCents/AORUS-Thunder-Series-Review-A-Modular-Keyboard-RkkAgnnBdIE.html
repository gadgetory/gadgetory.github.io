and Twitter photos that I put up you
guys have asked what keyboard is that in
the background my gosh it looks awesome
it's been kind of sitting there for
awhile just teasing you and making you
wonder what the heck it is today we're
gonna take a look at a few products from
Oris I think it's orestes how you say it
well embarrassed to say I don't know how
to pronounce it ao r us ARS ours we're
gonna be taking a look at the Thunder
Series today from I'm gonna call it
Horus Aris that is right for the last
two weeks or so I have been trying out
some products from Aris now we are
taking a look today at three actually
I've never done three products in one
video so I'm gonna try and keep it as
straight and to the point and not too
long but not too short I mean that's the
hard part about this whole gig anyway
we're gonna take a look at the Thunder
k7 keyboard the Thunder m7 MMO gaming
mouse and the Thunder p3 gaming pad I'm
assuming it's k4 keyboard m4 mouse and
p4 pad
I came up with that one all by myself
actually they didn't even send me a
review kit that told me what that meant
now I'm gonna go ahead and start with
the keyboard because I'm gonna be honest
this keyboard has quickly become one of
my favorite keyboards I have ever used
but at the same time it's not perfect
so we're gonna talk about everything now
the Thunderer k7 it is a mechanical
keyboard plus macro keypad what does
that mean macro keypad in fact if you
take a look at the photo here you'll see
the ten key it's a ten keypad plus an M
macro pad but it's on the left side of
the keyboard but if you look right here
you can see mine he's on the right hmm
interesting
yeah alright so anyway it is a
mechanical red switch with a blue
backlight that's kind of problem number
one for me was the fact that it was a
blue backlight I would have loved a
white but I digress now the cool thing
is it's got volume control brightness
control macro control everything
profile control everything is right on
the keyboard with these dials and it's
pretty pretty neat you can turn up the
volume you can turn up the brightness
with a dial so it gives you more than
just that kind of a three step or a five
step brightness but it has got an awful
lot of functionality now let me go ahead
and show you what I think is really cool
about this keyboard as this keyboard is
really truly modular now if you're like
me I really like a rest pet but maybe
you don't well cool you can just take
the damn thing right off or you can just
put it right back on you see that let me
do that again for you guys you can just
take it off or put it right back on the
damn things magnetic people look at that
now maybe you don't want the keypad you
just take it off now you've got yourself
a ten keyless keyboard maybe you want it
on the left side like this show in the
picture that's right magnetic BAM there
it is so you've got three major pieces
to the keyboard right here yeah that's
pretty damn cool so a 10 key pretty much
with all your volume control and your
lighting control and it's also a button
when you push it down watch yeah that's
neat right it's a nice matte finish it's
got some hefty weight to it the anti
slip pads are pretty good size it's got
the fold-out feet so you can get up
right angle if that's more your flavor
or if you decide you want that keypad
boom there it is now you're seeing kind
of problem number one aren't you it's
only magnetic now where that becomes an
issue is if you're like me and you're
constantly sliding your keyboard around
now it's not coming off as I'm sliding
it as you can see but let me tell you
what's happening it's got these tiny
little spring-loaded contact pins in
here on both sides of the keypad it's
got the same flip up foot by the way so
it can match the height if you flip up
your keyboard these really easily lose
contact if you were to say wiggle it
like that so when you do that your
windows is gonna windows got
automatically detect that a device was
disconnected because this kind of
carries its own little keypad driver and
anytime you move it around or go to pick
get up it tends to go dead drunk don't
dink don't dunk and then starts like
recognizing and installing the driver
that happens during a game you get a
momentary can loss of control of your
keyboard that's that's the one problem I
had is I had wished that there would
could have been like maybe a latch that
you could maybe kind of lock in on the
bottom so that it doesn't come off and
it can stay permanent because I I need
my 10 key pad I I need that but now
here's the cool part is it also comes
with its own cable so you could keep
this thing entirely independent so you
could be like on what is that high
school game game high school whatever
video game high school yeah that that's
vgs vGHS video a game high school yeah
you could use this independently as its
own like keypad if you want it I mean it
has its own cable and it's separate from
the keyboard so you can do that if you
wanted this is perfect for left-handed
gamers I have a friend who's a
left-handed gamer and he'd specifically
bought one of those logitech gaming pads
so this could double is that you've got
you've got your right up here when you
push it down it'll light up and change
colors based on profile so you have
different macros for different games and
different profiles you can set a color
on that that's an RGB and so the
keyboard is pretty awesome and now
putting it together I think is really
neat too because you can just slide it
over slide it over and there it is well
J but the wrist rest if you move the
thing off the right and you move it to
the left right it's gonna look funky
like that well got you covered
all right so that's enough about the
keyboard I've been using it for a while
I've managed to learn to move it around
without it
disconnecting on me but there are times
I move it in the middle of a game and it
disconnects and I get very very
frustrated but typing on it is
absolutely fantastic a lot of people
don't like cherry MX Reds Cherry MX Reds
are one of my absolute favorites which
next to that would be Cherry MX browns
and blues so now we're going to go ahead
and take a look at the m7 MMO gaming
mouse now just like you would expect
with other gaming mice it has lots and
lots of buttons but what's cool is it's
got this kind of acrylic window both on
the top and inside right there so that
you can you can see in there
engine and she was a little engine in
there and it's got a mac artist weeping
not a macro but it's got a profile
select button on the right it's got one
two three four five six seven eight
thumb buttons so it's perfect for mmo's
I find it very comfortable it's more of
a claw Mouse though I find it's not so
much a palm Mouse it feels like more of
a claw Mouse you got to kind of hold it
like this I would prefer it to be a
little bigger but that's just me it's
got very very smooth feet on the bottom
it glides really nicely especially on
their mouse pad Oh once again there's
one thing that's not perfect about it oh
of course it's got a scroll wheel which
is also a button it's got some LEDs on
the front that light up braided cable
I'm a big fan of that
now there's something on here that I not
a fan of and that's the location of the
profile switch right here is I tend to
find that when I'm got my ring finger
over there it tends to rest right near
that I don't if you can see that it
tends to rest right near that button and
so what happens is I find myself
accidentally changing profiles in the
middle of a game specifically
battlefield or other shooters and all
the profiles have their home dpi
sensitivity so my DPS says dpi
sensitivity could be changing mid game
so I would definitely maybe had
suggested them a different spot for that
button but either way so it makes also
finding out which profiler on really
really easy because the LEDs down inside
of the little window here will change
color based on the profile you have
selected as well as the LED on the
scroll wheel will change colors
depending on the profile you have
selected so the mouse is actually really
comfortable I really do like it it's a
little smaller than I'm used to but hey
you know we can't all have the size that
we care about and last but not least we
have the massively huge Thunder p3
gaming pad now this isn't designed to
just be a mousepad it is just that this
sucker is a and you see I tried to pick
up the keyboard and all fell apart on me
this thing is a gaming pad it is
designed to run the entire length of the
surface where you're going to be doing
your gaming and as you can see just like
that
you can have pretty massive size surface
area for all of your stuff it's pretty
big now it's sort of like a neoprene
material on the bottom it is not gonna
slide and the only downside is because
it's a fabric it tends to pick up dust
and dirt and and things really easily so
it looks dirty kind of quickly but you
can pretty much wipe it clean with a
damp cloth with absolutely no problem
but it's cool because it's not just a
mousepad it's a gaming pad so your
keyboard and everything goes on here
your entire gaming surface then becomes
your mousepad
and their Mouse in fact any Mouse
actually smooth or rides really really
smooth on their their gaming pad here
but I see I've got like lint and stuff
already on this and I find myself
cleaning it quite a bit so guys this has
been the thunder series here from Oris
and if I'm saying it wrong please
correct me down in the comments section
let me know jay you're an idiot you're
saying it wrong
it's a Oris or our rust it's pretty
awesome actually is what it is it's been
a while since I've come across any
gaming peripherals that really made me
have like wow this is this is pretty
cool and fun to use so this is the
entire series here go and check them out
I'll put links into the description if
available I'm not entirely sure where
they're available yet but I'll be
putting those down there as they become
available
guys Jase 2 cents follow on twitter
social media and all that other fun
stuff you got a lot of cool stuff coming
up on the channel here you're getting
pretty backed up and I have a lot of
stuff to review also have been eating a
lot of red meat with it okay that's
probably little bit too much TMI see you
