today we're going to do a video that i
said for a long time i wasn't going to
do but i'm doing it now because
apparently i give in to peer pressure
don't do drugs
so with the new enthusiast x99 platform
launched on the horizon here I've
decided that I am in fact going to go
ahead and put my third 70-80 into my
main rig that way I can just have a
massively overkill underutilized system
because well I don't know if I'll ever
have another chance to actually do this
so here is my third 780 right here it's
coming right out of the test bench
behind me and guys I'm committed now the
graphics of block has the waterblock has
already been ordered for this thing and
well the cables have already been done
and I've I'm pretty much dedicated I'm
committed we're doing this so this is my
EVGA 780 SC with the ACX cooler on here
and this is what we're going to be BIOS
hacking and / volting to get better over
clocks now obviously we're only gonna be
able to go so far because of the fact
that we are still air-cooled but I'm
preparing for the water cooling that
this is going to be going on now this
video right here is going to come with
an awful lot of disclaimers the reason
for that is that you can very easily
turn this into one of the most expensive
doorstops you could ever own trust me
I've already done it so what exactly is
BIOS hacking and / volting well it's
just like it sounds going to be loading
a custom BIOS on here custom rom and we
are getting which is going to allow us
to remove many of the fail-safes that
are built into these graphics cards to
keep you from blowing them up I can't
just blame her enough guys do this at
your own risk I did one video in the
past where I showed people how to use a
tree disk or whatever it's called and
how to clean up old files on your system
do you have any people wipe their C
Drive and blaming me for it yeah so
disclaimer disclaimer disclaimer your
own risk now there's a whole list of
disclaimers that we're going to be
talking about here before I even move
forward because guys I'm not going to be
responsible for you guys blowing up your
cards I'm just documenting the process
I'm going through on my card which works
with my model and my bias your results
will vary
I guarantee it disclaimer number one
can't go without saying enough I've
already said it your own risk
disclaimer number two I can't guarantee
it's going to work with your card you
have to basically go and find the right
BIOS yourself loading the wrong BIOS on
the wrong card will brick it I've done
this already and I could not flash it
back even with the help of EVGA and the
custom BIOS ROM maker it's actually the
first card he said he was ever stumped
on on being able to flashback so guys
you can permanently ruin your card
disclaimer number three I will not be
providing you guys any links to any of
these tools if you guys cannot go and
find the tools yourself you are probably
not capable of doing this hack reliably
so if you guys are smart enough to be
able to go and find these tools based on
what you're seeing on the screen
chances are you have the beginning
capability of actually performing these
but I will not be linking you if you
want to send me hate for that too
freaking bad I'm not giving you guys the
tools to ruin your cards and simply
showing you how I'm doing it with mine
and disclaimer number four you must have
adequate cooling do not think that
you're going to BIOS hack and over volt
your air-cooled card and get good
results guys this is designed for people
who are on water cooling now what I'm
going to be using it for today is just
getting it ready for my water cooler so
with that said let's go ahead and get
this bad boy stuck back in the system
and let's go ahead and get started
transition
now while we're waiting for the system
to boot up here let's go ahead and talk
about a couple of other things I'm sure
many people are already asking when will
this work on another graphics card can I
do it on my 290 can I do it on my 280 my
770 my sevens I don't know guys I'm
doing the 780 because that's what I have
I'm sure there's options out there for
these other graphics cards I don't know
if they'll apply to you you have to do
the leg room you have to do the research
and figure it out yourself all right so
we're going to turn into the computer
here we're going to load up Valley
Valley benchmark and I'm going to show
you guys first off the reason why we are
doing this now if we head on over here
and we just go ahead and run the
benchmark here for just a couple of
moments we'll go ahead and show you guys
one of the reasons why we're going to do
this now NVIDIA has stated that the
gk110 video card which is the 780 the
Titan the Titan Titan Z Titan black a
lot of lot of titans out there are
capable of 1.2 1 2 volts from the
factory but a lot of card implement
implemented tato deters implementers
have actually hard limited some of them
to one point one five zero volts and
that happens to be the case here on this
graphics card so I've gone ahead and
I've loaded this long enough just so
that we can actually see where we are
going here on the voltage and if we look
right here see one point one six two
volts and it bounces up and down it
started one point two and then it came
down they went up and they came down and
went up it came down and that's a
problem for overclocking right there
that's sort of sort of a V group thing
it also has to do with the fact that
you've got your power limits on the
graphics card which is set to 106
percent power limit and when we do a
custom bios and a custom over volt it's
going to actually allow us to kind of
remove all of those limited limiters and
we're just going to pump the voltage
into it non-stop now that's why the
cooling is actually a major major issue
blower style coolers guys don't do this
please it's just it's not going to work
you're going to throttling anyway due to
heat and water cooling is actually
fantastic now if you do have a custom
PCB something that has better MOSFETs
better caps and and better VRMs chances
are you'll be able to do even more
voltage than the 1.3 volts which the
BIOS will allow us to achieve
and your overall results will be better
so I'm even taking a risk by doing this
on a reference PCB but you know I
digress I like to take risks the way
I've always been all right so you guys
can see there we actually had some some
limiting right here on the voltage and
as that voltage goes up and down it does
affect the max overclock now the max
overclock stable I was actually able to
get on this graphics card as you can see
it was 1228 which is where it started
but as the voltage drop so did the core
and it dropped all the way down to 1202
now twelve hundred megahertz overclock
it's not a bad overclock whatsoever in
fact that's a fantastic overclock but we
want more power that's the way I work
it's free power and I'm going to take
advantage of it damn it so the first
thing we're going to do here is we're
just going to go ahead and close out all
this stuff we're going to open up my
over my hacking tools here and the BIOS
that I'm actually using is the Skynet
BIOS now there's some BIOS out there
they're available from other people like
s7 it's f7 some other guys out there
I'm just want to use the same BIOS on
all three of my cards so I am using the
Skynet BIOS no relation to the
Terminator I don't think hope not into
that I've just given three new graphics
cards to the network from Skynet so
before we move forward we're going to
load up techpowerup as gpu-z this is a
program that allows us to take a look at
our BIOS it also allows us to backup our
BIOS and that is very very important you
must save your BIOS you can see here
we're running 8080 31 0 80 that means
it's a B one revision GPU just means
it's a newer GPU you might see 80.000 or
3a there's a bunch of different bios out
there so the important thing is you need
to make sure that the BIOS that you are
using matches at least the first numbers
on your BIOS now guys like Skynet he
actually puts in readme files or text
files with his BIOS and will tell you
specifically where they've been tested
and where they're compatible so that is
the most important thing loading the ROM
BIOS you're effed now right here next to
the BIOS version you will see there's
this little save BIOS we're just going
to go ahead and save that it's going to
take a second here because it's got
actually export it and we're just going
to go ahead and save this into my
hacking tools hacks never want to do it
yeah nope we're going to do it in our
780 folder here and I'm going to name
this gk110 now I'm going to put 823 201
4 because that's today's date so I know
pretty much when I save that BIOS it's
now been saved and there it is right
there so we now have our BIOS to revert
to if something goes wrong now in most
cases you can flashback you can get it
recovered with a Windows boot disk but
sometimes it doesn't work as I know
firsthand alright so the book the BIOS
that we're actually going to be using
for this is the Skynet BIOS EVGA SC
revision 4 here's the readme and as you
can see right here it works with BIOS
versions 8080 and this one's to 108 II
we're on a 3-1 it just means there's a
slightly newer factory BIOS but this is
a perfectly capable BIOS and compatible
because of the 8080 that's kind of the
most important thing okay guys there is
some files that you're actually going to
need there's three files here you can
see I've got NV Flash MB flash 32.6 and
NV flash 64.6 so we're going to go ahead
and we are going to copy these three
files and we are going to start a new
folder here and we're just going to call
it I don't know we'll call it third 780
that way whoa that was my
780 so that I know exactly which files
I'm using for this card right here even
though they're all the same I still like
to keep it exactly parsed out so I know
of my three cards which files they
actually derived from now we're going to
go ahead and also cut the stock rom that
we just saved out of there we're going
to save it into that folder so that it's
all in the same place and lastly we need
to go into our appropriate BIOS it's up
to you to figure out I'm not telling you
what the appropriate one is for me I
happen to know it's ask iOS by a Skynet
bios EBG 8sc revision 4 here is the file
here it's got a very long kind of a file
name I don't really care for that file
name so we'll be changing that
we'll move it over here into there as
well we'll go ahead and paste it and
we'll just sort of change the name of
that to Skynet SC BAM
so now we have two roms in this folder
we've got Skynet SC and gk110 8:23 2014
so now we've got our programs that we
need ready to go and the next thing
we're in do is actually run our Flash
utility that's the part we've got to
kind of reach down and grab your nuts
and see exactly how brave you are when
it comes to performing this because
that's where it's either going to pass
or fail now the easiest way to open up
the env flash program is just to shift
right click in the folder and then do
open command window here there's also
keyboard commands you can do that I just
like to do that and as you can see right
here it takes us into a command prompt
that's right there in that folder now
there's actually a command line we're
going to type right here and this is the
part where this is actually really
important so we're going to run env flat
we're going to run env flash I've never
gotten used to typing on this keyboard -
or space - for - space - five this is
actually a list of commands for override
BIOS protection override you know that
the boot image may not match in fact
even though they're made on the same
BIOS platform or level if you will or I
guess backbone it still says hey this
BIOS doesn't match if you do this you're
probably going to brick your card it's
sort of an invidious failsafe so these
are actually overriding that and that's
where it gets a little bit scary and
then you're also going to do space - six
and then we're going to put in the name
of our BIOS which is Skynet SC got wrong
now we're going to hit enter it's going
to tell us here you want to replace the
8080 3102 80 with 80 80210 80 so really
we're kind of rolling it back slightly
but you can actually see here that the
the actual note I remember this is
called right here I think this is the
image is actually identical so you have
to hit Yes to confirm it says the
display may go blank for on and off so
basically gird your loins hold on tight
it's now actually
storing the firmware BIOS image onto the
wrong now here's the funny part
I didn't fart I swear it's my chair okay
maybe I farted okay so now it says we're
done it's verifying update it's
successful now here's actually the
freaky part because we're booted into
the old wrong or the previous room ROM
image even though I had bricked my card
in the past it still worked until the
reboot and then the reboot when it
actually loads that ROM image is where
we got a blank display and absolutely no
recognition of the actual graphics card
whatsoever in the system so it may still
be displaying an image right now but it
could actually be bricked for all we
know so now what we're going to go ahead
and do is we're going to verify that the
ROM actually took effect go ahead and
restart and let's just hope I didn't
brick looks good it's five hundred
dollars down the drain every time it
happens guys and if you've got a more
expensive video card it would be it
worked
alright so as you can see the image
actually took now that's only the first
part of actually BIOS hacking and over
volting your graphics cards now the
graphics card has a BIOS on there that's
going to no longer do GPU boost 2.0 it's
no longer going to have a turbo or a
boost frequency at all so when I run
into a game it's going to run at the
default in this BIOS it's actually one
thousand six megahertz not the 940 one
and it's not going to ramp up at all so
that's actually what we want we want
full control over what the graphics card
is doing GPU boost 2.0 great idea for
massive overclockers like me terrible
idea so you guys remember we actually
had that fluctuating voltage before and
without doing any hacks to msi
afterburner because actually to get the
next part of this you need to hack msi
afterburner so that it no longer V group
that voltage we're going to go ahead and
take a look at our settings here now the
first thing I want you to notice here is
do you remember how 106 percent was
actually the max we had before on the
TDP or the power limit we now have 150
allowed to us so that's one part of the
BIOS hack it allows us to tell the GPU
it's okay to use a lot more power than
you recommend
so we're six percent over power
protection I guess now it's our
protection but over power limit on the
graphics card is now 150 percent so
basically we went from about a 330 watt
over power limit to a 450 watt allowance
on the graphics card now you see why the
cooling is very very important okay so
these are all of our same settings
before but take a look at the voltage
right here you see this we are now
sitting pegged 1.2 1 2 volts and the
reason for that it's sitting there
pegged is I have the Nvidia power right
now set to instead of being on adaptive
it's actually set to prefer maximum
performance if you set that to adaptive
then it will actually come down and ramp
down when you're doing idle tasks but
for the sake right now of testing our
overclock this is what we've got going
on now I also want to point out the
temperatures do you see our idle temps
have jumped up quite a bit that's
because we're pumping all that voltage
to our graphics card so again I can't
stress enough how important it is to
actually have adequate cooling so now
let's go ahead and load up our valley
benchmark and let's see how much more
megahertz we've actually gained now
nothing's going to change right here in
fact the mega Hertz are probably going
to show lower because previously when
you did an overclock you were actually
you're adding kind of an offset
megahertz on top of the boost but now
it's going to actually be a one-to-one
so if I say give it a plus 100 it's a
plus 100 megahertz to the base clock if
that makes sense
where before it was a plus 100 to the
GPU to boost ratio so it's actually
changed the way we overclock the cards
entirely temperatures are sitting at 65
degrees Celsius right now 66 it'll
probably hit 85 after all of its loops
that's where I have it set to but the
cool thing is temperatures are good
volts are still sitting at the stock
1.21 to max allowed by Nvidia which
means we can now crank this thing so our
we went to eleven hundred and
twenty-four megahertz which is actually
about seventy eight megahertz slower
than before so now is where we're going
to actually start tweaking so we're
gonna leave our memory at zero and we're
going to go ahead and bump this up we'll
do plus 200 to see where we get apply it
save it if you guys don't know how
MSI Afterburner you guys will have to
figure that one out on your own we'll go
ahead and rerun Valley benchmark and
we'll continue to repeat this process
until we crash will back off and find
where our max overclocks are so keep
your fingers crossed that we actually
gain something because that's the entire
point of this if we don't get anything
this was all just for naught we voided
our warranty for absolutely no reason
whatsoever and that's not cool we have
finally found our max overclock here on
the stock bolts of 1.2 on 2 volts on air
and that is a twelve hundred and
sixty-six megahertz core clock now
that's pretty fantastic now some of you
may be saying well that's only 60
megahertz higher than you had before
remember
all we're doing is forcing the card to
go to its max safe voltage determined by
Nvidia thereby taking a VJs BIOS out of
the equation of saying no only go to
1.15 and we also are doing it on a fan
controlled graphics card which does eat
into the amps and bolts a little bit in
terms of that power setting so it's
allowing us to go to that one point two
one two volts because of the 150 % TDP
max that is allowing us to actually take
the fans out of the equation now if we
take a look here as you can see while
that was actually running we got our one
point two one two bolts all the way
across if you can't read that it
actually says one point two one two
volts and as you can see we're done and
we're out of the 3d mode it ramped back
down to the 0.875 and our max core right
there actually shows 1254 so there's a
little discrepancy in valley but we got
about a fifty megahertz 50 to 60
megahertz overclock on top of the stock
voltage now you can get a lot more out
of this in fact I'm pretty confident
that this graphics card will probably
reach thirteen hundred megahertz maybe
even 1350 once we start bumping it up to
one point two five and even one point
three zero but I can't even consider
doing that until I'm actually on water
because then I'm just asking for trouble
my max temperature had actually gotten
up to 79 degrees Celsius which is not
bad at all considering where air cooled
but it's not I'm not going to give it
any more voltage whatsoever until it's
on water so there you go guys that is
how to BIOS hack and over volt
technically it's not over bolted to do
an over volt you would actually have to
run
a hack into MSI Afterburner which is
going to be a separate video if I even
bother doing that there's some custom
code you have to change inside of MSI
Afterburner that will allow us to get
past that plus points or that plus six
to millivolts setting on there so until
we do that or you can go EVGA precision
15 which will allow you to go up to 1.3
volts in there as well so you're going
to have to actually have an overclock
program that's going to allow you to do
over volting in your graphics card so
there you go guys
again I'm not going to be able to tell
you guys where to get these tools you
guys we have to go and find them
yourself make sure you run the right
bios it will void your warranty and all
that stuff but you can regard it back to
stock if you need so guys I hope this
has helped you and very least I hope it
entertained you do this with your own
risk guys and tell me your results if
you actually do it and get a good result
so I'm gonna get the heck on out of here
follow on Twitter if you guys have any
questions and as always we'll see you in
the next one maybe it'll be a next
ninety nine overclocking video ok cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
