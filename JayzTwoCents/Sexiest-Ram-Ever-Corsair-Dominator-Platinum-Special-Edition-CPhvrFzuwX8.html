that we're gonna take a look at it's
actually some new RAM and probably some
of the sexiest Ram that I had ever seen
and trust me it something I've never
actually said in the same sentence sexy
and RAM but anyway with skunkworks guys
know i've been using the corsair
dominator platinum 3000 megahertz dims
I've actually got there's four in the
system now I've got four more here I was
running 64 gigs because of the 4k
workflow but you guys messaged the hell
out of me
telling me about Corsairs new special
edition both black and chrome plated
Dominator Platinum's you guys are like
you should get this for skunkworks you
should get this for skunkworks oh my god
would look so good and skunkworks and
you guys are right because I did all the
chrome fittings and the chrome back
plates you guys didn't realize was like
I've already had these guys on the way
right now for a limited time if you buy
an EVGA GTX 10 series graphics card you
get a power link for free learn more
about the free power link promotion by
following the link down below so what
we're gonna do today is we're gonna take
these guys out of the box we take a look
at them up close read a little
touchy-feely whereas Buffone with these
things we're gonna put them in the
system of course and see how it looks
before and after but I do have two of
these and what's interesting about this
is these are limited edition there's
only 500 available in each configuration
now these are two four stick kits so
technically I've got eight dims or
you're going in the system here and I
should have probably gone with the four
16s but oh well this way at least I can
play around with them in different
systems and not have to take them all
out of smoke works if I want to see how
they look temporarily another bildt's
Corsair also said hey make sure you take
a look at the packaging because these
are such limited availability they put a
lot of effort into that kind of a
premium feel with the box so we'll go
and take a look at all that as well so
here's what the current Dominator
Platinum's look like here ddr4 and ddr3
you look pretty much the same you can
see out there you've got your heat
spreaders on the sides you've got some
heat risers here on the top aluminium
bar but as you can see there is no light
bar openings on these it's actually
upgrade to get the light bar on here if
you want to install them on RAM that
doesn't already have it but anyway these
are 3000 megahertz dims right here and
of course the new ones here are 3,200
okay so we're gonna go ahead and do this
real gentle-like
because after all it's this boxes first
time
there we go look at it look at the
embossing on the box look at that that
is pretty you guys get mad at me for
using scissors last time I'm using a box
cutter now is that okay okay yeah there
you go
also too I forgot to mention that these
are indeed numbered so I've got number
47 and 48 of 500 there's only 500
available of each configuration so right
here you've got your little special
edition how they're made it tells you
all about it here they're numbered
package sent to you to enjoy we're
enjoying it but this is the part we care
about the most right here right so we
got four of these bad boys in here this
one oh wow look at this it even gives
you a little cleaning cloth that's cool
because they are chrome we'll take that
out in a second because they are chrome
you don't want to scratch them up three
and four and then five six seven eight
over there where I could open that one
yet you can see it there it's got its
light bar on the top so here's what they
look like side by side obviously it is
very shiny very very shiny and it is the
same on both sides and of course it says
dominator Platinum special edition on
there I'm not gonna do this four times
in a row here I think you guys kind of
get the idea what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
shut down skunkworks we're gonna put
these bad boys in and see how they look
so there you go guys that's just a kind
of a quick sexy first look here at
Corsairs special edition dominator
platinum memory and as you can see it
looks pretty damn good there and
skunkworks all lighting up looking
blingy and stuff but one thing I want to
mention here a quick is they do call
this one chrome what I find kind of
funny as it's not it is not super mirror
finish like chrome but it really is more
like a polished aluminum then more of a
chrome plated metal if you ask me so I
think it would be more of a polished
look if you will but besides that if
this isn't your thing if that's not the
color you're going for that you also
have black available but remember guys
it's extremely limited production 500
per color per sighs there's they've got
four times eight gigabytes and two times
sixteen gigabytes so only 500 available
in each color in each size and in this
case here 498 available because I'm
greedy and I snag two of them so with
that said guys it's time to go thanks
for watching this video let me know if
you want me to do more like just kind of
first look unboxings and stuff like this
I don't do a lot of unboxings and that's
okay but this one here I thought was
worthy of it because it is special
edition and limited so it's some people
might not be able to get their hands on
this and at least they can see what it
looks like and how its presented to you
but it's time to go and with that thanks
for watching guys and I will see you in
the next video or you'll see me anyway I
won't see all of you I might see some of
you but not all of you all right guys
take it easy see the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
