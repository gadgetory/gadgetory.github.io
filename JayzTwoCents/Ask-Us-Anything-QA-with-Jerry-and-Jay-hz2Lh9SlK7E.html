day I'm sitting here with none other
than Barbra Cleese nerdgasm now we've
had a long day it's late tonight it's
shoots going on midnight we had a long
day with Newegg TV we got to go to lunch
with Brett Rosewill we had I was cool we
had a lot of fun with the alt-tab show
I've even got swag from this speaker
sounds really good that's your really
cool blue t to be here we had a lot of
fun in the alt-tab show we figured we'd
take this opportunity while we're
sitting here together
to do something we may not get to do for
quite a while is do a Q&amp;amp;A with Jay and
Jerry here in person so before we get up
early in the morning tomorrow head on
down to Anaheim for the MLG event where
we hope to run into some fans and get
some people we decided we'll go ahead
and do a Twitter blitz of Q&amp;amp;A with Jay
and Jerry and as we're gonna do right
now we're gonna answer your questions I
got really energetic there yeah we need
it's like my second wave and I'm tired
alright so Jerry once you go ahead and
find the first question here and the if
you guys want to go and see some of
these questions that were asked the
hashtag actually was hashtag ask Jamie
and Jerry all right well let's start out
with Jose Garcia and he says how much
money is required to build a pretty good
gaming PC Jay what are your thoughts on
this a pretty good gaming PC pretty good
I would say that magic dollar figure two
we break into very good would be $1,000
I would agree $1,000 seems like about a
place where you can build a competent
machine they could play most modern
games and everything's time to play
everything the best it's not gonna play
a cutting edge but it should be able to
play everything yeah and you could buy a
PC for cheaper but it's not gonna last
years long in the future so I think
$1000 is that sweet spot agreed all
right our next question is from ian
savage and he says barnacle e's are you
ever going to do a draw my life video
like Jays two cents David question yeah
in the honest truth is yes I do plan to
do a draw my life video it's just a
really involved video type from what
I've seen I'm still trying to figure out
how to do it and find the right time to
do alright the next question is from
Alex he says any suggestion for a new
youtuber that's odd question it's a
broad question but we can just get
straight into the point with it any
suggestion for a new you
- uh quite honestly only do it because
you like it you have to look this is it
this is a labor of love don't do it for
the money because money yeah quick yeah
what you're getting money for this
alright our next question is from James
Bartlett and he says gaming has come a
long way in such a short time where do
you see it in five to ten years
J go on this one yep
I think people are gonna start making
that move towards VR virtual reality
I agree the oculus rift was a pretty
cool technical demo and I think with the
right high resolution screen that thing
could be a complete game-changer
all right our next question comes from
Andrew Evans he says when and how did
you guys meet is he related to Austin I
was just thinking that maybe it's really
Austin Evans in disguise it might be hey
guy and drew Austin alright so I can
start off with this one all right so the
cool thing was J was actually a larger
channel than me when I first met him a
friend of mine told me about him he had
thank you for saying larger channel
because if he said larger youtuber that
could be misconstrued as a fat joke well
he's a fat ass too but anyways it was a
larger Chet it's a beautiful ass up
anyways he had 18,000 subscribers I had
about 15,000 subscribers at that size I
felt like he was a lot larger me I
wanted to get in touch with him he was
doing cool videos and doing neat things
my friends liked him uh I didn't I
didn't want anything to do with him when
he was messaging me no you pretty much
you pretty much ignored me but then and
I hate to sound like a jerk saying that
but I I wasn't interested in trying to
meet anybody yeah I mean just to be fair
because you get to this point to where
you kind of shut everyone out because
you don't know who the trolls are yeah
but the cool thing was is I found a way
to give us attention i donated does
campaign for CES and it gave me an end
you make it sound like you bought my
friendship well buddy I did but
basically guys here's how it went I was
laying out there on the couch he'd made
the domain the donation he was DMing me
on skype or not Skype - of Twitter
because I followed you back we were
having a Twitter conversation basically
he says hey won't you just head on over
to Skype let's check out chat on skype I
was like no I'm just laying here
watching TV I'm gonna go to bed soon I
don't wanna
about an hour later we're still DN me
he's like clearly you're not going to
bed so just take your butt over to the
computer and get on skype so I called
them three hour phone call later with
bromance from the start next thing you
know I'm on a plane and now I'm living
with the guy
then he met Chris Parrillo and I was
like on the curb shut your mouth all
right next question is from frizz IW he
says who is the hottest obviously me
next question look at the guy he's
sweating it's obvious he's on the
hottest all right the next question is
from Lynn Wildwood she said what was
your first game system and or first
video game that you play a game question
from a girl alright so for that let's
see hold on I could go with that hard
pole position okay well he doesn't
conjures up some memories there and digs
them out of the archive my very first
game system was in an in television and
a funky little like dial pad as a
controller it looked like a foam pad for
a number or for a phone it was really
crazy and the very first game I ever
played on that was football it was just
called football you know it was a couple
of like 300 alternating pixels that made
a guy running that was it for me the
first game that I have like a really
good recollection in memory of playing
it was like my first real video game was
pole position on the Atari 2600
I think everybody's playful position and
honestly I Racing's a lot better so
Geoffrey frou-frou deep rowdy Jeffrey
crowd crude what's gonna wait crowd he
says so did you guys have any awkward
situation while he slept over well there
was that time what oh he's robbing other
you're pointing at me see we had an
awkward moment right now all right our
next question comes from seer the gamer
you said how long have you guys been
doing YouTube and when did you know you
wanted to start go ahead J I started my
channel
August 26 2012 and it was actually done
on a dare I've told this story before a
great guy by the name of holiday duck he
was an emoji Cod caster Call of Duty my
channel started guys because of Call of
Duty a lot of people's channel started
because of Call of Duty but I didn't
start with as a call Call of Duty
challenge it's the guy who got me with
the interests of starting the channel
dared me to do it he came into a live
stream I was doing for a friend who
traveled during the launch of
battlefield through his close quarters
and you want to see the gameplay so I
figured out how to live stream to twitch
and he happened to stumble in there he
felt that I was energetic and worth
watching so he told me he said hey
do YouTube doesn't know I want to do
YouTube and he said no you should do it
people would like you I said dude nobody
would like me everyone's mean on YouTube
I have no personality nobody would be
interested he goes I dare you this is a
dairy to do it just put up put up one
month's worth of videos and just see
what happens well in that first month I
had already gained like 500 subs and it
became addictive so we just kind of kept
it going and nearly two years later now
we're on a regular schedule and I have
absolutely no life so that makes it
really easy yeah well my story is I
started on a complete fluke actually
wouldn't bought something called a flip
video HD just to shoot video not for
YouTube just my own personal video and
one of the features on the camera was
the upload straight to youtube can show
straight up I literally used the
straight upload to YouTube for my first
3 or 4 videos that were just like simple
little product reviews just for fun I
thought it was cool and after that I
stopped doing it for like a year I
didn't upload anything for like a year
or two and then my mancave just grew out
of control because I got in an arms race
with a friend of mine and we basically
kept upping our computers upping our
displays upping everything just going
absolutely crazy and one day I walked in
and I was like damn the setup is so cool
I should be sharing this with people
this is definitely unique and so I
picked up the camera and the rest is
history and we've heard about three 46
inch monitors every day since and you'll
keep hearing about it until I go up to
50 inch monitors or 60 inch monitors or
three projector screens or just a direct
line into my brain I think the irony
here is as I approach 100k I did this
channel to prove that it would go
nowhere so Johnny McConville I think
it's McConville is 2 C's is it
McConville yep Johnny Mocambo says who
is the catcher and who's the pitcher
I'll be honest we've been so busy we
haven't had a chance to play baseball
this weekend yeah we'll get around to it
eventually
all right so Andrew Adkins on Twitter
says best tip for my first build take
your time quite honestly take your time
double-check your connections and just
make sure you've got everything you need
before you start I mean seriously yeah
it's nothing worse than starting a build
realizing you oak I have no thermal
paste or something like that yeah
and don't get in a hurry take it slow
your first build if it's your first
quite honestly expect it to take you all
day I agree all right our next question
comes from ninja commander and he says
why does using a web browser either
Firefox or Chrome how raise the temple
your GPUs like my sapphire r9 280x or
top toxic over
it's basically gpu-accelerated though
the way that it's rendering the browser
and everything inside of it is actually
leveraging your GPU to render it faster
I'm constantly monitoring my CPU usage
and stuff a month on that UI you've seen
popped up there if I open up my browser
I'll see that my GPU usage could jump up
from five to ten percent at all times
and stay there yeah but I've also
noticed I open up an entire set of tabs
when I open up my browser it's a default
tab I noticed that some of the websites
like socialblade you have just one the
ones that pop up if I close socialblade
my usage goes down by like 8% the
socialblade have any Flash content on it
it has lots of Flash content and it's
constantly refreshing itself
yeah well flash also is GPU accelerated
now so if you're on a web page that
loads or utilizes flash that's
definitely you're gonna see a GPU hit
Overlord Minton's asks you so awesome we
know
well guys this has been the first
edition I see first I'm sure they'll be
more fast I've asked J and Jerry keep
the hashtag rolling ask J and Jerry will
probably pick some every Thursday for
Tech Talk it sounds good I like it
notice unfortunately guys I have some
bad news Tech Talk next Thursday is not
gonna happen unfortunately and why is
that J life gets in the way guys I'm
travelling to New York City next week
June 23rd to 27th I'm gonna be out of
town I'm not even sure if I'm gonna have
any video uploads for that week I'm
gonna try it might be a good idea to
just take the week off and see what
happens but guys life gets in the way we
have daytime jobs and those are
obviously what keeps the lights turned
on and those come first so hope you guys
will understand there's no Tech Talk
with Thursday and video uploads this

the ground running the Thursday after
that we'll make it up to you somehow

in it to win a guy's just be patient but
