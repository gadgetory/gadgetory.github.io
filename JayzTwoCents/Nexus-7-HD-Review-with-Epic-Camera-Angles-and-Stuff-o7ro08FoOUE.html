watching Jays two cents and today we are
going to take an in-depth look at the
google nexus 7 7 inch tablet this is the
brand new 2013 HD model so let's get
started
now before we get started let me go
ahead and be brutally honest and tell
you the main reason why I bought this
tablet to begin with I own an iPad 4
we've got an iPad one for my daughter my
wife's got a kindle fire and i'm just
usually not a very big tablet person i
don't understand for the most part why
people would like tablets especially
when our smartphones can do everything
that a tablet can but the reason why i
got this to be perfectly honest was
because I wanted to hook it up to my
camera rig right here which is part of
my CES coverage equipment it's going to
go on a arm an articulating arm and it's
going to you know basically it's going
to attach kind of like this right here
so this is going to be my field monitor
for my camera rig and the reason why I
picked up a tablet for that it's because
it for the most part it is much much
cheaper to pick up an HD tablet than it
is to get an HD 7 inch monitor for your
you know your field use on a rig like
this so i decided i would go ahead and
give the tablet a shot and i got the the
software hooked up to it and it's
absolutely amazing it is really really
cool what you can do with it but before
i started messing around with the camera
I of course had to mess around with the
tablet and I found myself laying their
way into the night just playing with
Android because even though I I do have
a galaxy samsung s3 I don't really use
it too much this is a company issued
phone I don't like carrying two phones
so I tend to carry my personal phone
everywhere I go and this tends to sit at
home most of the time in fact I think
right now might even be might even be
dead let's see now turned on but anyway
but guys we're going to go ahead and
take a look at the nexus 7 the 2013 HD
model it's the second-generation Nexus 7
tablet and I went ahead and went with
the Nexus because it is stock and man
the phone booth oh wait for the verizon
tone but this is a second-generation
Nexus 7 tablet it's made by asus it's a
16 gigabyte model it's a Wi-Fi only and
it is an HD screen let's go ahead and
take a closer look at this device that's
compared its size wise to my iphone 5
and my galaxy s3 so you can see just how
small the 7 inch tablet really is but
yet giving you what feels like this huge
viewable
base it's going to take a look at that
up close and personal run the b-roll
hey guys let's go ahead and talk about
specs on this bad boy this thing is
sporting a quad-core Snapdragon s4
processor it's got a 1920 x 1200
megapixel camera or that's a huge camera
at 1200 1920 x 1200 screen 323 pixels
per inch it's got a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro as already
mentioned two gigabytes of RAM this is a
16 gigabyte storage model Wi-Fi only and
a 3950 milliamp battery that is probably
beating out some specs on your PC's
depending on what you've got it
definitely beats out some specs on the
work pcs at my office which is probably
just sad to say and when it comes to
battery life this thing is sitting at
about eighty nine percent battery right
now and I've already been using it for a
solid hour now taking a look at the back
of the tablet here um there's one thing
I don't really like about this tablet
and I'm just going to go ahead and point
out right now I'm not a fan of the way
that the power button I don't know just
the feel of it it feels kind of hard to
push at times it's it's not that big of
a deal i guess that's just a personal
preference of mine but when it comes to
physical buttons this is it there is the
power button and you have your rocker
switch right here for your volume then
you've got a microphone input right
there that's what that little hole is
you've got your camera right here on the
back i don't recall exactly what the
megapixel rating is of this i will put
it up on the screen probably post
processing you've got a nice nexus logo
here you've got the Asus logo right
there and then you've got your speakers
right here and your micro USB charger
plug right there on the front of the
screen there's really nothing to it
there are no physical buttons you have
your front facing camera right here and
as well as your proximity sensor and
you've got your soft keys now the DSLR
is just not going to be able to pick
this up as sharp as I masti in it so
you're just going to have to kind of
take my word for it so when it comes to
screen resolution this guy here is pack
in 1920 x 1200 that's a 323 pixel per
day or 323 pixels per inch in this
little screen that's more resolution
than my 27 inch desktop monitor
as in this 7-inch packets you can
imagine just how sharp it is your eyes
are not going to be able to pick up a
single pixel like no matter how hard I
look at this I cannot see any pixels in
this whatsoever they just put in
retrospect the nexus 7 compared to the
Galaxy Note 8 the Galaxy Note has a 1280
by 800 and 189 pixels per inch so when
it comes to pixel density you're
definitely getting it now one of the
things I never liked about Android in
the past and I did own Android for two
years before I ever owned a single I
device is the fact that I felt that the
scrolling on it was always a little bit
quirky like kind of choppy or jittery
the first thing I'm noticing here is
just like the newer Android devices I
mean the the processor on this is so
powerful that it is just I mean look how
smooth this Scrolls I mean it's probably
not getting justice on this on the
camera pick up here but it is just as
smooth as you could possibly ask for I
mean this is just this is beyond smooth
it definitely feels like the kind of
device that you would probably use on a
day-to-day basis I've been sitting for
hours one of the things that really
surprised me about this tablet is the
fact that i am not a huge tablet user
and i found it very comfortable to hold
this and sit on the couch or sit on the
toilet or wherever you may be sitting
maybe you're if you're sitting on your
brother's head or something I don't know
I found it very comfortable to hold I
mean one-handed it's it's as you can see
right here it is very very easy it's
comfortable the problem i have with the
ipad is the ipad is just too big
especially if you're you know you're
looking at the 10 inch model and even
the iPad Mini is just way overpriced I
mean this 16 gigabyte models coming in
at 229 US dollars for 229 dollars the
amount of power you get in this is just
insane and of course you get all of the
support of the google play store you got
the kindle store I mean you've got so
much going on here and let's go ahead
and load up some humber get hunk Hummer
Hummer games that's a whole different
kind of video guys a whole different
kind of videos let's go ahead and take a
look here and see how the video plays
this is the first time i played a video
on this so it has not a pre-rendered it
looks like it played SD a standard def
here I'm not sure it's going to switch
on us but either way sound quality on
this is really good the speakers are a
little bit small you know they are on
the back maybe that you can see the
camera the mic hello but we are playing
some Hunger Games here I don't want to
get in trouble so let's go ahead and
fast-forward here a little bit and see
we got see how fast it can seek
I think the camera doesn't pick it up as
sharp as it is in real life I mean with
that kind of pixel density you can just
imagine how sharp it actually is let's
go ahead and go home here so let's see
what our how fast can this thing load up
various apps i don't know let's go ahead
and load up a no vine see that popped
right up the ebay app i mean you can see
this thing is just very snappy i don't
have anything any of the other pages
though let's go ahead and do a google
search how do i get to walmart because
i'm a cheap bastard you know hey look at
that it found a walmart right there what
is the cruising speed of a laden swallow
and there's a google search this is
actually very snappy this is zach this
feels faster than Cirie how many
kilograms is one pound at that what is
the euro to US dollar conversion rate
for u.s. dollars Wow okay
how long does it take to swim across the
Atlantic Ocean I think it does a google
search for things that doesn't know so
I've never really used any of the google
talk stuff the google speak remember
what it's called this stuff was all in
beta the last time i had an android
device I let's see here tell me a joke
and it brings up joke so it's not quite
as intuitive a serie when it comes to
you no funny stuff but it definitely is
a navigate me to the nearest walmart
that's right it brings up the most
recent one there when was Disneyland
opened how many people visit Disneyland
each year there you go brings up ascom
ask nah ascom again people different
site different site entirely my god okay
Pandora here let's go ahead and see it
we've got how fast is it open up and
streams from pinned or I don't want to
register all right let's screw that of
course you've got your task manager you
know what Android device wouldn't have a
task manager on there okay so let's go
ahead and check out a game on here a
zombie world is a free game i downloaded
off the Play Store it's one of the
things I like about Android is there is
a lot of indie developers out there
making games for the Android device and
they're not nearly as expensive as iOS
games sometimes okay was it easy because
i'm a noob what if we got here an easy
come on zombies you a gig in here this a
visit Irene will get the zombies who use
Dombey bring out the big bomb what the
bomb being at the bomb Oh screw you
stupid zombies all right so as you can
see that was nice and smooth I mean you
see how fast that loaded up but you know
as I mentioned one of the reasons why I
got this specifically was because I
wanted to be able to control my DSLR
with it and that that's exactly what I
can do with this app right here called
DSLR controller now let's go ahead and
talk about whether or not this device is
worth your 229 dollars there are a lot
of tablets out there I mean you've got
the galaxy tab 3 that's out you've got
the note you've got the nexus here the
nexus 7 2 f HD 2013 don't confuse it
with the first gen x as the first gen
does not have a rear facing camera like
this one does right here I had initially
bought or I originally had bought the
Nexus tab too because it was a hundred
and sixty nine dollars but I went ahead
and I pulled you guys on Twitter and
asked if he felt that I had made a good
choice many of you said that you felt
that I should return it and get the
nexus 7 and when I compare the specs and
the price difference of 60 bucks it
definitely was worth it to go with the
nexus 7 now I don't have any direct
comparison of this with the tab to the
galaxy tab 2 because I never opened the
galaxy tab 2 didn't have a rear facing
camera it had a low resolution screen
versus this I think this was definitely
a no brainer so if you're looking for a
strong tablet that's not going to break
the bank has great battery life has a
great screen it's fast as you can see
gaming on it is it's certainly easy I
mean everything you do want here is just
super snappy I mean it is just so fast I
have absolutely no complaints what
ever with this device the touch on it is
pretty good as long as your fingers
aren't really oily when the screen
starts to get dirty the touch on it gets
a little bit finicky it's not too bad I
just I had to reboot it earlier because
I had been running it for so long I
think it had a memory leak and the
screen wasn't responding as much but a
reboot fixed all that but if you've been
around Android long and if you know
reboots are definitely necessary
sometimes it does not have a removable
battery so there is no expand with
expanded battery options but all in all
for 229 dollars I feel that this tablet
is just as good if not better than the
iPad Mini which would be lysates rival
in the same form factor the 7-inch
screen for half the price it's really
getting difficult to it honestly it's
really getting difficult to have any
sort of justification to have an apple
product when the pricing of this is what
it is I mean this is half the cost of a
16 gigabyte ipad mini Wi-Fi only I don't
know why you wouldn't want to go with
something like this for that kind of
price definitely going to improve this
device as AJ's by I've never done
anything like that i'm not going to
start doing ratings on products but this
is certainly a JS x because i bought it
i'm going to keep it and as i mentioned
earlier you guys are going to see it
attached to this rig getting all kinds
of excess or excess extra use especially
when it comes to CES and almost knock
myself out with this thing okay guys I'm
gonna get on out of here make sure
you're following on Twitter I do a lot
of fun stuff up there go to the Facebook
page all the stuff you need to know is
down in the description underneath this
video unless YouTube decides to do a
layout change throw it above the video
