no today I'm gonna try and stay calm on
this one my therapist says I get way way
too attached and emotionally invested in
some of this technology stuff so I'm
going to listen to her advice and I'm
going to coherently put put together a
video about Nvidia's brand new Titan CD
okay okay so Nvidia today announced the
brand new GTX Titan Z as if the name
couldn't already be stupider number for
me to Titan by the way they added a Z to
it okay so a year ago I did a video that
some of you guys said hey stop being
such an a noob or you mad bro or hey
stop getting all pissed off about this
 if you don't like it don't buy it
just just worked that way with me people
I love technology and I want everybody
to experience technology and that's why
I was mad about the thousand dollar
price tag on the GTX Titan thousand
dollars for one video card okay it was
nothing new I mean it was $1000 for the
590 was $1000 for the 690 but at least
those were dual GPU cards there were two
GPUs in there and the Titan was a single
GPU that was only marginally faster than
the 780 even though it came out first
and it still had locked CUDA cores okay
fine I was really mad about that and I
did a video on that and you guys saw it
and you liked it and some of you hated
it and I don't really give a rat's ass
right now if you wanna know the truth
and they came out with the GTX 780 Ti
which had fully unlocked gk110 potential
and guess what here it is in fact
there's one
there's two and I still have a GTX 780
sitting right here and have another one
in my system right there now why is this
even matter well we'll get to that in a
second because first we have to think
logically which I don't think Nvidia at
this point in time is capable of doing
what is Titan Z it's two of these on one
card with 12 gigs of gddr5 sure the TI
is only three is of gddr5 and the titan
is six gigs so two Titans or Titan black
editions which is the same exact GPU as
a 780ti two of those on one card
theoretically should be double the price
of a 780ti plus the additional gddr5 so
if I was even to estimate on the high
side and say that the extra six gigs of
what is currently on the Z versus what's
on these T is maybe 500 bucks that puts
you at $2,000 so how much does the Titan
Z cost it cost $3,000 now let's think
logically about this why does one plus
one equal three so when you try and
build a YouTube channel teaching people
about how to build computers and to
ditch their consoles and that you don't
have to be Bill Gates to build a
computer they come out with this
I'm sure the console fanboys are just
laughing it up over there in little
high-pitched squeaky voices just saying
I like pcs those bad enough you know
 you guys I mean seriously
Nvidia I just every time I start to
really think team green again you come
up with this kind of okay okay okay
I'm not I'm not I'm gonna let it go I'm
gonna I'm gonna let this one go I'm
gonna let you guys rage and troll all
you want in the comments because the
joke is really on anyone who buys this
piece of if you are going to spend
$3,000 on one coin
the joke is really on you it me
seriously
hey Jay did you hear about the new Titan
Z Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
