hey there good ride to Z I may or may
not have made the Z very loud
I didn't even remove the mufflers just
the resonators so right now it doesn't
sound any different than it normally
does huh
yeah I just wait waiting you already
know if it's just right there
you
freeway fury entrance
but yay
hey what's up guys base $0.02 here and
we are I forgot to say what we're
actually going to be doing today we're
going to be putting together the racing
send the GT Omega art cockpit that I've
had over a year now
yeah everybody's got a lot December of
2014 but I didn't have a place to put it
and it got taken apart and now that we
moved I got a place to put it we're
going to put that together and now we're
here at Lowe's because we need a way to
cable manage that bitch I wanted velcro
straps I don't see any bail Christians
but I do see you know like these
reusable bags right here these could
work
yeah do I need this many though there's
a shortcut right here this is a big in
zip ties look at the shoes I don't know
I don't know if I do really need
anything else so I just need to wait a
cable manage that I've already got a
power strip mounted to it so that I can
use my you know monitors and stuff I'll
plug in that the idea what the racing
cockpit was I want it to be kind of like
one unit where everything is attached to
it has its own power and the only thing
I have to plug in is one power plug and
one USB hub adapter to the computer so
that everything is just easy to move
around so that's the goal so Jay was
just giving me shit about my shirt this
is boss Ryan then he realized he was
wearing his Nissan shirt yeah well you
know at least they give me a discount
what is what I can give you problems all
right so this is the GT Omega art racing
cockpit now it's actually kind of a
modular thing here we'll do a full
review at the end but I'm gonna show you
kind of what I'm doing one it's got the
racing seat on here and what's cool is
it's on a track so it slides forward and
back it has full reclining capabilities
here as you can see it fits a big guy
like me with no problem plus a seat does
actually have some height adjustability
on it granted you have to undo bolts and
move it up and down it's possible now to
look over here at the wiring you can see
it kind of got a little bit
discombobulated it's not that big of a
deal but that's where we're going to be
doing today I have the shooter the
shitter I have the shade
on the right away I have the shifter set
up on the right because uh well American
we start on the left side of the car but
if you happen to be one of those folks
that have right side seating and you
want to mimic that you can actually pull
this piece off right here it literally
just bolts it on the side on this rail
flip it around put it over here then you
have a shift around the lift so it's
kind of neat that it's modular like that
now if you look down here there are
these and never mind any of the dust
you're going to see this has been in a
closet or in a garage for a year you can
rotate these and then the two bottom
halves come apart and now you've got
almost but it's kind of like a game
chair I sort of want one of these and
then you can actually pull that out too
I want one of these quite honestly as
like a like a gaming chair for consoles
or whatever yeah I play consoles in
Forza oh hey that's actually kind of
nice but the chair is very very
comfortable it's got lots of lumbar
support granted II don't need any of
this lateral support here it is designed
to make it feel like you're in a race
car so that's a neat thing cereal we're
going to do I'm going to coconut monkey
um kind of document here where I'm going
to do with the cables and stuff we'll
get this all hooked back up and I have
to kind of rebuild a computer for this
thing too because I've taken parts off
of that now it doesn't have a computer
anymore
I prepared bad bad bad Babs
did you do bad bad got click-click-click
are you doing a lot of steps to get
anywhere and all stairs every time you
forget something I exercise though I
forget something yeah so are you hanging
up
well that bolts in there I'm gonna do I
agree my skewed over a few moments later
babe we're good now
ah rug burn I rolled hair off my knee I
don't think you're old I think you just
pull it right off all right so I mean
this one kind of got all the additional
bells and whistles on it pretty much
comes without this part that holds the
monitor it's just the frame so it's kind
of thing you would like slide up to your
desk and call it a day like I said I
want this to be as modular as possible
so GT Omega hooked me up with kind of
all the add-ons like the little table
that's over there on the chair or on the
couch that's my mid-foot right here I
just had this mount to here like this so
that I didn't lose the damn thing but
yeah I'm gonna end up taking all this
off right now anyway cut and zip ties
watch feet oh they say yeah you see on
this carpet it would be it's better to
house I don't know right that was the
best thing about that carpet though you
get head zip ties and everything on
living
until I walked in and down the moon yeah
the way I've got this going here there's
not a lot of you on the skid ready I
just want to leave with some things up
so I've got a mouse and keyboard are
going to go on here to this really it's
kind of its own standalone complete
workstation which the tables put on
there but so a USB hub that I have mouse
and keyboard plugged into and which
means that I'm going all I have to do is
plug in the USB cable just kind of
hiding right here and uh she's right
here no wait crazy where is it it's
hiding anyway there's USB cable that
comes off here somewhere and then that's
all I need oh wait wait found it found
it I plug this guy into the PC and it
will have the mouse the keyboard and the
steering wheel all attached to it now
I'm going to give a little shameless
plug here I know I do have a promo code
for GT Omega racing and it works uh they
have a Europe store and they have a US
store now so look in the description of
this video and you will find the link to
the discount code and you can save some
money while at the same time supporting
the channel and they sell not just these
you know racing simulators and set bales
to sell the office chairs and gaming
chairs and all of that sort stuff so
it's really it's really worth if you're
looking at getting a new chair and said
I don't even know this power blog is
work yeah almost
it's a code for USB no I think this is
the power plug for the steering though
it's the hardest part with anything like
this man is just the amount of wires and
stuff you know uh I think I could relate
but I mean keeping this nice and neat
and like I said I want to be modular so
that I can just move it around easily
mm-hmm yeah part of me really wants like
a thrust master or even something even
better than that but I just I just can't
bring myself to spend that kind of money
right
you know the Thrustmaster is 500 bucks
by itself and he gets something kind
like with Jerry has now it's like 2
grand load sell break and all that stuff
which is kind of nice but like I said
I'm not gonna spend that kind of money I
would like to see a racing simulator
though cockpit I guess what everyone
call it is some sort of cable management
built in I think companies forget about
the amount of cables and things that you
literally are going to hook it up to
this kind of like a bicycles do all the
cables inside the frame this these days
yeah like carbon-fiber bikes
yeah because yours go inside the frame I
don't think so though mine doesn't
either well they're mine passes through
the frame on some pots but yeah bobbing
your body dude cutting the zip ties
mm-hmm put the night he's so hardcore
well if I use my good it won't get mad
oh yeah Jay hasn't seen wanted I had to
show it to me yesterday once it was a
terrible movie I like this so how many
times did you hear me be like uh I think
my favorite part was a when the you
chuckle when they did the Corvette and
my yeah when they use the Corvette is a
ramp yeah so it's got visa mount you can
see it's adjustable side to side here
nothing too fancy but I guess the job
done should be using like a twelve
millimeter wrench here but we've already
established this lazy thing earlier
would you do it for Red Vine no that one
he goes again did that exercise we're
they're having this around and stuff
it'd be fun to play battlefield on here
again you know we need a lot of work
power graphics cards like a lot well not
I mean not too too much but require
there's a lot of pixels in three-way I
said you know just the heights of these
match I gots telling you before you
started the camera though there's a lot
of bezel on these panels that's why I'm
kind of like
yeah when it comes to it hmm but well
it's perfect for doing spreadsheets
though let's talk about editing rig and
a County rake my 3d you know full motion
editing rig right it's kinda like a bit
free thing
yeah I'm just adjusting the height of
the monitors also one kind of make sure
the angle is at least somewhat similar
here so the three panels are hooked up
and the adjustment on them I wish it was
a little bit easier to get them adjusted
on their height but literally you have
to just loosen these screws right here
and slide it up and down you know get
the arms where you want them and tighten
everything down the problem is sometimes
when you tighten it then things move a
little bit as it torques down but in any
case we've got it pretty much acceptable
where it is that and I I was torn on
whether or not I wanted to stick with
the three 24-inch panels which I feel is
kind of small for a setup like this
versus getting like say a big 46 inch TV
to put right here with the problem with
that and this in my experience is the
racing simulators when you have a single
screen tend to kind of squish a lot of
it down into that panel so you can see
the side mirrors and stuff on racing
Sims remember this is ideally going to
be for iRacing and project cars and
things like that
so I went ahead and stuck with the 3-way
surround here because this is easy
enough to change it's literally just on
this pole right here take the panels off
and I can switch it later if I want so
you guys tell me if you think the
surround setup or the single large panel
setup I'm kind of torn alright so what
I'm going to do now is this is literally
like my desk Platteville's meant to go
on here this is a custom piece I don't
know if this is available to order they
did send it to me I did request it but
in any case this is what I am pretty
much using to have you know a desk set
up here so that I can still have
keyboard and mouse on both ends it kind
of sucks because the way that would be
mounting the steering wheel means that
it's screwed down and I can't just move
the steering wheel technically I mean I
could if I just want to use the clamp
but then again when I kind of get into
the simulator and I'm steering and stuff
I don't want any chance of that clamp
coming off so let's go ahead and hook
this thing up and
you should be much to go after that what
to put together a computer obviously
it's kind of one of the most fun parts
so literally you just lay this thing on
top and then push the screws through and
it's got some nuts nuts nuts that go
through on the backside which I'll do in
a minute let's say it holds it that up
there so doesn't slide away and then the
screws on the bottom are least the
threading on the bottom of the steering
wheel then lines up with these two holes
so the steering wheel isn't going to
move around and go anywhere and then you
can actually just use the clamp as you
can see they've even got these square
pieces right here designed to make it
thicker where the clamp would attach to
it so you could make it clamp style only
if you wanted but they provide you all
the hardware so why wouldn't you use the
actual mounted location then you can use
steering wheel kind of hold it in place
so you can get your nuts on get your net
started you guys can take it however the
heck you want damn it and drop my nut in
my face okay
these are the screws that go in and hold
up the steering wheel so the steering
wheel doesn't go anywhere wonder why
more racing games don't feature the 370z
what what is so funny about that
well that's the cool thing about this
right I showed you how you can do the
loosen up these wheels right or these
little knobs right here and you can
bring out higher if you want so all you
leave yourself enough slack on the
cables you know yeah I also lowered the
shipped into the shifter as well yeah
you did didn't you yeah that's actually
kind of like where it is in my car it's
like super oh yeah any little shifter
almost got me he almost got me
you got guy reach large bar than that
alright so this is the way it looks
behind I still have to cut some of these
straps actually it's about as good as
it's gonna get quite honestly I guess it
doesn't look that bad like cooking
like he said it kind of looks like a
race car back there but we've also got
shutters so you can actually see we've
also got this thing that comes with it
you repeat the sound effects for that
okay so that way it's not sitting
directly on your floor I guess this
would be more for like hardwood floor
they even have caster wheels that you
put on the bottom is that come with it
obviously I'm not using those but yeah
honestly I thought it was racing sim now
with free yoga mat all right so coconut
milk and I just spent the last hour two
hour and a half or so trying to find
racing harness because we thought this
thing needed a racing harness what woke
one up eventually like to order it off
eBay I'm not getting no real real
Sparkle or anything like that must been
that kind of mine but anyway here it is
right here let me know if you guys want
me to do like a full review of this
thing I just thought I would go ahead
and vlog putting it back together which
is nice now I decide to build a computer
for it which one take that long we go do
a video about that but this is it this
is how it looks in the corner of the
room go come over here so you can see
how how much room it doesn't really take
up to to much I think it looks good
there if you can't tell by the pictures
on the wall this stuff this is kind of
going to turn in to sort of the mancave
movie room except for those those are my
toys over there by the way those are my
toys don't judge anyway there you go
guys hope you guys have enjoyed remember
there is a coupon code so you can get
some money off your own GT Omega racing
stuff chairs racing cockpits whatever
you guys want over there there is a
coupon code check the description of
this video and you can find that anyway
thanks for watching guys we will see you
in the next video you can take the low
life out of the car but you can't blow
life out of the driver
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
