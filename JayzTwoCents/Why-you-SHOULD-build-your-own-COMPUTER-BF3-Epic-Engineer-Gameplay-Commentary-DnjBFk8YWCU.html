his dog tags his name was beer I killed
it I killed here do it shoot my who are
you to beer no no no no no no really
really do you guys on the stream just
see that straight fat pro straight I was
side to side strafing leather do is
shoot meatiness and then I was reloading
and then that killed a man that's the
guy the streams oh oh my god that was
awesome okay I'm dead that was it so
cool what's going on guys you're
watching Jays two cents and by popular
demand and bringing you some more
commentaries regarding conversations
that you guys want to have with me about
building and upgrading and fixing your
own computers and today's topic if you
can't read or tell by the title its
reasons why you should build your own
computer but before we get to that it's
going to talk about the commentary we're
looking at some battlefield 3 action
here I start off it here in the chopper
and I don't have a very good beginning I
mean I get some kills and I get some you
know kill Dale aircraft and vehicles and
whatnot but it just wasn't really
working out so then I hop on now and I
basically give you guys a pretty good
show on how to play the engineer class
and I went pretty clutch right at the
end I got 10 kills in a row and it just
check it out enjoy the gameplay but
let's go and get back to the topic and
the reason why we're here I put together
a simple list of reasons why you should
build your own computer and they're not
really in any particular order because
what's important to me or what's
important you is going to be different
and the benefits for everybody's going
to be a little bit different but over
all these key points if you will pretty
much can apply to everybody
first and foremost you're gonna save
money companies that build computers and
sell computers they've got to make a
profit they've got to take the parts and
they've got us raise the price on them
and they've got a cover overhead they've
got a cover you know insurance costs for
business warranties employees
electricity bills all that stuff and you
don't have to worry about that when it
comes to building your computer so
you're going to save money because
you're not going to be dealing with
markups and if you really take the time
to do price shopping you can get some
really good deals out there especially
feel of near microcenter but even if you
don't there's a lot of companies all
around the world selling computer parts
and I think unfortunately for all of you
Australians I think you guys really got
the short end of the stick when it comes
to parts in the world because everything
you guys get it's just going to be
really expensive and overpriced so
unfortunately for you guys you know it's
going to be expensive no matter what you
do but for the rest of us we usually
have options everywhere in the world
Europe Asia Middle East united states
canada mexico south carolina south
carolina it's it's own continent now I
guess South America there are retailers
everywhere newegg is a huge one here in
North America and you've also got NCIX
Canada and America so if you go and shop
the prices of computer components you're
really going to save some money if you
just do it yourself number two you have
control over all the pieces that go in
your computer most of the time if you're
going to buy a gaming computer rendering
computer work computer laptop whatever
you have a base model and then you can
make some changes in some add-ons but
you're really limited to whatever they
place in the drop-down so it's not going
to be specifically your computer as if
you were to build and pick out every
single piece by hand that you want in
your system that you feel you know
customizes it towards your needs number
three you have more respect for your
computer and for yourself if you've
never built a computer there's nothing
more exciting there's nothing that feels
better than saying I built this I put
this together i'm using this my own
blood sweat and tears and you know all
of the product research and all the
pulling my hair out trying to figure out
what parts mean what what's important
it's just gonna mean a lot more to you
you know you've probably heard that old
clich√© of you know you have more
respect for you know doing things
yourself than having things
provided for you and whether or not you
by a computer building it is certainly
going to make you have a newfound
respect and I get your guys's tweets and
your messages and your emails all the
time saying sending me pictures of the
computers that you built because of the
videos that I've made to help you and
that makes me super excited because I
want all of you to experience the
amazingness that is building your own
computer but you kind of leave this
number four if you've never built a
computer you're going to obviously have
to learn how to do it and by learning
how to build the computer means that you
can also you know learn how to repair it
if you need it and you know if when it
comes to exchanging components and
taking out video cards or motherboards
and whatnot once you do it once you
realize it's really easy there's really
nothing you know to it's like putting
together Legos it really is it only fits
one way it only goes in you know one
place and it's it's so easy it's
honestly like just plugging together
some Legos unless you want to do a
really custom water cooling loop or you
know a custom case or case modding you
don't need to know any of that to put
together a computer turn it on play some
games and just have some fun which
brings us to number five yo you because
you're going to choose the parts and
because you're putting it together
you're going to know where the parts
came from if you're gonna order a part
brand new and it's got the factory seal
on it it's got the cellophane it's got
all that stuff you're not going to deal
with any of those computer companies in
the past that have been uncovered and
basically exposed for using refurbed
parts are returned used parts in a
computer and selling to you is brand-new
at a brand new price there's a lot of
companies out there I'm not going to
name any names right now but there are
companies out there that it's been
exposed for that selling you new parts
or what they label as new parts and they
happen to be nothing more than refurbs
or returns or rma's that's just shady
right there because the company wants to
get as much money as they can and
they're not gonna tell you hey we're
gonna put a used motherboard in your
computer that you just pay two thousand
dollars 40 k dekh ke bro all right bro
here you go here's your use motherboard
2 grand okay etching we went and you
kind of lose in that aspect number six
it really is easy like I've mentioned
it's honestly nothing more than putting
together LEGO pieces and parts I mean
you the motherboard
it's gonna it's a mother book it's going
to mount into your case you just gotta
line up the screw you stick it in and
there you go graphics cards plug into
the pci express port it's one screw in
one tab and depending on the card you go
with it's either one power cable or two
power cables and even if you wanted to
go with multiple cards all you do is
connect the little SLI or crossfire
bridge and guess what most of the time
your operating system and the drivers
for the graphics cards are going to
automatically recognize hey we've got
two cards in here we're going boss mode
and we're going to go ahead and just
optimize ourselves to say hey we've got
two graphics cards so let's just just go
ahead and use both of them and it's just
that simple power supplies are probably
I think one of the more complicated
parts of choosing computer parts that
you may have to do a little bit more
research on but as long as you stick
with something that's like 80 plus
bronze are higher and you have plenty of
wattage to cover your system then you're
not going to really have any issues
there and we're gonna have to do a whole
nother conversation regarding power
supplies and under sizing or oversizing
your power supply because believe it or
not you can buy a power supply that is
too big for your computer now whether or
not you're lucky she may or may not said
it's too big by day that's what she said
right okay whatever I digress maybe we
come back all right number seven here
the number one reason honestly why you
should build your own computer is simply
because you can you can do this I've
said this a year ago and one of my first
videos on YouTube that you guys really
really liked is that it empowered you
guys to feel like hey this is easy I can
do this we've done some live streams of
live computer builds in my last life
computer build I had guided my friend
through it who would never built a
computer before you guys saw firsthand
just how easy it is in less than two
hours to put together a brand-new
computer if you've never done it before
it's so simple I think a lot of people
are really afraid of damaging their
components are there parts because you
know it's a lot of money it's an
investment but you really have to try
today to damage your computer putting it
together and you honestly can guys you
can do this you can save money choose
your pieces and you'll have
a newfound respect for a new hobby and a
new ability that you've just learned in
a new skill by putting together
computers and then you like me can deal
with everybody saying hey they'll be a
computer hey fixed my computer hey it's
not working anymore can you come over
and take a look my computer it's
actually not so bad i mean it's if i
didn't do this sort of thing we wouldn't
be making a channel like this movie guys
it's really easy do me a favor continue
to send me your tweets and your messages
about your computer and i would love to
see him i would love to hear and check
it out we won and i want you guys to
check this out look at this score 15 and
