welcome to 2018 and I told you we were
gonna finish this build and we're
getting closer and trust me I get tired
of showing it off as much as you guys
are tired of looking at it I think but
we have a care package remember I said I
ordered some stuff from performance -
PCs comm go and check them out but
here's the care package they sent me and
this is what we needed to get this done
the new dg7 series cases from EVGA offer
PC enthusiasts more of what they love
like tempered glass side panels vertical
GPU mount integrated RGB control board
DG tuner and an awesome three-year
warranty to learn more about the dg7
series of cases from EVGA head to the
link in the description below
bla bla bla bla bla bla so I got this
right here which is really important
this is the aqua computer it's a filter
and it's not meant to be left in the
system full-time it's designed for
cleaning systems but you could leave it
in there full-time if you wanted I'm not
gonna be doing that but we're gonna be
running a the Mayhem's blitz cleaning
kits a two part kit and it's designed to
get anything that might be stuck to the
radiators out of there flush or flux and
any of that solder material and even
though radiator manufacturers will will
try and convince you that they're clean
and ready to go out of the box you don't
believe them just clean your systems out
but instead of just letting like the
Blitz just circulate that crap all
throughout the loop and redeposit it
somewhere else we're gonna let it
deposit right here inside of this filter
now it's pretty neat to mesh filter it's
gonna capture big stuff little stuff and
this is gonna allow us to make sure that
we get a nice clean system because we
don't want to have any sort of color
reaction we don't wanna have any sort of
fallout I haven't decided what coolant
I'm gonna go with yet but either way I
need to clean the radiator so when I'm
done getting this loop all setup and all
the tubing cut then we are going to take
the radiators out we're gonna set up the
blitz cleaning set like in the kitchen
and we're gonna let this run for like 24
hours capturing all the junk that it
possibly can't believe it that's that's
quality right there so something else
that I got here was a crap ton of
fittings which is usually some one of
the most expensive like parts that add
up to a system is the custom fittings
but these right here are actually the
bits power
multi
Lync fittings are twelve millimeter
diameter fittings because I'm gonna be
doing in this system glass these are
twelve millimeter glass tubes right here
they're for silly i'ts or whatever I'm
sure I completely butchered that but
anyway it's it's that that kind of glass
like science glass that's what it is but
we are gonna be doing twelve millimeter
glass tubing I haven't done glass tubing
in a while I've only done it once
actually and it was in that fractal
design defined nano s build that I did
still together by the way never took
that system apart so I decided a system
this high-end and this custom and this
elegant needs the last tubing so that's
what we're gonna do and then of course
with that we got a new glass tubing kit
for cutting kits we got gloves to
protect our hands we've got eye
protection to protect our eyes and then
we've got some sandpaper to smooth it
out and then we've got some bubble wrap
but then we've got a new set of cutters
right here I've got a pretty cheap glass
cutter that's like a little squeeze
thing it's like a that's terrible anyway
it was like ten bucks this is designed
to score the glass because the way and
we'll show you in this video the way
that you you cut the glass down to size
is you have to score it you wet it and
then you snap it and it breaks where you
score it if you do it right it's a clean
break sometimes it's jagged which is why
we have the sandpaper and stuff but
enough talking let's just go ahead and
play around
all right so the loop is done I'm really
happy I went with the custom glass
because glass is so clear part of the
problem I have a PT G especially is it
always looks slightly dull I've used
this analogy before and I'm in knowledge
you guys can do it at home look at your
thumbnail you'll see if you hold it in
the light just right you can see those
these grooves and liens in your thumb
and that's exactly what PT G looks like
and just always has a slight big cloudy
look the glass is super clear so kerlix
kind of in between the glass and the PT
G in terms of clearness PT G is a lot
easier to work with obviously than glass
but that's kind of the challenge here
we've got this super elegant high scale
case that deserved this super high-end
loop we got singularity PC parts and/or
singularity computers I key call it pcs
singularity computers parts we've got
all the bits power fittings which are
handling all of our bends for the glass
you can get and I need agree bent glass
tube you can get it from performance -
pcs comm which is pretty much where
everything you see here is available
when it comes to water cooling but I
like the way the fittings look
especially since I wanted to fill it
fill it out and make it look kind of
busy I think it did really well but the
glass is pretty easy I mean if you have
the right tools anyway it's just like
any job can only do as good as the tools
that you have and wear that to will be
your knowledge or a specific tool needed
for something like you know cutting and
breaking glass then I'm happy I got the
new cutter because the cutter I got off
Amazon the first time I tried it I
really cheap tout because I wasn't sure
if it was something I was gonna do a lot
of so I did not get a good glass score
and so it it was hard to work with this
time I use something a lot better for
scoring the glass and it was pretty easy
I mean you score it it didn't try and
walk it gave me a perfect circle and
then once you wet it you just give it a
little bit of a pressure like twisting
and but you pull apart as you're doing
it how'd you do it just snaps apart
you're by creating a score or a scratch
in the glass you're giving the glass
sort of a track to break a park on and
that's all you're doing with that but
like the extra trick is getting it wet
that's why I was putting it in water or
pouring water on it to get water in the
crack and then let's say this is where
it's you know I'm gonna I'm gonna score
and break it right there and you don't
twist like this you give a little bit of
pressure as you're pulling apart and if
you do that the right way
then you get a pretty clean cut this is
actually one of my breaks right there I
have
deburred it yet it's never gonna be
perfectly flat and mr. cutting it with
like a proper machine that cuts glass
which obviously I don't have but this is
more than good enough to get the job
done but obviously the glass is delicate
I mean it's pretty it's pretty robust
and handling it it's not gonna break
that easy if I dropped it on the conker
right now clearly it would but it's it's
a lot like tempered glass it's pretty
robust until it's not and then when it's
not it shatters it's really not that
hard I mean what I do to make sure I
don't waste any glass because it's not
cheap it's not super cheap as I use ten
by twelve millimeter ptg tubing cut that
all to length then I mark the glass and
cut the glass plus it gives us a really
good template to keep retrying if we we
have a bad break or we you know rather
than cutting the glass for me like oops
and tossing it we have extra PT G which
is a lot cheaper I didn't want to
actually do a bunch of fittings on the
top I played around with that I put a
picture up on Twitter you should be
following a social media he was seeing
all the behind the scenes of putting
this together it looked too crowded and
too busy it was just too much happening
there I didn't like the way it look so
instead I decided to bring it out in
front of the reservoir it's offset from
this piece back here and it's higher
than the piece in the back right here so
they kind of frame each other out which
gives us just a really neat full look
now in terms of fluid haven't decided
what I'm gonna do yet I've got three
batches of fluid that are mixed up right
now and I've been nickel tell you I'm
constantly holding it up and looking at
it and I can't make up my mind one is a
UV green Matt may have his pastel the
sand green I'm using in skunk works
that's held up for two years with no
color changer issue we've also looked at
the UV green from Prima chill that's the
view the same stuff we tested out Nick's
computer for a while until we tore it
apart to see what happened with the
blocks of course it was like slightly
abrasive so it was cleaning our blocks
which isn't too bad and then I also have
some Mayhem's xt-1 which is a clear that
a custom mixed green in to make it look
like an automotive coolant I don't know
a lot of you were like you should I just
got coolant but I I wanted to use stuff
specific to water cooling for computers
and I think I think that one's out if
you wanna know the truth because it's
it's a such a different shade of green
than the rest of the green that's in the
system that it just looks too different
so I think that one's gone so for me
it's between the Mayhem's pastel and the
primo chill view and you guys won't even
know
would I go with until either I show it
on social media or you guys see the
final video because the next video you
guys see this it will be done the only
thing left to do now is lil wiring and
then of course I've got a custom back
plate being made by my friend Joe and
he's gonna be he's milling that for me
and that's gonna be covering up the
wires on the back and then put the glass
panels on it's gonna look super clean
because we have no SATA drives we have
no SATA cables and no SATA power to
worry about for those we do have SATA
power for the control boxes for the
these are the mag level 120 RGB fans got
six of those lots of cables to have to
manage with those are terrible I wish I
wish Corsair coming with a better way to
connect power and RGB with those fans
daisy chain them something every other
manufacturers daisy chaining them but
they're not so I don't know what that's
all about but anyway I digress I'm using
a proprietary in wind power supply the
power supply that comes with this case
is meant for this case it's the same one
that actually were was in the Terry
Crews it doesn't have the same mounting
holes as a standard power supply and of
course we could have made an adapter and
use any power supply we want we've got a
high rated power supply that comes with
its 1000 65 Watts more than enough for
this system my cable mod also supports
custom cables for in wind power supplies
so I'm actually using their cable
configurator which is allowing me to put
custom links in there play around with
the colors to see what I like - it looks
like in different materials I considered
going with a paracord which they have
available but I think I'm going to end
up going with mod mesh instead we'll
just have a brighter more vibrant color
which is what we kind of want for this
but the cool part is when you use the
configurator you tell them what power
supply you have you tell them what
cables you want so obviously in this
case we'll be using a 24 pin 8 pin EPS 4
pin a +4 pin EPS for the CPU - 8 pin PCI
Express - 6 pin PCI Express and we need
a SATA for our fans for the RGB control
box we might get a couple extra cables
just in case but the best part is you
can play around with it see what it
looks like change each individual wire
color to figure out exactly how you want
it then you tell them the links you tell
them the material you can even go with
thicker wires if you want which we'll
probably be doing for this and then they
make them they send them to you and
there are they're really not all that
expensive in the grand scheme of things
you think about what
some like this cost and the fact that we
have over 500 dollars in fittings alone
for this glass tubing then what you pay
for the custom cables is really not that
bad if you take a look at it but
obviously it's a luxury for a luxury
system so I wouldn't have it any other
way
anyway guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching like I said you're not gonna
see this again in another video until it
is done which should should be right
after CES once those cables arrive we'll
get to it and we'll get it done anyway
guys tell me what you think in the
comments below thanks for watching and
as always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
