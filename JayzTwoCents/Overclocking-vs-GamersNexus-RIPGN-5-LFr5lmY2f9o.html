I am I'm quite happy with that okay
sixteen six six three so I stopped here
is that good enough alright we talked
about our 3175
ex overclocking excursions if you guys
haven't seen that yet you should go back
and check out that particular video but
this is the revamping of the RIP TN
series we've had this CPU now for like
five months maybe even more I'm not sure
we've had the motherboard but you know
we didn't really have before was a
cooling solution for it and alva cool
was gracious enough to send over one of
their blocks for it we talked about it
in that video so make sure you guys go
and check that out if you haven't
already because we're gonna do right now
I'm gonna go in here and I'm gonna kind
of dial back our overclock just a little
bit because the problem with riff GN
even though there's enough booting from
your honor detect memory oh it's a good
start
with their 9 blade designed the skier on
D RGB fans from Italia offer a balance
of performance and aesthetics available
in both 120 and 140 millimeter sizes the
ski run fans are sure to fit any size
builds hub mounted LEDs provide a wide
spread of lighting while the daisy chain
of a wiring harness and cherry tidy
wiring job every time to learn more
about the skier on RGB and D RGB fans
from metallic gear click the link in the
description below okay so I'll be honest
I don't know the first thing about this
CPU it makes no sense to me
so we did while the trucks are out there
emptying the trash bins right now I just
went well let me just go and do a test
and I dropped my core clock down to four
seven from four eight but I upped my
core cache just a little bit and we just
now got almost 300 points higher than we
got in that 3176 we were freaking out
six thousand nine hundred and thirty-two
almost seven thousand points that's
where we started right there when we
first started overclocking this thing so
look at that I don't understand this CPU
at least the one that we've got so I'm
gonna run this again though just to make
sure it's not some sort of an anomaly
but like I said if you look at Steve
scores and granite wood this is like
five months later since he did his or
six months or whatever it is we did
download a new bios for this motherboard
I don't know if that makes much of a
difference but we're getting
significantly higher CPU scores than him
with significantly less cooling and
frequency if you guys recall if you look
if you go look at his scores and I'll
have I'll have Phil put it on the screen
just so you guys could compare we have
to see what his where he's at to know we
need to be to be able to beat him right
that's how a competition works and so we
pay attention to scores very closely we
realize he's running five gigs five gigs
on chilled water I remember that wasn't
that was amazing I thought twenty-eight
cores at five gigs that's insane on
chilled water we're not on chilled water
this is our radiator right here this is
our alpha cools XT whatever sixty Mick
milk with not even a push-pull config
with Vardar fans running a hundred
percent it's not even a high fpi fin
count so it doesn't make sense to us
that a slower speed could be a faster
speed unless it's a lot like GPUs with
this particular core count where max
frequency is not necessarily
fastest but I would have I know Steve
he's intelligent he he would have
stepped this up incremental II and seen
if there was a diminishing return he
knows how to overclock we tried so hard
to match his score without using Titans
because we just thought that'd be badass
right
we've got 220 atti for the win three
cards right here that we've got custom
bios available for that would allow us
to just remove the power limit but the
problem is these are at kingpin cards
which means we don't have any control
over voltage and stuff like that which
means that we're still stuck with max
overclock ability at stock voltages well
guys it's gonna happen I'm going to take
the Titans out of here I'm going to take
them apart I'm going to shut mod them
put them on chilled water and with that
cpu score of ours if we get anywhere
near Steve's overclocks on these we
should take the crown back these cards
were obviously launch cards and the
problem was these cards have two
different BIOS on them one I think has
like an 11% power limit an additional
power limit and one is fourteen one of
these cards is like more GIMP than the
other and I think I think that is why
when we did our initial Titan r-tx
testing in SLI we got a significantly
lower score because one of the cards if
it's being power limited the cards are
going to match and they're always gonna
match whatever the slowest card is so if
one of these cards is we already know
we're hitting power limits so if one is
hitting four percent less power draw
then the other it's gonna pull the
better card down these cards are so
pretty though yeah but pretty don't win
competitions do they well I guess they
wouldn't beauty pageants but that's
nothing does this look like a beauty
pageant contestant right here it's like
you would think this guy at the gym is
buff but like this guy out lifts him so
what we did was we pulled the current
driver or nut driver but BIOS off of my
okay firmware off of my Titan card that
had the 14% power limit like I said this
one here is like 11 so I just reflash it
back to itself to make sure the cracked
NV flash is working I'm not doing a
video about how to flash the ROM I just
wanted to tell you guys if that's what
we were
and to do here so we're gonna do right
now is we're gonna cross-reference using
gpu-z
the version of this rom versus the one
that's online if they're the same that
not to worry about pulling it down Sony
device ID this is about version 0 0.01 I
bet you anything it's gonna end up being
a new one
RTX Titan wrong it's with a virus
collection
oh they're the same 0 0.01 okay so we'll
look at the version on this one I bet
you anything it's significantly older
here is the the bios that's in this one
here 1902 one eight zero zero zero two
not the same as our other one but as you
can see right here look at the power
limit this one goes to 123 all right so
we're gonna flashback to the other BIOS
because this this clearly this BIOS I
don't think was obviously ready for
primetime I think about how higher power
limit
I got bet you anything because we're not
we don't we're not measuring wattage
from the National card I bet you
anything that 123 is a higher percentage
but of a much lower base that's what I'm
thinking here so it's just going
flashback alright so we're gonna see
where we land right now on air it seems
to hover by around 2050 to 2100 on both
cards now that we finally got the proper
bios flashed on both clearly the
engineering sample was pulling down the
other card because it was really
dropping in flux and when you're an SLI
both clocks have to match so we're just
gonna run right now with our CP
overclocked where it was with these two
cards enough talking let's just see
where it lands cuz that's that's where
we've got a that's where we've got to
improve dude that's at 17 for a second -
come on the city in the 18s and 19's
holy I pull back the clocks and I
pull back the cache and it gets better
it doesn't make sense I tell you it just
hardened no put it you eat all services
it was so juicy oh my god that was a
pressed strawberry thing I've ever had
yes look how red it is
mmm we at least hit 16,000 oh so close
do you think that's a best CPU score yet
by five by three by three hundred points
god we've got a lot of room to make up
though it's in GPU yeah we're the top
ten with air cooling alright that's
alright it's only 11:30 in the morning
we got plenty of time I just woke up
with Tamara cool cards it was like BAM
all right what we just had two crashes
in a row so you know what that means
what I do the shut mod the block install
and the other thing alright so you might
be noticing that we are not using the
full cover water block when you're doing
the mods and stuff and then you put
a full cover block on it if something's
wrong with the shut mod or it's making
contact with something it shouldn't or
we need to add more or take some away or
whatever that's kind of a big deal with
the full cup of water block have enough
to take it off and completely drain it
and all that sort of stuff so that would
in my opinion just be a big issue so by
doing it this way I have access to the
shunts on both sides of the card the
other thing is just the simple fact that
this is easier to control condensation
because if I have a big giant surface
area of metal on the card and then it's
all covered by the really pretty plexi
and acrylic and all that sort of stuff
then it's even harder for us to control
condensation so this way I can wrap the
block around with paper towels and I can
even go as far as putting our neat
eraser in there if I want to and really
control the condensation because since
we are dealing with a $3,000 CPU and a
$1,700 motherboard and $5,000 in
graphics cards I really care about where
the water goes
why I'm surprised on my first attempt
first time ever trying because you know
the thickness of the metal can make a
difference on how much resistance there
is it's about resisting and and that's
how I'm not gonna get into how the
shunts work and stuff but it
communicates by resistance and we're
changing that resistance value so that
it thinks it's pulling less power which
lets it do things like this go to 2115
and not throttle why we just go ahead
and do a 3dmark run it's crashing like
immediately yeah it was just a loose
mount that could have been causing our
problem - okay that's farther than we've
gotten yet right oh my god those
milliseconds are lower whoa you're still
100 points behind that asshole
god oh we lost like a couple points oh
okay
everything fine this is fine come on if
we just brute force gt1 enough because
we know we're hitting power limit in gt2
we were going to brute force method
it wasn't power limiting gt1 if that can
carry our score up
too much salt but I'm not even done yet
we're gonna go to CPU now 60,000 866
we're gonna see if you score it's not
even our highest but look at that up in
the cache voltage brought our GPU score
up my wife is on her way I wonder if
have time for one more run up the cache
one more people said you can't do it Jay
nice Steve I missed the freaking BIOS
because I was worried about me so this
is actually the next day I figured that
since three marks database went down
yesterday for maintenance or whatever
reason I would just continue to screw
around and I'm glad that I did because
you guys saw us yeah 16800 whoo and it
was like okay that's kind of nothing now
equator what we've achieved but I'm done
for the day because we played around
this morning some we got a new high
score technically but we're fighting
some serious condensation yeah it's bad
but I want to show you here how we kind
of did the radiator setup because this
is important if you don't have flow
going across or through the fins whether
it's sitting in a bucket of ice water or
not makes no difference so I've actually
got this pond pump which is a
submersible pond pump and it has
threading on it so you could hook a hose
to it and run it somewhere if you want
but look how much water this thing
actually moves so this is the pump right
here it picks up from the bottom pushes
out there and then that just you saw how
much water comes across so it shoots
across the radiator and then on the
bottom of the rad I have these screws so
that it doesn't sit flush on the bottom
of the cooler so that we can make sure
that the water actually goes through it
now the reason why we use a radiator
like this rather than just going Jay why
don't you just pick up the ice water and
pump it through the system we did that
when we first started this competition
when the very first time we did ice
water I went why should we have a
radiator why don't we just pick up the
ice water and put it through well
varying reasons one
the temperature at the bottom is warmer
than the temperature at the top and
that's because the ice settles at the
top and that's where it's colder there
is a gradient of temperature change
the other thing is I have no idea why
but on average we were tendency warmer
when we just picked up ice water and
pumped it through the system for some
reason having a chilled loop
I think the coal I think it can contain
the coldness better and so it gets
closer to the actual temperature of the
ice when you're chilling and cooling a
separate closed and sealed loop so if
you guys know the physics behind that or
something out there actually really
knows the answer it isn't just going
well I don't know but here's my guess if
you actually know the answer as to why
that is I'd love to know so once you
guys put that down in the comments and
respond to us so this was a score where
we first started screwing around in the
3175 ex overclocking video we were like
hey we've got some potential here this
is higher than our score that we've had
in the past we've got a really good CPU
score this is the score that is as of
right now public on the Hall of Fame
website and I continued to play around
after the database went down and these
are the scores we got I then got a
seventeen thousand sixteen a seventeen
thousand twenty a seventeen thousand
fifty eight a seventeen thousand 85 a
113 a 119 and a seventeen thousand one
six two our CPU score came up almost
another thousand points to seventeen
thousand 605 and we got our seat our
GPUs to seventeen thousand 87 so not
only did we beat him in CPU which we
knew going into this cuz we've always
had a better CPU score than him for some
reason we've now beat him in GPU as well
on shunts that are still hitting power
limit early we think so there's still
Headroom to be had here and this is
without our fast memory we don't have
six dims of our g.skill overclocking
memory we're using dominators which are
slower in every way than that and we
found that the way I was able to get the
score so much higher and yeah I know I'm
kind of putting this info out there for
everyone to copy but that's fine we want
you guys to have fun too is vram on the
graphics card that score that score
right there was me running 1,400 Plus
1,400 on the memory and plus 190 on the
GPU if we went plus 200 on the GPU we
crashed
we got a plus 1450 to run but it wasn't
any better of a score so we saw just
kind of
returned right there so plus 1400 I know
and the other cards and stuff if I want
anything over like plus 1250 we'd start
getting artifacting we then get any
artifacting at plus 1400 so what we
found was even though I was incrementing
this the the GPU clock we weren't
getting a better score in fact we were
getting a worst score because memory
wasn't supporting it but once I increase
the vram well then we got the scores
that you saw right there so you know we
got to do now upload and validate this
score all right so if you go to Hall of
Fame we can see even with all scores on
times by extreme we're fifth place what
happened Steve disappointed in these
data add to K if we go to 2x we're still
1 over number 4 17,000 162 two spots
ahead of Steve because I'm kind of a
jerk I also ran over a single card score
and I expect him to beat me because he's
gonna be doing ellentube
I believe Bowman number 6 number 6 so
that means all of our scores that we
actually care to compete in haven't done
fire strike on this are all in the top
10 once again
not bad cuz saving the fact these cards
have been around for almost a year now
and we expected the XOC guys to come and
just knock us off the board entirely
locked off the top of 100 or something
like that so Steve I expect to come back
from vacation and see that I'm knocked
off of there again and you're on the top
so all right guys now we can go because
he made me come in on a Saturday to do
this crap
that one core like screwed up the
calculation and then everyone else was
like ah man damn it George it's always
George we have to name all 56 of our
threads yeah cuz the court of the clock
sorry how do the clocks go again
