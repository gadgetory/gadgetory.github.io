loved ones over at CES busting ass I
decided to stay home because let's face
it I'm lazy but you guys have been
asking me about different fluids and
things and these are some of the fluids
I've used recently and I figured we'd go
ahead and do a video that fluids but not
in the traditional sense so I've got
pastel white right here from Mayhem's
I've still got more of the yellow here
as well pastel sunset yellow and then
the Primo chill clear which I have dyed
orange and I figured we'd do a video
about these fluids although we're not
going to them about these exact fluids
we're going to be doing something
involving a little bit more science
science bitch the lick max to 120 and
240 from enter Max is another awesome
choice of AIO liquid coolers for gamers
and enthusiasts without breaking the
bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more so i decided we're not going to
do this in the conventional way we're
going to test those fluids we're going
to see how various things around the
home my work when it comes to water
cooling so we're going to go find a few
alternatives
ok so I think this is a pretty good
match for the fluid that's currently
inside of skunk words now so we're going
to get two of these but do you think the
clear ones or the more opaque why not
both
I'll drink I'll drink the science when
we're done sunny days a little bit too
sugary no orange II remember the sunset
yellow is yellow so let's go check out
the orange juice we're just kind of
funny because always tell people no I
know it's choosing jello and I'm gonna
get more juice to represent it and we
want to find pre or post color change
but I mean I remember to change colors
so I want to go for color changer map we
have to make sure we get no Popo so
choices are very limited are you in
concentrator like actual no Cole that
one looks like this Pablo well no it's
settled so that'll do for that and now
we need to get milk I know you thinking
like nonfat milk because it's kind of
paid it's like kind of watery yeah it's
a little bit watered down to like that I
think it's you
it's about brides that's a thing with
like the white the pure white is it's
not
like say vitamin D milk where it's like
good
which like really really thick it's not
the quite for about milking light hammer
24
I think we have some at home but you can
never have too much this is true ok
smell like something burning I felt that
when I got to your place to it I mean
when I was out that in our area it
doesn't normally mean someone's burning
a fire it means somebody's like burning
and yeah I will be writing all of this
off of the Sam
Somoza not breathing I've ever done in
my life
we get it you babe so we decided to go
ahead and ditch the turbo setup and now
we install the twin screw charger
always doing this to me haha
I have to add more fluid to the test
loop for my baseline numbers well that
was a fun little Drive anyway we're back
we've got some stuff here that we are
going to use as alternatives so we've
got here some Minute Maid pure squeeze
no pulp orange juice representing the
pastels you guys keep telling me it
looks like orange juice I guess you're
right actually you're pretty damn close
we've got some skim milk here because of
the white pastel every time you guys see
a white bill that one's I go who food
it's cooled with milk so I guess we'll
see if that really works uh we couldn't
find anything that really represented
the same color orange here that I have
custom mixed I'm gonna have any of that
iron brew stuff here that everyone keeps
saying this looks like so I decided just
to go with orange Powerade and I think
we'll go with I don't know which one do
you think we should use honestly this
one are the more clear one or is it they
won't I don't know lost it we hit the
bank it's behind you
and we'll let coconut monkey decide
which one this one's more cloudy this
one's much more clear the mix coats
clear alright so we'll go with that one
then drink this one kind of one drink up
here there and I'm a bottle opener
so before we can tell how well this is
going to work for the sake of science
yes I it's bitch we have to see how well
the real stuff is actually working so
the test loop with its triple rad and ek
supremacy block and the what type of
leads visiontek without EK parts here on
a 59 30k overclocked right now to 4.4
gigahertz at 100 percent load we're
sitting at 62 C you can see it right
there and if you zoom in on that 62 C
right here on the on the CPU temperature
so that's the package temp not the core
temp so we're going to go with package
temp on these tests just to see how well
it performs y'all be honest here which
one of you which one do you think is
gonna work best here I which you think
it's going to carry away the most heat
and actually do a good job I think the
parrot you know I was thinking to
powerade myself because these are so
heavy yeah I don't know how well they'll
absorb well that's the skim milk so that
would be the lighter one too this is
still gonna be the lightest this is also
sugar-free go for that one I'll go
milk then you're going for me okay I'll
go for milk okay my concern with these
two is if they're going to bubble up
because if they bubble up you know you
shake milk what happens it bubbles up
right I mean technically it does a
little bit but you can see it it falls
out pretty quick so I'm concerned about
bubbling but I guess we'll see what
happens
the shitty part here for us is that in
between each one of these we have to
flush the loop which really don't suck
but whatever well we'll get through it
so all right 62 see it's still sitting
there exactly where we start Oh 64 see
61 so we're gonna go we'll go 62 it's
fluctuating based on a test you know a
264 no I'm doing an egg exciting here
I'm just cleaning off the thermal paste
on the block that was already on here
cuz I don't want this to get all
got to make sure we get the thermal
paste very very consistent between tests
otherwise our scientific project is a
little bit skewed here it looks like
you're doing dirty things to complete
them yeah you would think that would
would you rather have someone else think
it and that's why I thought I'm speaking
for the people all right so I think
we're gonna go with the Gatorade first
or the Powerade simply because I think
it's me the cleanest oh that goes fast
that is a fast pump did you see how fast
you guys have been asking me about the
4.0 pump I've used it before it's got
one speed of one speed only and that
speed being super fast both the speed
but you know what it you notice it
didn't bubble up or anything yeah holy
heck it smells good yeah you smell that
see like a myth immediately smells like
citrusy run-button this is I think this
is gonna work
that's what I'm scared of this is gonna
work and people are gonna try this do me
a favor don't try this at home we're not
responsible for anything that neither is
Discovery Channel that's what they
always say in like uh uh many busters
yeah
we're what you call professionals it
smells so good whatever I open it up
this is like sweet twins do that it's
not like I think it's gonna frickin work
so this is going to be very this is why
I was saying I was concerned about
bubbling with the milk in the orange
juice because the light tower it comes
up in the middle here and it like
spreads out on the side so I technically
could have removed that Center insert
but then it would like be crazy bubbly
I'm going to top this off a little bit
but if you look in the tubes there's no
there's no like foam or bubbles building
up and the way I'll remove the lid
that's like it's like air freshener and
water cooling in one I don't know why
I'm having so much fun with this this is
this is fun this is fun and I could
drink look look and you can drink the
fruits of the labor alright first boot
of the system with the gatorade mix
power IQ PAP Gatorade Powerade don't sue
me have a reports drink with the sports
bar drink fit into the water cooling
loop it's so like move it lovely look at
the temps 25 see it idle I totally get
25 see that's already lower than it was
when it was on when we started it now
granted the system had been running for
a little bit and warmed up but that's
crazy
alright this startup aida64 you ready
watch the temps like shoot through the
roof now now there are reasons why you
would never actually want to do this
we'll explain at the end of the video
but for the for the sake of it we are I
mean why the hell not why not play the
temps so far we'll let it have it let it
take a couple of minutes to warm up the
worst-hit at 50 to 55 I mean it's good
it's going to take like it's going to
start going through its stress test of
the floating-point units and stuff when
it does FPU test is when the
temperatures really shoot up so we'll
just let this go for a few minutes when
we'll come back something else I want to
point out too is I do have these broad
are barred our fans plugged into a PWM
circuit for system fan - but I forgot I
have that fan header right now on the
motherboard set to silent so if you
listen to my finger as I touch the blade
it is running at its lowest setting
listen
it is not turning very fast and our
temperatures right now 56 Celsius at
100% load now granted it's only been
running for two minutes we'll let it go
for 10 we'll do 10 minutes and see what
the temperatures do okay so we've let
the thing run now 9 minutes 16 seconds
and it's it's bouncing between 60 and 64
and 66 what's the next attempt we
actually ever saw on there what I want
to do right now is I'm kind of curious
as to how much the fan speed would
actually prove this because the radiator
is warm and like I said the fans are
running at their slowest speed okay so
I've got the Vardar fans now running at
their max speed start another five
minute test here on 864 as you can see
here based on the chart how flat it is
it's pretty much stabilized on the
temperatures if we look at the
statistics the CPU never went hotter
than 54 degrees Celsius and the average
is 50 to point to package which is a
it's a totally different sending it on
the motherboard 74 which is well then
check look at the core temps 68 6170 66
68 and 63 uh yeah power rate is pretty
freakin powerful when it comes to water
cooling I hadn't I really had no idea
I am totally surprised so now it's time
to flush the loops and we're going to do
the same with milk and orange juice and
we'll just kind of do some overviews of
those and we'll come back with some
final thoughts
definitely triple-check this guy this
was open what goes flying out a bad day
I don't want to spill this
the other one smelled really good I'm
kind of wondering how the milk is gonna
smell not looking forward to the air it
goes you ready see if it just turns into
a foam mess
surprisingly no although in there that's
kind of alien look yeah bubbles
um I know we'll see I think I think like
bubbles my form initially until all of
the airspace is gone and that can't
aerate and then the bubbles won't be a
problem
okay so right now CPUs chillin once
again at 25 C idle 26 with max per go
and start the test right for 10 minutes
and we'll see how well the milk does
it's not separating that's the bubbles
at the top remember because the the Jets
are coming up the sides that's just
where it's like pushing up slightly on
the reservoir see
yes I separate but it is looking a
little bit green compared to this huh
could be picking up some of the flux in
an alpha cool rad that rat is unflushed
alright well the test has been going for
just under 11 minutes now and I'm going
to point out the temperatures are
actually more like level and stable with
the milk than they were with the
Gatorade believe it or not statistics
here we have a 50 point one C average on
the CP with a Mac CPU temp of 54 C core
tips are 6661 70 65 68 and 64
overclocked with skim milk Jake what are
you doing J okay we need we need that we
need that for the video card that video
card whether we need you the
overclocking gosh we need it for the
cooling sleigh will forever be the
apprentice that's okay watch did you it
was like watch the science guys watch
the science science science guys watch
what's gonna happen science is gonna
happen eventually you nothing really
where there goes there goes the science
see it see the science it's going that
is so gross yeah look was a bad idea
milk was a bad choice
see this goes to show how powerful those
little 4.0 pumps are can looks like a
nice cup of beer
maximum CPU temperatures 55 an average
of 52 so it's a couple of degrees hotter
than the milk was but again the core 68
63 72 65 67 and 64 and if we look at the
actual cooling trend you can see it's
pretty flat it warmed up initially and
then it's flat so it's not getting any
any hotter than that yeah so what we've
learned today well that was pretty fun
I didn't really know what to expect I'll
be honest um they all did better than I
thought that they would I really had no
idea what to expect I thought the
Gatorade would do the best but actually
the milk kept saying Gatorade Powerade
primary so I thought that the powder II
was going to do the best but the milk
actually cooled the best but the milk
was also the nasty is to try and clean
up it was the worst to flush afterwards
it was still rip residue of it and I had
to flush it again so let's talk real
quick why you should never ever do this
with your systems one these are all food
based products which is going to promote
growth of things you don't want in your
system there's no growth inhibitors in
here there's no anti corrosive sin here
all of these would probably cause
problems to the metals and the plastics
in your loops not to mention I am fairly
certain and you guys can correct me if
I'm wrong but I'm fairly certain that
the acidic acid in the juice here would
probably damage the copper as well as
any of the nickel plating and nickel
plated parts of maybe in your loops um
the milk I feel would probably sour
pretty quickly and turn nasty and maybe
even chunky oh you guys see what happens
to look what it goes bad right it turns
chunky
could you imagine that going around in
your loop I feel like this would be the
easiest on your system but once again
this would have growth gosh if someone
else is willing to try this long-term
and see how well it works then by all
means go ahead but I was kind of curious
as to what what happened here and we
thought we'd do this for the sake of
science science bitch and see exactly
how well this was going to work anyway
guys so what you thought about this
video let me know if you want me to do
more funky experiments like this and if
you do make sure you tell me an either
Twitter or in the comments what type of
experiments you think we should do here
is I'm gonna do more fun stuff like this
in 2016 anyway Happy New Year guys
thanks for watching as always we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
