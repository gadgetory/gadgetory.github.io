here we're going to have a little fun
today with the with this video we're
going to go ahead and play a game and in
fact you guys get to be interactive with
this game especially when it comes to
the comments now here's what we're going
to do we are going to play word
association and I'm going to say a word
and I want you guys to type the first
thing that comes into your mind down in
the comments section okay and that word
today being bitfenix the first thing
that comes to mind for me when I say
bitfenix is I think cases I mean
bitfenix kind of debuted with the
prodigy which was a mini ITX case and
then they didn't micro-atx version of it
and they have come up with some very
fantastic looking designs and very
popular designs when it comes to cases
now they've got a whole range of
products and they are now entering the
power supply game here with the brand
new bitfenix fury line of power supplies
the Fraggle design are five is so
amazing it fits all kinds of cool
hardware in their water cooling air
cooling and on top of that it's silent
and it's awesome like explosions or like
really quiet explosions let's just go
ahead and be brutally honest here power
supplies are not something that really
are all that glamorous you know they're
not even that fun to review to be honest
and I'm sure when it comes to shopping
for them they're not even any more fun
when it comes to shopping for either
they don't get any of the glory yet they
have all of the stress of your system
put on them I mean really they're kind
of like I've said this before linemen in
a football game something goes wrong the
lineman's definitely to blame but when
things go right the lineman or very
rarely ever thanked well the power
supply is a lot like that when it comes
to your system it has to deal with
everything in your system everything
goes through the power supply when it
comes to stability and trust me you
don't want to cheap out on a power
supply when it comes to your system
otherwise you'll be buying a new system
so bitfenix is stepping into the power
supply game here with their fury line of
power supplies and they've got three
different flavors they've got a five
50 a 650 and a 750 watt variant but what
makes there's a power supplies unique
and what really shows that they're
coming out swinging is the fact that
they are doing it with all individually
sleeved cable sets included with their
power supplies now the sleeping that
they use on here they're calling their
nano sleeve braided cables really it's
more like a soft sort of like a paracord
if you guys have ever used their alchemy
extensions it's the same thing as that
but it's just built into the entire
power supply and before we open it up
and take a look at it let's just go
ahead and do a couple of spec things on
here it is 80 plus gold now that's kind
of becoming like the new 80 plus bronze
especially now that we have platinum and
titanium rated power supply is out there
80 plus gold means that you're going to
be getting at least eighty seven percent
efficiency or higher when it comes to
the efficiency of the power supply as a
five-year warranty on there which is
good and it's got a lot of other things
going on for like one hundred and thirty
five-millimeter fan keeping things very
cool if got Intel Haswell c6 c7 power
state ready for a lot of the low power
states that are available in Haswell
processors the nanos leave already
mentioned active power factor correction
which is going to be at least their
advertising giving extremely clean power
delivery to your components no I can't
test that i do not have one the
equipment or to the certification to do
that it takes a lot of special equipment
and talent to be able to actually do
full power supply testing that's why
guys like johnny guru are very very well
known for that and last but not least
when it comes to power delivery we are
looking at the 650 watt version here and
it is a single 12 volt rail capable of
50 amps on the 12 volt rail alright
let's go ahead and open this thing up
and take a look the packaging is very
very nice and once again with enough
soft foam to actually get Linus well not
soft if you know what I'm saying
so immediately we can see we have got a
very aggressive looking power supply on
here in fact it's it's very very
nice-looking it's got a very nice fan
very again very few nixie looking design
on their very well matches their logo
that they're very well known for it I'm
said very well-liked very well many
times I know I'm doing that so here you
can see the individually sleeved chords
again they feel just like the BitFenix
alchemy extensions as they should
they're using the same stuff but you can
see it is individually sleeved coming
out of the power supply that's nice to
see for a semi modular power supply
often the semi modular will have like
black cables for all of the accessories
and PCI Express but then it will have
some ugly see-through rainbow colored
cables coming out of the non-modular
port so that's nice to see now the only
non modular cable on here is the 24-pin
the cpu we got 1 2 3 4 6 plus 2 pin vga
or pci express power cables and we've
got one two three four five peripheral
modular cables on there now obviously
when it comes to the modularity here
they all are right here once again even
the say does and everything is
completely individually sleeved and that
is fantastic to see it even includes a
floppy drive to 4-pin molex adapter
that's kind of cute I don't know maybe
some people still run a floppy drive I
don't know I guess there are some
devices that use floppy but whatever and
then here's your PCI Express cables
right there now let's go ahead and talk
real quick about the difference between
the 550 650 and 750 now the 550 version
does again have a 12 volt rail a single
12 volt rail delivering 42 amps on that
rail the 650 delivers 50 amps on that
rail and the 750 delivers 60 amps on
that rail so if you want to know if you
have enough power output on this to run
all of your accessories or multiple
graphics cards there you go you can
figure it out based on that now the 550
has a red line the 650 has a blue line
and the 750 has a yellow line I do kind
of wish that bitfenix would more
standardized this maybe just with a
black or a gray because then it would
aesthetically match many more builds now
if you were doing a red system say an
AMD or an ROG theme system then this
blue is going to look at a place
especially if your windows
was the power supply like many new cases
are doing like the seven ATT from
corsair which has a full side panel
window the entire thing is a window so
this would show and then that blue would
definitely not match now that does seem
a little bit trivial but when you're
going as far as to do custom braided
single braided sleeving like this then
this shouldn't be an oversight as far as
I'm concerned now you could flip it over
but then you're going to be looking at
your spec sheet there and bring it in
through the air through the top and then
out the back you know bringing an air
from the main part of your case a lot of
people don't like that a lot of people
want them upside down especially if
you're doing water cooling if there's
some sort of a drip having it the fan
face down it's going to give you a
little bit of protection for the power
supplies so something doesn't
accidentally drip drip inside there
don't ask me why I know so much about
drips near power supplies and skunk
works has a leak
you
we are going to be putting this thing to
the test in a future build this is
actually gonna be powering the AMD build
that I've been teasing for god knows how
long which will be doing very very soon
but this is going to be powering the AMD
system which I have teased I think it
looks fantastic I think if they made a
label change and got rid of the red blue
and yellow coloring yeah I'm actually
saying don't even put yellow even though
it would look great in skunk works now
it might seem extremely trivial to be
like hey don't put colored icons on the
now it might seem extremely trivial to
you know be saying something along the
lines of don't put color on your label
like that but I do think when you go as
far as to sleeve cables like this
standardizing the label to a more
monochrome color that's going to match
any build aesthetic is a smart movement
you might actually find yourself with
more customers that way there you go
guys the new fury line of power supplies
from bitfenix we got more stuff from
bitfenix will be taken look at here in
the future including the new ages case I
had initially planned on putting the amt
build in that case but then I realized
like the dork that I am and it's
actually a micro ATX case and I'm going
to be using a full ATX motherboard so I
guess we'll probably end up using the
define are five for that build but
either way it's going to look pretty
badass so thanks for watching guys hit
me up on social media if you guys have
any questions just want to chat I like
chatting and interacting with audience
that definitely is a way to pass time
throughout the day when I don't know no
I'm doing poop naps like barnacle ease
or whatever attempt to not not fall
asleep on the toilet though like poop
nap would would basically indicate
because then my butt goes numb and
that's never fun then I get up and I
walk funny hello what kind of funny
anyway so that's it for today I'm going
to go ahead and get the heck on out of
here thanks for watching my first look
here at the BitFenix fury power supply
and as always thanks for watching I
might have a slight addiction to
graphics card
