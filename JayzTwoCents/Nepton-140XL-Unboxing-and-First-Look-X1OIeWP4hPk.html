I don't want to repeat what happened
last year where I had to do all of my
rendering on a laptop and even though
it's an i7 laptop it was definitely not
an ideal situation for doing my mobile
rendering so with that said I'm gonna be
building an ITX system and before we get
to the build video which is going to be
coming in the future we have to take a
look at some of the parts we're gonna be
putting in this and specifically today
we are gonna look at the cooler master
Neptune 140 Excel 140 millimeter water
cooling option this is going to be
cooling my ITX build here and most of
these parts you guys have already seen
in other reviews and it's gonna be going
in this node 304 case right here so
without further ado let's go ahead and
open this thing up and get our unboxing
and first opinion here on the 140 XL
it's pretty obvious that a 140 XL is
gonna be a 140 millimeter radiator and
because it's the XL it means it's extra
thick so we get maximum cooling area
which they advertise here two times the
cooling area it is maintenance free you
don't have to fill it drain it or do any
sort of maintenance to it and it does
have a durable fep tubing which means
you can to bend it really tight and make
all the bends you need in your system to
get a nice installation here in any case
that you may be using it in and not have
to worry about those tight bends the
tubing is nice and durable the pump and
the water block are all one unit as are
most all of the water cooling options
but you can see right here that is
compared to the Intel stock heatsink at
81 degrees Celsius we're looking at
expecting somewhere right around 46
degrees Celsius which is only two
degrees higher than their 280 L which is
the standard thickness double 140
millimeter radio so they found a way to
get maximum cooling area crammed into a
small radiator by increasing its
thickness giving us ultimately the same
amount of surface area which is really
what it's all about it doesn't matter if
it's long and
skinny or short and thick and all of a
sudden this conversation started
sounding like something way different
than I really intended but as long as
you can get the same amount of surface
area that cooling will be fairly similar
to something that's a longer here we go
again but giving us more surface area
does give us a lot better cooling now it
is a pure copper water block it's a
microchannel technology it's prefilled
sealed durable powerful water pump
dissipates heat effectively and
maintains temperatures through stable
water circulation it moves water that's
what it says so let's go ahead and open
this thing up and see exactly what comes
in the box
all right so opening this bad boy up
we're immediately met with some
high-tech foam to bite out of that and
you do get some pretty thick tubing on
here which I'm actually pretty proud of
before we take that out here are all
your mounting options it fits all of
your AMD sockets and your Intel sockets
on there 775 a newer FM one and two and
newer and these are the fans that it
comes with right here which are very
very similar fans to the the jet flow
fans which we've already taken a look at
on this channel here the shape is the
same the idea is the same it doesn't
have the same rubber mounts on there but
overall the concept is the same as the
jet flow speed wise I'm not sure what
these are rated at want to take a look
at that but it is pwm fan and it does
come pre sleep once again I wish these
cables were longer but what are you
gonna do I wish we had longer cables
guys seriously you make a huge stacker
case give us longer cables would you
there we go you got two of these fins
you have your installation manual here
installation guide you have your
warranty information card and here it is
right here now this is going to be an
aluminum radiator a lot like the Neptune
series but look at the thickness of this
guy it's pretty thick so it's giving you
a pretty good amount of surface area as
always you have your plug on here that
says do not tamper with if you open this
up your warranty is void here is your
pump and block right here
with our little sticky tape on there
protecting the block and there's a
little bit of a rough finish on there
but I don't think that's really gonna
affect performance too much but if
you're into lapping and polishing you
might want to give that a little bit of
a lap in Polish we got the same
rotatable fittings as you find on the
other water cooling options here from
Coolermaster but what's interesting is
that you do have both 140 millimeter and
120 millimeter mounting options here on
this radiator so if you happen to have
120 millimeter fans that you like to
prefer you could mount those on there
whether they be jet flow or Corsair or
whatever so they are going to accept
your radiators what I like is that the
screw holes are aligned with the fins
and not the cooling channels so if you
do happen to screw down in there too far
you're not gonna deem your radiator a
paperweight by puncturing one of those
channels you'll just simply crush some
of the fins and you have more of an
aesthetic problem than dealing with the
performance problem making it completely
broken at that point so there's nothing
else in the box there I was hoping to
see ah yes here it is
I was hoping to see a PWM splitter which
we do have right here that comes inside
the package so you can split off the PWM
signal to both your fans if you happen
to only have one PWM header available to
you your fan or if you have a PWM CPU
and a CPU optional you can run all three
the pump in both fans off of two headers
I do wish that the sleeving
went all the way down to these two but
again what are you gonna do so there is
your splitter all of your mounting
hardware and your cooler master thermal
compound and really there's nothing else
to say about it the quality of it feels
nice you hear the fluid flopping around
in there the cover for the CPU pump and
block is aesthetically pleasing it is
plastic it's not metal like the glacier
is or the glacier is but there it is
guys you have a 140 millimeter cooling
option here fits in most cases that
accept 120 140 millimeter fans as always
if you've enjoyed this unboxing and
overview be sure to give this video a
like if you stumbled across this channel
and you like what you saw hope you stick
around and don't forget guys tune in
next
January 6 to January 10th I will be
bringing you live coverage from CES at
some point I'm going to be doing a live
stream from on the convention showroom
floor don't know exactly when that's
going to be yet but I will be sure to
update you guys on Twitter so make sure
you're following on Twitter because
that's going to be the most live
coverage you're going to be getting from
CES as it happens and as always guys I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
