was experiencing some strangeness with
his 780 and basically what he said was
every time he would launch a game his
CPU would go to a hundred percent usage
and his games would look like a
slideshow which I thought was very
strange because in all of the
troubleshooting I've ever done with
graphics cards in the history of playing
with computers I've never experienced
that particular scenario so we're gonna
go ahead and fire this up on the test
bench here and we're gonna see this is
obviously not his rig so there's other
things that could be in place CPU his
motherboard BIOS also whatever drivers
he has whatever software he has
installed it could all be a part of it
so that's why we are going to go ahead
and just see what happens when I put the
780 on a system that I know works
because we just we just did a video with
the system do you want to be cooler do
you want to be more desirable well
you're in luck because right now you can
own your very own J's $0.02 swag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below what happens here so
here's our splash screen preparing
automatic repair yeah test benches and
things don't like being shut down by the
power switch which I've I did recently
so there's that come on windows OC we
just froze a little spinning wheel stop
spinning it's never a good sign and we
just rebooted and preparing automatic
repair again so we're in dude we're
gonna go ahead and go into safe mode
it's kind of funny though Nick will
confirm he saw this computer works just
fine with the other graphics card
installed doesn't it this started after
we installed this guy alright so
obviously safe mode works so I'm just
gonna go and start by getting rid of the
current Nvidia drivers yes and install
the driver Nvidia uninstaller has
finished alright so we now have no
Nvidia driver on here let's restart see
and with no Nvidia driver installed look
at this
and I want to confirm that we have the
correct driver most recent driver is the
390 dot 77 and 390 dot 77 was what was
installed previously to this okay so I'm
gonna try right now is I'm gonna try
rolling back
another driver real quick so let me go
to an older one let's go to like
December 20th 2017 like three 88.7 one
so let me try that one so Windows is
working right now though because it just
has its own basic VGA drivers that it
installs that's why we're seeing 1080p
and all that but if you right-click
you'll see there's no Nvidia control
panel so I'm going for a clean install
of an older driver to see what happens
all right moment of truth new driver
well new old driver installed now this
doesn't work this isn't the end of hope
we've got another thing we can try
because technically if this doesn't work
yet and it's just whoa wait a minute so
could it okay so at least the boot
problem could potentially be the newer
drivers okay but we're in the system but
we still don't have an Nvidia control
panel showing though so there's that so
I'm gonna do another restart just to be
safe because if you right-click and you
don't see the Nvidia options in the
desktop then it's not actually running
the Nvidia driver which means we could
still potentially have the problem we
have before still have no Nvidia driver
mmm lamins by trying to run a 3d program
it probably won't go
it's just freezing on the loading screen
it's all that tearing right there to the
drivers definitely yes you know we're
not responding well then okay see I
double-click Nvidia settings which is
right here doesn't open anything so like
the driver installed it says it
installed but nothing really happened so
I'm gonna try installing the driver on
top of itself again see if that works
all right fingers crusts I installed the
driver on top of itself hoping that
something will happen
give me a control panel nope I don't
know if it's the driver though to be
honest it could still be many things all
right so now I'm gonna try installing
the newest driver on top of the bad
driver I don't think the driver install
even worked be honest with you because
when we install the other driver windows
wouldn't boot like it just kept locking
up I know if you guys know this but
there's different modes that your
graphics card goes into based on
what's happening so when you're booting
and you're going through BIOS test and
basic VGA when it's loading and then it
goes into desktop it switches to 3d mode
and that's why I could be locking up
when it goes into the desktop
I can't even test Nix gaming problem
until I at least get this thing to get
into a mode that allow me to game
because right now we're in basic VGA so
I can't even try and play a game all
right
unfortunately that didn't do anything
now we're just getting the startup
repair loop again so here we go back to
safe mode oh crap it's startup repair
and we're back we're just gonna repeat
what we've already seen me do I'm gonna
go back into safe mode I'm gonna delete
the driver again
and my next step here is I'm gonna see
if I can't get I'm gonna try to update
the wrong so one other thing I wanted to
try before I got invasive and started
screwing with the ROM because once you
start messing with the roms and you
don't have a backup bios which this card
doesn't have because it's an SC so it's
based on like a you know reference PCB
and we foo briquette then there's no
getting this card back is I wanted to
see what would happen here in device
manager now you can see we've got a
little exclamation point next to gtx 780
exists telling us that the card is not
working right and then if I use the
function you know where you right click
and say update driver because it shows
update your driver it comes back and
says the best drivers for your device
are already installed so I want to see
if Windows 10 handling it would maybe
improve things a little bit but it
didn't really help at all so what I do
is I just searched for the ROM file or
the ROM version that's on the back of
this card and I found it on techpowerup
or BB J's BIOS collection portion of
tech power up so haters right here 783
gig SC with ACX cooler and that's our
BIOS 8080 3100 80 so I am just going to
go ahead and download that so we have
our ROM file so we've got our ROM file
we've got MV flash and of course our
BIOS Tweaker if we wanted to the BIOS go
in here to display drivers and we need
to disable device yes we're gonna
disable our graphics card while we're
using it what that is basically done is
it's basically told windows that this
device is nothing more than a basic VGA
adapter which is exactly what we need we
don't want any drivers or anything
running the fact that we didn't even see
the screen turn off and come back on
tells me that no driver even though one
was installed is working whatsoever if
there was actually a driver working
right now from Nvidia we
would have seen that screen go black for
a second and come back on and then yeah
so that didn't work at all the
difference on this one it's a 64-bit
version of envy flash because we're in
Windows 10 I guess we're gonna do
negative or -6 which is bringing up
option 6 which is to ignore the subset
mismatch because technically this ROM
doesn't match this GPU ROM ROM enter yes
ok now it's saying here warning
they don't match are you sure you want
to do this and I'm gonna say yes they're
only off by one numbers you can see it's
a slight versioning thing I'm gonna say
yes update ok we're off to the races we
are now writing to the EEPROM now we
need to see if this helped at all Nick
I'm sorry to say if this didn't help
there's no fix for this it kind of it
really makes me wonder what went wrong
the ROM could have just fubar it a
little bit all right so that's done what
we have to do now is our restart I
expected the boot just fine question is
whether or not we can get a driver to
install there's no driver installed so
yeah it's gonna be it's going into
Windows just fine as expected but what
that tells me is we just had we just had
a successful rom flash and update it's
now it's time to see if this driver will
install on here with this rom and if it
makes any difference like I said if it
doesn't if it doesn't fix it then
whatever it was cool science experiment
we didn't drop tests off the parking
garage see what happens to a graphics
card when you dropped it from two
stories if we do this the Internet can
get mad at you and up me for the record
I'm kind of against the idea but we also
have slow-motion cameras that we could
so while trying to install the driver
right now it just popped up and said
that windows installer was currently
installing something and I had to wait
but I just noticed we have audio which
can only happen through the driver so
there's there's hope I right-click and I
still don't see g-force or NVIDIA
GeForce driver on the desktop but I'm
gonna try installing this one more time
a reboot might actually get us somewhere
so there's there's slight hope here
because we didn't have any audio before
even when we had the working driver when
we first installed it like with the
older driver remember that kinda makes
me wonder if this works how many people
have thrown out
or are made graphics cards that could
have simply been fixed with a rom update
okay so we just clean installed the
latest driver after updating our rom if
this boots to the desktop and we have a
control panel then we might have fixed
it if it locks up right here I say we
head to the parking garage and check
this thing off the roof which do you
hope happens
oh it booted which which wouldn't work
before remember
it wouldn't work and we have a Nvidia
control panel see right there BAM so all
of this has led to me just trying to
verify the initial problem that Nick
told me which is when the CPU would go
to a hundred percent when trying to game
so all of this has led to me being able
to start figuring out what was happening
with his system but I think it's all
related quite honestly I'm just gonna
bring up heaven see what happens with
this because remember we tried to run it
and it wouldn't go past loading right
well because it tries to enable the game
gaming mode and it can't do that they
really go do that look at that well what
you just look at it this is a good sign
though Nick potentially something that
wasn't working is now working pretty
flawless isn't it like you said every
time you load it up this card it would
just peg out your system and you got a
slideshow for games right all right so
we're gonna do one more test here this
is Metro last light I wanted to run
destiny too but I thought it was already
pre-installed on here but I guess it's
not 44 gigs worth of download but as you
can see it's running just fine
right here with Metro last light which
is still a pretty demanding title
especially in 1080p it's gonna put some
CP a little bit cpu load on there would
this have worked this well at home on
your system no no no okay
well you know the only way to truly test
whether or not we fixed the problem is
Nick has to take this card home put it
in his computer and see if this the
problem persists if it doesn't then we
fixed it if it does well then we're back
to the drawing board but obviously this
video is up before that so if you guys
want to find out what the results of
this were make sure you follow on
Twitter follow Nick because he's the one
that's gonna go up there and do it it's
at coconut monkey I'll put the link
right there and you guys can go and
follow him to find out
whether or not we truly fixed it if we
did you're welcome if we didn't then
we're gonna go up to the parking garage
we're gonna check this thing right off
of the roof but I think I don't think we
need to do that we can see it's
obviously working yeah I kind of want to
write but in this given day in this
state of affairs with graphics cards
that would be extremely irresponsible
when have I been known to do responsible
things anyway guys we're gonna go thanks
for watching follow Nick on Twitter to
find out the results of whether or not
this worked thanks for watching guys
we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
