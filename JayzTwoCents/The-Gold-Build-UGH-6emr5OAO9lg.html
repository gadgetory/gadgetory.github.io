when are you gonna finish the gold build
well I refuse to let this turn in to the
new post Malone build where it's where's
the bill where's the bill where's the
build so we're gonna see how far we can
get today I'm not a hundred percent
positive we're gonna get done but I just
really hate for this to turn into a
three parter but I digress we're gonna
see how far we can get today because we
have limited time and limited skill to
get it done today's video sponsored by
Nordby pn a service i've used for years
and highly recommend you don't want
people spying on your internet
connection I mean that's regardless or
you do anything important you're not up
there why I let people spy on your
information you know the biggest
offender at spying on you is your ISP
they want to slow you down and throttle
your connection regardless of the speed
you pay for because they shave your
Internet traffic well start shaping your
own by encrypting it and using Nord VPN
and when thousands of servers and over
61 countries we regardless of where you
are you can get connected fast and
secure and you can start taking that
internet security serious by saving
seventy five percent off a three year
membership and getting a month for free
by using offer code J's two cents at
checkout
so stick it to your ISP and start
surfing securely by using Nord VPN and
again 75 percent off at three-year
membership that brings it down to like
$2.99 a month that's less than a cup of
coffee
it's coffee more important than your
internet that's the question there's a
link down below each part clearly so I'm
gonna show you guys some of the parts
and stuff that we've gotten going in
here there's one Titan card in there and
now I'll call it t-rex that's what video
calls it I guess we've also got the
other one sitting here in the box I
wanna I want to address some of the
comments on this build a lot of
suggestions people had one I think the
most common suggestion
JJ you should totally check out the RGB
royal ram as if we didn't already have
it we've had this ram since before it
launched just didn't know what I was
gonna do with it I was like I never
built a gold PC before and then the
t-rex came out and I was like well
obviously that is the right use case for
this rim so we've obviously got that
picked up a couple of 860 Evo's these
aren't even technically for this build I
just got it
they're one terabyte drives I'll
probably an nvme in here if I have any
more otherwise we can add that
after-the-fact motherboard we picked up
the X 299 deluxe
too so this is the
the second version of the original
deluxe that came out because Asus has
kind of done like sort of a generational
refresh of this so it's a it's not an
evolutionary change it's more of a way
not revolutionary evolutionary whatever
it's a minor upgrade apparently it can
have them handle a 79 80 X II which is a
16 core or 18 core 32 math I'd
originally planned on using my 16 core
from my workstation upstairs but then I
remembered we have that deleted 79 80 XE
why don't I just use that let's also
talk about some of the water cooling
parts and how even a water cooling
expert such as myself can make stupid
mistakes
like for instance ordering the wrong
radiator that's going to be way too
thick now yes this is a XC 360 cool
stream XD XD stands for extreme edition
and this would of course fit in the
front of the case the problem is once
you in add fan thickness and then you
add my reservoir combo which I want to
mount to it I then don't have enough
room to clear the back of the graphics
cards
so I'm probably gonna end up using a
different radiator that I have in stock
because the extreme is 60 millimeters
thick that's with three C's seriously
it's like easily a/c / 20 mil and
there's 60 so 20 times 3 is 60 so if I
were to can even get this in there
add 25 more millimeters for the fan
thickness which would I want to put the
fans on the inside there pushes it out
to about there we might end up having
enough room for it because there's one
way to find out
speaking of combo we're using D 5 this
is the photon 170 from excess PC glass
reservoir
I love these the other comments some
people said was J why don't you just
water cool the graphics cards because as
soon as I pull this cooler off of here
there's no more gold the entire theme of
this build is based on the gold t-rex so
I'm leaving the coolers on here for
multiple reasons one that way I can take
them out easily if I want to use them to
beat Steve and two there our theme
so yeah let's just kind of see how far
we get
we stopped a montage just enough of that
crap so a lot of you guys always say
j-just take us along for the ride talk
about what you're doing don't just make
beautiful montages and stuff well that's
we're gonna do today because these
builds no matter how much you plan or
think you've planned things go wrong so
this is the proton right proton it's
called proton that's it Photon a couple
things I don't like about it I've never
really actually mounted this to the
radiator like this is meant to be spaced
properly to be mounted to the radiator
but we learned and they're not gonna
really have a choice here is that if you
mount it to the rad it's not centered
like they could have made it longer they
could make that little piece longer
there's no side-to-side adjustment on it
at all as you can see it's like it can't
slide this way I don't know why they
didn't just make this part longer so
that it would be centered in the
radiator so my OCD is gonna be a little
going crazy but that's not the only
other thing one one of the things we've
always complained about is like man why
do people keep using molex mullux death
to molex death to molex so where did the
state aversion and I was like oh crap
it's not sleeved that's okay I'll sleeve
it oh well I can't deepen this now yes I
could cut it sleeve it solder it and
then all that but why why deal with all
that so we're fortunate enough around
here to where we have other parts laying
around that we can use the other issue
here is this just uses a it says excess
PCB but it's a laying d5 pump any d5 is
the same manufactured laying and they
just put a different sticker on it this
is the ugly retention ring that comes
with all d5 basic pumps
I think Swift tech was one of the first
prints actually start using the D 5 and
this is the ring that was used so that's
obviously ugly in there this is more of
a beauty build and I remembered that it
had one of these protium covers from
singularity computers so singularity
sells this stuff including beautiful
reservoirs and stuff which if I had more
lead time before I ordered this stuff
then I would probably gotten a protium
kit like I used in my d5 in fact I'm
gonna be taking the d5 build apart and I
thought about gathering or salvaging out
of there and putting it in this build
but I just haven't taken it
part yet so we're gonna be replacing
this with this cap and we're gonna be
replacing the pump entirely with one of
my pwm D 5 pumps out of an EK reservoir
so that's the nice thing about using
anything that's laying d DC or d5 rather
than some of the more proprietary like
you know pumps to some of the certain
brands is the fact that you can salvage
them out of other parts and the reason
why I'm using this one is because it is
sleeves getting all two like lineups can
be a little bit of a pain of the night
I'm an expert guys so this is what you
spend a lot of time doing no matter how
many systems you've built how many water
cooling runs you've made any rigid tubes
you've bent you have to spend a lot of
time just kind of looking at it and
imagining how it's gonna look and right
now I've got to think about the fact
that I've got tubes that are gonna be
coming out of this a drain port I've got
a deal with and then part of me is like
do I just want to go with a thinner rig
ready to right now it's got a 30 mil I
think a single 30 mil would be fine
for a semi not a TXE because it's the
only thing that's gonna be in the loop
not overclocking it very far either
maybe like 4.2 this was provided by
cable mod I went onto their cable
configurator websites and I chose the
colors and stuff that I wanted and
actually went with paracord not a PVC
sleeving or whatever it's called they
told me the color gold I wanted would
not have basically worked with the nylon
but this oh my God look at this freakin
money do that and there and I mean their
paracord but they can still be trained
so and then I also got like on the PSU
cables and stuff for like the 8 pin
power and all that we went with White's
aluminium cable combs so those are
actually metal cable comes on there so
that gold turned out so much better this
is honestly the first time I opened it
as you guys saw I just trusted that
everything was perfect and I think this
is a really good gold between our paint
and gold and the color of the t-rex on
there so you can see I know I cannot
wait to get these in there that's just
just look at that what you just look at
it
so this is what I've come up with like
the third or fourth time I've come up
with something for this build the issue
stems from we get again from the fact
that I went with way too thick of a
radiator on accident if I'd gotten the
standard 40 mil then we wouldn't have
had nearly as much of a problem and now
I had to actually come up with a
solution so I've got my alpha cool
radiator with my Corsair fans on here
which are white RGB and then I've got an
ek X res on here with RGB which we're
just gonna set to white which will
actually illuminate the reservoir which
will look neat it'll kind of put some
light in that empty area of the kit or
the kit that the case three drools
recently and then this is just gonna go
down to the pump which is gonna be down
below it like this which will then go
out to the rest of the system so yeah
this is a little bit weird technically
but it's all we got
it's the only thing we can do to make it
work either that or I postponed this
build even farther I don't know if I
want to and I may still change this but
this is the problem that's why some of
the builds that I do take so long so
what I do now is I got to change the top
out back to this top and that way I can
plumb up fittings because we're at least
we're gonna be able to go from the rad
right to the top of the reservoir and
then out of the reservoir into the pump
so that at least takes care of kind of
this area of it I would love to be able
to just use a pump down here as a
reservoir combo but that's not working
with the amount of space that I have
technically and I don't have a d5
version of the protium which I would
love to use so you can kind of see how
this works out worst case scenario we
order or go buy what we need and we
continue it another day either way we're
gonna continue another day because it's
not going to be done today there is no
way no way nohow that's what we done
today all right so this is what we got
so far as you can see I put in all the
cable so you can kind of see all the
gold sort of tying in we have the gold
cape of fittings here from primo chill
but you're not too happy with there's a
lot of silver showing through it's a
very light dusting of gold and they're
not consistent like all the fittings in
the package have a different color
consistency to them so I might end up
painting those myself but the gold ran
the gold cables and hectic is that we
even have gold static
Able's for this I like gold can I paint
this yoohoo gold so yeah this is how it
is how it's turning out in the south
overall gonna look so I've got a lot of
cable comes on these cables for a couple
reasons one because they are paracord
the sleeving themselves are not going to
help keep it into position
so usually paracord flops around a
little bit more too because we are using
the pro cables on the the sleeving kit
here from cable mod it's a thicker cable
which means that we can still train it
so I've got all of these here sort of
training the cables in the position I
want them to be in don't know if I'm
gonna run these back to the motherboard
tray or just go through this hole right
here
the pump is down in here now Phil can
see it so I'll be able to rotate the
pump this way because it's just going
straight down to the top of the pump for
the inlet from the reservoir and then I
can use these two fittings one of them's
an out and I can just use a 90 have it
come straight up and then out here into
the CPU and then from the CPU to the
radiator those are the only two runs I'm
going to have to do so that's where I'm
gonna be ending part two and yeah part
three is gonna be filling it turning it
on doing some benchmarks and all that
stuff usually I do these builds and
learning about benchmarking them because
I kind of adopt the mindset tough well
if you want to know how tight necks
that's not tight neck so when our tier X
performs an SLI we'll go watch a t-rex
that's a lie video but might as well do
it for you in this one Rd late at 79 ad
XE we already know it's gonna do fairly
decently we lap that because it was not
perfectly flat we also left the block
because it wasn't perfectly flat so
hopefully we'll see some decent
performance but it's time to go I've
spent all day literally I'm putting
together a reservoir and a motherboard
and phil has been so nice perfect
employee is to point that out alright
guys I'm gonna go thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one recently
1600 watt power supply and this one too
how's the audio right now
oh I wouldn't walk over here you might
want to walk that way doo-doo-doo-doo
