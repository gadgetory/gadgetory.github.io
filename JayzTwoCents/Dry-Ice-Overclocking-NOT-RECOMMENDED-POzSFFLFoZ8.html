900k launch and the 27-hundred launch
it's not really anything else coming up
but I know us we can kind of get back to
this because I just started getting my
feet wet
ha no pun intended got my feet wet I did
it really wrong but this guy that
started with EXO see I haven't touched
anything like this since I did my Ellen
to overclocking video with kingpin where
let's face it he set everything up and I
just sort of got to pour the ln2 which
was fun and all but yeah so I saw the
livestream maybe you didn't take that
over 150,000 replays on a live stream
which is crazy I'm gonna show you guys
today kind of the process of doing dry
ice cooling not quite as exotic as Ellen
- and in my opinion a lot more dangerous
because of condensation effect I already
killed one of our X - 99 dark
motherboards so let's just hope that
doesn't happen today
vengeance RGB pro ddr4 memory from
corsair features optimized peak
performance for both the latest intel
and AMD based ddr4 motherboards to learn
how to bring your computer memory to the
next level click the link in the
description below so obviously you're
gonna need a motherboard and a processor
that can be anything you want in terms
of overclocking obviously we've chosen
the 18 core 79 80 XC because we are
going for you know obviously rip GN and
rip Paul and all that so the bigger the
better
and yeah you need a good motherboard
designed for overclocking so the X 299
dark is designed specifically for that
reason so that's why we're using that
we're also using g.skill Trident xenon
RGB memory this is also 3600 dims
because memory plays a huge part in our
3d mark scores especially when it comes
to physics so that's why we're using
these but obviously you need a way to
keep things cool now this is the pot
that I was using this is technically an
ln2 pot this is the one kingpin left
behind if you guys haven't seen that
video go and watch I'll try never to put
a link down below now the scores I
recently got he said hey not bad that
you got those scores on dry ice and the
fact that you did it on a pot that's not
designed for an 18 core so he just sent
me his newest pot design for 18 core and
you can tell by looking at it it's
obviously a lot bigger this one's a
two-piece too so you can get different
colors and stuff on it but if we look at
the inside you can see just how much
more tower there is or
individual chambers for cooling two kind
of more control the actual base of the
pot to give us a good cooling surface
area so you can see the whole thing is
definitely designed for 18 core which is
exactly why he's like hey you want this
pot he also sends his keep and cooling
heater plate now I already killed a
motherboard like I said and the reason
why I killed it was condensation I let
it get too warm condensation formed got
onto into the PCB and I think believe it
actually got into the socket and it
killed the motherboard but not the CPU
it's amazing how robust the CPU is this
CPU just keeps on tickin so we're gonna
see how far we can push it today but
this actually goes on the backside of
the motherboard it uses one of these
giant thermal pads that he sent with
this this is actually a thermal pad look
how thick that is that goes on there
like that or it can technically go like
that and then our heater plate goes on
top of it like so so this is a heating
element that will heat up the thermal
pad which will heat up the backside of
the socket which will keep all these
components warm and keep water from
forming back here that's what killed my
last motherboard was water other things
you're gonna need obviously is
insulation like I mentioned we use a lot
of blue shop towels we use Vaseline as I
said this is actually actually for Steve
you know because I keep beating his
scores so he needs the Vaseline but I
digress that's besides the point
this is actually for insulating the
motherboard so it's a messy job when you
do XOC you need a way to monitor
temperatures because unfortunately the
on board motherboard monitoring is not
designed for southern Europe it's not in
fact if you go below negative 4 on this
motherboard the course will show
negative for the motherboard will show
FF instead of a temperature readout as
soon as you cross 0 Celsius so that
makes this completely necessary because
on the bottom of the pot right here you
can see we've got these different holes
that are drilled in here these are
different places that we can actually
monitor temperatures so you've got one
right here at the very base of the pot
and you can monitor temperatures all
around it so I'm sure he's got this in
there so that he could have probes all
over it making sure you have nice even
temperature but you just put a dab of
thermal compound in there
stick the probe in there bend it up tape
it down and then you get your reading at
the actual base of the pot which is what
we're going to be doing here today let's
see what else that appears to be pretty
much it so today if all goes well we
will take my deleted 79 80 XE we are
going to reapply my KP x thermal
compound something that Vince designed
specifically for sub-zero cooling we are
going to apply under the IHS this is
this is a dee-lighted 79 80 XE it does
not reglued that way I can reapply it as
needed we also are going to be
reapplying obviously our thermal paste
to our pot and that's that the
motherboard also comes with this
standoff which is kind of nice so you
can keep it off the ground
voila just like that it's like a little
test bench you can get air flow
underneath it we will be also doing
graphics card on our extreme water
cooling which is with just a giant ice
tank that's being pumped to the radiator
keeping our temperatures as cold as
possible our graphics cards will
actually run under load about 12c 13c
not bad at all but if we don't do that
we can't get the temperatures anywhere
near we will want them so let's go ahead
and set this all up see how how low we
can get it and whether or not we can
actually get my CPU back up to five
point six which is where my current CPU
score is on 3d mark and I want to see
how far we can get up on single card
today
okay so this is our setup here we're
only got one GPU because I really kind
of only focus on single GPU today so
here it is we are going to go ahead and
we heated up the pot and the reason why
we did that is I observed Vince was
pretty warm and serve observed Vince do
that when he was here he did with a
torch because when you apply the thermal
pace you because you are gonna go
sub-zero you don't want it to sort of
Harden in non spread format and you know
as you heat a thermal paste it tends to
thin out and get a little bit wider and
it sort of dissipates and spreads out
more between the materials that it's
touching so if we went straight to
sub-zero that would never spread so we
heated that up to about 60 C or a fifty
eight point one right here you can see
so that sort of represents very similar
to what a processor at stock speeds
would probably be doing so we should get
some pretty good spread of that thermal
paste so now we're going to kind of let
this cool down just a little bit here
and then we're gonna go ahead and put in
our acetone oh use acetone hunterson
acetone because it doesn't freeze at the
temperatures that dry ice will get to if
we were using ln2
well the ln2 itself would be our conduit
in terms of dropping the temperatures
but we use acetone because we needed
something for the dry ice to melt into
to make cold which the acetone has a
much lower freezing point than naming
our dry ice which is like negative or
minus 78 C or something like that - 80 C
it kind of conflict the information on
the Internet bottom line is it's pretty
damn far below zero but not as cold as
ln2 which you can get minus 150 and
Beyond and then there's liquid helium
which can go all the way to like minus
250 so something ridiculous but anyway
we're gonna go and let this kind of cool
down here for a little bit and then we
are going to see if we can get on single
GPU I'm aiming for 5.5 at least hoping
for 5.6 here's our ice bucket right here
for our GPU we will be doing GPU ln2
slash dry ice but I'm getting a custom
card for that so let's go ahead and I
just wondered if that would actually
lower the temps at all it's at 50 6.9
so what you're looking for here on the
initial test as you as you're cooling it
down is you are looking for these
temperatures and the pot temperatures to
be similar because remember we're the
software is measuring inside the actual
die whereas the pot is measuring the
actual metal touching the die so if
those two are very similar then we're in
a good spot because if they were very
different which I've seen before because
I used bad thermal compound that wasn't
meant for sub-zero then that would tell
us that we were not getting a good
thermal transfer between the pots and
the chip which means instability and
potential damage no no that was coming
out of here it's the display stopped
working in the niche started smoking I
mean look look at the wires see it
started from inside there so now we have
no idea what our loop temp is okay we're
gonna keep trying to get this lower so
it's gonna take a lot of energy a lot of
ice to get the acetone temperature down
where we want this to be which is going
to be close to negative 50 ish or minus
50 minus 60 cuz think of it like when
you first put ice in a bucket the ice
will start to melt like that is right
there the ice will start melting as it
is equalizing and then once it equalizes
it'll stay at that temple s energy or in
this case dry ice to keep it there so
we're using a bunch right now to bring
the temp down and then it will be a lot
easier to maintain it it's cold up on my
hand and ice okay so in all fairness
this pot is not exactly meant for dry
ice so that two-piece nature of it is
probably allowing some of it to get
through the sides
I meant to tape it I should have taped
it and I didn't and so what we're
dealing with now is just acetone just
everywhere fortunately acetone itself is
not really conductive it's now like
dripping under the board
so now XOC overclocking is really not
that much different than regular
overclocking now we're basically going
to just bump it up incrementally so I'm
gonna go straight to 5.2 with all the
same settings we just did but my main
job during this is actually to regulate
temperature here and make
that all the temperature stays well
within you know safe zones where we want
it all right
11,000 787 on the CPU getting there and
that was at five point four five point
five so we're gonna go and try five
point six a number that I had a hard
time getting stable before that I really
think I attribute to the fact that I
couldn't keep the temperatures quite as
cold and the pot was probably just
getting a little bit overworked five
point six crashed disappears five point
six is like it's a bit of a wall for me
I'm gonna hack up a time hitting it oh I
don't think we're gonna be hitting I
don't think we're me getting five point
six on this I think it needs to be
colder to get five six five seven
Vince was telling me a kingpin he was
telling me that you know this might be a
five eight five nine chip but it's gonna
need like minus 150 to get there you'd
be surprised what temperatures can
actually do in terms of stability okay
it finished where we were playing
eighteen 603 so let's go ahead and
compare results online oh yeah I would
love it eighteen 603 I'm seeing ones as
I've smokes smoked and inhaled so much
acetone and dry ice number seven has
moved up another one but in a nutshell
this is what XOC is like you spend a lot
of time tweaking and tuning and figuring
out what works and what doesn't and very
little time actually running the test at
least for me learning like this we also
got bored and started putting dry ice in
here
so such is the life of EXO see I guess
now what we have to do is we actually
have to warm this up to about minus 20 C
before we can shut it off so about minus
25 minus 20 and then we shut it down and
take it apart before the condensation
can form and destroy our motherboard so
yeah with that guys we're gonna go ahead
and shut her down thanks for watching I
just you guys seem so interested in the
live stream that I did I thought I have
to do a video about this and since
Vincent sent me all new stuff I figured
I might as well at least try it out and
as you guys saw a game back like two
spots two or three spots on single card
alone and I think I'm gonna try right
now to go ahead and just do like fire
strike extreme and fire strike ultra and
maybe even time spy and I don't know
we'll see but I'm pretty much out of
acetone and stuff so I think we're done
and rather than prolonging how long it
will take me to shut down this system
I'm just gonna go ahead and just run
like prime95 or something to let it warm
up to warm up to minus 20 Celsius yeah
crazy right it's at minus 61 right now
it's going to be a little while all
right guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you the next one and
this guy's still over here sizzling do
all this at your own risk
seriously I've already killed a mother
board and this board is ugly now and
this board was drenched in acetone
earlier because it leaked out of the pot
I know let's frost bit my thumb we
almost caught fire you know this caught
fire so yeah that's a wrap
intro this thing broke on me
oh it's smoking oh they're all right
that started smoking on me that's really
warm it's so cold potato co potato cold
potato</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
