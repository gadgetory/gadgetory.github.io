cents and it's really no surprise that
sometimes people just like their
components to be big and I mean like
really really big kind of like this guy
behind me here the half stacker it's
pretty big now that's not just true for
computer cases it goes for a lot of
things when it comes to computers for
instance you could go with this giant
480 millimeter radiator it'll do a 40
millimeter radiator it's mean look
please know the difference in that so
when it comes to computer parts there's
a lot of different choices that you
could go with when it comes to size now
if you're one of those people that's
really not interested in building a
gigantic computer maybe you want to go
more with a micro ATX board like this
one here which is even smaller
but what if even that is too big for you
what if you want to go even smaller well
then you're looking at ITX format now
ITX format is really as small the
problem with that is sometimes the ITX
motherboards just are a huge compromise
when it comes to power and features well
until today because you see MSI has come
out with the z87 eye gaming ITX
motherboard with a z87 chipset I mean
look at it this is the box now I know
you guys aren't too interested I'm
looking at unboxings but hey there it is
this thing is tiny I feel like eating it
it's just so small I don't know to do
with it I just now before we move on to
the motherboard let's go ahead and just
see what comes in the box this
motherboard comes with a really cool MSI
gaming badge a big one and which is kind
of ironic give you a huge badge small
motherboard stick that on your case
we've got your driver software your
software disk
you've got your i/o shield your typical
SATA ports here your MSI
installation guide you've got your users
manual course with the dragon on there
and these antennas antennas you say well
this motherboard has not only built-in
Wireless but if you look at the front of
the box here it has the world's fastest
Wi-Fi on there at 867 megabits per
second OEE 802.11 AC 5 gigahertz
wireless onboard that's important
because if you're building a small
form-factor case like this chances are
if you're building a small form-factor
PC that would go in an ITX case chances
are you need portable well Emma sighs
thought ahead and said well if you need
portable chances are you gonna be tied
down to a wire so that's exactly what
they did on this board here they've
included the wireless built-in right
here this board comes with everything
you would expect it to come with in a
large format like a full ATX board
you've got your dual channel RAM here
you've got two slots
you've got your PCI Express 16 X slot
right here and you've got
high-definition audio it comes with the
killer e to 20 new cards got eSATA it's
got four USB 3.0 s two USB 2.0 s it's
got your optical out it has HDMI output
DisplayPort output DVI output and of
course 7.1 surround audio that is really
killer now of course one of the things
that the MSI gaming line of products is
known for is the dragon and there's no
compromise with that right here as you
can see you have the dragon heatsink on
there no different than any other MSI
gaming board and then you've got your
chipset cooler right here which just
looks fantastic now you've got USB 3.0
connectivity you've got five SATA 3
ports on here and then of course this
does have onboard RAID controller and
then you've got let's see here it looks
like one - it looks like you do have two
PWM controlled fan headers I can see one
two
it looks like we do have two onboard USB
expansions I do see your AC 97 audio and
your HD audio ports and what I really
like is the fact that on the back it
still has a clear CMOS button which is
really important if we're gonna be doing
overclocking what's really neat is the
way they implemented the battery the
save space on the board instead of
having the battery laid out flat the
battery is laid vertical to the
motherboard just in a slot right there
so it could be kind of tight to get that
battery out of there looks like a little
lever here that you just push down and
it pops right out but there it is
so it comes of course standard with all
of the features that you would expect
here with a high-end motherboard I mean
it's got well it looks like all black
capacitors here it's got audio boost the
killer Ethernet the OC Genie 4 which you
know can automatically overclock your
chipset for you and it's got all the
military class specs that you would
expect from MSI but what I think really
sets this board apart is the fact that
it's got that onboard Wireless now yeah
I mean it does kind of clash a little
bit because the PCB on the wireless is
green and it's got the white sticker on
there chances are it's not really going
to be seen but you know hey there has to
be some compromise on there because
everything else about this board just
seems to be absolutely perfect I mean
the quality of the parts the black PCB I
mean everything on this just looks
perfect and I really have no complaints
about it now if you're looking at
building a small form-factor like this
this is definitely a board to check out
now at the time I don't really like to
talk about pricing for the most part but
I'm gonna go ahead and put it out there
in this video because I know people are
gonna ask at the time of filming right
now this board is coming in at about
$200 so I think says MSI says that their
price point is on this is $1.99 and that
is as of the filming of this video of
course over time that's probably gonna
change so there it is guys if you're
looking at building a farm farm Villa
farm built a farm with your computer
maybe a data form may be a bit mining
farm so there you go guys the
uncompromising z87 I Gaming Mini ITX
motherboard from
sigh giving you everything you expect
from the z87 chipset without sacrificing
the power for form factor and just to
give you a little bit of a size
comparison on this there's my hand check
that out
I don't have a very big hand and this is
not a very big board and it let me look
that's a quadrat and that's the
motherboard it's pretty damn small check
it out guys you know to do if you like
this video click that thumbs up button
if you liked it mash the thumbs down
button if you hated it and tell me what
you guys think about this motherboard
put it down in the comments let me know
what you think about this let me know
what it--it's motherboards you have used
and as always guys I will see you in my
next video and until then go and watch
another one of my videos or something or
talk to me on Facebook or maybe Twitter
or maybe that their Instagram thing here
that's where all the young kids are
doing today I have no idea what I'm
talking about now you can go that is all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
