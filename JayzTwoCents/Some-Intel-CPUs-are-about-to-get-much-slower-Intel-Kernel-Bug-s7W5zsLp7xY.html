in a brainy a talking head video to give
you sort of a breaking news like a
dudududududu dude there's some big news
that is hit this week we're gonna talk
about that so feel free to minimize this
video and just listen if you're busy and
doing other things there's no point in
looking at me I'm not doing any editing
I'm not even putting any music in this
entails got some problems right now
because of a kernel leak happening on a
hardware level in their x86 CPUs x86 and
64 CPUs
so yeah you're gonna want to listen to
this one I'm not gonna dive too deep
down the rabbit hole of what the problem
is trying to talk technical jargon and
stuff about things that I truly honestly
I'm not a CPU architect I don't know how
it works I don't care how it works
because between you and me
the what the problem is actually doing
is less important to me than what the
fix is what's the effect of the fix
going to be and what is at stake right
now and that's what most people should
be concerned with when it comes to the
problem on a high level what's happening
here is I'm gonna put some article links
down below please read them check them
out they're written articles but they
they're some of the sources I use for
just kind of figuring out what's going
on with all of this so they're worth a
read please check them out but what's
happening is we've actually got three
different problems three not just one
meltdown is the one that's kind of
hitting the the mainstream media hard
because it affects Intel x86 64
processors which as you guys know Intel
still has the huge majority market share
which means they kind of shoulder the
burden of most of this problem and the
way it's affecting people but there's
three problems out there between all
three of them all manufacturers of CPUs
and micro processors are affected Intel
AMD and arm even the problem is Intel's
more affected by this on their hardware
level bug because AMD and arm are
affected more on a software level and
the kernel bug that were about to talk
about with Intel you have to have
physical access to the machine on AMD
CPUs to have the exploit available to
you whereas Intel's memory leak in the
way that the memory leak with the kernel
is happening versus AMD if you have an
AMD processor you're pretty much
unaffected by this even though the
problem does actually still sort of
exist for you as well
now the kernel and I don't mean Kentucky
Fried Chicken kernel although some
pretty good right about now the kernel
is kind of sitting in between the
processor in the OS it's very basic way
of describing it basically but as it
holds very sensitive data
encryption levels and things that
happened but unfortunately the memory
leak that's happening right now with the
kernel is very accessible and it's not
encrypted which means things like
passwords and sensitive data access
point to your computer and from your
computer it's it's basically a backdoor
that anyone can get into that machine
and do anything they want they can
delete data they can add data that can
run programs run malicious software if
you thought the ransomware
was that was a was a bad thing that only
affected certain people with what
certain uh you know patches that weren't
that in place this affects everybody
pretty much everybody but like I said
whether it comes to arm and AMD they're
they're easily more patched and named
yet to have physical access to the
machine but the way Indies architecture
also is built with the kernel it's very
different on the way that that memory is
accessed or that kernel is accessed and
I'm glad I waited to do this video to
today instead of yesterday because there
was some late night developments with
Intel and they finally addressed that
yes this is real VSS is a problem yes
were we are working with the software
vendors to fix this and my software
vendors I mean your operating system so
if you're on Windows of course Linux and
even Mac OS you are affected by this
unfortunately this is one of those times
where you can't be like well I'm on Mac
I'm impervious to these types of things
no you're you're affected by this as
well because you're running Intel CPUs
but Intel did in fact come forth and say
yes this is a problem and we're working
to fix this it's really up to the
software vendors to patch this because
this is happening now with on an OS
level and understand more about this
problem you have to understand how they
even arise is a lot of companies and
even independent researchers without
even being asked will go and hack
websites they'll hack software they're
hack hardware and then what they do is
they present the data these are good
hackers it sounds weird right these are
good hackers who will present the data
to the firms so that they can be fixed
and patched and stuff usually for a
nominal fee I mean they make a lot of
money doing this security stuff and then
there are firms that are hired to
continually try to hack and break in
backdoor whatever and we use that when I
worked in software we had a firm that
was constantly this their whole job was
to just constantly test our stuff find
the exploits and let us fix them so that
was exactly what happened here
a firm found this exploit which attests
as far back as ten-year-old processors
and found that this exploit was present
so this is not new this has been going
on for over a decade now when it comes
to the problem it's actually started to
be fixed by some of the software vendors
as recently as December in fact the
beginning of December Mac OS update went
out that had a fix in it for that so as
you can see by the time we hear about it
it's been long going on and the reason
for that is because you don't want to
tip off the hackers because you want to
try and fix this before it makes
mainstream that way the hackers will
have an opportunity to exploit this so
that's why Allah this is kept hush-hush
not because they're trying to oh my god
protect market share shareholders
interest of course that does indeed play
a part of this because AMD's stock has
soared since it came out that Intel CPUs
are the ones that are being hit heavy by
this just go look at the stock market
for yourself and you'll see that AMD
stocks have soared
especially since Tomlin dakki at AMD
who's an engineer for them came out and
said look we are not accessing our kit
our kernel the same way attack they have
a they have something built in that
handles things very differently it's
called and I gotta use my notes here cuz
I don't wanna get this wrong it's called
their kernel page table isolation
feature it protects against these types
of things so AMD actually has something
in place that sort of gave them a little
bit of added security towards this
although they are still affected a
little bit like I mentioned on the
software side of things you have to have
physical access to the Box even have a
chance of hacking the AMD kernel so
that's crazy how 2018 has started off
but here's the here's the part that
really truly affects us is when this is
fixed it's going to be respect we're
going to talk about Intel and Microsoft
here because this that's the majority
right the all the distros and stuff on
Linux and the way the Linux kernel is
handled that's already been worked on as
well and it's being worked on and
patches are rolling out for that but of
course we are at the mercy of Microsoft
and what they do with this and they're
gonna be kind of rewriting and putting
out a I believe the update is supposed
to be January 9th on this this new
update and in fact the updates that way
you guys can check and see if you have
it because unfortunately now to truly
fix this you're gonna have to have
updates turned on there's gonna be
update KB four zero five four zero
- - that is the update that is supposed
to fix this but here's the problem
because of the way the kernel is being
accessed and kind of rewritten with the
OS to try and band-aid this this is the
band-aid fix there's no other way to put
it this is a band-aid fix because there
is a hardware level problem here
so until Intel fix this on new CPUs our
old CPUs are still going to be using
software band-aid fixes which
unfortunately can probably be broken and
hacked as well so you know people are
going to be attacking the fix the fix is
where you find the code for the problem
and that's what they're going to attack
unfortunately so just wait for that the
fix could slow down your Intel CPU by as
little as 5% or as much as 30% depending
on your age your processor and the
workload on it now processors with PCI D
are going to be a little bit less
infected and those are processors that
are Haswell fourth gen and newer the
higher end the CPU and the stronger it
is probably the less impact it will be
performance wise but it will have an
impact no matter what these slower more
baseline entry-level CPUs are probably
going to see a much higher hit and then
of course those without PCI D or older
that has well fourth gen are going to
proceed probably a significant hit
because PCI D is supposed to be what's
kind of mitigating a lot of this
performance loss so the question is how
much is it going to affect you an impact
you have no idea we don't know until the
patch rolls out worldwide and gets out
to its users and I'm sure you're gonna
see people saying it's probably gone as
higher than 30 percent you might see
people saying I don't even notice a
difference Intel is pretty convinced
that average everyday piece consumers
like an home PCs are not going to notice
really much of a difference at all it's
those that are running data centers and
cloud farms and and data farms and all
that sort of stuff that are gonna notice
more of an impact because those CPUs are
being leveraged to their max capacity
anyway so once you're already at max
capacity at your current workload and
your current capability and it slows
down that's where you going to notice it
great because it comes off the top if
you're not using all that performance
Headroom and it comes down up here but
you're still here you're not gonna
notice it that much so that's the way
that kind of works so in terms of gaming
because I know a lot of you guys are
like what about my games if you read
some of the articles down below you'll
see that gaming was mentioned the
problem is the game titles that were
used were not DirectX titles they were
they were other api's and so
problem is DirectX being a Microsoft API
and the way it's gonna access the
operating system with the new kernel
access software update could potentially
see a negative impact who knows what
that's going to be there's too many
Hardware permeations and variations out
there for me to even begin to say
whether or not you're gonna see any sort
of a slowdown I don't know if I'm gonna
test this quite honestly I don't even
know what kind of testing methodology or
redundancy testing or regression testing
I can even possibly do to try and give
you guys an answer on whether or not
you'd be affected but maybe we'll play
around that a little bit but five to
thirty percent slowdown you imagine
overnight with an update comes through
and your CPU is 30% slower because of a
hardware level bug that's existed for
over a decade on Intel CPUs this is not
the way we needed to start 2018 this is
not right kind of man I feel bad for the
Intel folks going to CES next week this
whole problem came out right before CES
I don't think I'd want to go anywhere
near those Intel boosts I as a rep I
wouldn't wanna go anywhere near Intel
I'd probably just be like I'm done I'm
out I quit it'd be like a jet PI trying
to go to CES which he's not going to by
the way - you wonder why anyway so guys
that's that that's very high level like
I said I highly recommend doing some
reading you'll find the links down below
all we can do is wait and there is
nothing we can do other than turn on
updates now in Microsoft we have no
choice unless you want to leave yourself
exposed I mean if you want to be a CPU
flasher leave yourself exposed that's on
you I mean it really is but I mean the
only way to really fix this now is hope
that the hope that the CPU manufacturers
and the OS vendors are talking to try
and fix this as best they can but I
don't think this is going anywhere I
think I think now that this is hit
mainstream and the hackers now know
where to look and when the when the
patch rolls out the patch is gonna
obviously point hackers in the right
direction on where to kind of zero in on
where the problem is and start to
reverse engineer that patch to try and
access things I'm telling you right now
man hackers it's it's incredibly it's
it's impressive how smart they are but
man is a sucker when it's used for
malicious purposes anyway sound off in
the comments down below guys and really
curious as to what your thoughts on this
are you guys wanted mine
here it is don't know what else to say
alright guys thanks for watching and
we'll see we'll see you next week but we
got a video or two coming up before that
hopefully anyway see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
