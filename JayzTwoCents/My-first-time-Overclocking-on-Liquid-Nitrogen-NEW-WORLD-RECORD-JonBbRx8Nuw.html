look what I finally got my hands on me
much anticipated long-awaited in my
opinion overdue GT x 1080 TI kingpin
edition from EVGA that is a mouthful we
haven't seen this since Computex if you
guys haven't seen that video I highly
recommend you go and watch it first I'll
pop it out right here somewhere because
we talked about what's custom with this
car - what makes this more than just
another custom cooler with some LEDs and
graphics card oh no this card is
different in just about every single way
looks like a black and copper for the
wind 3 but from about right here this
line on the back of the GPU rearward is
all custom this is a very one-off 10
phase power delivery - it's 13 phase
it's 10 plus 3 so you got 10 power
phases for this GPU 3 power phases for
the memory and it's capable of a
ridiculous amount of power delivery
something I think I think Vince told me
something like 1200 watts or something
like that is capable of being delivered
through this power delivery system so
this is not for the faint of heart we
got to a pin power plugs right here on
the back which is kind of funny right
the amount of power you can put through
this and doing it with just 2 8 pin PCI
Express but I digress that's besides the
point we've got our evbot plug right
here on the back what I like though is
the way this card if you look at it
closely the PCBs on the edges are
normally green because of the the layer
of the PCB in between is like a greenish
yellowish color this one's gold because
they actually gold trimmed this if I
mean everything like so much detail into
this we've actually got three mini
DisplayPort a full size HDMI and a DVI
and the reason for this and I asked them
about this is why do you do mini
DisplayPort because it's kind of
annoying personally he goes well that's
because we want to be able to
accommodate single slot now I could have
just done a straightforward you know put
this on the test bench turn the fans to
100% well all these copper or fins do
their thing but you know the only way to
really get the most out of this card is
to do like ln2 overclocking that's what
it's built for the problem is I've never
done Ellen - I've seen people do it I
have no idea like what I would be doing
I'd probably kill the card if I did that
so unfortunately I don't think that
we're gonna
- did you hear that
did someone say you're clocking
okay so obviously I called in an expert
here we've got Vince the one and only
kingpin himself you might have heard of
him if you haven't he's pretty much the
world-record holder all the time if that
spot slips he gets it back every single
time that's kind of the chase right yep
so Vince is holding right here the exact
same card these are production cards
these are not custom one offs like we
saw at copy text so I mean what's
different well the difference is number
one doesn't have the cooler on it and
it's a little bit greased up and ready
for some L into action all right and
this right here is the stock plate the
cooling plate for the vrm correct yeah
we made the vrm plate modular so you
know you have to keep the the power
phases cool when you're overclocking
they do get quite hot at 1.45 1.5 volts
yeah you can just just mount this and
you don't even need the cooler so okay
so we hear a lot about custom VRMs and
custom power delivery on pretty much all
the brands so what makes this one
different this one is really I mean you
know the average stock overclocked card
maybe 400 watts for 50 watts but you
know this card went pushed to 2.5 or 2.6
gigahertz I mean you're talking 900 to
1,200 watts it's a big difference
that's insane so power delivery I'm not
just the graphics card obviously as a
whole it's very important we're actually
running two different power supplies
today we'll talk about that in a sec all
right so why don't you tell me then if
you're watching this right now and
you're like well I put my hands in the
grease like you said not to the like you
mentioned literally that's lathered up
and we'll talk about that so if you're
watching this or you like me I've never
done lnto before what do you actually
need to get started well I you know I
brought brought my stuff brought on my
gear well for number one you need lnto
pots you need the GPU pot you need CPU
pots you need temperature metering
equipment fluke 52 is very nice dual
input you'll notice he's losing a lot of
hardware monitoring not relying on
software monitoring for voltages of
which we know is fairly inaccurate yeah
so we've got Hardware monitoring over
here we've got some supplies yeah these
are I mean it's pretty simple but it's
this is a key point a lot of guys use
these it has to be blue though yeah blue
blue shop towels get them at Home Depot
Lowe's
very absorbent and these can wick away
moisture from everything on this is that
what you're fighting with Ellen to is
moisture constantly constantly because
we've seen them the I've seen other like
videos about ln2 and you see guys that
will you know they'll create this
barrier on the motherboard yeah that's
that's you want to isolate the airspace
around the socket to minimize the
freezing same thing on the card you can
see the the GPU pot just has foam on it
and once it's mounted you don't really
want a lot of ice and water getting in
behind the GPU and memory chips can
cause a lot the same kind of material
you'd find out like an HVAC unit right
with those pipes yeah although it
doesn't get as cold with the with the
transfer but yeah I brought some here so
I'm just some half inch flat foam yeah
exactly if you can get this at like Home
Depot's yeah it's like HVAC insulation
okay what is this tube right here this
is the temperature probe yeah this is a
k-type thermocouple very accurate they
read down to about minus 196 pretty
accurately so I use these all the time
okay now tell us about the pots because
you were telling me that you actually
designed these yeah this is my f1 dark
pot and this is good for the new socket
x-29 ein and many many past sockets it's
competitive look pretty Universal here
yeah it's definitely compatible with
many and this is a great CPU pot turn
around for a while can handle ten and
twelve core no problem actually this is
another another thing you need it's very
helpful this is a heater plate so
there's a heating component in here okay
which heats the socket and fights the
condensation that we were talking
so you want to cool it down to a certain
degree but you want to control how cold
it's going with this well you you don't
want to cool the problem is if you don't
use this the whole PCB will freeze the
memory slots everything that causes a
new level of problems huge problem cuz
electricity doesn't like to be frozen
nope so basically this mounts on the
bottom of the motherboard and these rods
are used for pass-through like you said
and then the pot mounts from the top top
side right on top of the CPU you just
want to cool the CPU you don't want to
cool the whole socket and most most guys
have developed their own their own
cooling solutions to like you've
designed your own here are these
available for purchase yeah I saw these
on KPC com I saw the GPU pots on kpz
calm the temperature probes the thermal
grease a lot of this stuff I've
developed
from many years of our garden now Vince
told me he's gonna leave these with us
that way we can start getting our hands
dirty and hopefully not frozen right we
don't wanna we don't a terminator
situation here something to notice here
too obviously we're using the dark x 299
board here from EVGA this has active erm
cooling as well did this play a big part
too on on getting X to 99 where we need
it in terms of overclocking actually
when we did this board you just need
light airflow on the V RMS it's we
increased the face count on here and
it's very very good what's cool is this
isn't just a typical piece of aluminum
that you would see on their County as
the heat scene there's actually heat
thins in here is there a pipe in there
as well um I believe so yeah there's a P
those are those fins are soldered and
it's actually a very high quality
heatsink it's not just some a slap on
aluminum piece still can't wait for this
one to make it to market here we're
still a little bit away but hopefully
soon we'll get our hands on one what's
the heat gun for then and the end the
torch okay well the blowtorch is is
really a key point of overclocking
basically if it gets too cold you can
heat it up with the torch I use map gas
because it has a higher combustion
temperature over 2,000 C and it burnt
burnt I think it burns cleaner than than
propane and there's there's once we
start going I can show you some some
tricks on how to how to get the pot to
pull down quicker by using the torch and
you're using your own brand of thermal
compound yeah this is kpx I developed
this recently in the past a year and a
half okay so is there is there something
special about that with the temperatures
involved well the problem is when
thermal grease gets to around - 142 -
160 most commercial greases will freeze
you here and it's it becomes an
insulator Wow I need on't want that no
because then we're gonna be going the
other direction
well yeah you see a huge Delta you could
have you could have minus 150 on the pot
but your your CPU temperature will
actually be positive yeah you know with
that know you know and then obviously
we've got the L the L and - that's
important Vince brought the small tank
today he carries this with him
everywhere he goes never leaves home
without it something else we didn't
really mention on this table though is
the Vaseline
yeah how come you can't mention Vaseline
without a giggle right that's but that
I'm pretty sure this is for the price
involved in ln2 right because so that's
not actually for the computer as much as
it's for well you can use your
imagination it's for protection I mean
it's the right right we don't want to
chafe you know I put it all over
everything I put it around the socket I
put it all over the memory chips and
basically this will keep the card
running without this the water can get
behind the GPU can get behind the memory
chips and then you see artifacts and
then it's not working yeah because it's
gonna find its way in there no matter
what you do it just it's gonna work its
way in there the Vaseline keeps it from
getting in there it's the seems
counterintuitive if you ask me well you
know we gotta do next now we got to set
this all up so I'm gonna let Vince do
his thing and we're gonna hopefully
maybe even break a record today who
knows it's probably not likely because
we're in MySpace and I'm not that lucky
but we're gonna we're gonna go for it
we're gonna see what happens
okay so everything's together we're
posted now once you tell everyone kind
of what you do and how you start the
process here okay so it's not as simple
as just plug everything and go go
gangbusters which is what I would do I
would just like I'd be too excited to
actually pace myself and I think I would
try and go for the record right away
that's not the right thing to do no you
need to do things incrementally so I
will assemble a system make sure posts
make sure the cards okay boot into
Windows maybe run a few benchmarks I
think for today I really want to focus
on overclocking the GPU so we will just
leave the CPU at a reasonable speed it's
18 core CPU so times by extreme doesn't
really slow bottlenecking theory then at
what point does your cpu speed really
start to limit your overall GPU score it
depends on the resolution of the
benchmark you're running and you run
extreme support K right yeah it's a lot
less yeah the difference between four
point five and five point five or five
point four is almost nothing in the
benchmark okay he's gonna keep topping
this off because it's boiling off over
time well I think it's neat though is I
thought it was based on a level like he
wants to keep that full but he was
telling me that it's specifically based
on temperatures right so you're
monitoring the temps and then you're
adjusting based on that but something
else that you have to keep in mind too
though custom cooling and custom
overclocking and world record attempts
also we've got a custom BIOS that's on
here
that's going to help us do that so
what's next now do we just scope next is
I'd like to run some time spy extreme
just to make sure that you know
everything's cool and stable this is
actually full of L&amp;amp;T right here I'm
surprised at how well the vapors yeah
okay so this is how he's filling it
right here
and he gets nothing but liquid which is
really cool would you call that system
yeah well basically there's a there's a
phase separator on the end of here and
what this does is it slows the velocity
of the ln2 down and eliminates a lot of
the bubbles minimizes the pressure it
makes it a lot easier to deal with at
the supply side of this line so many
little things go into this and I notice
you're not using gloves this cuz you're
a badass
no actually it's more it's more it's
it's more safe to not wear gloves
because it cuz you can feel the cold do
you know when to pull away when there's
a barrier between your skin and the
Ellen to the Ellen to can burn you
directly Wow as opposed to I can show
you I mean I've seen the science videos
to where the guys are like yeah it just
it just boils off okay yeah that's it
see I just felt like you pull like bez
this felt like faucet water but if you
had a glove on you would be burned
instantly Wow so I don't and also socks
I usually don't wear socks when I
overclocked or you should have your
pants pulled over so your socks can't
get wet then you can kind of see how it
reacts to one yeah you'll see like that
warming will stop and then it will
slowly start to pour or maintain now
it's loading right now s'alright your
you can you can hit the GPU again and
you don't have to worry about anything
freezing I mean the voltage is one point
one volts decore right now now when the
CPU test starts you kind of have to you
got to like put a lot of ln2 in if you
got to be ready to go this is getting
kind of low too
now one thing you know if we're standing
here for a few hours benching then what
happens is these containers start to
sweat right oh yeah and this thing will
be covered in water and you'll go to
pour it and you'll dump water all over
the board so you got to constantly do
this all right here comes the what is it
CPU test yeah hit the hit the CPU hard
give it just fill it let's see
should be okay but I have everything
cranked on this right now cash in the
memory and every day so it's gonna run
hot yeah and a GPU of course in the CPU
test does not that is very very nice you
can see that thing heating up even
you've filled it with Ellen - it's crazy
right
4.5 that's it not when we're
overclocking and the GPU say is that -
150 - 140 yeah you actually there's no
load on the GPU during this part of the
test so you want to lay off the GPU and
just kind of let it go yeah yeah so yeah
make sure it's valid and then submit it
try to submit it to 3dmark calm and just
see it goes under your account and
everything and then we're good to go we
can let it rip
so we've been playing around this for a
while finding our limits and Vince
actually receded the pot the army
mounted the pot because we found that
mounting is like an art okay and yes he
mounted it and yes he put all this
together but I had a part in it pouring
is important he said so yeah there's an
asterisk next to my name on the world
record but our world record was a 64 44
then we did at 64 73 then at 65 65 66
then at 60 601 and then a 66 42 so we
added 200 more points to our score on
top of the world record so what we're
gonna do right now is we are gonna load
up that score and we are gonna send it
up to the cloud valid score as you can
see right there so for the meantime
until someone else or Vince himself
decides to go in and break this score I
will hold the single GPU world record in
time spy extreme under the Canadian j-su
sense don't understand why it's doing
that but whatever this is I've always
known this is the next level right
skipping you know chillers and pail
tiers and stuff like that but going
straight to ln2 it's not half as scary
as I thought it was I didn't even want
to touch the thermostat the start of
this because I was afraid I'm gonna burn
my hands I've been pouring it all over
my hands without gloves by the way and
Vince tells me that having gloves can be
dangerous actually why is that
well the ln2 can burn your skin
immediately if there's any fabric or
anything in between the two services he
told me that and I thought that that was
interesting I mean even like special
rubber gloves and stuff but a part of it
splashed off the table and hit me in the
lake and I've been pouring it on my skin
you know as it overflows no problem but
the second it hit my lake with the with
the jeans it just felt like it was like
burning in it was a really weird feeling
but anyway there we go we are the world
record holder hopefully this will
refresh yeah I mean it's it's not it's
not for everybody
but it's definitely for the enthusiasts
looking to I mean this is we talked
about this this is my game right
overclocking is my game I like games
overclocking as my game but obviously
we're just I've been doing it at club
level up until now
well it's does my 64 44 so he hasn't
come back and beat me yet but I don't
know well you got back up so we have
backups see what you do is you save your
score and then he beats you it's just
like BAM it was my real score yes there
it is
66 42 so we are currently a little under
300 points faster than JPM boy oh I hope
he's watching I hope he's watching
anyway guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching today's video this was a fun
project a huge thank you to EVGA for
sponsoring this video Vince for coming
out and yeah I I'm impressed with
everything I saw and member that was
without even pushing the CPU as far as
we could because I mean we didn't need
to know four point five all right we're
gonna shut her down since we're letting
everything everything's good warmed up
we're gonna shut it down we're in this
video guys thanks for watching check out
EVGA comm also to you have your website
kingpin : comm check it out all the
stuff you see here is off the shelf like
I said you can go and buy this today and
start getting your I would say your feet
wet but I'd say get your feet frozen in
Ellen - alright guys we'll see in the
next month look at that Canadian J first
place
I gotta figure how to change that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
