welcome to my home office where if
you're a long-term viewer of the channel
you'd remember I made a lot of my videos
here hundreds of videos were made in
this room and because the winds kicked
up in Southern California and
unfortunately they kicked up trees right
out of the ground and broke powerlines
and it is just a mess here in Southern
California and so our studio is without
power so I am here at the home studio
home office I'm basically making a
studio again with a very temporary setup
I'm gonna be bringing in my review here
of the r-tx 2070 from Nvidia a highly
anticipated launch and one that I think
most of us are very nervous about
because obviously the 2080 and 2080 I
launched went without put that much
enthusiasm I guess you could say it was
a terrible price to performance ratio so
let's see how the 2070 stacks up now
this sort of recap if you guys were not
paying attention to the r-tx launched
back in September it was yeah it's it's
launched almost a month ago by the time
you guys are watching this video it was
extremely disappointing I don't know
many reviewers who gave it a very
positive review because although the
graphics card is a huge leap forward in
graphics technology or GPU technology
obviously we've got the tensor cores in
there we got the touring architecture
we've got real time ray tracing which by
the way at the time making this video we
still have no titles that truly take
advantage of ray tracing we've got the
Final Fantasy 15 demoed ELSS demo which
is still not ray tracing it's just using
the tour occurring cores for
anti-aliasing
processing and then we've still got the
Star Wars reflections demo which is not
a game that is an extremely tailored
demo designed to make Raich real time
ray tracing look amazing which is not
indicative of real-world performance so
I don't even show it because it's really
just it's it's not indicative of what
the actual user experience is gonna be
like but the price to performance ratio
on 20 80 and 20 ATT I've made it an
extremely lackluster launch sure it was
faster upwards of 25 30 40 percent
depending on the title but at an
increased cost of up to 70 percent
compared to the 1080 TI
where we're used to seeing generational
improvements in the 25 to 30
range at the same price unfortunately
when you compared the very comparable
price of a 2080 to a 1080 TI you saw
that it was anywhere from zero to nine
percent which was not great so that's
where the 2070 comes in a card that I
was extremely interested in taking a
look at because I wanted to see how
video was going to fit this in it's
extremely crowded product stack let's
look at AMD for a second here because
AMD doesn't have a very crowded stack we
have the 565 75 80 rrx cards obviously
and then we've got Vega 56 and Vega 64
we've got basically five cards that make
up the entire product stack if you look
at a video on the other hand we have got
and not including the GT 1030 because
that's not really a gaming card at all
that's just a card to give you video for
like home theater or just browsing the
internet looking at videos not really
gonna game on that very well we've got
the 1050 1050 10 Ti the 1060 3g the 1066
G we've got the 1070 1070 10 T I at 1080
1080 TI Titan X Pascal Titan V although
it's not a gaming card playing people
are still gaming on them so that's 10
cards right there 20 80 20 atti
and now 20 70 that's 13 cards that you
could buy today the other thing that
made the RT X 20 80 and 20 80 TI
launched extremely disappointing was the
nearly impossible or let's just call it
impossible MSRP price point to reach
remember Nvidia is also in direct sales
they have the founders Edition card
which is basically $100 premium on top
of the MSRP EVGA gigabyte asu's PNY MSI
I mean all these companies that are also
making a video graphics cards and buying
cores from Nvidia are competing against
their supplier so it's a very
interesting market that we saw starting
with Pascal so a Nvidia is charging a
hundred or premium on their cards
because they are basically you know
finding them and keeping the best ones
for themselves and slightly overclocking
them now with the RT x-series the AI
bees are having to compete with that and
they are not basically capable of making
cards MSRP and still make money
they did that they would be out of
business before you knew it because
there would be no profit there is very
little markup whatsoever when it comes
to graphics cards
and so it's very difficult for them to
do that so the twenty seventy we're
looking at today is kind of a big deal
because it is an MSRP $4.99 offering
from EVGA that being the RT x 27 t black
edition now one of the ways they kept
the cost down on this card is it doesn't
have any frills it doesn't have a
backplate it doesn't have a triple slot
cooler it's got a very basic cooler
actually it's a the same style fan as
you would find on the XC ultra but it's
a dual slot it's a much shorter PCB it
has no backplate no RGB it only has one
power plug so it's not really built for
high end overclocking it's gonna be
stuck to the power limits and stuff that
are available to it through a single PCI
Express eight pin as well as the power
being delivered through the PCI Express
so it's gonna have a lower power target
on there it's not going to overclock
very far but for the sake of this test
and comparing it to all the cards that
we've already benchmarked recently here
with these launches everything garden's
see in this video is out of the box
settings anyway so the 27 T founders
Edition card boosts up to 17 hundred and
10 megahertz where the reference cards
are advertised as boosting up to sixteen
hundred and twenty but actually saw on
this card with the temperatures kept
really really low with the stock fan
curve because again not a lot of heat
coming out of this core it is seeing up
to eighteen hundred and sixty megahertz
and then dropping down into the mid 70s
when it's under load and the
temperatures have sort of equalized and
saturated but keep in mind pretty much
all of the r-tx reviews you're seeing
though when it comes to temperatures 20
80 and 28 ET I included the tensor cores
are pretty much sitting there idle not
doing anything and those will generate
heat once titles start calling for those
courses do something specifically DL SS
being the main thing that's going to be
asking for the tensor course to do
something so as soon as those start
becoming more active and in play the
temperatures on all these cards are
probably going to go up pretty
significantly
now the EVGA 2070 black was sitting at
62 C max temp in all of my testing
that's fire strike fire strike extreme
fire strike ultra time spy extreme of
course the game titles that we've tested
and I found that to be actually pretty
good now that is obviously in an open
air test bench but the reason why we do
that is because we don't want the case
to introduce any sort of impact on the
cooling when we're testing cooler
capability on the graphics card so we
allow it an open air environment so we
can see what the max efficiency cooling
capability is of the card so obviously
your cooling is going to vary depending
on your case and ambient temperatures in
your environment
now speaking of testing let's go and
take a look at those benchmarks you
could see how it stacks up to the ten
seventy ten seventy TI Vega 64 and the
ten eighty all sitting within a hundred
dollars of the price of this card and
you'll see that this is actually what we
were kind of expecting to see with the
twenty eighty and twenty a TI
so this is what we were kind of
expecting to see what the r-tx launch
cards had actually become available at
MSRP compete against their past
generational brethren smack them around
a little bit and do it at the same price
point that's what we were expecting to
see now a lot of people might look at
this and say well then why wouldn't you
just run out and buy a GTX 1080 or a GTX
1070 TI and call it a day
well that might make a whole lot of
sense but the problem is we're still
waiting for features that are not
available yet these cards are
technically trying to future-proof
themselves by waiting for features to
come online as developers implement them
so this is still an investment into the
future whether or not that's a sound
investment is still waiting to be seen
demos are not gonna tell us the big
picture that's why I include synthetic
benchmarks in my testing as well as
actual game titles because sometimes
you'll see a certain card may take the
lead in synthetics but as soon as you
actually put a more real-world test on
there or start looking at titles that
actually leverage a GPU in different
ways than synthetics which are very
consistent and very optimized then
you'll see that the picture definitely
changes same thing can be said over a
and B the Vegas 64 does really well in
synthetics but then in real-world
testing it definitely trades blows very
differently than it does in synthetic so
that's one of the reasons why we test
that now we're gonna be taking a look at
27 custom cards at well as well but I
found the MSRP card to be sort of the
unicorn which is usually never ever
found you rarely find cards ever at MSRP
I wanted to see what this one was all
about because it's the first one that's
gonna be available and it's as you can
see it handedly beats the 1080 and it
does it with less power less heat less
noise and less money but guys tell me
what you think of the 2070 this is the
card that I was really excited about
during the keynote all the way back in
August
here we are now October 16th we finally
have our hands on it and I think if you
can get the card close to the $500 price
point Dennis the r-tx launch we needed
beats the previous generation at the
same price point without the features
that are supposed to be included even
turned on yet so guys sound off in the
comments below and tell me what you
think about the 2070 and what cards do
you want us to take a look at obviously
this is GPU season right around the
holidays a lot of you're going to be
buying graphics card so I want to try
and bring in as much information as I
possibly can
hey guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you in the next one
whether it's here or in the studio I
don't know yet it is kind of nice though
to be able to when I'm done editing this
video just to go to bed not have to
drive 20 minutes across town but I get I
digress that's besides the point thanks
for watching Kaizen as always we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
