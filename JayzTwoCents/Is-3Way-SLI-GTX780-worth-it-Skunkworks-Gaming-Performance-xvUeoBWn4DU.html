a while back I upgraded to x99 the eight
core 16 thread Xtreme processor and yeah
I did a video about that and you guys
really seemed to like that build log now
before we go any farther in this video
I'm gonna go ahead and dress something
yes I did pop another eye vessel thing
that's why I was wearing my Gunners
because I've been staring at the screen
non-stop for the last two days and I
didn't want to look entirely like a
zombie for this video but a half a
bottle of Visine and these Gunners later
my eyes are still pretty effed up so no
guys I don't live in Washington or
Colorado therefore let's not go there
when it comes to the comments but where
we are going to go today's we're going
to take a trip down gaming Lane with
skunk work so we're going to see how
well that third 780 actually scaled so
back in like April or something like
that
I did a video about moving to SLI with
my seven 80s and that was still on my
z77 platform and I talked about what it
was like going you know 57 60 by 1080
you know three way or three monitors and
V surround SLI how it scaled it all of
that now while back when I moved to the
x99 platform while I was in there I went
ahead and tossed in my third 780 I
wanted to see how well 3-way was going
to work
keep it clean guys it's not not that
kind of 3-way it's the the tech 3-way
which is essentially just as sexy if you
ask me
now one of the reasons why this video is
so late is because I was having some
massive scaling problems with 3-way SLI
in fact if I was to disable one of the
GPUs I was getting the exact same
performance numbers with two-way if I
disabled the second GPU I was getting
the exact same numbers as I was with one
GPU so obviously there was a problem
there so for about the last month I have
been banging my head against the table
quite literally in fact that's why
sometimes you see marks on my face
because I did a video after banging my
head on the desk because I was so fed up
with the machine in fact I started to
hate this machine because it was turning
out to be nothing but one big pile of
problems if you guys want any proof of
that just head on over to twitter and
ask EVGA jacob how vocal I was about
things were not working properly yeah
things are not working properly it is
making me very angry sorry for that but
I was getting pretty damn fed up with
the system well anyway Jacob and I
actually live pretty close to each other
and he happened to stop by last night
and we did a lot of tests to the machine
and we found the most unlikely culprit
my CPU overclock was actually causing
the problem the more the CPU is
overclocked the worse the SLI
performance was in fact the worse all
GPU performance was but then we found
out it actually had a correlation to do
with the CPU overclock and the RAM
overclocked in which order you do it in
in fact it created some sort of bug in
the intel algorithm where something
weird was happening with the PCI Express
Lanes or the PCI Express bus or
something where the graphics cards were
never even getting a chance to do
anything it was almost like a synthetic
bottleneck if you will but anyway we
figured it out the system is running
full tilt right now and I got to tell
you now that I'm experiencing the 3-way
yeah annachi tois baby aqua Townsend
now let me just start by saying that
this system is stupidly fast I mean it
is just stupid I can't even I can't even
fathom the point of having a system this
powerful but I've got it so might as
well flaunt it
so anyway my three gtx 780 s are
water-cooled
they are not the TI is they're certainly
not the titans in fact they are
reference PCBs they're not even for the
win or classified or any of those cards
these are stock reference PCBs slap the
water block on them custom wrote a BIOS
myself slapped it on over volted it and
just said balls to the wall if the cards
blow up
well I'll cry but for the sake of
science sure I said I was going to push
these cards as far as I could
that's exactly what I've done now we've
got a couple of tests I ran here I ran
some synthetics like 3d mark 11 3d mark
fire strike fire strike extreme valley
heaven benchmark or valley heaven note
Unigine heaven that's right Ally
something else in fact valley doesn't
even really work well with three-way
it's one put that out there but then I
ran battlefield 4 metro 33 and tomb
raider and as far as titles I want to
know real quickly from you guys tell me
on Twitter please go over to Twitter
make an account if you didn't because
it's actually the easiest way to get a
hold of me and tell me what titles you
guys would like to see me include in
these future benchmarks because Crysis 3
I don't think it's very well optimized
watchdog we know it's not very well
optimized I've got Borderlands and those
games but they're not really that new so
they're not really pushing these systems
very hard so what do you guys want to
see when it comes to these benchmarks if
you're disappointed with the titles I
chose today I'm sorry I'm working on it
I will get more titles in fact if you
guys have any keys feel free to toss
them my way and I will include them in
these benchmarks now ok let's go ahead
and start with fire strike extreme now I
was getting just under 17,000 getting
like sixteen thousand nine hundred in
three ways before fixing the issue with
the CPU and whatnot so now that we're
fixed my score jumped and I'm not saying
I'm sterile by the way I'm not fixed
like neutered the system was neutered
but we've we've we went ahead and
slapped his e-peen back
gone and now you're getting these scores
so twenty three thousand two hundred
thirty nine and fire strike holy
that's more like where it should be
in fact when I tweeted out my scores you
guys are like uh luggage a but those
scores suck sounds going what do you
miss to go to suck I start looking into
it I'm going you're right my scores suck
and my feelings started to get hurt
that's okay because now I'm the one
hurting feelings and breaking hearts
alright so the fire strike extreme score
was a twelve thousand two hundred and
fifty one now I think that that could be
improved a little bit with some more
tweaking and some more card tuning no
it's a joke guys I don't I don't do that
seriously this is a pop blood vessel
this is not cannabis stop it
now when it comes to these scores I am
running my cards at a conservative
thirteen hundred megahertz in a lobby
you're like what do you mean
conservative that's huge the base clock
is nine sixty seven that's a 343 F make
a Hertz overclocked mathur's math is
gooder yeah remember guys I'm on
reference cards I'm not on for the winds
or classifieds or g'wan snipers or any
of that crap I'm on a reference card
which could blow up at any minute in
fact you guys could even get a ball of
fire behind me at some point in this
video a two of my cards are capable of
fourteen hundred megahertz and one of
them craps on its face at thirteen
hundred and twenty all the way up to 1.3
two volts
yeah I don't want to push it any farther
than that so I just went ahead and tone
back the two good cards to a little bit
below the crappy card and so here we are
we're just sitting at three cards at
1300 megahertz
now 3dmark 11 it's an old benchmark but
it's fun to revisit some of these old
benchmarks because I remember
benchmarking on it back with my GTX 580
when it was new and was like yeah I'm
getting seven thousand points whoo I was
all excited back then seven thousand
points was pretty damn good for 2011
well today on my 3-way GTX 780 s
overclocked in water cooled 32 thousand
six hundred and twenty-one come on down
that's the new score that that's
I'm sorry but that's just six that's
just sex - look I don't know why
computer stuff can can be arousing but I
got that was a little awkward all right
is going to talk about Unigine heaven
benchmark another synthetic benchmark I
like to use it because it gives me good
apples to apples comparisons on how some
of my clocks and stuff are working and
how I write my own BIOS I actually wrote
my own BIOS for these cards and so I've
been testing that out and synthetics
give me a good direct comparison of how
results are working I can't control
multiplayer situations and games like
Battlefield so synthetics do have a
purpose guys now my engine Haven heaven
whatever benchmark is 4037 max FPS 316
average FPS 160 point 3 all right so
when it comes to the gaming titles what
I went ahead and did here was I ran them
in 1080p with all sliders maxed as far
as everything could go things like
motion blur and anti-aliasing and
anticipate filtering all of that stuff
and it's entropic whatever i maxed as
much of that crap out as i could for my
1080p test and then my 57 60 by 1080
surround test I went ahead and pushed
everything as far as I could to the
right and disabled anti-aliasing the
reason why I do that is I am on three
gigabyte cards not the six gigabyte 780
s therefore I am running out of VRAM
pretty damn fast at that resolution now
when it comes to battlefield 4 I was
actually getting in 1080p 160 frames per
second average and that map was a 64
player full operation Locker conquest
tons of explosions you guys know what
I'm talking about if you play
battlefield Locker is just like an
explosive wet dream yeah that's a
hundred and sixty frames per second
average now but top-end was peaking at
200 because that's as far as the game
can handle and the low-end never dipped
below 90 frames per second he bit me
that's awesome I'm sorry 144 Hertz
monitors come in handy with those kinds
of frames
now speaking of 57 60 by 1080 as I meant
and anti-aliasing turned off and
aliasing post
fxaa was on by the way but that's free
performance it doesn't actually hit your
graphics card in any way was getting a
103 frames per second average on three
gigabyte cards that's actually pretty
good now I can play at that resolution
we were maxing out at about 184 frames
per second and the average was a pretty
playable at 103 I think you'd agree with
me even though my monitors were capable
of much more 103 is no slouch alright
it's time to move on over to the
ridiculous benchmarks here no Metro 33
the title is not perfectly optimized it
has its problems but I went ahead and
used it because I do know it is somewhat
demanding now in 1080p we were getting
an average frame rate of 121 frames per
second in the benchmark with a max frame
rate of 291 and a minimum frame rate of
13 and the 13 happened in the frame
number 3 so once again it was loading
the benchmark so it kind of stuttered
and that's where the low FPS comes from
121 average 291 max holy now when
we move over to 57 60 by 1080 it's a
little bit different story you can tell
Metro 33 is not very well optimized for
threeways graphics cards in fact the
average frame rate dropped all the way
down to 50 with the max frame rate still
sitting at 228 there was a lot of
stuttering and it just seemed like the
game didn't really know what to do with
the graphics cards considering their
usage was sitting at about 50 percent so
the game wasn't calling for the
performance therefore the cards were
like hmm what you want bro we're gonna
do something or what so yeah a three way
optimization on Metro 33 seems to be
well shite now last but not least
everyone's video game fantasy Laura
Croft with Tomb Raider minimum frames
per second 280
max frames per second 461 average frame
rate 381 frames Tomb Raider scales with
3-way and that's amazing considering
it's an AMD title
that anyway moving on to the 57 60 by
1080 test we had a minimum of 116 an
average of 134 and a max of 148 pretty
good scaling if you ask me now when it
comes to temperatures the system is two
separate loops and the 50 are the five
sixty millimeter rad in the bottom it's
a 45 millimeter thick rad by alpha cool
and it is housing all three graphics
cards by itself and they will top out at
about 55 degrees Celsius now the
temperatures went up dramatically with
the third card being introduced in the
loop I mean with two cards I used to sit
right around 44 degrees Celsius and I
was okay with that but in the summertime
like right now it's pretty warm in here
and maybe one day from October but it's
pretty damn hot still where I live and
so the temperatures do start to climb
now I was thinking about putting a third
radiator in here adding a 360 rad to the
front of the case just two more get more
dissipation of that heat there may or
may not be add some changes to come into
this system in the future here when it
comes to more efficient methods of
graphics if you know what I'm saying
you're just gonna have to wait to find
out what that means
as always guys I hope you've appreciated
and enjoyed this video if you have you
know what you can do you know what
buttons you can push to tell me you
liked it and you also know where you can
put this video if you hated it a feeling
it will fit right in there anyway guys
I'm gonna go ahead and get the heck on
out of here
feel free to flame me for the system if
you want it is by far nuts and crazy
stupid and I've never owned a system
like this and it's kind of hard to
believe I built it anyway guys time to
get out of here follow on that their
Twitter let me know what titles you guys
would like me to start including in
these future graphics card reviews and
as always I will see you in my next
crappy video
yeah it is over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
