bringing it a video about the camera
gear that I plan on taking to CES and I
think you guys ought to be interested
because fundraiser will pretty much pay
for it
so don't go anywhere please alright guys
well here she is and if you've been
following any of my social media for any
length of time
specifically Twitter or Facebook you
would know that my Canon t2i is on its
last Lake it needs a major service and
unfortunately the service is just about
the same value of the camera itself so
it made no sense to service it even
though it has served me so well you guys
are probably looking at this and going
that is a bit overkill for a YouTube
channel and you are absolutely right
this is not needed for YouTube channel
whatsoever but if you have a true
passion for cinematography like I do I
love making videos and not just YouTube
videos but what I've been doing for a
long time since I was a little kid is
making home movies like Star Wars action
movies and special effects and things
like that and if you guys remember back
in the very first day I started this
channel I made reference to a previous
visual effects stuff I used to do on
YouTube
I love cinematics I love short movies I
love special effects and so I wanted to
build a camera that not only appeals to
YouTube in terms of tech and bring you
guys tech reviews and stuff I also still
want to be able to make movies for me to
just enjoy having the fun of doing
filmmaking and I'm very very amateur at
it but it doesn't change the fact that I
love it in fact if I could go back and
change my career guys the only other
thing I could imagine myself doing with
a true passion and true love for it
would be a director of photography for
Hollywood I mean screw being in front of
the camera screw the actors the gear the
equipment to set up the just pulling the
focus and the dolly rails and all that
stuff it just that is what I love about
moviemaking and this sort of does that
for me in a DSLR trim all right so
enough about that the hunk of meat on
here is the Canon 70d I chose the Canon
70d because it's got the same processor
that the 5d Mark 3 has and that's a
$3,500 body and I'm you get this body
for $1000 I happen to get the kit which
included the 18 to 135 lens the basic
lens and there's nothing fantastic about
it for about $1,400 so yeah it's still a
lot of money but it's a great great step
up from the Canon t2i have that is
pretty much on its deathbed now I love
the 7d B it's got all the functions that
my t2 I had with magic lantern but stock
firmware so I need to investigate
whether or not magic lantern is even
going to be worth it on this camera
because it just gives me so much
functionality I absolutely love this
camera and everything about it so far
and I have nothing but great things to
say about it now I'm not going to do
review of the camera because I would not
do a very good camera review that
not what I'm geared towards so I'm gonna
talk more about my rig now everything
else you see on here is pretty much a
hodgepodge it's all put together through
eBay and Amazon and stuff like that
because I just cannot afford the
name-brand stuff have you ever heard the
name Redrock micro you would know that
that make PC gear look like chump change
so pretty much everything I've got on
here is like a knockoff of Red Rock
micro people most of it is pod kadhi pea
vodka is like a Chinese brand but they
make some pretty good stuff and the
tolerances are really good okay so PS
productions baseplate adjustable up and
down that's what I like to buy it most
base plates are just kind of static but
this one goes up and down so I can line
it up with the matte box without having
to move the matte box up and down which
is nice
speaking of matte box this is a pro
Wayne matte box it's about 200 bucks it
comes with all the adjustable rings on
there so that you can fit it around your
lens nicely blocks all the Sun out it's
got true ND filters in here 4x4 filters
that I can install in there so if I'm
shooting outside I can block off the Sun
and still maintain nice depth of field
and low f-stop settings without blowing
out the entire image it does have the
you know the barn doors and stuff that
mount on there that are adjustable up
and down you know and all that so I can
block the Sun for outdoor shooting
clearly I leave them off indoors because
they don't get a whole lot of pull out
of Sun in here if I did it would sure
help the lighting situation now the
rails that these are mounted on again
are vodka rails is your 18 inch rails
they're a little bit long for handheld
so I have some shorter rails for
handheld the actual C bracket right here
this is a podcast mm again with the
handle on the top and this is pretty
invaluable too when it comes to being
handheld at CES is is having a way to
actually hold the rig and as you can see
right here I just you know I just took
it off the tripod and you can you can
hold the entire thing together you know
hold it
right there and get nice low angle shots
or just maneuver the rig that way my
cameraman is going to love that he's
actually my brother-in-law so it's not
like I'm paying for a cameraman I pay
him with starbuck he he's gonna
appreciate that because last CES he had
no way to actually handle the rig and so
getting it up and on his shoulder and
off his shoulder and stuff was actually
a major pain in the ass on this side
here we've got the D focus it's actually
a local brand the company that makes D
focus is right down the street for me
superior follow focus to the one I had
last year very smooth it's adjustable
the tilt and the height of it and
everything so it fits on there perfectly
it's got this giant knob right here
that's adjustable so that I can get it
on and off quickly and then the sound is
being recorded right here through as you
can see my zoom h4n through XLR cable
which is running to the mic is just
off-camera my mic is a sennheiser e83
five fantastic mic it's only a hundred
bucks dynamic so it doesn't require any
sort of phantom power which means the
battery life on the zoom lasts a heck of
a lot longer than if I was running
something requiring phantom power so
with the rails came this silly little
lever here but this lever here is really
silly it just just mount on pretty much
with a giant rubber band but it's it's
really difficult to get into a just
focal length with all this gear on here
so this handle makes it very easy just
go up and down as you can see the lens
is moving in and out and you can kind of
see up there on the tablet
you know I'm zooming in and zooming out
speaking of the tablet is being held on
there with an 11 inch magic articulating
arm so I can just loosen this thing up
and then I can move this around you know
lock it down wherever I want
which makes magic arms magical yeah so
obviously that is a camera our brand
again amazon love Amazon
the nice thing about having the tablet
Mountain on here with just it's just a
cheap little plastic tripod mount thing
I got ebay for 10 bucks and then I got a
a Manfrotto mounting plate for it and it
threads on to the arm and it holds my
tablet up here it's already broken once
and I super glued it back together
that's just how cheap I am and then I've
got a USB cable running from the camera
to the tablet now the tablet software
I'm using is called DSLR controller it
allows you to control everything about
the camera from right here in the app in
fact if you look carefully up there you
can see as I'm talking the audio meters
move blah blah blah
bap bap bap bap see now I know if I'm
not if I have an audio miss happen I'm
not capturing audio it's moving right
there I mean that is cool it gives you
battery life on there tells me my ISO
settings my f-stop settings my frames
per second I can adjust everything my
Kelvin temperature rating my manual
focus auto focus histogram I mean
everything you could possibly need e I
mean there's my color histogram it's all
handled through that as an app that cost
$7.99 if you've got a DSLR and an
Android you need to go buy that app and
I don't get anything for that that's
just the coolest freakin app ever and
the cool thing about that app when I
turn the camera off you can see that the
app goes away see now we're back to the
android screen but when I turn on the
camera its hands-free it's going to
immediately go right to the DSLR app and
boom even if the tablet was turned off
and locked without a passkey of course
you can get right to the app so there's
that so that's pretty much all there is
to talk about with the camera rig I also
got a new tripod as you can see right
there and very nice sturdy legs actually
is rated up to 20 pounds this is an e
image tripod a true fluid head now the
other tripod I had was an FM 18 from
ebay or naive AM and
not a true fluid head which made pans
very difficult because it would have
hang up points where we kind of slow
down or skip and it made pans very very
difficult they weren't smooth you know
so it's got true a knob on here that you
can turn where it gives me true actual
resistance in the panning and the
tilting and stuff and as you can see
right here see how I pushed itself back
that's because I've got it set to
remember the position that I was in so
if I wanted to do a nice slow tilt I can
just let go of it it's going to go right
back to where it was and it's going to
stop I mean that is freaking cool and
then I can also adjust the resistance of
it
so that I can you know it pretty much
will stay anywhere I put it I mean it's
like set it there I'm sure most tripods
would just look and fall forward and
want to break the camera so that is no
longer an issue
I love this tripod all right so enough
about this why don't I go ahead and
convert this over to a shoulder mount so
that you can see how it's going to be
utilized at CES and then I'll show go
and show you guys my new slider I picked
up as well that's really going to help
with a lot of the b-roll footage here so
don't go anywhere okay so this is not
exactly how it's going to be in when
it's shoulder mounted there's a couple
of changes I still have to make one
thing I want to point out is the 18-inch
rods that I'm using right now are too
long to be able to get your face
anywhere near the back of the camera so
I'm just too lazy to switch them all
over to my 10-inch rods for handheld but
you guys will get the basic idea now if
I can get this around here without
hitting my mic wow that's perfect
you can see right here we've got long
18-inch rails here I've also got this
four pound counterweight that actually
gets mounted to the back of this thing
to counterweight the the weight of the
camera and the pivot point for that is
obviously the shoulder now I'm not gonna
mount this on here now because there's
really no point to it but yeah you guys
pretty much get the idea now when it
comes to shoulder mounting it go ahead
and get this thing off of here
and there you go you guys could pretty
much get the idea now as I move over
here
so the zoom isn't going to be staying
right here it's going to actually move
to the other side more towards the back
to give good counterweight but one of
the other things that's going to be
happening here is I'm actually going to
have a really nice high quality eye Cup
on here for a viewfinder that actually
has a diopter so that you can get it set
to your vision and your wear if you wear
glasses like my cameraman does the last
thing we want is him focusing for his
vision rather than you know a true
optics so this is pretty much how this
works
handheld but as you can see you've got
the handles on there you've got the nice
comfortable shoulder pad and this is
actually not very bad this is not
difficult to hold it's very very very
comfortable so there is the rig right
there in its handheld format I think you
guys kind of get the idea okay guys
here's my t2i and here is what it is
doing for me today now what it's setting
on right here this is actually a very
Vaughn 800 slide cam slider with a cheap
generic ball mount for my Canon t2i now
this is my Canon t2i and it's my
ultrasonic 28 to 130 millimeter lens
it's not great it needs a service it's
very grindy what I turn it but the cool
thing is now I can get those really cool
perspective changes when I'm doing my
work and as you can see it's just
sliding on my slider here now it's got a
little bit of movement when it's on this
this tripod this is that FM 89 shinned
earlier which is not a true fluid head
but you know what it gets the job done
for me nicely and I love this slider
it's a true ball bearing it rolls so
smooth I mean look at that if I just if
I just barely move that it slides by
itself and just to kind of give you guys
an example of what this is if I was to
turn this on right now I'm just going to
take just a little a little footage here
with the slider and set this up
get this all in focus here at the point
where I want it focused I'm going to
give you guys a little demonstration of
how the slider works so if you just kind
of push that in you get the idea it's
actually quite the art to get good at
sliding I mean sliding I'm learning
right now just to move this at a
constant smooth rate it's hard so I'm
thinking about actually attaching some
some pulleys on this because this is
designed to attach pulleys where I can
crank this and then it will you know
pull a cable and it'll it'll go and
that's a lot easier to maintain speed on
than sliding this with your hand but
because I have the ball mount on here as
you can see I can just move this around
however I need then I can do sideways
shots or you know push ins or pull outs
like I just demonstrated that's going to
make doing b-roll and stuff a lot of fun
but at the same time a lot of work
there's a lot of work actually goes into
getting that b-roll stuff so guys there
you go that is the stuff that I am using
now to bring you the content that you
see and prepare for CES for running and
gunning so it's called when you carry a
camera with you and stuff yep it's not
like when the model does this thing I'm
not going to do another Arnold voice for
a while but anyways there's my equipment
guys you don't need this kind of stuff
though to have a successful YouTube
channel there's plenty of successful
people who do it with nothing more than
a Logitech c920 webcam in fact there's
quite a few videos I did in the past
where that is that is uh what I was
recording on and some of you may be
wondering now what am I actually
recording this on if the other cameras
there and the t2 eyes here it's actually
uh actually my brother-in-law's t3i
which I've been using as a backup to Kin
to keep the channel going and thank you
for letting me borrow this thing for a
long extended period of time because
that's what's kept things going time to
get the heck on out of here guys it's
going to be the weekend by the time you
guys see this and as always follow on
Twitter ask me any questions you got
about this check the description for
discounts as well as links to all of the
stuff that I'm using here
and catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
