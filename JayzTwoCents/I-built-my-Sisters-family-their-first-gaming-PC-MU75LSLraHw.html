got a phone call yesterday from my mom
basically asking if she could buy a
computer from me and I was like why
would you need to buy a computer for me
especially since I bought her a nice
convertible laptop earlier this year she
basically said so that the grandkids
will stop taking my computer she shares
the house with my sister and
brother-in-law who is a retired Army
veteran and basically they share a house
and they keep taking her laptop because
they don't have a computer of their own
so that's we're gonna be doing here
today we're gonna be building and
basically surprising them with a
computer but I'm not gonna be filming
that part because they're very shy and
they don't want to be on camera they
never have so I'm not gonna put that
evil on them but today we're gonna build
a computer and yeah maybe saved my mom's
laptop
Corsairs new light loop RGB fans feature
16 independent RGB LEDs across two
separate light loops allowing users to
create unique and custom lighting
effects perfect for both air cooling as
well as radiators the corsair light loop
RGB fans are an excellent choice for
that ultra custom look learn more by
clicking the link below so where do you
like we normally do we're just gonna
kind of rationale some of the parts here
it's it's a fairly balanced system but
it's mostly stuff I'm just grabbing off
the shelf here to try and build one
that's fairly future proof for future
compatible but without you know being
too over-the-top because they are not
power users in fact they're not even PC
gamers until now that's why I'm building
them this PC so this right here although
it's just the chassis already torqued
down this is the Corsair 270 R it's a
very inexpensive
mid tower case that can fit all of our
parts and it's even water cooling
friendly although we will not be doing
any water cooling on this build I got
some UV lighting right here I played out
some of the lighting to see what we can
do in this case I've got four of
BitFenix 120 millimeter fans I just
thought the contrast of the white and
the black would look good especially
since he's a huge Star Wars fan
I thought maybe would go for sort of a
stormtrooper II kind of a thing
my brother-in-law that is actually the
whole family's huge Star Wars fans will
talk about CPU here so I grabbed my 1500
X it's AMD risin 5 because it's four
cores eight threads very decent
overclocker
it's gonna have a lot of future
compatibility but it's not a
ridiculously overpriced CPU for them but
I think it's gonna get the job done for
years to come we are going to be putting
in there motherboard wise hour tomahawk
be 350 motherboard mostly because it's a
fairly neutral color scheme
it's basically black and grey again I
think goes it's gonna go very well with
the whole sort of a Star Wars theme I'm
kind of going for without actually
putting anything Star Wars in there but
yeah I think it'll get the job done
we've used this quite a few in quite a
few tests so he's been a fairly solid
board I've heard some mixed reviews in
terms of overclocking reliability on
this but we're not gonna be doing any
crazy over clocks if any over clocks at
all I might do a little bit but instead
of using the stock Wraith cooler that
comes with it I'll be putting in my
cooler master master air ma 610 P
weird numbers I think that military I
don't know crazy numbers mostly because
it's RGB I could do red or something I
guess I'm trying to do sort of a Star
Wars II theme but I want to over cool
the CPU and I'm not going with an AI Oh
or water cooling because I want the
ultimate and reliability because like I
said they are not power users in fact I
don't remember the last desktop I've
ever seen
my sister's family with it's always been
laptops in fact I'm not sure they've
ever had a gaming desktop so this doesn
t kind of a first for them so I wanted
reliability that's why I want them have
to worry about pumps going bad or any
drips or leaks all I got to worry about
is taking some canned air blowing some
dust out and they're good so that's one
of the reasons why I'm also not to be
pushing the overclocks very far I don't
want any random blue screens or stuff
ruining their day now memory I'm using
that Pacific Sun memory we got when Nick
and I did the super low budget like $500
PC because it worked really well with
Rison it's an 8 gigabyte kit I think
eight gigs will do them just fine for
now mostly because of the ridiculous
pricing of RAM and quite honestly I need
to hang onto the RAM that I have and
they're not going to utilize 16 gigs so
this will get the job done this is also
easily swappable if we need to update
that for power supply here I grabbed my
EVGA 550 b3 in fact we never even use
this I bought this for a build we ended
up not really using it but one of the
main reasons for this it's bronze rated
550 watts more than enough what we need
but check this out it's a lower end
power supply that doesn't have ketchup
and mustard cables sure they're still
not the prettiest cables but they're
better than ketchup and mustard so
that's quite honestly the reason why we
went with that one I was hoping to have
a 650 but I didn't I only had a 550 and
I remember buying this now I think we
bought this the same day we got the
packs on memory but storage this is
actually my dad stuff right here
and this was kind of hard for me because
I had to format this stuff last time we
used it which basically was was taking
off all of the stuff that was on my
dad's PC when he made his videos and
stuff leading up to his last days so it
was hard for me to format these but we
got through it we're gonna be recycling
those and my sister's build I figured
what better way to basically have these
go full circle and then the
back in the house that my dad lived in
and still doing some duty now this is
the part that's always hard graphics
cards especially when the markets been
so flipped upside down especially in the
used market but I grabbed my EVGA gtx
1070 superclocked now you might be
asking yourself if they're not gamers
why did you give them a 1070 well
they're gonna be getting my dad's
monitor that he used which was one of
the lg ultra wide z' but it was the
1080p version and so we need to have a
little bit more graphics power to push
all those pixels especially there me
doing some gaming but my sister's family
was absolutely hooked on my HTC vive
when they came over a few times you know
and played it specifically for game
night and they were obsessed with VR so
I want to give them something that's
powerful enough to be able to run VR if
they decide to get a vie for and any
other hmd so I didn't want to undersized
their GPU we're just gonna go straight
with a 1070 which i think is a very good
sweet spot so with that said we're just
gonna build it there I believe is
actually some games already on this
kingston drive because we use this in a
couple of tests but we're gonna put it
together see how it looks and maybe
we'll do a couple of benchmark runs to
see how it performs
so there it is we're all done the only
thing I have left to install that I
haven't done yet is the wireless network
card this is a wireless AC where they
where this is going they don't have
wired Ethernet throughout the house so
Wireless is the necessary evil in this
one right here but there it is in all of
its glory it's not quite as Star Wars II
as I was hoping but I still think it
looks really good the lighting on the
cooler I just said it too white that way
it matches the rest of the aesthetics
I think the black light because I put
some black lights in here look really
good if you go that angle and look at
the fans
I don't know well it shows up on camera
but they had this really nice backlight
glow to them but the case has this
really nice just sort of a subtle not
in-your-face over-the-top amount of
lighting to it but it's mid tower case
they'll fit just about anywhere we went
to the parts it's no slouch this is
indeed a high-end gaming rig because I
want to introduce my sister's family to
the amazing world of PC gaming now just
to do a little bit of a test here for
some stability
we're gonna go ahead and run a 3d mark
test so just gonna do a regular fire
strike right here which is a 1080p test
remember this is going to be doing 1080p
gaming the GTX 1070 can definitely more
than handle it
and there's also no overclocking applied
I know this kind of goes against all of
my fiber that you guys have seen right
no water cooling and no overclocking but
this is all about stability so I'm gonna
let the test run
we'll take a look at the score
so here's our score we got a 14,000 and
88 as our total score graphic scored
18,000 206 really not bad for a stock
EVGA 1070 SC which is essentially just a
founders edition card so it's doing
pretty damn well obviously we push those
scores higher if we overclocked but I
don't want to do that so 14,000 88 not
bad at ball well guys I'm gonna go ahead
and finish doing the updates to this
actually updates look like they've
completed all the drivers and stuff are
installed I'm gonna deliver this now and
I'm going to rescue my mom's laptop from
the nephews so that's it guys just fail
out make a video about this it's going
to a good home and hopefully they'll get
bitten by the PC gaming bug you can see
I've already pre-installed steam right
when they're like where do we get our
games there it is there there steams
where we're gonna start
and maybe what steam so we'll roll
around or something and get them
completely bitten also I have no idea
how much this rig actually cost so what
I'll do is I'll put links to all the
parts that are used down below because I
don't know what the total cost of this
is if I had to guess I'd say it's
probably somewhere around 1300 or so
which is a mid to higher tier of the
high-end gaming pcs of course it can
scale up from there but I'm gonna go
guys thanks for watching and as always
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
