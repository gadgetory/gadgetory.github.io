today where our our system you guys saw
this we did the case review for the new
define s2 vision this is a clean windows
install and it is completely borked in
that like nothing is working like see
little thinking we own stuff you'll
never guess what's actually causing this
oh look and process microsoft windows is
not responding no the problem isn't
windows today's video is sponsored by
cable mod and their massive clearance
sale taking place right now at
performance pcs whether you're looking
for sleep cable sets for power supplies
a o sleeve kits cable extensions or LED
lights you can start spicing up your PC
at massive discounts to see what's on
sale now click the link to the sale page
in the description below see if we can't
get to go like I said this is I don't
want to give away what the problem is
yet I mean I'm sorry for the click baby
title I really am but this is important
I want you guys to watch this because in
my seven years of doing this YouTube
channel and well I would say thirty
years of building computers but I
haven't haven't been dealing with these
components for thirty years obviously as
you can see we can't get anything to
come up nothing's working and I'm
telling you right now what is causing
this is something that it's probably
make a lot of you happy watch what's
gonna happen right here it's gonna start
to load windows or try see how we're not
getting a little thinking wheel this is
where a lot of people would probably go
down the wrong rabbit hole and think you
with the problem is I I guarantee
someone at this point would bust out
their windows installer and be like oh
man I got a corrupt windows installed I
need to reinstall windows and they would
try and reinstall windows and it would
fail because in this particular instance
what's causing our system to completely
brick itself and shit itself at the same
time is RGB for the first time you have
a legitimate right to say fuck RGB
because in this case RGB is fucking us
that little hyper X Drive right there
with that Tony Stark level of arc
reactor brightness the ow
holy Shh that's harder I think we've
ever seen it all right where is the give
me give me give me okay the LEDs that
are in this Drive literally draw enough
power there are 75 LEDs in here more
LEDs than the rest of the system
combined that are causing our drive to
reach over 70 degrees Celsius this is a
SATA Drive we're getting hotter than m
dot 2 drives get and if you're not
familiar with NAND it has an operating
temperature and it's fairly sensitive as
it overheats and gets hotter it slows
down to the point to where the only way
I can keep itself from cooking itself to
death is literally throttle itself and
slow itself itself down look we're still
sitting here it is still trying to get
Windows to load because it's probably
getting a megabyte a second it is
cooking itself to death right now trying
to start Windows so I'm gonna turn on my
FLIR here if I go ahead and point this
at it has to adjust 64 64 on the
exterior yeah our drive is harder than
the vrn would you you pull you to the
light yes I know what that light is also
what's generating the heat that's making
its way into the drive when I'm gonna do
right now in real time and hopefully
it'll come back because I'm gonna take
this fan and I'm gonna point it this
massive ass fan we're gonna point it
right at the drive and see if the system
will wake back up without a reboot so we
first learned about this where we are
shooting the b-roll for this build we we
couldn't get into the operating system
I'm going what the heck man but that's
when we started looking over the
internet and we found this an attack or
a non tech article where they talked
about bright light dim performance or
something like that's the name of the
article and then so this it's definitely
worth reading I will try to remember to
put the article down below but if you if
you just search the internet for anon
Tech and Kingston HyperX fury drive LED
drive or RGB this is what you'll find
there's only one other drive in the
market that's even anywhere similar to
this and I believe that that is the team
group has like a RGB SSD so it's not
really a thing yet so this has been
sitting on the back of the chassis with
the glass on it and stuff we've
running tests before starting this video
it doesn't matter the glasses on the
glass is off it's the same just turning
on the LEDs heat up the drive in fact I
did a test with the LEDs off with
running crystal mark and nine sequential
hour nine runs of sequential and random
read/write back-to-back-to-back so for
like 27 27 read/write tests back to back
the temperatures are flat they don't
move in fact we have an image right here
we could show you of that but we also
did was simply let the system sit at
idle and no it's not coming back it's
completely failed but if I go ahead and
restart this because we've cooled the
drive down we will get into Windows
where we can start showing you in real
time kind of what's happening here what
I want you to look at this little this
little time lapse as I'm kind of talking
here if you watch this this sort of a
time-lapse here over about like an 8
minute duration all we did was let it
sit at the desktop and turn on the LEDs
and we filmed it both with the camera
pointing at the chart which is an msi
afterburner using hardware monitor for
our grabbing the smart info off the
drive and then we use the thermal camera
to kind of see what was happening to the
casing of the drive with that chart so
we can see interior and exterior
temperatures and right around the time
we get to about 60 high 50s low 60s we
start seeing a grenaded performance once
we hit like 63 65 you get what we have
here which is a completely dead system
simply because of the LEDs and again
it's important to note that was idle the
system was doing nothing that drive is
hotter than our studio lights we have
the thermal image to prove it so we have
to do right now to get it back is let
that fan cool that hard drive down to
normal temperatures restart it it'll
probably going to startup repair then
we'll get to the desktop and we'll show
you how bad it really is so once we get
into the operating system if it tries to
do the updates right now we're screwed
I meant to go in and plug the actual RGB
tape
oh no no updates well with the fan
pointing at it we might be okay that's
one the other things we're gonna test is
like I can re I know someone has already
typed this and if it's you watch the
damn video before you comment yes we're
gonna test what happens with airflow
over the drive a realistic amount of
airflow no we're not gonna relocate it
to inside the chassis because I have
enough slack on those cables with the
way it's wired up what we're gonna do is
we're gonna lay it flat like it would be
on the the floor of the motherboard or
they the case like divider wall and then
we're gonna have a regular case fan just
sort of gently blow air over it and see
if that's enough to keep it in there go
the updates to see if that's enough to
keep it in check in terms of
temperatures the drive normally draws
like one watt like SSDs don't pull any
power which is kind of ironic that
they've got you know say two power
cables everything going to it but what
the what the LEDs on in white so we set
it to white for RGV for all three of the
RGB LEDs to be lit which I know you're
thinking about through a DVD it's a
white LED yes I remember that outtake
filming the thing is if we were in a
single LED before we test it with blue
it took a lot longer to get to this
point but with white it was ridiculously
fast how fast it overheated and I
thought okay well fine I'll just unplug
the RGB harness from it that'll get us
by when you unplug the RGB harness it
just defaults to red and it's still
overheating
I'm also legitimately curious as to why
they felt 75 LEDs was necessary your
Drive is obviously got all of your data
on it and if it's like doing crazy stuff
because the temperatures it could
corrupt your data there's no doubt about
it
diagnosing your PC turn our didi off the
drive is sitting at 47 with that and
blowing at it so if I turn it off watch
what happens so it's not only at 47 we
just turned off the fan at 48 the whole
system is already like yeah look at that
it's our to see how it's already getting
crazy
this was our test when we had that that
time-lapse going this is that chart and
then this is when we turned off the LED
so what I need to do right now cuz like
it's already at 52 and we're gonna start
slowing down here so I got it I gotta
open up dragon center
oh god no oh no no it's a white square
oh no Microsoft Windows is there Oh what
happened
I need to turn the fan back on yeah we
say we turned on the draw at the fan
though you see it's all coming back it's
completely temperature-dependent
now if we go here to mystic light
whenever return the LEDs off watch how
quickly the system comes back to us so
it's at 53 there so all we turned off
was the lighting so close that Oh
everything's like catching up now from
all the clicks I did earlier look we got
that running you got edges running this
is running file explorer everything's
running the drive is extremely
temperature dependent so we're going to
do now is we're just gonna go ahead and
mimic as if this drive we're sitting
like in that check that center part of
the chassis there and then we're gonna
just point a case fan at it in fact
we're gonna point even the same case fan
and we are gonna see what happens with
an actual fan so this is running because
it's hooked up to the same controller
the exact same speed as the front fans
so we've sort of made kind of our own
chassis back here with the drive in it
to see how that does so we're sitting
here at 30 it's still slightly cooling
off so all I'm gonna do now is turn the
LEDs back on let the temp go to where
it's gonna go we'll see where it maxes
with a theoretical airflow if we were to
put it in the center divider wall of
this chassis in the direct airflow
alright so as you see the system's
already unresponsive this this player
goes this accounts for what if we go and
look over here you can see we indeed
have airflow in my little theoretical
chassis right here the drive is still
overheating to the point to where the
system is already sluggish 57 degrees
while sitting here in the desktop doing
nothing with airflow over it is
certainly not acceptable maybe I will
maybe I will I don't think this is gonna
work
we had to make a plate to sort of touch
this to like make a heat spreader I have
no intentions of turning into a idiots
crazy cooling video all of our stupid
idea videos that we do totally prepared
us for this man so I just put two fans
in here I'm like this I don't think this
is gonna work it's a heat pad from the
drive to this like metal plate I'm using
the trying work as a heat spreader to
thermal paste on the pump and that's
actually secured really tight the irony
is you can't see the RGB anymore
on the drive but we have RGB fans so the
drive was that is that 24 right now
that's already like six to seven lower
than it was idling all right lights are
on okay now we wait
yeah we wait this was the original curve
how it just kind of kept going this is
our curve now it's starting to flatten
off but the problem is it's starting to
flat plateau with that water cooler
where it's still hot enough to be
causing slowdown like he just saw Russ
trying to open that file so that I was
hoping it was gonna work but we knew it
wasn't going to because it's like the SS
Dean and themselves plus the thermal pad
to a metal plate to the chassis to
another thermal pad to a metal plate the
thermal paste to pump oh the water to
rad to air I mean he just hit 58 all
right so here's the bottom line under no
circumstances should you buy this SSD
the Fury RGB LED is furiously hot
unnecessarily even if you put it in
direct air flow as we showed earlier so
I just felt like I need to make this
video as a public service announcement
to save your money by any other SSD
probably not even the team group RGB one
although it may not have the same
problem because them cramming 75 LEDs in
this tiny little two and a half inch
drive space is stupid so this is the
first product I've come along that
literally warranted me making a video to
say this is so bad you should stay away
from it like it were the PC plague
because as you can see it definitely
gives the PC the black
to cool this no I'm not Ellen to cooling
this drive
I've already given you guys my final
thoughts there's nothing else to say
this this drive is in the end game now
it's very bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
