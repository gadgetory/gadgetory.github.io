thread coffee-like cpu launched and with
it a very curious question from Twitter
asking why all of our benchmarks were so
vastly different linus and i had nearly
identical benchmarks where Paul and Kyle
had lower benchmarks and someone was
wanting to know what the heck is going
on well it was actually noted that
anyone running ASUS motherboards were
seeing a significantly higher score why
is that well it's because ASUS
motherboards launched with something
called MCE or multi-core enhancement
enabled by default which is actually
causing some low level or high level
depending on the way you look at it
overclocking to take place the question
is whether or not the consumer is aware
of that and whether or not it's
something that consumers should be
concerned about having something like
this enabled when they're not actually
aware of it
coolermaster is going back to their
roots with the new cosmos II 700p
featuring a dual curved tempered glass
side panel all-metal construction built
in RGB case illumination USB 3.1 type
seen on the front panel and an open
internal layout that is fully modular
and reversible learn more about cooler
masters cosmos see 700p by heading to
cooler master calm now to be fair this
is not new multi-core enhancement has
been around for a long time in fact you
can find threads going all the way back
to 2011 2010 and sometimes even older
about multi-core enhancement and what it
does on the motherboard a lot of people
seem to be very confused it makes no
sense to buy case qcp you would not
overclock it
so what asus is kind of done by default
is enable MCE and when it recognizes
that it's got an overclocking friendly
CPU in there it will go ahead and allow
it to run all cores at max turbo clock
when applicable when things like
temperatures and whatnot are actually
taken into account so what we've got
right here is my 8700 k bench that we
put together last week the only thing
that's different as I threw a Titan XP
on there because yellow but anyway I
know is really annoying I know what
we've got right here is the exact same
test bench 16 gigs of Dominator Platinum
3000 megahertz which as we've talked
about before you know if you are not
actually overclocking your memory or
even enabling the XMP profile you can
see we're only
at ten sixty nine Mecca remember it's
that times two so we're only running at
twenty one thirty three on the memory
but if I take a look at our CPU you can
see right now at idle we're sitting at
point six eight eight point eight point
six eight volts going back and forth
extremely power efficient its sipping
the power but MCE as I mentioned is
enabled by default on caseview CPU so
what exactly is it doing well if we go
ahead and bring this to the bench arc-15
if you guys can download this yourself
you can follow along at home it's an
absolutely free it's a nice little
utility just to play around and see what
kind of scores you get when you play
around over clocks you can see our
voltage jumps up to one point two four
eight technically one point two five
which is higher than the standard
voltage that you would see on a non MCE
motherboard also - you can see all of
our cores went to four point seven
gigahertz which is something that
typically only the main core whichever
core is being loaded the most would go
up to four point seven so that on a very
basic level is what MMC or multi-core
enhancement is doing it as allowing the
overclock or the turbo clock to apply to
all cores and it's allowing the voltage
and a load line calibration and all that
stuff to sort of self adjust to go with
what it thinks would be stable for an
all core overclock because technically
turbo boost is an overclock so with our
optimized defaults and all out of box
settings we got a 1557 now that's the
score that prompted a lot of some people
on Twitter to be like hey what the
heck's going on why is your score higher
well again MCE like we talked about now
if you recall I am running a
water-cooler on here this is the Celsius
s 36 the 360 read with three fans
because the moment I started to push the
over clocks on this core or this chip
whatsoever even a little bit it started
to get hot so that's why I was concerned
about MCE and whether or not the
audience or the consumer should know
about this because most people don't
know that this is actually happening and
if it's bumping up things like voltages
and you're not running adequate cooling
it could cause some problems over time
you are actually putting more of a load
on your power delivery than you are on
the chip and if your motherboard isn't
up to snuff then that's something that
could cause long
reliability issues and that's where
companies like Asus really have to draw
the line on which motherboards should
have MCE enabled or even such a feature
if the components aren't up to such a
task so if you take a look at our
voltages here it looks like 1.3 to 8
volts was the max peak who we saw
temperatures we went all the way up to
71 high 7 or low 70s high 60s on water
with defaults so keep that in mind and
that's one of the reasons why I ended up
putting the water cooler on here where I
still have the air cooler on the rise in
system particularly yeah this is Verizon
right yeah 1700 X because this wasn't
seeing those types of temperature spikes
because until once again with their
shitty thermal paste in between the the
the heat spreader saving a buck by not
soldering that goes all the way back to
what has well we've been complaining
about this and until it doesn't care
about our opinions but I digress
these temperatures right here remember
are on water so what happens if we
disable MCE what's gonna change let's
find out so here's a UEFI BIOS here and
the asus motherboard if you're running a
modern asus board this should look the
same pretty much across all of their
motherboards it just may not say rog but
look right here XMP is disabled that's
fine for now we're going to do is hit f7
go to our Advanced Settings because if
you if you notice when we're in the
basic settings here the easy mode you
don't actually see any of that MCE or
multi-core enhancement stuff I mean
here's your rapid storage technology for
running often you can turn that on there
easy system tuning this is where you can
one-click overclock right you can set it
to different settings and then hit apply
but we don't want any of this we just
want to leave it as is but look at that
no there's no mention right here
whatsoever of multi-core enhancement if
you go into advanced mode f7 and you go
over here to AI Tweaker core ratio limit
set to auto correlation all cores that's
normal
asus multi-core enhancement is set to
auto now what if we go ahead and set
that to disabled right oh yeah we
disable it now we get some of our
settings that come back but we're gonna
do it right now is all we're doing is
disabling it we're gonna go back into
windows very first thing we're gonna
notice right here is check this out look
at the core clock see how the four point
seven numbers bouncing around they're
not just locked at
4.7 the other went all the way down to
4.3 yeah the mac score and all of them
at some point will say 4.7 because
they're bouncing around but check that
out we are not seeing the same level of
just pegged at 4.7 because that's what
MCE does it applies the max turbo speed
it's nice should overclocking beyond the
turbo but it's applying the turbo to all
the course let's take a look at the
voltage right here though
if we go up here we can see the voltage
came up to where to go
1.37 - okay but we're sitting right
around 1.6 it'll peg up to right you can
see it's moving around a little bit more
diam find it dynamic can't talk
dynamically but it's still sitting much
lower and remember we are still running
we are still running the balanced or the
recommended mode right there so if we
just go ahead and run this now let's see
what happens to try previous scores we
went from what a 1577 I think it was
forgot to save the score I can obviously
impost take a look at it but check it
out now we are seeing our voltage come
down a little bit
1.21 six remember before it was running
almost 1.3 if we look at our core clock
check that out it actually drooped down
to 4.3 under load not 4.7 which is what
we saw last time so now if we look at
our score this is probably gonna be
closer to what Kyle and Paul were
experiencing fourteen hundred and five
that's still higher though that's still
higher than what cutting Kyle was down
in the 1200 range which I still cannot
answer that but they were definitely not
running aces motherboards I think one
think they were running Oris or
something like that but you can see we
definitely saw a reduction in
performance now what if we go ahead and
enable performance mode what's gonna
happen okay performance mode is now
enabled you can see everything still
looks roughly the same right the four
point seven core is jumping around we're
seeing some 4.6 s and four point five
if we run the score again put this under
load it comes back down to 4.3 it
doesn't sit at 4.7 voltages are still
the same 1.2 1 6 and have a feeling
we're gonna see a roughly identical
score so looks like you about 10 14 15
we're with the 1405 so we came up to 14
15 voltages seem to love a lot about 1.2
volts and the memory of course is still
running 21 33 so although this is still
not as low as like we saw with Kyle
system I don't know why his was down
into the twelves but we are obviously
seeing something happened with
multi-core enhancement we're seeing some
higher voltages all the way up to 1.3 6
so in a very high level that's what MC
is doing it's applying a little bit more
voltage so that you can get your turbo
clock across all of your cores in fact I
think it even works with non K CPUs as
well if there's a turbo clock involved
don't quote me on that I'm pretty sure
that's the case but something else just
to be fair though asus is not the only
motherboard manufacturer that does this
but it's my understanding that as of
today i believe that the only
motherboard manufacturer that's applying
it by default because auto is
technically on auto basically says if
you see the cpu that it can go in there
and play with its gonna do it it's gonna
raise the voltage just to do it now what
I would like to see actually is that off
by default but XMP on by default because
you know many people out there don't
understand that the speed written on
their memory is not the speed it's gonna
run out I say this all the time because
every time I say it someone comes back
and says well I didn't know that thanks
for sharing I'm on a mission to help
everyone understand your RAM is gonna
run at the base clock unless you enable
XMP which is actually a ram overclock
I'd rather deal with that than dealing
with VRMs getting hotter more voltage
being applied to my CPU and higher
cooling needs when the average consumer
isn't gonna be aware of that because
check this out if we go in here right
now this is that this is the easy mode
which we've already showed and we enable
profile 1 check this out would you like
to apply the Alcorn Han sment remember
MCE with the XMP settings for improved
performance select no for Intel stock
operation sufficient processor cooling
is required under all core enhancement
they just warned me about that when
enabled XMP but they never warned me
about that when I booted the system the
first time or assembled it if you as a
consumer are not aware that this is
gonna apply more voltage and it's gonna
require better cooling it I feel like
this this warning that you're seeing on
the screen right here should be applied
whenever MCE is enabled especially on a
first boot on a system that's applying
it by default that's my rant now with
all that said it doesn't all fall on the
motherboard manufactures oh this is
what's important for reviewers like
myself to start testing for this in both
case scenarios if it's gonna shift by
default it's worth talking about it's
not like I said but well whatever
the same thing right if it ships by
default then it's an out-of-box
experience that the consumer is going to
experience with drinks at a valid test
but also it's important for us to test
both methods so for all reviewers
testing ASUS motherboards it's important
to make or any motherboard again it's
important to make sure that those types
of features are turned off it's one
reason why AMD during the rise at launch
had recommended that anyone using ASUS
motherboards on Intel platforms to
compare disable MCE simply because it is
not the typical out of box experience
that you get in an Intel processor so it
makes perfect sense that that was a
request of theirs and going forward I
think if we're gonna use Asus boards we
have to test both which is fine honestly
I mean it's it's it's nice to have one
button click for extra performance the
important thing here is that the
consumer isn't being notified about it
that's where my rant really lies with
all of this I mean I know I sound like a
broken record here but it's important
transparency is important in fact I just
looked at the box again and it doesn't
mention MCE anywhere on the box it
doesn't mention as a feature of mentions
five-way optimization which is not new
either that's something that's been out
for a while but five-way optimization is
something that you typically will let it
go through and do its testing and it's
like a whole procedure not a
overclocking function that's on by
default so what do you guys think sound
off in the comments below do you think
that companies like issue issues Asus I
can't talk today what the heck do you
think companies like Asus should be
shipping this sort of function by on by
default or do you think it should be a
prompt similar to like what you saw when
I enabled XMP allowing the user to say
hey
this is an option but also here are some
risks involved or or what sound off in
the comments let me know what you guys
think should be happening and as always
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
