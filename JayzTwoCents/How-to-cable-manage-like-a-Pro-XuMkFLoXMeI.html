time for me to build our news server the
team is growing we've got more people
now accessing the footage so we actually
need to have a way to have a central
place for all of this footage to be
grabbed with all these hard drives any
guesses as to who supplied these yes I'm
actually working with Linus tech tips
and Seagate on this projects we've got a
whole plethora of iron wolf Pro drives
ten terabyte drives but we got to build
a server here so anyway that's actually
not the point today's video though I
wanted to kind of tease what's coming up
today I'm actually gonna show you how to
do cable management probably one of the
most recommended videos I've ever been
asked to do and usually I'm like you
just zip tie the thing to the thing and
put it out of the way and you're done
but it continues to be requested and I
thought what better video to do that on
then a video that has a ton of hard
drives and a lot of power cables and
things to try and make that look pretty
so we think that look good you can make
anything look good
today's video is brought to you by Nord
VPN and right now they're giving my
viewers 77 percent off a three year
membership using my link in the
description below guys its 2018 we are
more connected than we have ever been we
have smart phones in our pockets our
laptops and we are on the move so it's
time to start taking your internet
security serious now VPN stands for
virtual private network and it does
exactly what it sounds like it should it
keeps you private when you're connected
to the Internet you never know who's
looking at your information so stop them
by encrypting your data the nor VPN uses
a military-grade encryption and they
have more than a thousand servers in 61
countries across the world and that
number is growing every single week
including regions like China and the
Middle East with the constant changing
landscape and laws and litigation
regarding net neutrality is more
important than ever to take your online
security serious so save 77% off your
three-year membership at Nord VPN by
using my link in the description below
that's Nord VPN comm / J's two cents
let's see what the parts are going this
build real quick this will start with
the main platform this is the X $2.99
workstation from Asus so you might
notice I have an X 99 for a box up here
because that's what they sent it in this
was actually an early access board I
don't know if it's fully out yet I'm a
little disappointed I'm gonna say that
up front simply because they
dramatically stripped the number
SATA ports that are on this the old one
had like 14 this one has six so I'm
really disappointed which means the
build is not going to be fully
functional today because I have to add a
SATA controller or RAID controller on
there so there's going to be some are
gonna be on the rate controller some are
going to be on board which kind of
stinks I would like to have all been
handled on board but I digress that's
not that important we'll get that
working out so we're running a seventy
nine hundred X ten core twenty thread
CPU
we're gonna be running I want to run 64
gigs of DDR four I've got 32 here for
now we'll probably be adding more to
this because this is going to be an
interesting build it's not just the nez
it's gonna be also doubling as a
workstation so it's gonna be a physical
box and a virtual machine and a server
all-in-one so that's where this is
obviously a little bit different than
the typical like 45 drives projects that
Linus was working with and with Seagate
mines gonna obviously be tailored to the
needs that we have here now I've got a
Titan XP actually it's a Titan X little
P no not a little Pete whatever it's
always it's confusing it's always
confusing this is not the newest one it
has a DVI port but we're not actually
using this for gaming this is going to
be our pass-through this is gonna be
used to actually communicate between VM
and physical box not for gaming so we're
using this simply because of the amount
of CUDA cores and the throughput speed
that this has so don't confuse this as a
gaming rig and we also have two one
terabyte SSD now drives these are going
to be our cache drives for all of these
spinning mechanical drives so that's
what these are going to be for you guys
might notice here we also have a master
wood master wat maker
1200 big giant heavy power supply
because of all of these drives and stuff
we're gonna be adding as much power as
possible just for safety we're gonna be
cooling it with the Celsius s 36 now is
torn on this because this is also
doubling as a server not just a
workstation we want reliability so
that's why we're not doing a custom
water-cooled rigid tube or any of that
stuff because if something fails in this
system we need to be able to fix it fast
and if we're going with a custom loop
fast is not really part of that
algorithm so we're gonna be using a
Celsius s 36 now the reason why I'm
going with an a IO because I was still
kind of torn on doing that versus air is
because this system is also going to be
render
videos and it's doubling as our ingest
station which means it's the it's the
station we're going to be bringing all
of our footage to our server I want to
keep the CPU as cool as possible because
it's going to be doing it's going to
have allocated course for the VM it's
gonna be allocated cores for the
rendering station we want to keep it
cool that way we can run faster clocks
and get better performance out of
premiere but the reason why I chose the
Celsius s 36 specifically is again one
cable to make all the fans work so I
don't want to have a lot of cables going
everywhere and an a IO is easy enough to
replace if it goes bad and then we are
going to be putting this in the
brand-new gunmetal fractal design r6
because of all of that harddrive support
and I can still fit a front-mounted
radiator if I want to front mount this
or we can put it on top but I don't have
to sacrifice drive storage or water
cooling I can have both and because I
can fit all of those hard drives in
there that is why we chose that now I've
got 15 of these terabyte are these 10
terabyte drives that's a hundred and 50
terabytes I don't know if they're all
gonna be going in this build right now
but we're gonna be putting in as many as
we can so we've got a few extra drive
cages that we stole out of a couple of
the other r6 as we have laying around
here just to get as many as we can in
there so without further ado let's build
it and then that's cable manager
so obviously we just built all of this
to get the perfect well this is like a
perfect storm look at these are all the
cables I've got to get to fit inside
this box neatly so what I like to do
first of all when I'm doing my cable
management is I connect everything to
the power supply first a lot of people
like to connect to the component and
then to the power supply but I find it
easier to deal with if I've got the
power supply pre-mounted and all the
cables hanging out now I haven't
installed anything yet cable wise except
for the front panel connectors and the
USB 3.0 I've got my fan headers over
here so we're gonna we're gonna see how
well I can actually do with this this
I've got my work cut out for me because
I chose also the master watt maker
cooler master maker maker whatever they
called themselves now the look at this
24-pin connector this thing is massive I
mean that's this is this is we got an
obd ii scanner for a car anyway so what
you notice here is i have all eight
drives put in right here now one of the
reasons why I have arranged like this as
you can see I still have room down here
for excess cables now you might look at
this and think well that's blocking off
all the airflow it's actually not
there's quite a bit of gap in between
each one of these hard drives so this is
set up pretty well we've got a little
bit of airflow up top we've got airflow
on the bottom so I think this is a
really good example of making sure you
have enough space to hide cables because
really cable management as nothing more
than hiding them and then trying to
route cables together now something else
you're gonna need obviously a zip ties
or lots of twist ties something to hold
the cables together and what you're
going to notice I do when I'm doing this
is you're gonna find me zip tying things
together and then clipping it and
redoing it and clipping it and redoing
it and probably wasting zip ties but
it's because I like to kind of hold
things in place while I'm planning and
then when I'm done at the end then I zip
tie everything together now I'm gonna
set these aside for now these are gonna
be less and the reason why I do this
last is because if you've ever dealt
with SATA power or SATA cables these
little plastic tabs are easy to break
off so as we're moving cables around and
stuff I don't want to accidentally break
anything on our nice expensive hard
drives so we're gonna do now is we're
gonna kind of separate our power based
on logic we're gonna take out
24-pin we're gonna take our PCI Express
cable the PSU power for this
motherboards are this PSU zl--
interesting where normally they would
split into two four pins at the end
Coolermaster just chose to split it
apparently all the way down the sleeve
so I'm gonna set those aside because now
I can visually see okay this I know
these are four main components these are
all my SATA plugs for my hard drives my
fan controller from fractal and then our
two SSDs right here because I've got
length on this never got pigtail on this
I want this to be a part of this cable
harness that's gonna go this way so now
I know okay I need one harness it has
three going over here and two harnesses
over here because I've got as you can
see four SATA connectors per cable or
four harness I've got two of those going
this way and one of them going this way
so you can kind of see I'm sort of
visualizing now how the separation of
the wiring is going to go now
fortunately the r6 has a lot of
well-thought-out cable management tie
down spots we got velcro straps here
we've got loops all over the place to
allow us to zip tie to so I'm gonna go
ahead and do now the main components and
get those out of the way so that I only
have to deal with all of our all of our
accessories so the r6 also has it's very
own fan controller on here allowing me
to have again one connection point to
deal with pretty much all my fans you
notice what I did right here though is
it kind of took the length and then I
sort of just folded it over till I had
sort of a clump of wires here if you
will and trying to make it all sort of
the same length so we'll kind of do that
again so you can see see they're not
exactly the same length but if I take
them and just sort of fold it like this
now we've made a single harness here
it's much easier for us to just zip tie
and get it out of the way something else
that really helps too is to have a set
of side cutters so that you can just
sort of snip it and move it out of the
way I'm sort of just getting things
where I want them to be
then I will clean it up I don't try and
do it all in one pass so it's going to
take this behemoth have a 24-pin I'm
gonna go ahead and use this guy right
here
and I'm gonna just sort of push this
through like that now I can plug it in
yet I'm just gonna sort of get it out of
the way same thing with my PCI Express
I'll have both of these cables coming
through the same grommet so that again I
can route these together to get him out
of the way now I don't think I have
anything else that's gonna actually go
up through this harness right here with
the velcro so I'm not gonna tighten it
down yet tight I'm just gonna sort of
route this like that again dealing with
visuals here visualize it see already I
velcroed this one I shouldn't have
because I'm gonna do eight pin DPS power
up through here as well usually I'll
come up like this for eight pin power
but I think in this case because I don't
have a lot of length I'm just gonna have
this follow up through the main channel
as well and then I'm just gonna push
that through for now so if I flip this
around you can see oh my god this is
heavier than I expected it to be with
all those drives you can see nothing's
plugged in yet we set of cables is sort
of flopping around here but that's
because we can't start to strap anything
down in the back until we have all of
the slack out of the front so that's why
I kind of do things in this in this
manner I just sort of slowly give things
a way to go and get them out of the way
so we are almost to the point where we
can start nailing this down this guy I
think I'm just going to leave running
right along the bottom right here
because this is what's gonna get power
to my two SATA drives here and my fan
controller and then these are the two
that are gonna go here now instead of
routing this around the outside of this
support bracket right here I'm gonna put
this on the inside because I've got more
room there so why the heck not but I
think this is the part that a lot of
people make mistakes on they just start
tying everything down as they're
plugging in and then they realize oh
crap I need to redo it
now as tempted as I am to start plugging
these in I'm not gonna do this yet again
I want anything to do with SATA power or
SATA cables to be the last because I
don't want to break those plastic tabs
so now we're gonna start plugging things
in on the front side so this has to kind
of fold this way because of where the
little retaining clip is so I'm gonna
push that back through and I'm gonna go
ahead and give me my bend now
plug this in here and there's that and
as you can see because it's flat cables
I just routed it all flat like that and
now the slack is sticking through on the
backside all right so I'm just gonna
relocate it to this bottom grommet here
so it looks a little less crowded up
here although the appearance of this
truly doesn't matter this is a purely
function over form build it would bother
me so the only thing left to do on the
front now is going to be our eight pin
power which is up here at the top and
this one is usually pretty tight so I
like to lay the computer flat I mean
just a whole lot easier to install these
when the case is flat because you're
looking down so much more natural so
again just push the slack out the
backside and now we'll work on the
actual cable management so remember how
I said that these cables were kind of
twisted in there so what I did was I
unplugged these from the power supply
side so that I can sort of lay these all
flat like they need to be and now I'm
gonna start sort of zip tying these
together as sort of a harness they're
flat cables they're designed for them to
be able to get really flat obviously
behind motherboard panels and case
panels so it's gonna allow you to have
more room plus you can see just how much
neater this is but what I also do is
I'll get a few started but I won't crank
them down as tight as I can I wanna be
able to slide them along the harness if
I need to adjust where they're actually
you know grabbing on to our cables
tighten those down cut off our excess
and you can see we get a much neater
appearance here so and look at that what
you just look at it little zip tie pro
tip that I like to do is just once these
are done and clipped is just sort of
rotate that behind that way just has a
nice cleaner look but now that we're
done with this cable I can go and plug
this back into the power supply side of
things and get this out of the way ok so
the next area focus that I'm going to
focus on here and I'm saying the word
focus a lot let's focus on all but
focusing on focusing on we are going to
do the same thing with the eight pin EPS
there's a loop
right here on top of this case and this
is what we are going to use to strap it
down up top
now that loop is probably gonna be kind
of hard to push a zip tie through this
what you can do is you can take the end
of the zip tie and sort of bend it like
a hook so you take this like a hook and
just sort of hook it through the eyelet
there and money it's not that's ready to
go we can just sort of collect our wires
up here at the end of our zip tie and
then these guys will be ready to go but
once again don't tighten it down just
get it started because we might end up
needing to move this guy because we want
to control the amount of slack we have
down here too and we can do that up here
by actually allowing this to sort of
Bend like that if that makes sense
so make sure we're not too much slack on
that side so I'm pretty comfortable with
how that is go ahead and just tighten
that down enough to where it won't move
so with the flat cables you want to try
and get them to be as flat as possible
make sure they're all sort of going the
same direction and then you can zip tie
them down on the radius in the middle of
the cable and then for me again down
here on this radius we're gonna clip
these little tails off
try not to clipping who hires I have
done that I have clipped wires while
clipping zip ties rotate these so
they're not showing and we're gonna
route this guy right here next to our 24
pin now our 24 pin PCI Express and 8 pin
power are done and out of the way
someone do this area next I've got
eyelet here here and there which is
awesome so because I know I need SATA
power here in here I just kind of want
to get it somewhere in this part of the
case if it's there that it's more dangly
and in the way on this part of the case
we sawed up open unobstructed space
there I'm not gonna put anything in this
eyelet because I want to have some slack
right there I mean I could I'd still be
alright but maybe I'll do that at the
end now in terms of the SATA cables
I'm not going to route this up and
around because as you can see that would
not work so I'm just going to go ahead
and focus on
getting these plugged in and back in
their spot so it's better to remove the
drive when you go to plug it in then to
try and finagle because again if you're
trying to get it in there and you pretty
much force on this plastic you're gonna
break it so unhook it do yourself a
favor and then once you get it put it
back on the case tighten it down you
know that one so I'm just gonna kind of
squeeze those wires together like that
take the slack plug this into let's go
to this one so we have an extra slot
left if I ever need it for lighting or
something and then I'm literally gonna
just sort of push that kind of out of
the way now we're gonna do the power PCI
Express power cables for our graphics
cards exact same philosophy that I
showed you when I did the eight pin and
the 24 pin make it flat zip tie it
together
snip our little tails off of there have
your tools out of reach that's important
part of cable management and then we are
going to just we're gonna borrow this
one right here now we're because we're
not gonna be going back in there and now
we can pull it fairly tight and that's
what that looks like here's what we've
got left we've got the two SATA
harnesses for our hard drives and let's
just start for up one two three four
plug this guy in and give it a little
loop look that guy in a little loop put
that guy in a little loop and put that
guy in then we take the loops gently and
don't put any lateral force on that
gently flatten the loops so now we're
going to do the same thing and we're
going to run on the left side of the
SATA we can't run to the right side
because if we do we have the SATA plugs
right there and that worked out
perfectly so now if we go forth from the
top one make a loop to make loop so we
do the same thing so give a little
crease run that one right over the top
and there is our power for our hard
drives last thing I'm gonna do just like
you guys saw me do on the other ones I'm
going to zip tie these two together
right at the bottom so now I'm just
gonna do the same thing with USB 3.0 and
zip tie these together anyone that's
worked with USB 3.0 cables know that
they are they are a mess they are stiff
they don't want to bend they're always
in a double harness like this and
they're just a complete pain but they
are a necessary pain because USB 3.0 so
the HD audio I'm just gonna kind of push
I'll go along the floor that just to get
it out of the way but I'm not hooking
this up to anything because like I said
I don't use HD audio for anything I
never use frontside audio connectors so
this already looks great I mean
everything is managed you can tell where
everything's going I mean could you ask
for anything better
oh yeah we're forgetting something are
we SATA cables so I'm gonna go ahead and
do all these SATA cables at once here
but it's the same logic that I just
applied and showed you guys with the
rest of the case the only reason I do
these last is because like I said I
don't want these plugged in getting
yanked on and breaking the plastic tabs
on the drives so yeah we're to go ahead
and do this we'll come back at the end
see how it looks and then we'll wrap it
up but guys this is how you take a case
like this ten hard drives including the
SSDs and make it look I mean that's
better cable managing some systems I've
seen that have one hard drive so anyway
let's go ahead and see what this looks
like when we're done
well guys here it is this is what the
front looks like and this is the
business and the side you see this is
the part where most of the time if
people are fine with how this looks they
don't care how the backside looks but
obviously this is a tutorial about cable
management and this is how it looks even
with all of the SATA cables so you can
kind of see what I did right here I've
got the cables routed together this is a
separate harness of cables this is gonna
go to my SATA controller for my RAID
controller when that comes in so I've
got them harnessed and ready to go so
once that's plugged into my PCI Express
slot I just plug those in and we're good
to go
but you can see we don't have a huge
clump of cables down there we've got
good airflow everything is easy to trace
that's what cable management's all about
being able to trace your cables if you
have to fix something or play something
rewire something then you're able to see
where it is and follow it easily anyway
you guys want ask me forever to do a
how-to cable manage video this is it
I chose probably one of the more
difficult scenarios with all these
drives so it scales down from here
alright guys we're gonna go now thanks
for watching today's video if you guys
have any suggestions let me know
that's how videos like this come about
if you're new around here or you enjoy
today's video won't you consider giving
a like and subscribe if you're new
anyway thanks for watching guys we will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
