provided by performance pcs for the
largest online selection of PC modding
and water cooling parts head to
performance pcs comm
here we go part two now of the skunk
works version three updates and answer a
couple questions from the comments of
the first part now I don't know exactly
when this video is going up going on
vacation this weekend taking the family
all down in San Diego for a few days and
I think I already said that last video
but I can't remember the case apparently
I didn't mention what case it was it is
a case labs smh and of course more like
why aren't you using the enthalpy move
why aren't you using the defined s why
aren't you this why aren't you that guys
I don't answer why aren't you or why
didn't you questions there's just so
many limitless permeations of combo of
parts that I could have chosen and this
is what I'm going with so I don't answer
the questions of why I didn't go with
this or why I didn't do that like people
saying why didn't you put Intel 750s in
there well because until then 77 50s as
I've said this is a sponsored build and
I use the parts that I have I'm not
spending money on this build so anyway
we're going to do today we're going to
start doing some of the simple assembly
I'm not sure how far we're going to get
it's already the afternoon I had a lot
of had some car repairs to get done
today so I lost a lot of time but my
goal today is to get the upper radiator
mounted and fans because that has been
mounted in place so I can know where to
put the reservoirs get the reservoirs
mounted and get the mid plate in there
and start figuring out how I want to do
the loop that way I can figure out where
I have to drill so because I have the
mid plate ready you know to be able to
put in and out pretty quickly I can pull
it out and then do drilling where I
needed to be done and then put it back
in so looking forward to that where the
first time I had to do all the drilling
with it assembled but anyway let's go
ahead and get some of this stuff mounted
up and would like to get the blocks on
the Titans and so it'll start looking
like a computer again here shortly
hopefully anyway that's the plan well it
wouldn't be a J's build if there wasn't
some sort of snag and here
snag number one so I put in the new mid
plate there's only a couple screws
holding it in place you can see how we
have a cutout here and this is designed
for if you're gonna have like a 480 rad
in the front you need to have you know
enough room for it to pass through well
this is the one that came out of the old
mid plate and the case that didn't give
me a new one I don't think they realize
that I had to drill into this so I went
ahead and wrote them an email to see if
they could send me another one
but that's going to be that's gonna hold
me back a little bit uh shouldn't matter
too much though I can still do what I
need to do because I don't think I was
going to be drilling into that unless I
can find some way to incorporate that
hole into the bill but I'm not sure so
yeah like I said this wouldn't be a JS
build if it didn't have some sort of
snags along the way that's what keeps it
fun and exciting though well I guess I
don't have to figure out what to do with
that hole because 13 minutes after
writing an email to K slabs they've
already shipped me out that replacement
panels so yeah it's just this little
piece of aluminum but alright so we're
gonna go ahead get the radiator mounted
up and we're gonna start placing things
because that's not going to stop me
that's not how we do this this is the
radiator going on the top it is a black
ice nemesis GTS this one's a 480 you can
see they are fairly decent fin density
they're double finned so it means for
each row there's two sets of fins given
tons and tons of surface area what I
want to point out about this radiator
those this was actually custom made for
me by request because normally this
radiator comes in the wrinkled coat only
so I asked black ice or hardware labs if
they would be willing to make me one
that was with the same matte texture
that comes on their higher-end radiators
and they said absolutely so this is what
we've got here these are actually some
custom radiators for a custom system
they're they're pretty nice-looking
radiators man they these things are
slick looking I like the bevel on the
side it gives us some some really nice
shape yeah tell me what you guys think
of this thing this is pretty badass so
of course we got a 480 a 560 and a 280
it's a lot of radiators look
there's a new pump and Reza's put into
place so I can start getting some of the
tubing routed I've got to re sleep those
in the bottom the wires as you can see
they're coming apart so drill some holes
so the wires can go straight back and it
will look good there's a radiator in
place the front fans look I've always
loved the way the yellow looks shining
through the front of the case I mean I
think it just looks badass the yellow in
the gunmetal I thought about changing
the colors but it just they just had to
stay but now we're moving on to the part
that everyone's been waiting for and
that's me water cooling the Titans so
here's the first one we already took it
apart and as you can see it's got a ton
of memory chips on there on the front on
the back so yeah we're going to water
cool these three get those bolted up
into place over there that way we can
start figuring out how we're going to
run this loop and I'm not sure I'm gonna
get much farther than that today what do
we get to work on this again well I get
to work on it some tomorrow and then not
at all again until like Monday ah the
anticipation is killing baby alright so
this is where we are right now we've got
three Titans in there we've got the
pumps and reservoirs in there in the
upper rad I cannot for the life of me
figure out how I want to do this loop
I'll figure it out I tend to go through
this every single time but we had
another setback in that one of the
valves I bought broke so the handles on
the valves from bits power are plastic
and they're very very stiff to turn when
you first get them even if you wet them
and turning the handle on one of them
simply trying to move it from the
position at which it was shipped in
broke the handle right off and here it
is right here as you can see the plastic
like it's just a plastic piece on there
that's supposed to turn the metal shaft
in there and it's got like a nylon
washer and it's very stiff so if you
guys have ever turned any bits powered
rotary fittings you know how stiff they
are and well so that's busted now I got
to get a new one of those but yep not a
whole lot to report on today other than
we got the graphics cards ready to go
and I just can't figure out how I want
to do the loop the way
had it before was the outer reservoir
did the graphics cards and had all the
tubing under there I want to use less
soft tubing and I don't want to put a
whole lot in the basement so now I'm
trying to figure out how to get you know
all the tubing where it needs to go
because as you can see even though
there's a lot of room in this case
there's me a lot of crossover and I
don't want a lot of crossover so so
there we go guys that's it for today is
kind of a short one spent a lot more
time just staring at this thing trying
to figure out how I want to do it then
actually getting any work done I mean
all the blocks are installed that's
important probably not to rotate the CPU
block so I can get the inlet and outlet
on the proper sides and now it's just a
lot of brainstorming a lot of tedious
stuff like Reese leaving the pumps and
then doing the bending and all that
stuff so anyway I don't get to work on
this thing until next Monday
right now it's Wednesday and I don't get
to work on this thing till next Monday
because after tech talk tomorrow the
family and I we are hitting the road and
going down to San Diego until Sunday so
I won't get to actually work on this
until Monday which is good though
because I already wrote an email asking
for a replacement valve for the one that
broke and possibly some other fittings
and I'm going to need so yeah we may be
that stuff can be here in time by the
time I'm back and ready to work on it
I'm probably not going to do a lot of
updates going forward on this because
believe it or not stopping to do the
camera and all that stuff really does
slow me down so I think at the end I'm
just going to do a complete system
review and show you take you guys on a
tour through it do some nice camera work
and all of that of course guys you can't
forget to thank the sponsors for this
build if you guys are enjoying seeing
this system come together of course in
video for the three tight nexus dot EVGA
Nvidia sent those cards over some of the
stuff I already had like the ek
waterblock on there was sent the
supremacy block was sent by ek hardware
labs sent the radiators but all the rest
of this stuff that you see going in here
in terms of water cooling was all sent
by performance pcs
so if you guys are shopping for water
cooling stuff make sure you hit over to
performance - PCs and just check them
out especially since frozen CPU is still
not up and running really performance
pcs is kind of like your
option 4 you know the best selection so
and then of course the ek water blocks
did send me the blocks for the Titan
Nexus so thanks for that guys and what
it's all done we'll give this system a
complete a worthy b-roll and dramatic
effect and all that stuff is not like
doing the cinematography type stuff when
I can even though I kind of suck at it
it's still fun anyway guys as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
