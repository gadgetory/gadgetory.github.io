event 'im this is their top-of-the-line
custom water-cooled completely
configurable 175 pound box that you feel
the impact of the ground
well it sounds like downstairs anyway
this thing's 175 pounds if I thought
skunkworks was heavy that one back there
the great bit that is so much impact
like I feel the ground shake it it's
concrete today's video is sponsored by
LastPass we live in a digital age
everything we do is online online
banking online car payments online
shopping so why use a single login for
everything because you can't remember
your passwords anymore
well LastPass is a digital encrypted
online vault for your logins and your
passwords it syncs across all of your
devices that you log in so if you change
it on one device it changes everywhere
my favorite feature is the online audit
it will basically audit all of your
logins and let you know where your
passwords are week and anywhere you have
a duplicate password because that's how
they get you they find your password
then they try it everywhere and see if
it works now I am terrible I remembering
passwords and that's usually why people
have duplicate passwords because they
can't remember them well they've got a
password generator which allows you to
be able to kind of customize the
complexity of that password types of
custom characters to make it as
difficult to guess as possible but also
you don't have to remember it because
it's all stored in your digital vault so
stop trying to remember your passwords
and pulling your hair out because you
can't remember them and getting locked
out of your accounts because you've
guessed wrong too many times or that
email you were using in the past is no
longer active start securing your
accounts with the LastPass by using the
link in the description below one idea
of how strong this box is look at this
so I weight 260 ish pounds about 260
before Thanksgiving this is the Box
handle breaking you know you probably
should have never picked it up buy this
handle to begin with series 175 pounds I
don't know if that isn't British units
probably like I don't know don't you
guys measure in stone good something
like that there's at least four boulders
in here so here we go it has an ax 1200
I and
leftover cables a lot of foam packing
digital storm customized systems
accessory box basically all the extra
stuff that came with the motherboard so
it's got the wireless adapters the
standard sli bridge for you know non RTX
cards
okay so foam oh my goodness
I'm gonna flip it this way and try and
slide it out maybe also open the bottom
of the box and like push it out thanks
for watching guys we'll see you next
time box 75 of the hundred and
seventy-five pounds is probably the
cardboard box maybe not that much but
anyway filler you try to pick up one
hand Oh
once you tip it it's heavier suddenly oh
man to make it worse sorry digital storm
you're gonna have to put a new cover on
this oh that's my fingers hahaha are you
ready for the reveal
Oh
it's so big the computers pretty big too
okay so this is uh oh you guys know this
build just pointing a little bit of a
size comparison
ah look at this okay so we obviously I
start by taking off the side panel and
the glass is freakin heavy this it's
like I'm carrying us a sliding glass
window right here in fact even on the
back side of the motherboard tray you
can see it has fans and the distribution
block that's used to make that really
clean wire or tube routing that you guys
can see on the front side now this is
what happens when diehard enthusiasts
start a an SI or a system integrator
company you get stuff like this so
starting on the back right here we're
gonna look at a couple of things you can
see we've got fans on the back side
where we've got a two hundred and eighty
millimeter red I think it's a two eighty
red yeah that's definitely definitely
ah always sticking my fingers in inside
of fans anyway this is obviously the
1200 X well twelve ax 1200 I power
supplied from Coursera now this is the
custom built distribution plate right
here because remember the tubes on the
other side runs straight through this
redirects it to where it needs to go we
also have a 480 right up top or 360 red
there's a ton of radiators in here this
is the Power Distribution panel I was
talking about though this has obviously
power cables that run from this adapter
down to the power supply this runs
through the mid plate and as you can see
they've got these sleeve cables that are
going to both of the graphics cards
right here they've got your combs on
there to keep it nice and neat to RTX 28
ET is from a video with EK water blocks
on there we also have a clear bridge
right here for those blocks that you can
actually see the coolant this is a clear
coolant and then obviously the color
scheme they have on this one is more of
a bronzey gold color we've got gold
fittings on here I believe these are
bits power could be wrong they look like
bits power rigid tube and it's all
plumbed into the distribution panel that
goes onto the back like I said so you've
got these cross or pass-through fittings
that go onto the distribution block on
the back and then these can be ran
obviously very straight and very tidy
so this
the ekx rez right here the same ones I
have in skunk works actually I love
these they don't even sell these anymore
so they must have bought up a whole
bunch of them or they're still making
them just for digital storm 250
millimeter reservoir this looks like a
gold digital storm label block I know
who makes this block though and you can
see we have two sticks of g.skill ddr4
now this is a ninety nine hundred K it
is overclocked so components wise they
really are off the shelf what really
makes this system unique is the amount
of custom work they put into the chassis
as I mentioned this chassis is only
built for them so the front fans blow
directly on your storage options which
as you can see you've got one two three
four five six seven eight
that can go in there looks like you do
more right here if you remove this yes
they are hot swappable so you switch
that lift that little slide up and you
can put it in there so on the bottom
it's very similar to how I have
skunkworks setup this is a five sixty
radiator which means we have four 140
millimeter fans it appears to be about
forty five millimeters thick again I
don't know who the brand is for well I'm
always sticking my fingers in inside of
fans I don't know who the brand is for
this but what I can see down in there is
the bottom basement is soft tubing which
is I guess nice that way you can easily
move it in and out having had skunkworks
be all rigid tube down there it can be
kind of a pain in the butt trying to get
to those what I think could have been
nicer personally it's do like I did on
skunk works a very similar setup flip
these fans around so the air is coming
in and then these are exhausting it and
it just goes straight through that's
exactly how my skunk works is set up but
what do I know I am NOT digital storm so
it's going to fire it up and see what
the clock speeds and stuff are out of
the box because this is supposed to be
overclocked let's go ahead and run
Cinebench and see what our temperatures
are like and what our clock speeds are
like Oh 4.7 but they're hitting 59 61 50
60 so about 10 12 degrees cooler than my
small form-factor build so I went ahead
and push the overclock to 5 gigahertz
which is pretty much possible for just
about every 9900 K in fact the turbo
boosts on an onion 100k
on one core is five diggers we applied
it to all the cores up the voltage a
little bit and also updated up the RAM
speed to 3,600 up from 3000 temperatures
are amazing though 70 on the package all
the cores are in the 60s one core hit 71
and a 2088 so yeah that's obviously this
cooling system can handle much more but
because it's not my computer I'm not
going to push it too much farther and we
will do a test after where we put the
side panels back on to check for airflow
because obviously with the solid panel
right here I'm curious as to what the
airflow situation would be there so our
temperatures have pretty much stopped
climbing at 50 C on the main card it
will drop down to about 47 C on certain
scenes but 50 is where it maxes out we
think a lot that has to do with the fact
that there's not a lot of space between
the glass and these fans which means I
mean this is still perfectly reasonable
though in terms of temperatures and not
the coldest you can get on water but the
2080 ti does run warm we've tested that
on water before it's certainly a warm
card there's also the 360 right on the
top and the 280 red on the bottom as
well so we are still getting decent
temperatures considering the fact we
have so much radiator space in this if
you took the side panel off the
temperatures would come down a little
bit because you have such a massive
radiator and then it can get way more
airflow so this is one of those where
the design choice was kind of more
aesthetic rather than being a hundred
percent functional I think there's no
denying though that it's certainly
beautiful looking but all that RGB
goodness in there and the fans turning
and doing their thing and all the hard
line loops and stuff so I mean 50 C
though that is what 34 see below where
the what 84 degrees is where the factory
fan curve is if this had been an
air-cooled system so the digital storm
event MX has definitely been a flagship
of theirs for quite a while you can
order it and pretty much any CPU
configuration that you want this it's
got thread ripper rise in ninth gen
obviously as you can see X 299 and what
really what this is a showcase of what
happens like I said when PC build
enthusiasts start a company and start
building the craziest pcs that they can
available to the public people ask me
all the time if they can buy pcs from me
because
the custom stuff they see like
skunkworks and all that and although
unfortunately I do not sell to the
public this is one of those things where
you could have a system that's even
better than something I can build
because of the manufacturing process of
governments like the the power passed
through on the motherboard tray that is
something that it it makes servicing a
system like this extremely easy
it makes wire management obviously
extremely tidy the pass throughs on the
ridgid tubing this is available in soft
tubing as well but this is obviously the
rigid tubing model you've got the
distribution blocks at the top and on
the back you've got extreme detail even
in the paint job this custom paint job
has a like a Perla Desson flake in it
the list just goes on and on the massive
tempered glass side panels which are
probably amongst the heaviest pieces of
glass I've held before so you guys can
find out more though about the events of
x-series as well as the other CPU towers
that digital storm makes they also make
laptops you guys recall I did a laptop
video a while back that's still my
gaming laptop that I use to this day you
guys can check out that video down the
description below as well but yeah this
one as outfitted is about $9,500 which
is a just extremely premium when it
comes to building a computer but that's
because of the amount of work that goes
into the chassis and all the custom
configuration not just the components of
course there's the labor to put it
together the warranty and all of that
stuff and I'm proud and happy to say
that it arrived undamaged because of the
shipping method that they use as well
and obviously all the soft foam material
in there to make it travel safely so
guys check the link in the description
below you guys can learn more about the
event on X and yeah as always guys
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one this is one of those things
like you just don't even want to touch
it because it's just pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
