if you remember just the other day I did
a video talking about static pressure
versus air flow when it comes to fans
and naturally you guys asked hey do more
videos please about how to do case fans
and things like that so naturally the
next video in this little series was a
no-brainer we're going to talk about gun
or optics no actually that's next week's
video so today we're going to talk about
case pressure positive pressure neutral
pressure and negative pressure and what
it all means to the cooling of your
systems so yeah today we're going to try
and bring you a case flow 101 when it
comes to air cooling water cooling and
what it means to have different types of
pressures in your case now for this
video today I'm using the cooler master
cosmos se it we're gonna actually be
doing a full review on this in a future
video but it's going to be for
demonstration purposes today so what we
have in front of us right here is a case
or an enclosure or chassis some various
things that they are referred to as but
this is where all the parts of your
computer go in if you guys didn't know
that you might want to go back a little
bit and start more of the basics but
this is a computer case now the chassis
serves two purposes it is to a house all
of your computer parts and B it is to
create a cooling environment now by
creating this cooling environment it
also gives you control over the air flow
and that's very very important not only
other things on your motherboard like
the heatsink and the V RMS and things
that need to be cooled there are lots of
parts in your system that require
airflow to transfer the heat out of the
system now the major heating dynamic
that's taking place inside of your
system here is radiation and where the
heat is actually radiated into the
atmosphere and how that system heat is
removed from the chassis now the three
different types of chassis environments
that you can create here are a positive
environment and by that I mean it tells
your computer it's doing a good job and
to keep going and it's very very
supportive and positive there is a
neutral environment or their basic
basically everything is like hey you
know you're doing your best but keep
trying harder
and this is a negative environment where
it basically just tells you you're a
piece of grill I probably took the
analogies a little too far so let's go
ahead and start with positive pressure
positive pressure basically means
nothing more than you have more intake
than you do exhaust that means you have
more air entering the case and the fans
exhausting it or able to move so what
happens is the air has to find a way out
that's one of those things with physics
we just can't change that so the air
pretty much finds a way out and the way
it finds those ways out our vents in the
bottom vents right here in the PCI
Express slots those most of those cases
have vents now you have these little
rubber grommets for water cooling you
have the expansion slots over here on
the side you have vents in the top I
mean pretty much cases these days are
very very ventilated now you also have
neutral pressure which means you have an
equal amount of air coming in as you do
going out so you don't actually create
any pressure positive or negative now
negative as you may have guessed by this
point it's where you have more air being
exhausted that is being taken in so if
scientists were right and every action
has an opposite and equal reaction that
means if we have more air being
exhausted that means all of our events
become intakes the exhaust fans have to
pull the air from somewhere and if the
intake fans are not feeding the case
that means that air is making its way
into all of these vents now why do we
care about this as PC builders well guys
it really comes down to two things one
temperature control if you can get more
cool air entering the case especially in
a water-cooled system you're going to
have a much better cooling environment
we have more cool air entering and more
cool air means more density for the cool
air to be able to absorb the heat or
actually the heat to transfer to the
cold air remember it goes from hot to
cold and then that air being exhausted
through the vents and the fans and that
other thing being dust control so if you
AskMe dust control is probably the most
important reason at least in my opinion
why anyone should care about positive
neutral or negative warning guys I'm
about to bust a myth right now we're
going to keep it really really real
positive pressure only reduces dust if
all of your intake fans are filtered let
me repeat that positive pressure only
reduces dust if
all of your intake fans are filtered if
you don't have filters on your fans the
dust is just going to come right in
through the fan you're not going to
actually have any dust control
whatsoever but with that said it
actually becomes very difficult to
create a positive pressure environment
when you have intake fan filters because
they tend to be pretty damn restrictive
now let's talk about ways that you can
actually create a positive pressure
environment positive pressure is what I
recommend it's by having higher rpm or
higher static pressure fans in the front
then you do in the exhaust remember guys
more air in less air out Eagles positive
pressure all of the ventilations no
longer become little suck magnets for
bringing dust into your system because
most of the time that's where dust is
going to make its way in I cannot think
of a single scenario where negative
pressure is actually desired in fact
negative pressure tends to pull air in
from the sides and it actually creates a
situation where if you're running water
cooling or a radiator because of the
added resistance the air is going to
find the travel of least resistance
which is going to be through the open
exhaust fans now air is going to travel
through your radiator but trust me
positive pressure is where you want to
be neutral pressure is actually very
very difficult to achieve on cases these
days because as you can see the cooler
master cosmos se has a whole lot of
restriction on the frontier in fact we
do have two 120 millimeter intake fans
but you can see the top half of this fan
is being blocked by this hot-swap drive
right here or cover I guess I should say
and right behind those as you can see is
the drive cages immediately so these
fans are going to be very unlikely to be
able to have the air reach all the way
through to the exhaust fans in a case
like this if you were air cooling I
would actually recommend that you take
the top fans and instead of having these
being exhaust maybe turn them into an
intake so it's blowing it's blowing cold
air right onto your heatsink and then
you have your exhaust fan exhausting as
much air as it can in this case it would
create a positive pressure environment
now guys it may sound like I threw an
awful lot of information at you
hopefully you're not more confused so
let me just go ahead and summarize
positive pressure means you have more
air
in than you do exhausting and all of the
excess air has to have a place to go it
will exhaust through all of the vents
through pressure rather than the fan
moving the air so you have air being
exhausted by the fan as well as air
being pushed out through the vents
negative pressure is where you have more
exhausting fans than you do air coming
in so the air that's being exhausted
literally gets pulled in through all of
the ventilation and unfortunately that
pulls in a lot of dust with it as well
neutral pressure it's very very unlikely
you're ever going to be dealing with
neutral pressure in fact a perfect
example of neutral pressure would be
this right here the side case is open
you have neutral pressure which means
all the air on the cooling components
like the heat sinks like all of these
like the passive heat sinks down on
motherboards and Southbridge Northbridge
and AMD things like that are actually
not getting cold because there's no air
moving over them so opening the side of
the the case like this would actually
create a neutral environment which is
not good either you have to have some
sort of airflow so guys I hope this has
given you some clarification I mean if
it didn't I sincerely apologize maybe
I'll try and do another future video
where I actually show maybe through
smoke how the air moves I just I don't
have a smoke machine
I don't smoke I'm not gonna blow into it
and dry ice I don't know I don't how to
do that anybody have any suggestions on
how to get smoke in here and show how
things actually move yeah so anyway guys
there you go positive neutral and
negative pressure explained by J's to
sense aim for positive it's a good thing
it's called positive for a reason let me
get on out of here guys follow on
Twitter if you have any questions the
fundraiser is doing really really good
we've actually unlocked white a lot of
giveaways I'm gonna be doing here on the
channel and if you have no idea what I'm
talking about just look down in the
description the campaign is still going
feel free to contribute if not my
content is free for everybody with that
I'm gonna get the heck on out of here
guys see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
