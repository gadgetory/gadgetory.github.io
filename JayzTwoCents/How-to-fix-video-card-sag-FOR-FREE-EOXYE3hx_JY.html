know there's something that I think we
all deal with as the graphics cards keep
getting bigger and more powerful and
stronger and that being the problem of
GPU erectile-dysfunction basically
they're sagging all over the place and
I've seen lots of different people try
to come up with different ways of
dealing with the CP or the GPU droop by
having little posts here I've even seen
people use fishing line tied to the top
but today I'm gonna show you a method
that I kind of came up with don't know
if anyone else has done it if so good
for you but I haven't personally seen
this and I used it on my last couple
builds on how to fix GPU sag regardless
of how big or heavy your GPU is for free
free being the key word in this save
money while simplifying your gift
shopping this year with mass drop get
high quality products at amazing prices
like the ex EMU Purple Heart headphones
featuring handcrafted solid wood
enclosures providing a warm non
fatiguing sound signature easy to drive
design making them perfect for cell
phones and portable mp3 players without
requiring an amp all while weighing less
than a half a pound making the EMU
Purple Hearts an ideal choice for travel
sign up for mass drop is always free so
to see what's dropping this holiday
season head to mass drop via the link
below so I've got two GPS right here
both of them are fairly heavy and that's
we're gonna be using as our subjects
today we've got the asus Poseidon which
has a built in air cooler and water
block so of course you've got the weight
of that and then the ever gigantic ZOTAC
Arctic storm which is basically a
water-cooled amp card again with a full
cover water block on there adding quite
a bit of weight but what you're gonna
see right here will apply to pretty much
any graphics card big or small and just
about any product mass produced case and
I looked at a few cases here to make
sure that what I'm about to do would
work it does appear that it would and so
your mileage may vary but any
mass-produced case will probably have
the same issue now the first understand
GPU sag you've got to see it you've got
to figure out why it's sagging
now back plates are things that
companies have come up with for both its
aesthetics and also to give a little bit
of rigidity because a lot of GPU sag
folks have pretty much come to the
conclusion is because of the weight of
the card and the bowing and flexing of
the PCB causing sort of a flex downward
so the back plates are supposed to help
with that but all that happens now is
get the whole card that sags down do you
see all this movement right here the
problem is if you get in here neck - you
can see this movement is directly on the
socket as well as the pins and we don't
want that actually how about is this one
sagging oh yeah there's definitely sag
in that one not as bad as others but you
can see it's definitely lower right here
the top screw hole here takes a lot of
the sag stress as you can see as I move
it up and down you can see the bracket
moving now what I would usually do is
drop the screw so one of the things I
would do is I would keep this screw kind
of loose and I would take the end of the
card right here and push it up as high
as I can sometimes you it feels
uncomfortable to you like bending the
card push it up real tight and then
tighten down that screw as much as I can
sometimes it'll hold but in this case
you can see it goes right back down now
I got me thinking look back here you see
this part of the graphics card right
there that's basically this do you see
these little tabs that push in this is
where it actually goes and slots in to
the PCI Express slot now you see how
these sort of taper they taper in a
little bit which means we have some play
like this up and down so when this
corner comes down this corner comes up
kind of like a cantilever so if you
watch right now when I play with the
Flex ladies you can see that corner
right there is moving up and down so
this is actually where you fix your sag
every one kind of focuses here on the
end of the graphics card but this is not
the problem back here is and this is
kind of the problem with mass-produced
cases everyone just sort of comes up
with these slots you know the slots
where the graphics card will thread in
there in fact you can kind of see right
here what I'm talking about
so here's a PCI Express slot so you can
see where they just sort of slot into
there if you move around to the back
year case you can see the little metal
tabs sticking through now watch what
happens when I mess with the card you
see all that wiggle what we want to do
is we want to push those down the
problem is these little tabs these
little narrow tabs right here are
narrower than the slot so that's what's
actually what this is what
supports the card this does not the
screws not this part right here this is
what supports the whole weight of the
card so this is all I do it's just this
simple and the reason why it's free it's
because you all have these screws that
came with your cases and it's simple
enough so I take an m3 screw and all I
do is believe it or not I just thread it
in to the hole there's so many windows
in this video but I just thread it into
the hole right here I see there's a hole
it's actually not a hole it's just a
slot the thing is the m3 threading right
here is perfect to just sort of thread
itself right into that gap now it's
gonna spread the metal a little bit but
trust me this is worth it so what I'll
do is I'll take the end of the card push
it up so you can see I'm making a little
more space and then just get it started
just like that and tighten her down it
is literally that simple you won't see
it from the other side the screw is
creating a wedge just go until it kind
of snaps cuz all I did was like kind of
pop the metal back now we have a fully
supported GPU with no more sag you can
see it's a lot more rigid but if you
look at it now you can see there is very
little sag compared to before and in
fact if you want to just be you know if
you want to do your due diligence you
can do it on both sides so let's go and
try it now with the waterblock graphics
card so you got to remove this screw
though every time you go take the
graphics card out just for the sake of
dropping screws cuz that's what I really
like to do now this is actually quite
the test too because this case has a
very thin steel metal it's very flimsy I
mean you can kind of see watch this I
mean you can see how much this whole
thing is flexing right here and when
this metal is supposed to be supporting
the whole graphics card it's definitely
a challenge so let's see what happens
here and putting the water cooled card
but you can certainly see back there
right now
make it to get in there tight you can
actually see just how much movement
there is back there and you can see how
when I lift up on the right corner that
corner goes down you see that because
this is our this is our cantilever point
right here that's where the action is
so we go up here it goes down there
which is why we wedge that screw in
their back - how much are we saggy right
now let's see actually not too bad but
you can see we could certainly get that
up a little bit higher a little bit more
supported but these screws these are
typically just toss I mean usually
they'll give you more screws and you
need with the cases spare screws that's
why this is free once we thread this guy
in there look at that no more movement
whatsoever
and there's our graphics card so we're
gonna come across a case where those
slots aren't actually the problem so we
got right here is the act amp or the
zotac amp Xtreme it's a very long card
you can see we have a lot of play right
here you can see there's a little bit
moving in the back like I showed you but
the problem is if you turn around look
at the back of this case this is a
cooler master case right here it's one
of the maker 5 cases but you can see
it's actually manufactured really well
where there's not much movement back
here and the slots are actually small
enough to where I couldn't get a screw
in there without drilling a hole anyway
so that's telling me this isn't our
problem so upon further inspection you
can see the problems actually wait this
card is manufactured this one's got a
lot of sag the issue here is if you look
right here if I can we turn off the
light if you look right here you can see
look at all this sag I mean this card's
fully mounted right here but what's
happening here is the card has no
support with the cooler to that bracket
so it's just sort of floating right here
so if I was to take something like say
just to show you for demonstrational
purposes if I wedge my screwdriver up in
there
oh that our sag is gone so that's
actually more of a card manufacturing
problem where they just didn't give
enough support on the bottom side of the
cart so if you look right here on that
on this card you can see once again it's
kind of the same issue see all this flex
right here this is where the SAG is
coming from so has nothing to do with
the mounting mechanism so what I would
to do what I would do in this situation
is I would find something to sort of
wedge up in there that isn't too
aesthetically unpleasing to give our
card a little bit of support this I
don't think is going to work
that wasn't enough but let's see if we
can come up with something so what I
want to do is I want to support kind of
right here in the middle of the card
because if I put my screwdriver back in
there you can see if I wedge it sort of
right there that takes care of most of
the sack so I found this little thing
that's a little 3m wire clip retainer
thing I don't even know where I got it
it was in my toolbox but I would go with
something nonmetallic
we don't want to be shoving metal parts
up inside of our GPU see if I this helps
if it does the nice part is this is a
it's got its own adhesive on it
so we could actually adhesive that in
place but that was not enough so we need
more you can see I turned that just how
much flex there is down there because
that you can see that that's where the
problem is if look at all of that flex
is because of the way they attached the
cooler with no support right here so I
just stuck these two things together
seeing if that gives me enough because I
don't want this to be too permanent but
I want it to work that helping yeah
that's something there so that actually
worked it's not too ugly now we've got a
level card hook level to you it's pretty
little to me but to prove it let's knock
it out and see what happens oh yeah you
see it sag the second I popped it out so
this is where you just have to get kind
of creative right to come up with
solutions but these are the two major
reasons that you would find a GPU
sagging case manufacturers to come up
with their own brackets and stuff to
support the end of the card sometimes it
wouldn't be necessary though if the card
was manufactured in a way where wouldn't
sag
those are the two methods I kind of use
when it comes to dealing with GPU sag if
you've got a cool method make sure you
put it down in the description below an
awfully pink I'm standing in front of
our our nice cool stage lights but
anyway I'm gonna go guys also to if
you've been missing any sort of the
notifications click the bell below this
video YouTube is added again if you guys
don't want to miss any videos click that
otherwise get to it when you get to it
I'm gonna go thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
