unblocking our nerd blocks as a coin the
term we coined unblocking so real quick
I'm not actually gonna let her run the

figured well I might as well let you
take over the show
what nerve block is if you guys aren't
aware it's a monthly subscription
service for either $13.99 for kids or
$19.99 for grown-ups all the grown-up
blocks the horror block and the nerd
block have t-shirts in them the kid
blocks still don't have t-shirts but
they're cheaper so whatever so we open
this every single month if you guys are
interested in getting your own
subscription you can save 10% by using
my affiliate code it's down in the
description you guys can check it out if
you're interested it's kind of fun she
likes looking at them every single month
because you don't know what you're
getting it's a surprise girl this week I
don't know the girl block is heavier
than the boy block this month boy block
is really light I'm not sure what's in
there so okay I'm gonna let Little J run
the show and she's gonna tell us what
we're unblocking and we're gonna we're
gonna follow her lead so what are we
doing 1st 2nd 3rd 4th so this my first
horror block whoo you like the horror

in this one a jigsaw vinyl character
that's pretty cool jigsaw from saw I
guess would be yeah you don't know who
he is huh he's a scary bad guy
right there yeah that's his little doll
yeah anyway we're not gonna talk much
about him because that's a little scary
for you all right so here's the shirt
that comes with it you've been wanting a
shirt there you go
yours alright what is this shirt oh my
gosh oh it's an aliens shirt why are you
when did you see alien I never let you
watch aliens I've seen that Aryan show
on family movie in the in the end like
almost and there's a dead guy and when
they're trying to fight him it turns
into a big snake I have a feeling I need
to start paying more attention to the
shows you watch alright so anyway it's
an aliens t-shirt another black t-shirt
all they do is black t-shirts black
t-shirts I'd like to see some color so
this is a a bone pen it's like finger
bones although their fingers are a lot
longer than mine yeah it's a finger pen
bones and you mostly want to close it
because it's an OEM no but there's no
lid it's just like it just stays that's
kind of cool yeah and then we also have
in here Oh an original style I'm
assuming this is not an original but
Tales from the Crypt comic book it's a
horror comic book that's kind of neat
yeah and then we have a zombie premium
multi-surface decal Oh zombie stickers
that's kind of neat you like stickers
yeah Tommy stickers
do you like the zombies alright and then
we've got another horror themed magazine
this one's called Rue Morgue
just a lot of uh well paranormal type
stuff so she's covered in blood
I'm sure that maybe she was she cut
herself cooking that's what happened
I'm sure all right so the horror block
this month was kind of neat it's got
some good reading material if you're
into that sort of stuff this explains
this card explains the all about the
jigsaw there's some other characters no

I'm not damaging the rim the edge is
really sharp it's just taped on here so
nothing's getting damaged no RAM was
harmed in the making of this video here
I'll let you open this one you're gonna
take it all for me anyway oh you go
straight to the we're supposed to look
at the t-shirt alright so this is a
Scribblenauts unmasked DC hero so it
could be several people Batman looks
like it could be Superman or Deadpool

two different things once again I feel
like I don't know what it's a mash-up of
but ok tear it right yeah
ok you don't know where that's been time
to get you your shot alright
