back from pax and we are back in the
swing of things we know later this month
we have got some cool launches coming
things that we are hoping are gonna live
up to the hype like r-tx we've got the
new 9000 ninth generation whatever you
want to call it I 9s coming out from
Intel but in the meantime we've got a
we've got to kind of fill our plate with
some stuff we are known for doing stupid
things around here and that's not gonna
change anytime soon we're gonna get even
stupider starting with that word because
that's not even a real word EDG offers a
full range of components including video
cards motherboards power supplies cases
and peripherals regardless of your needs
EVGA sure to have you covered to see
what EVGA can do for your next build
head to EVGA calm now obviously when
r-tx launches I want to test on multiple
platforms including rise ins we built
ourself a rise in 2700 X air-cooled
system here residing inside of a fractal
design define s it's got a knock to it
NH 12 view cooler that's what the
numbers were or something like that you
know the the names not to a kind of hard
Brown fan and all but whatever we are
running the 2700 X overclocked to 4
gigahertz right now on an asus crosshair
7 motherboard we've got an EVGA GTX 10 a
DTI superclocked
sitting in here and it's all being
powered by an RM 1000 I from Corsair a
very modest system very high high
performing system one that anyone be
proud of to play games and do work on so
yeah I've even told you what we're gonna
do yet today cuz I kind of wanted to be
just a little bit of a surprise and want
you guys to get hooked and stick around
so first things first we have to do some
baseline testing and this has nothing to
do with RTS this is just a whole
different concept I've been wanting to
do and I figured this is the perfect
time to do it so the system was actually
built for us to be able to do some rise
and testing with RT X because of course
we want to see how things perform on
both Intel and AMD based system
considering they are both worth talking
about now that AMD has certainly brought
some competition to the space so we're
gonna go ahead and run a 264 for I don't
know 10 min
something cuz it's an air cooler that
should be plenty and then we will do
three mark times by extreme so we're
gonna go ahead and start a 264 right now
100% CPU usage right there look at that
temperatures temperature CPU max so far
of 64 not bad considering it's
overclocked with Auto voltage so yeah
we're gonna let this go for 10 minutes
and we'll see where things balance out
so it's been running for 11 and a half
minutes you can see the nice thing about
air cooling is it pretty much stabilizes
right away water takes time for all the
water on the fluid to heat up but it
looks like our max temperature we
achieved on the CPU package was 73
averages we're sitting right around the
mid-60s you can see it's currently at 63
still running 73 with our max so we're
gonna we care about the max though I
want to see what the max spike is so
right now it's running 71 so let's do
this now let's go ahead and run what we
need to stop the test first right let's
go ahead and run some num num 3dmark
yeah Metro no not Metro 3dmark time spy
extreme time spy extreme is very
difficult to run it's time spy but it's
extreme
so here's our results a 4505 we're only
better than 75% of all results for the
2700 X and a 1080i that hurts
oh that hurts I'm used to seeing like 99
percent and if I see 98 usually like oh
we have to fix that now okay here's the
deal
I mean temperatures how hot did our GPU
get our GPU got all the way up to 69
degrees not bad really not bad
considering that was a 4k test and it's
a stock fan curve so I think we can do
better and I've got an idea and it's
gonna involve this stuff we are going to
plumb an AC into the front of this
air-cooled system now if you haven't
seen the other crazy test we've done
around here go and check those out first
this is just a continuation of bad ideas
that cost us a lot of money so we've
taken a box fan and basically put for
480 millimeter radiators on it and had
the Box fan do massive air cooling where
we got a GPU like a 1080 CI on water
under load overclocked to ambient
temperatures and then we used an AC unit
exactly like this one not this exact one
but exactly like this one and gotten it
blowing cold air at the radiator all
plumbed into it and got it to sub
ambient 16 C under load my question is
what happens out if we plumb cold air
into the front of this case and chill an
air cooled system well it will at work
yes it'll work its boiler alert I could
just cut the front of this actually one
of these cardboard boxes might be
perfect time
this channel is NSFW you ever seen what
happens to human body and pure vacuum we
also appointed the the PSU fan up
because we wanted to make sure that the
cold air went through the power supply
as well that's why we did that that way
why can I screw that on this tastes so
bad ah it had tape residue haunted
imagine if we imagine if we added up
everything I've ever spent on the stupid
videos we do like like this with AC
inside sharp I didn't put my gloves on
it's a gorilla tape this just might work
so ours yet there your global
illumination why is it terrifying is
because it's me hey this is fun I feel
like being unscrewed worse has really
prepared me for these videos yeah we
decided the AC wasn't worth they will
just take this Vardar Evo and
I was gonna test it I'm curious if I
could feel the the fans pull in the air
feels like I'm gonna turn it on the side
panels taped to this I can't get the
side panel off almost like I have
experience
oh I'm that way under the fingernail
they went under than me
Oh small but this is a stabby all right
back to what I was doing because we had
three seconds without an accident so
we're good yeah yeah it really does look
like claptrap it's the best tape job
ever
history tape jobs why does it look like
a gun well after spending about two
hours building it yeah two hours it's
done probably one of the greatest things
I have ever built I don't say so myself
all right so we just fired on the AC
we're gonna let it get cold we noticed
all the exhaust fans are turning that's
how much air is actually coming through
here and that's including after what's
being lost right here through this vent
I forgot to tape that off so we're gonna
tape that now we're letting the AC get
down to its operating temperature it's
the first time we turned it on and then
we're gonna go ahead and do our testing
it is so cold
these fans are running like full rpm
with just the pressure of the cooler
pushing it through we've gone through
and sealed up everywhere we could feel
leaks tip at the bottom of the case I
guess I should have done that there's a
lot of cold air coming out the bottom
right now didn't think about all the
vents down there that's okay though we
need to fire this up now and see how
well our temperatures dropped so let's
see MSI Afterburner what's our GPU
idling at 16 see if I actually turn the
fans on full blast what if that matters
well this is the best air-cooled system
ever right I mean this is legitimately
air-cooled all right same drill we'll
let it go for ten minutes unless the
temperatures don't move any more in the
first few minutes which I'm not I'm not
gonna miss a really will well it's been
going for six minutes in 45 seconds and
I think this graph shows you that
nothing is going to change its median
average is 46 see our max is 56 C which
is like what 17 C lower then where it
was on with just the ambient air to be
honest I thought it would be cooler but
okay I mean that's just the way the
cookie crumbles I guess right boom goes
the dynamite so here's we're going to do
we are going to go ahead and stop this
test the GPU is still idling at seven
though so we're gonna go ahead and run
our 3d mark now Phil can do an overlay
to see if there was an improved
what not that's what it fills her for
all right so ask or 45:57 really its
margin of error of the last score
nothing really changed to be honest we
can look at things a little bit deeper
though when Phil can compare this to the
original score cuz I didn't save it
because I'm stupid but let's see if we
went up higher than 75% and we are still
75% better than all results I didn't
really change but you know it did change
obviously our temperatures if we look at
those our GPU maxed at 45 see and I'll
be honest I have had plenty of tending
to TI's on water still reach 45 see
granted overclocked a bit more but if we
look at our core clock here itself
boosted all the way up to 1987 and
stayed there most of the time drop down
to 1886 at one point and then back up to
1974 and then this is during CPU tests
and stuff right here where it's done at
1557 so clearly the system is nice and
cool and obviously none of this matters
we had to build a system like I said I
want to build a rise in system to get
ready for RTX testing so we could test
them both Intel and rise in so obviously
we needed a Verizon build and that's
what we that's what we don't so yeah for
the low low price of what was it three
hundred and eighty seven dollars with
parts yeah about three hundred eighty
seven dollars is what it costs us to put
this together to make this video so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
