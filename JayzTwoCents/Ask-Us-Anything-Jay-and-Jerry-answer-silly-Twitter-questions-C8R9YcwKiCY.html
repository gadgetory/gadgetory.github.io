with this motorboat it's easy content
and we don't want to work for our money
yeah ba-ba-ba-ba balance what's up guys
jeez two cents here and every time Jerry
and I to get together we started this
back like in February of 2015 it's been
a while better something like that
anyway we're know June of 2014 is when
we started this when he came to visit me
where we do a Q&amp;amp;A with you guys
basically you guys ask a question on
Twitter we read the funny ones and then
we just kind of have some phones they
have a not so funny ones yeah sometimes
they get a little depressing most of the
time actually the new z170 classified
motherboard from EVGA features eight
phase-- PWM 4 Way SLI support along with
top notch components to offer gamers and
enthusiasts more of what they want a
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more so
here's what we gonna do we do this in
two parts where we kind of do some of
them over here in my channel and then if
you want to see some more of this you
head on over to Jerry's channel link is
in the description and yeah but you guys
will get the good ones here on this
channel this is the better channel yeah
so we have a question from Scotty or at
Scotty the tech two he said would you
let guests join Tech Talk because I'm a
fan of the podcast could I join Tech
Talks sometimes yeah for the low price
of one thousand dollars
I'm cool with that dude do I get any of
it this time or do you still keep it
although we right now you should be
paying me $1,000 I don't get the logic
alright so this one's asked by sy the I
res serious Oh seriously serious sy are
not serious on Twitter he says hello
salty are you Jerry that Jay is verified
on Twitter and doesn't care but you
really want it and they won't give it to
you I am incredibly salty actually I'm
incredibly salty because I was even
promised verification on Twitter there
are no promises they the internet there
are I learned that the hard way the
Internet has nothing but broken promises
and failed hopes and dreams
I'm very salty I'm almost thinking that
it's like a fat shaming level issue with
that every time you hit them up going
hey where's my checkmark I hit them up
after you'd be like don't give him his
check mark don't give him his check mark
and obviously you're winning oh about
the cars ah guys just my balls ah all
right
so the next question we have is from
Revo side what is the worst thing you
have ever done to your cars
that's might take a while well that's
the rest episode right there okay you
want me answered your floor until yours
because yours is kind of recent I think
I know where you're gonna go with this
yeah I don't know it's there's there's
quite a few battle okay think about it
you go ahead so actually it was my dad's
1989 Cadillac Sedan Deville when I was
in high school got to borrow the car
thought I was kind of like the
right yeah I'm rolling in a caddy right
sure take some friends home and I go to
do a Burnout
right I'm like okay the car could do
burnout at 4.5 liter v8 burnout I
thought it would be cool to do the
burnout and when I went to do the
burnout somehow I went to go into
neutral right and I was gonna do a
neutral jump neutral drop on it in an
automatic by the way cuz we put it in
neutral revit and just put it into gear
but I got a little bit you know
sometimes get a little overexcited oh
yeah you're gonna show off your friends
accidentally rubbed it and then shoved
it into reverse let's just say the
noises that the transmission made we're
uh yeah they were they were they were
terrifying
so anyway realizing I had put it into
reverse was like oh crap still forgot to
take my foot off of the gas went from
reverse straight to first yeah it was
bad it was bad well the worst thing I
think I've ever done and there's this is
a long list I could actually make an
entire video and the worst things I've
ever done in my car but the one that
probably like freaked me out the most
and screwed me over the most would be my
2001 Toyota Corolla which I thought was
a good idea the turbocharged and I knew
nothing about turbo charging which
qualifies it a ebay turbo kit no oh they
think this this was actually not a turbo
kit at all we reading we started we
started by buying a turbo kit but then
we found out nothing fit because it
wasn't for my car so then I welded my
MIG welded my own manifold I made my own
down pipe and trust me it look like it -
it was like all cannibalized and I
didn't was crying down any of the welds
and it leaked like crazy but long story
short I took it out and raced a Honda
s2000 with it and kept cranking the
boost up until I got to 14 pounds and
the engine absolutely grenaded it about
120 miles an hour
oil blue everywhere up over the
windshield down under the car antifreeze
a thousand feet behind me and I
to the side of the road and a cop
immediately pulled in right behind me
and asked me if anything was wrong you
know sir that's a feature I literally
just had to play stupid through the
whole thing I'm like are ruined but they
called they call the tow truck for me
and then the tow truck driver the entire
home read me the riot act about how
stupid I was for being a little ricer
and turbocharging that car he was right
this one comes from Dan Robards on
Twitter he says Jerry is it true that
you were laid off by Microsoft though
inspired no no no real truth when he
comes in it no no that's funny because
everybody keeps saying I was fired no I
wasn't fired what happened was Microsoft
laid off the entire test division for
Windows I was inside of that division so
I got laid off all my peers got laid off
except for people that were here on a
visa and my boss got laid off and even
his boss got laid off so it was like an
entire division in one day so in the
difference between being laid off and
fired is they basically gave me a
severance package and told me to go home
Tyler Baron says who do you think can
outdrink the other there's a difference
between outdrink and hold your liquor
that's true I think I could actually out
drink J but I'm a huge lightweight I
would be I'd be on call you just like to
lace all your alcohol with drugs
thirty minutes pretty much yeah I am I'm
a bit of a lightweight I don't hold my
own my alcohol very well so doesn't take
much to get me there doesn't take much
to get me there but man when I'm there
am i oh wait girl you can put it down
pretty good the last drunk talk and link
in the video description probably maybe
yeah oh this is a good one so it's a
world of Wayne actually out world of
Wayne UK says what are your wives think
of all your antics I'm gonna let you
take this one you know it's funny when
we get together whether it be me his
place or him here they tend to disappear
Jerry's wife isn't here right now but my
wife is pretty tolerant she's had 16
years of being used to me and she's
pretty used to the the craziness that
comes out when I get around my friends
but yes she's a great caretaker in those
instances especially when she has to
hold my hair back when I'm throwing up
in the toilet I I would have to say that
my wife is very much the same she knew
what she was getting into when she
married with me here we are twelve
twelve years later this is how you know
you have a keeper is when they can see
the antics and still want to be around
you yeah she's questioning the whole
marrying me thing but she hasn't gone
against the
so listen this this is progress it's
what comes from miles Robert on Twitter
he says would you guys ever live in the
same house or could you stand to live
together or be neighbors
he means neighbors have been neighbors
of neighbors we never see I'd love to be
your neighbors didn't we let's know
you've known as then I'll NAB you bro
wait a minute I shall cut that out no
don't okay I think we could I think we
could live together because I think both
of us have a pretty good idea of when
we're getting on the other's nerves and
know when to back off just a little bit
not too much just a little bit we've
actually gone through all the phases
together it's like a married couple
really we have we've fought we've
recovered we probably held each other's
hair while puking we've taken each other
probably to bed you care to be
downstairs drunk yeah exactly how much
you would not have made it downstairs
alive if it wasn't for me we were at PDX
and if you have good I left the group to
go and and hang out with you watch TV at
1:00 a.m. and we're always bitching
about like supporting each other in the
YouTube thing and yeah we're an old
married couple we always we absolutely
should not live together ever under any
circumstance it would be yeah and I take
everything you can have 50% of nothing
so the next and last question we're
gonna take is from a keel actually the
at the a keel Aurora
wow it sounds like royalty look that's
royalty right there so he asks are you
guys ever jealous of each other's setup
you know I used to be pretty jealous of
the room space that Jerry had how big
his room was and how biggest monitors
were and and just was kind of envious of
look man I've got to make all this work
in this tiny little room but this year
this year I'm not so jealous of of the
space this guy I think that's where the
jealousy kind of turned a little
especially since you're here right now
yeah the truth is I was never really
jealous in the beginning of Jays setup I
was jealous more of his ability is his
editing abilities as lighting abilities
I mean the blue god bless my credibility
it's ten times okay it's the weight
losing abilities I guess we could go
over ours about this but now I that's
change Jays effective use of space and
how he call or ghen eyes he is and how
everything is set up so that he can
actually
didn't do his job and get out versus me
where it's like climbing over stuff and
trying to find cables every five seconds
I am absolutely 100% jealous of this
which means I need to get my ass in gear
he hasn't even been in the shop yet
here's a minute up yet haven't even in
the shop yeah I've still got more to see
I lived that lifestyle man you've been
to the other house where the hallway was
storage and the living room was storage
and yeah I mean I had to make everything
work in this entire channel and a 8 foot
place yeah by 9 foot room let's be
honest we flip-flopped a lot throughout
this whole YouTube career like there was
times where you were ahead there's times
where I was ahead whether it be viewers
subscribers all over the place we we
were unofficially competitive you know
what I think has helped all of that is
since you and I've started people have
come up from the rear and past us big
time since we started like sure you guys
better than this true we try to get our
meat hooks into as fast as possible so
we can pull the whole you OS card later
on at least that's what I'm doing are
you doing that - no but I always
remember that we were the one that
actually gave what's-her-face were
started
oh you mean Simone Simone Simone Mertz
tamang guts gets Gertz is he good I was
yes yes yes we're probably butchering
the hell out of this thing but Simone
were hella proud of you she is now the
co-host on tested opposite of norm Chan
and does a lot of projects and stuff
Arduino just tweeted her out today dude
everybody's been like on everything she
does she did the breakfast machine and a
lot of the robot stuff we're incredibly
proud of her an it was awesome because
we were like the first we were the first
show that yeah like yeah like 200 or no
here like three or four thousand subs
dude she do up absolutely up so I would
say that's one of my prouder moments
like yeah we're gonna every now and then
every now and then we when we help
someone out that turns out to actually
be good for the community I'm like you
know what yeah I'm okay that I was a
rung in that ladder yep so Simone when
we're both failing horribly we will we
will shamefully and when she's when
she's the new main host of Mythbusters
reloaded Mythbusters reloaded we believe
it just would you consider us like I'll
even be like Jessie or I'm only on like
three shows I'll be a key grip I'll just
hold the mic that's fine yeah I'm not
about craft services come at us you know
leave some food for the actors man
pulling fat jokes Oh whole time I've
been here it's been one
man think of it hey the 30 piece was my
idea
alright guys well hey if you wanted more
of these questions and you're like oh no
it's over already head on over to his
channel no does my channel do you
remember it's at Bernard Barclays
nerdgasm right no it's at Barclays one

recorded this Thursday before Tech Talk
