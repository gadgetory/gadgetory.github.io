of 2013 i am your host JS two cents and
with CES right around the corner next
week starting on tuesday i will of
course be at CES bringing you some of
the latest news regarding the brand new
technology coming out in 2013 before we
get started there's two things I want to
go ahead and mention one check out the
shirt my favorite shirt ever right here
I'm a Jason Voorhees fan and if you're
wondering what this shirt is this is a
jason mask made up of all of the
different weapons that he's used
throughout all of the different movies
of the entire Friday the 13th series
best shirt ever and secondly right on
the heels of my microphones for youtube
video I decided instead of using my Yeti
for this show I'm going ahead and using
the four dollar microphone just to show
you how well you can actually work with
the audio at such a cheap price point
and not to mention I need to get the
practice because this is what I'm going
to be using to do the audio at CES so I
figured what would be more appropriate
than bringing you a special pregame
edition of tech addiction where we talk
about the most anticipated gadgets being
unveiled at CES 2013 okay so getting
things started like I said we were going
to during the intro I am going to bring
you the top 12 most anticipated gadgets
at CES this year one of the things at
CES is really known for is thats
unveiling a brand-new phone and TV
technology it always seems to be the
main theme at CES so get ready because
the top 12 items i'm about to bring you
are gonna be mostly TV and phone related
but some of its really cool so please
stick around and check it out coming in
at number one we've got samsung's brand
new Smart TV it's got some features kind
of like the Kinect where you can wave
your hand to move around different menus
and it's also voice-activated you may
have seen the iJustine commercial where
she did a demonstration of this TV for
samsung this could be kind of
interesting though if you think about it
where if you don't have to use a remote
control and it's all hand activated and
voice activated what would the arguments
over the TV channel be like in your
household these could definitely get
interesting with this TV if you are the
wife or vice versa want to watch two
different shows and you're competing for
the TV over the loudness of your volume
I want to watch cops well I want to
watch death for half-life disra
housewives isn't even on anymore but
there's still reruns that's the
stupidest show that Evers been on TV
you're the stupidest man I ever married
why don't you marry somebody else
probably should have listened to my
mother coming in at number two we've got
google TV Google TV is a major
competitor to Apple TV and they've
already announced some major vendors
that have jumped on board with Google TV
like LG Vizio hisense a sous and a whole
lot more and they're going to be
displaying some of their brand new
google TV features at this year's 2013
CES they've also mentioned that there's
going to be a whole line of set-top
boxes as well as full feature TVs in CES
2012 we saw several tvs that were
featuring four thousand horizontal
pixels but this year since everyone's
making the push for home theaters we're
going to see a whole lot of TVs here
that are featuring that 4k or that four
thousand p horizontal picture rating
it's the highest definition standard
right now available for TVs but it's not
going to be entirely mainstreaming until
we start seeing more mainstream and more
affordable displays at this pixel
resolution not to mention the lack of
video players right now they're actually
able to push this pixel resolution but I
have a feeling that 2013 and beyond
we're going to start seeing 1080p be the
lowest standard available in 720p is
going to go right out the window this is
really exciting for all you
high-definition bucks because things are
definitely going to be getting a whole
lot more high definition where you're
going to have a hard time distinguishing
between the TV and reality so Samsung is
planning on debuting a bendable LCD
screen for their smartphones they're
tired of everybody complaining about
broken glass when they drop their phones
so they're going to be showing us a
phone at this year's CES where you can
bend the screen and it won't crack
whatsoever this is not brand new
technology this was actually debuted a
couple of years back but it was more of
a concept and it was too expensive for
anybody to mass-produce but this year in
Las Vegas they're going to be showing
you this screen in full and I'm planning
on bringing you some hands-on footage of
this display at CES syntel is best known
for making his desktop and laptop
processors and completely dominating the
performance market when it comes to pcs
but entails really looking at branching
out being stuck in that box of desktop
and laptop processors and are now
developing mobile processors for tablets
and smartphones and you're going to
start seeing a lot more smartphones in
2013 that are being powered by Intel but
Apple better get ready to really step it
up because the performance numbers some
of these android driven intel-powered
phones are looking very very impressive
and I can't wait to get hands on with
this stuff in CES because it looks very
very promising and with an
like Intel backing your mobile hardware
I think things are really getting ready
to step up for Android and it's going to
get really really ugly in the smartphone
ring for anybody not running these Intel
processors and this could be a good
thing because more competition in the
field means lower pricing which means
lower prices for the consumer so far now
we've all probably heard that Windows 8
is nothing more than a tablet software
poured it to a pc to allow for a single
platform between mobile and full scale
systems so it's no surprise that this
year at CES there's a lot of
anticipation between hybrid machines
where you can take a tablet and plug it
into a dock and it turns into a full
based PC with keyboard mouse and the
whole deal and when you're ready to
leave you just undock it and off you go
and when you need to move you just
undock it and off you go and all your
work goes with you there's already been
a few commercials out on TV displaying
this sort of Windows 8 tablet but we're
going to see a whole range of
manufacturers now outside of just
Microsoft building tablets that run on
windows 8 and incorporate this sort of
mobile full-scale operating system
features I'll be bringing you some
hands-on footage of these particular
devices this year at CES I'm not a major
fan of windows 8 yet on the desktop
because there are some problems and some
driver compatibilities the Windows 8 is
definitely showing a whole lot of
promise when it comes to the future and
I can't wait to see what kind of things
Microsoft comes up with for their
desktop systems but in the meantime I'm
going to go ahead and hold off for
service pack 1 because when it comes to
brand new operating systems I am just a
big scaredy cat coming in at number 7 is
the entire phablet craze that's a phone
tablet things like the galaxy note in
the galaxy note 2 it seems that this
craze just simply won't die where people
want to walk around with a giant five
and a half inch screen in their pocket
but it's kind of the best of both worlds
if you're not looking for a tablet but
you want to get more done on your phone
and use it more like your laptop or you
just want more productivity on the go so
this year we're going to see a lot more
phablet phones I hate saying that word
it just feels weird to say phablet
phablet i will have a phablet please
sounds like some sort of a delicacy I
would have a fab it with kitchen sony is
one of the tech giant's this year at CES
that are anticipated to bring you a few
more phablet phones and who knows where
this is going to go in 2013 but it seems
like the craze is just to walk around
with the bigger and badder phone and not
just when it comes to performance but
the actual size of the phone no no I'm
just doing tech addiction right now but
I can talk what's up at the 2012 CES
HTC at unveiled the droid DNA which was
the very first smartphone on the planet
to feature a native 1080p screen however
through all of 2012 none of the other
major smartphone manufacturers seemed to
follow suit and it became the standard
to introduce phones with 720p screens
even the larger screens like the galaxy
s3 or the note 2 we're only featuring
720p screens but some of the rumors for
this year's CES are that companies like
sony and LG are going to be unveiling an
entire line of 1080p native resolution
smartphones I'll be hands-on with that
as well and I'll be bringing you full
reviews of phones that are coming out in
2013 from major manufacturers the Nokia
Lumia 920 is one of the first
smartphones to feature wireless charging
technology and this year at CES we're
expecting a whole new line of products
from all sorts of major manufacturers
that are featuring native wireless
charging technology this is a really
neat technology that I am looking
forward to where you just take your
phone and you set it down on a pad and
it starts wirelessly charging it can
take a little bit longer to charge a
phone in this method but it's a lot more
convenient to just set your phone down
and have a charge rather than fumbling
with cables are running to the other
room because you only have one cable
because you bought an iphone 5 and it
uses the damn lightning port and you had
like 1600 standard 30 pin connectors and
none of them work and you're too cheap
to spend thirty dollars on a 30-pin to
lightning adapter because apples ripping
us all off great thanks Apple appreciate
that coming in at number 10 for this
year's CES most anticipated tech gadgets
is the smart home all of your device's
refrigerator lights air conditioner
heater TVs fireplace phones alarms are
all connected to a central server let's
say you leave the house and you forget
to turn off your heater you can just log
in and turn it off that type of
technology already exists but companies
like Google really want to take the home
and turn it into an entirely wirelessly
controlled giant super gadget this is
really cool technology and always loved
the idea of a fully automated home but I
just don't know what that means for
hackers because right now people can
hack your cell phone signals they can
hack your NSC credit cards your garage
clickers it just make it really makes
you wonder if how secure this type of
technology could really be because
hackers today are really sophisticated
and now to get full access to everything
in your home they would simply just have
to hack that system so I think until
something like
this can really become mainstream the
security level of it really really needs
to be there it's a little bit of a scary
thought but the convenience factor of it
it's very very interesting if I can get
a hold of a rep at this year's CES I'm
definitely going to ask them what they
think about the security factor of a one
hundred percent smart controlled home
number 11 on the most anticipated tech
gadgets of CES 2013 is the self-driving
automobile we already know companies
like Google again Google's looking to
fully automate your house now they want
to fully automate your car where the car
will drive itself just like every
futuristic movie that's ever come out
where the car is driving itself and
you're sitting there having a
conversation and everything is being
done one hundred percent by computer
other giants like Toyota and Audi are
going to be apparently unveiling their
fully operational self-driving cars and
are apparently going to be doing a
demonstration I'm gonna do the best I
can to get into this arena who knows how
busy it's going to be but I think it's
very interesting to see what they come
up with we don't know yet what cars and
implemented this in we don't know if
they're going to be brand new concept
cars or if they've taken a car like the
Prius and retrofitted it with this brand
new technology but the idea of
self-driving fully automated cars is
kind of neat but you have to ask
yourself what kind of amenities have to
be what kind of retrofits have to be
done to the roads to accommodate this
sort of thing not to mention I don't
know if I would fully trust my safety or
the safety of my family to a fully
automated self-driving car we all know
the features heading that direction and
of course them and of course the unknown
is always scary but this is going to be
a pretty cool demonstration and I'm
going to try to get there and bring you
a first-hand look at the world's first
fully automated self-driving vehicle and
topping off the list that number 12 of
the most anticipated tech gadgets being
unveiled in Las Vegas at the 2013 CES is
the brand-new free open-source ubuntu
smartphone operating system they've
already published a very lengthy
demonstration the new smartphone
operating system and like Android it
runs on linux and it's fully open source
it's much more open than iOS however
it's much more polished than android so
it's really interesting to see where
it's going to kind of fit in in the
smartphone arena however with companies
like Apple and Google already having a
firm grasp on the smartphone community
it's going to be really hard to get
manufacturers like LG or Sony or HTC to
really open up and offer a device for
this type of product it does look really
exciting it doesn't really neat
I'm going to get hands on with this
device at CES a lot of people are really
looking forward to this especially
people who just don't like any of the
three options that are out there now and
those options being of course Windows
Phone Android and iOS the real test for
a bunt too is going to be how friendly
they can make their software developer
kitson and just how open and friendly
their market is going to be it's also
going to be very difficult to get
consumers to jump on board with a brand
new operating system like you bunt to
because there's not going to be very
many apps in the App Store available for
it but just like android android came
into the scene after iOS already had
hundreds of thousands of apps in their
market and looking Android today android
today has flourished it's a full feature
phone and it definitely holds its own
against iOS and all of the Apple fans so
if a bond to can get a consumer backing
and they can get developers that are
willing to develop apps and games and
other sorts of cool interactions with
the phone who knows maybe a bun two
would be the phone that can finally come
in and fill the gap between the three
phones that we currently have today so
there you have it the top 12 most
anticipated gadgets being unveiled at
2013 of Consumer Electronics Show I'm
going to bring you as much information
as I can regarding these devices it's
going to be four days of non-stop tech
addiction hands on gadgets brain
boggling to be four days of constant
mind-numbingly brand new gadget
technology i'm not going to know where
to start i'm not gonna want to go home
at the end i'm gonna stop my feet I'm
gonna kick and I'm gonna scream and I'm
gonna say I don't want to leave I don't
want to leave I want to take everything
home with me I can't wait to see what be
given out at CES a lot of these vendors
give out some really cool swag they
really want to get the consumer excited
about their products so if anythings
given to me they're not really
interested in looking at keeping maybe
we'll turn it into a giveaway maybe JS
two cents will do a CES themed giveaway
