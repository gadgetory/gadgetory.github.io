see right here is the second form of the
Rison 2700 X system I built the other
day that we did the air conditioning
test on remember I said the reason why I
built that was because we're gonna test
the new RT X cards on the rise and
platform as well as Intel so that you
guys can get eight you know apples to
oranges experience I guess because of
course there are people that reside on
both sides of that fence I ended up
moving it over to the EVGA DG 77 case
because yeah I used Gorilla Glass or
Gorilla Tape on the plexiglass for the
fractal design define s and ya residue
stuck to it and then the process of
trying to get it off I scratched the
glass all of the plexi all up so yeah
I'm shallow and I can't deal with that
what are you doing shopping for a case
from when you build what are you looking
for I want something designed for water
cooling fractal design define s all the
way check it out
plenty of airflow plenty of open
interior for water cooling radiator
support it even has mounts for your red
dwarfs I don't have enough room for my
hard drives okay
fractal design r5 look at all those hard
drive cages and you can fit your
radiators and water cooling in here no I
got a lot of hard drives but I also have
an e ATX motherboard okay I'm gonna try
something here okay bear with me you
might wanna stand clear never actually
tried this before
yeah it works fractal design defined r6
you can fit all your radiators a
crap-ton of hard drives and if it's a
ATX did this is perfect
nailed it something else I did for the
2700 X was I also used our Celsius s 36
triple 120 millimeter fan with some ek
Vardar RGB fans which is making all the
RGB puke go on in there just so that we
can keep the CPU very cool while we do
all of our testing and yes that should
be ready to go we also removed the
manual 4 gigahertz locked clock speed so
hopefully that will ramp up in the
future when we do our testing but that's
besides the point the reason why this
system exists is because I'm asked so
much over the last week or two ever
since nvidia held its key note about our
TX about whether or not they should
upgrade their systems I'm getting set PC
part picker at lists and there and
they're mixing and matching components
and they're not and and they're not
compatible and I know that's because you
know normally PC part picker will tell
you if it's compatible or not but people
are also making their own lists and
they're they're just there's problems I
don't want to address this now because
I'm trying to avoid people having to
deal with wasting their money and have
RMA returns or just product returns and
if you've already opened it and it turns
into a nightmare trust me so I'm trying
to hit a lot of that off now one of the
reasons why our TX launch is so
important is not just because Nvidia is
launching new graphics cards but because
this is the first time that I can recall
in a long time where a new CPU lineup
and platform is launching almost
parallel with the new graphics cards and
that seems like a very opportune time
for many people to upgrade their systems
for many reasons one when RT X launches
cask L is still a very very relevant GPU
platform in fact we've seen many people
say screw our TX we're sticking with
Pascal there's no point etc etc you
cannot deny the power of Pascal it's it
compels you the power of Pascal compels
you I went there and we came back
okay but obviously when a new graphics
card lineup launches the people that
want early adopt are going to sell their
current stuff at a very discounted rate
on very various platforms like tops
hardware or hard OCP Craigslist wherever
and you can find some killer deals
because they're just trying to make some
money back on their bleeding edge
purchase of new hardware which also
makes their wallet bleed so you can find
some really good deals that way also -
because we have a new Intel launch
coming with the z3 90 as well as the
9900 K now all of this has leaked slash
rumor information but it's pretty
credible at this point they've also
talked about their new notebook lineup
for Intel 9th gen that means you're
gonna be able to find some great deals
on z3 7 - stuff as well as 8700 KS or
people upgrading from older hardware
like 6700 K or 7700 K which aren't
amazing platforms that are still great
for gaming productivity and general use
so this is a good time for PC building
this time last year we were making
videos about how much right now it
sucked building computers and now this
is a great time RAM prices have come
down significantly not back to where
they should be but they've come down
quite a bit
GPU pricing has normalized and we have
new graphics cards coming from Nvidia
and a new lineup coming from Intel first
thing I want to talk about real quick is
the 9900 K or the 8 core 16 thread Intel
ninth gen AI 9 processor is not an X 299
CPU I have seen a few PC part picker
lists where people are putting X 299
motherboards in there and then they're
just leaving like a manually written
spot with you know for the 99 hundred K
it is a Z 390 it is a it's a it's a mid
series platform like it's slight
improvement it's still the 14 nanometer
they're calling it 14 + + + because it's
the third iteration of 40 nanometer
coming from Intel and I I can see right
now people are going to be confused by
this because the 900 or the 9900 is
something you only saw an X 299 or you
saw the next 99 with like the 69 50 X
and then the 9 usually would refer to
you know the
but usually anything with a nine in it
like that indicates it is an HP DT or a
high-performance desktop X 99 X $2.99 or
you know an AMD it would be pretty
obvious the X 1950 X 1920 X is a thread
Ripper so people are going to be
confused about that but we're gonna go
and move into the topic right now of
should you upgrade and is this the time
well it automated leap well that
ultimately depends on what you currently
have and what your computer is being
used for and how much time is taking to
do it because this question although the
hardware is over is always changing and
we tackled this topic at least twice a
year sometimes three times I guess the
third time I've done it this year what
has never changed is my answer and that
is what are you doing with your system
because here's the reality unless your
system specs are so far below the
minimum requirements of any of the
software games that you're playing it
can do anything you want it to do a
potato PC can render videos app attend o
piece of puppet end oh that's it's
Nintendo's new launched gosh I just
leaked that one great here we go right
it the potato PC could render a 4k video
but it might take 20 hours to render a
five-minute video so the question is is
your computer doing what you wanted to
do as fast as you want it to do it if
the answer is no then there is your
bottom line black or white yes or no
answer for you but what you should
upgrade to that's the harder part right
when it comes to gamers and that and
that seems to be a huge focus of people
because are you ready for this building
a great gaming PC more often than not
makes a great workstation PC now when it
comes to gamers it is extremely hard to
deny the value and performance you get
out of Rison we're accustomed to the
prior to the launch of rise n of saying
AMD is a great value but not necessarily
the greatest performance where ever Tom
at the FX platform because you could get
an FX 8320 or an 83 50 then they
upgraded a little bit later to the 83 70
and then you could say it's a great
value but it's a dead end piece of
hardware it has no upgrade path and its
performance is well lackluster at best
depending on the GPU that you use with
it now you get great value in the high
performance arena which is something AMD
has made a huge splash in the market and
as much as you maybe
biggest Intel fanboy in the world and
people would accuse me of being such and
we have Intel systems around here as
much as anyone else you cannot deny that
Intel has changed its entire roadmap
because of Rison just two years ago
Intel would tell you that a 6-quart 12
thread main stream CPU wasn't possible
because of the package size the 14
nanometer the focus temperature and just
the requirements of of the package it
had to go to HP DT it had to go on x99
it had to go on you know the big dot
fast forward now two years we have the
9900 K coming which is an 8 core 16
thread 14 nanometer main stream
processor that is going to be available
simply because AMD took the more core
more threads approach and a very
improved IPC over FX which made Intel
realize like hey the audience realizes
we've been lying to them all along very
rarely does anyone need X 299 and very
rarely does anyone need X 399 or thread
Ripper or any of that stuff if you are
like us we have two main editing rigs in
this studio one is the next to 99 s 79
60 X and the other one is a 1920 X 3
dripper which I should really just put
the 1950 X in there but I digress both
of those are amazing at what they do in
rendering videos extremely quickly both
of us can render 4k videos in about real
time that is important for us but if
you're just an average consumer that
makes videos for fun and you do some
live streaming and stuff the added cost
of going to that platform which is now
in the more than $1,000 for CPU and
motherboard probably isn't going to make
much sense and going with something like
a 2700 x8 core 16 thread or even in
1,800 x8 core 16 thread with 16
gigabytes of RAM will get the job done
very very efficiently and you're not
going to be paying literally out the ass
for that platform and all of this can
apply to GPUs as well are the games that
you're playing are you playing them at
the resolution you want at the FPS that
you want but before you do that there's
something you need to take in mind have
you thought about your panel lately you
know your panel has the final say and
what your gaming experience is is your
panel causing input lag because of
you're running at 1080p 60 Hertz
non-free sync or non g-sync panel that
has a
slow response time and your GPU and your
CPU are waiting for the panel to be
ready for the next frame which is then
causing your inputs to fall behind the
frames that are currently being drawn
that's input lag by the way then your
panel is probably what's ready to be
upgraded because if you are pushing
greater than the refresh rate of your
panel with your GPU then it's time to
buy a higher refresh rate panel rather
than upgrading anything inside of your
Tower
now this also works as a system like I
just said so if you are one of those
people that have a high refresh rate
panel available up to 240 Hertz now by
viewsonic I believe it is 240 Hertz
eSports like csgo or whatever the high
refresh rate gaming if you have a panel
that can push those types of frames but
your system is nowhere close even be
able to utilize that level of FPS then
it's probably gonna be time to upgrade
your system as well now something to
keep in mind is that Intel does edge out
AMD when it comes to max frame rates but
there's also the other side of that coin
when it comes to FPS where if you're if
you're gaming at 4k and not 1080p or
1440p and all you care abouts 4k
everything turned on and 60fps then you
can usually get away with a very
high-end graphics card and a mid-range
GPU because you are asking way more of
your graphics card to handle all of that
post-processing and your CPU has very
little to do with the average FPS at
that point then you can get away with
probably holding off on your CPU and
spending your money and upgrading your
GPU but this video guys it's just food
for thought this was not a video
designed to answer your question it's
designed to give you back some questions
that might help you determine what is
right for you in the future it's the way
I've always approached this question and
it's a way that I always will now
obviously you guys don't know whether or
not RTX is worth it yet none of us do
because we are still waiting on
performance figures which we will be
giving you and that's one of the reasons
why the system exists is because I
insist now because this is the new this
is the first GPU launch from Nvidia that
is during a time when there are two very
relevant cpu platforms to consider so
we're gonna be doing it like I said on
both Rison and on Intel and we're gonna
see just how much performance variance
there is there because there are
obviously AMD fanboys Intel fanboys and
then there are the
reside in the middle that would consider
either platform depending on the
performance that they provide ami guys
we're gonna go thanks for watching if
there's anything you would like to
contribute to this conversation please
comment in the comments down below or
take the discussion over to Twitter at
Jay's two cents and don't forget
speaking of gpus we are giving away a
graphics card at the end of this month
where you the winner get to choose which
card you want from our inventory of
graphics cards but disclosure r-tx is
not a part of that obviously we need
those cards around here for future
testing nice try I saw some of you
saying I would totally get a twenty atti
that's not on the list so alright you
guys are gonna go thanks for watching
and as always I'll see you in the next
one and so I got it I gotta go
downstairs so I'm gonna pick the
elevator and you can handle this while
I'm going hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
