seems like the scandals scandalous
whatever you want to call it just
continues I mean recently with the
strike that was applied to Kyle there
was the strike that was applied to
lioness last year and we nearly got our
own strike for simply wanting to give
you guys something for free so we're
going to talk about that today and then
a little plea from you guys to to help
us come up with some content ideas for
later this year cuz we kind of want to
shake it up we want to shake that tree a
little bit and see what falls out
hopefully it's a nut strikes with its
aluminum bezel solid construction and
adjustable base the vast 35 inch ultra
wide 100 Hertz VA panel for mass drop
offers performance at an affordable
price learn more about this drop by
following the link in the description
below so as some of you have probably
noticed the link in our giveaway for the
BLD giveaway that we did last week or
whatever whatever you guys I don't know
days are all blur because I just moved
anyway that's besides the point I
digress we did the giveaway or launched
a giveaway video with the gleam link
which is what we've been using for years
now to kind of control the contest and
what I mean by control the contest it's
to make sure that things are kept fair
gleam has a very good way of determining
which are the spoof accounts the spam
accounts the multiple accounts that are
created in an effort to kind of
circumvent measures to keep it fair for
the giveaway and usually when we do
these giveaways we'll have anywhere
between a hundred thousand to maybe
three or four hundred thousand entries
because usually there's two or three
ways to enter my giveaways unlike some
people
that would totally abuse the gleam
system and have 25 different ways to
enter that you could do daily making it
have millions of entries really reducing
your chances of winning because it's
like unless you're gonna follow an
Instagram and follow on Vimeo and follow
on Twitch and find all this stuff which
I never required by the way then it just
got so big it was it was easy to for
those measures and people to cheat so
usually we do these giveaways I'd see
you know a hundred thousand or so maybe
two hundred thousand entries it would
give me a list of about ten thousand of
them that were considered suspicious and
we give you reasons as to why and
usually it was because of duplicate IPs
and
duplicate user names like worth one
number difference and that sort of thing
and so you could keep things as fair as
possible so something we've always done
news for years in fact fullscreen
partnered with gleam years ago to give
us that platform to be able to hold our
public contests and giveaways and stuff
to make it just easy because back in the
way the way we used to do it back in the
day we'd use a company or website called
random.org and what you can do with
random.org is you could just put in
there grab a list of comments on this
video and put in a link or if you use
the hashtag on twitter for the giveaway
like hashtag jays two cents giveaway
anyone that ever tweeted what that
hashtag would be automatically entered
because we could tell it go grab all the
entries from those hashtags randomize it
give me one winner and that was how you
verify it but the problem is there was
no way to determine how people were
cheating with that because it just
randomly grabbed an entry so we stopped
using random.org a long time ago in lieu
of glean well fast-forward a few years
what sort of been happening is YouTube
as you guys have noticed has been really
kind of falling behind in terms of tools
as the channel has grown as the platform
has grown so have a lot of these
contests and stuff and YouTube has no
mechanism whatsoever for us to be able
to run these giveaway so we turn to
third parties like glean the issue is
that even on twitch there when you do
giveaways in the chat and stuff like
that has built-in tools so that you can
manage the giveaways and not have any
problems with trying to keep it fair and
you can do it with live viewers and all
that sort of stuff
so we turn to gleam and apparently
somewhere along the lines instead of
YouTube wanting to give us the tools to
be able to host these contests and stuff
on our channel they've decided to make
it harder for us to use tools being
provided by third parties allowing us to
be able to host these giveaways so
here's where we are today the reason why
the link is no longer in that video is
because less than 24 hours of me putting
up that giveaway the I got an email from
YouTube saying that the link was
reported now that means somebody
watching the video went and reported the
link that means some asshat out there
was like Jays doing giveaway and I don't
like it so they reported it probably
because they were too dumb to not read
the comments and see that
actually opened it up worldwide because
one of the first complaints was that it
wasn't a worldwide giveaway and the
reason why I usually do that with
something like a system is more often
than not the person that would win the
system would be hit with like anywhere
between $500 to $1,000 worth of a tax
bill just to receive the component we're
not gonna pay that obviously because we
have don't have a mechanism for that and
then in order for us to stay legal and
compliant we can't list it as a free
gift with a zero dollar value so we
can't do that because then that's not
legal on our end so we decided to go
ahead and open it up worldwide NZXT was
gracious enough to do that because NZXT
supplied the pc and then we're hit with
this reported link from gleam and
basically what they said was we found
your link to be in violation of our
Terms of Service on YouTube we've
decided not to take action at this time
however if a link appears on this video
again we are going to hit you with a
strike now a strike is a major deal for
YouTube because one it removes you from
the recommended channels lists you no
longer become a preferred channel and
and when it comes to the Adsense and
stuff like that which is a huge chunk of
how we make our income around here too I
can pay my employees they can pay their
bills we pay our bills as a company
obviously my livelihood as well - you
lose all live streaming functionality
which I don't really use that often but
still it puts you in a negative standing
on YouTube and it affects everything ask
Kyle it can affect your video standings
it can affect your views it can affect
everything because YouTube will no
longer push your content like it would
before because it now looks at you as a
liability and a risk so that's why the
link disappeared from that video and I
basically said go to my Twitter to find
out what's going on because I just
basically said look I don't know how to
do this now the giveaway is still gonna
happen all the entries that were in
there are still there but I don't know
how best to proceed with this now to
stay in compliance with YouTube and
still stay with the fairness and the
spirit of this giveaway so the problem
is YouTube they look at this as a fake
engagement creator when you put a link
like this you're having all these people
come to your channel you're having them
like video you having them watch videos
and they're calling that fake engagement
here's the problem with my give
way and why this really needed to be
reviewed by a human which is something
we've talked about forever YouTube and
Google rely entirely on AI for like 99%
of these claims and these reports before
a human gets involved which is why a
lioness as well but which is why Kyle
got a strike and then had to get it
repaired a day or two later because a
human never reviewed it it just
automatically you're guilty until we
determined that you're not the same
thing applies here because what they
said was that it forces fake engagement
the problem is I had four entries for I
had four entries on this giveaway none
of them were required one was go to
Twitter one was following Twitter one
was go to my youtube channel and just
have a look at it and then there was one
that was like tweet about the giveaway
or whatever none of it was required none
of it was mandatory but they said it was
promoting fake engagement on YouTube the
problem is the only way you would have
ever seen the link to begin with because
I didn't even put the link in my Twitter
was to be on my YouTube channel already
watching the video telling you about the
giveaway so how that could be fake
engagement considering you're already on
the channel is beyond me so I have no
idea so what we're gonna do right now is
I'm gonna go ahead and put that link on
my Twitter and you guys can go and find
it I think it's pretty obvious what my
twitter name is gonna be I'm not gonna
put a link to it down below
although YouTube does allow you to put
your social media links in the header of
your channel so people can click on it
to go to Twitter because what they said
was also a violation is a link that
takes you off the platform but they let
you put links to your social media in
your channel which takes you off the
platform so it's like that's against the
to the Terms of Service here but not
here
so anyway that's the problem with
YouTube this could all be avoided if
YouTube was willing to just give you the
tools you needed for us to be able to do
the things we want to do so this brings
me around to kind of the next point this
is gonna be my last giveaway I've given
away more than a hundred thousand
dollars in product since I started this
channel and I'm extremely proud of that
I mean yeah there may be a lot of
products still sitting behind us but we
have a whole pile of product over there
that's slated for giveaways and a few
things that we're doing like a fire sale
with it said that you guys are going to
kind of suffer from this now because I
refusing to do giveaways anymore in fact
we had a whole nother high-end system
giveaway slated to go right after this
one because you guys know I like to do
giveaways like every quarter and so
that's now been cancelled and I told
them I'm not doing this anymore I'm not
taking the risk we get nothing out of it
really to be honest I mean we don't get
any sort of like spike in channel growth
or anything like that we do these
giveaways because it's fun to get back
to community and it's also nice to get a
little bit of a return out of it maybe
get a little more exposure or Lib get
your name out there get some people to
find your channel but at this point all
you're getting is grief from YouTube
these giveaways are unfortunately on my
channel going to cease to exist but I'll
still do stuff on Twitter so if you guys
want to follow over there I will still
do some some giveaways over there just
haven't decided what yet but that's
that's just I had to make this video
explaining look what why J put up a
giveaway video and then suddenly the
link is gone and then everything's quiet
like what is going as J frauding us as J
being a scam no this is what's happened
and this is how I'm having to handle
this now so if you guys go to my social
media that starts with a T you will find
a link to the giveaway where you can
still continue to enter you've already
entered you're still there you're still
good there's no issues there we're still
gonna be using gleam for this particular
giveaway it's just the link is no longer
existent now one other thing I wanted to
ask from you guys is what kind of
content do you want to see from us do we
like doing builds we like doing the
overclocked challenge we have some major
overclocking stuff we're getting ready
to do with that was it 3975 expert 3175
that's a Big Damn
I want the 3975 no 31 but anyway or
maybe doing some more stuff with that
obviously we've got Computex coming up
in a few months
lots of fun content with us of
philanthropy stuff we're actually doing
a thing with make-a-wish you guys are
gonna see that coming up soon so we got
a lot of fun stuff planned it just kind
of sucks that these wrenches get thrown
into our into the mix on the platform at
which we reside because they can't get
with the time to give us the tools that
we need as content creators so I'm sorry
that this video was such a downer but I
felt like this explanation was was
important and if I had put this out on
Twitter it would have only been seen by
a fraction of people and not the people
that I'm targeting which is my YouTube
audience so anyway guys thanks for
watching make sure you comment down
below with the kind of content you'd
like to see later this year whether it
be build overclocking guides let us
we like to take those and we generate
our ideas based on that so I'm gonna go
guys thanks for watching and yeah good
luck good luck on the giveaway and again
sorry that we're not gonna be doing any
more on this platform in the future you
versus the guy she tells you not to
worry about so that's why the you get to
hear that in high def America</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
