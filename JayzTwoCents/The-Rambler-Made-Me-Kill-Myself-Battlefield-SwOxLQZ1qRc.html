god this guy oh I have no more
experience than you do I just put up
whatever the hell it felt like for the
yes I'm here I only have what what did I
say 57 room videos are a lot more
high-quality in my life all my dogs that
enemy grenade I'm stuck I can't move
flipper
I moved by dying and this thing although
one thing is ticking me off is I'm not
used to the cold I haven't used a corded
no store such a long time I always use
the wireless
well yeah I'm learning that but the
thing is like I've got my laptop on my
lap right now and my mouse pad is
currently being held up by a printer box
and a shoebox on top of that printer box
so the cord hangs down and my and it's
tugging down it's like if it was just if
it was a flat desk and I could give my
mouse and leash I wouldn't I wouldn't
notice it at all but the gravity tug of
the wires suddenly not that wasn't nice
oh I'm moving in less than a week so
obviously I'm not interested I'm not
saying I'm just saying well you dude
partly got a lot more confusing before
that you have to be invited to it like I
just got offered you can make money off
your YouTube video okay I'm in hotel
we're obviously noticing some new
Russian alright what's now it is we're
just gonna not try Kathy she's loud
these fans are unruly oh they haven't
moved from be honest and like I've never
seen this in battlefield before but if
someone literally just sits there in a
dominant I have never in my life seen
the Taliban court display like this they
just sit underground
but my placebo effect in the pool in the
play and bad company - it was you can
fuck it but I don't know I never pay the
Kinect at all
that's actually not really a relevant
statistic because I don't see the game
in meters like I see it like when I'm
looking at something I don't think in my
mind oh that guy is X amount of meters
away from me so my guys you're gonna try
and do like timing of when you're
releasing videos and whatnot I always
hate when people like you know smart guy
watching this series and he only
releases one a day well he does this
whole time you guys probably don't know
what you don't know a lot of guys it's
mean I'm thinking as YouTube name is
right in my head but there's aliases
it's on the tip of my tongue I I would
bet 20 bucks that I'm right you are
wrong I will bet you 20 bucks at Project
X there's no way you are a level 100
service star on your support I would put
40 bucks down well either your game is
full it watch when I actually get a real
job we're at the patient take it anymore
I will be nothing like this one I have
to get a job I really exactly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
