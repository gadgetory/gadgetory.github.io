about to bring you a series of reviews
that is very important to me because
these are parts that were specifically
put together for a gaming PC under a
thousand dollar budget and that's going
to be a different video but the reason
why this video is close to my heart
right there it's because this is a
computer I'm actually building for my
wife miss Jays two cents or mrs. Jays
two cents whatever the correct plural
roll no not plural o plural marriages
but anyway whatever the right term for
and however you say mrs mrs. I think
it's missus I'm way off topic but today
we are going to go ahead and take a look
at the backbone of the build for her and
that is the gigabyte 9 in 990 fxa ud3
motherboard revision 4 all right so the
990 fxa ud3 is not new to my channel in
fact I did 6 computers last year for
various customers where I use this exact
motherboard but we are taking a look at
the revision 4 so if you want to know
the base features of this motherboard
I'm going to go ahead and link and
annotate right now on the screen the
video I did last year where I talk about
the basis of the board or the basics of
the board which are the same on this but
we're going to talk about what's
different with the revision for today
now when it comes to accessories you get
your i/o backplate case badge manuals
QuickStart guide and all that and of
course an SLI bridge but this
motherboard is a little bit different
than the other revisions because they've
beefed up what is already considered
ultra durable I'm gonna go ahead and
undo the bag here so I don't wrinkle it
in your ears now when it comes to the
name ultra durable they certainly are
keeping that line alive not only with
the upgraded PCB on here which we've
already talked about which it inherits
from its predecessors but also it does
continue the tradition of all solid
Japanese capacitors low RDS MOSFETs and
it does have three times the electric
static discharge protection on here
where if you accidentally get some sort
of discharge on the board you have a
very high likelihood of not
damaging your board I don't really
recommend going and trying that though
but if you take a look at just the
overall construction of this it is it's
absolutely gorgeous I do I am a firm
believer in the gigabyte ud3 being the
absolute best bang for buck that you can
possibly get for any FX processor
speaking of FX processor we are going to
be bench testing this motherboard and
doing a complete performance review of
it when the build is together and we'll
talk about how the overclocking was on
this butt and it's going to be using the
FX 8350 in my wife's build so I'm really
excited about that now it does have 108
D be built on sound board it's got eSATA
USB 3.0 s io on the back it's got more
than you would ever really need 5.1
surround sound built in it's got a
gaming nip card in there ps2 connection
it's even got a built-in firewire port
on there I remember the last time I've
used firewire but if I needed one it's
there now if you want to know more about
the base features of this board go ahead
and check out my other video where I
talked about a lot of the features that
are built into this board it's pretty
much the same thing the revision 4
really is mostly just cooling upgrades
when it comes to the motherboard it's
got dual BIOS and all the things that
you'd come to expect and a motherboard
that comes in at $130 price point I
don't think it gets much better than the
ud3 quite honestly I mean they pack so
many features into this thing and they
really don't charge a lot for it and
I've loved the six systems I built last
year not one of them have had a single
problem using this motherboard so I am
very very confident in the durability of
the motherboard so if you're building an
FX system and you want to find a
full-featured motherboard without
breaking the bank and you want to say
below 150 dollars you have to check out
the gigabyte 990 FX ud3 now if you want
to know how this thing is can perform
for overclocking and other functions of
the motherboard you guys are just going
to have to go ahead and stay tuned for
the build video that this is being
featured in as I mentioned for my wife's
desktop as always guys thank you for
checking out this video you know what to
do if you liked it you also know what to
do if you hated it and as always I hope
to see you guys on Twitter and I will
see you in my next video and I'm gonna
stop waving this thing around because
I'm starting to scare myself and I'm
going to accidentally drop it or throw
it and I don't think gigabyte would be
very appreciative of that
then again maybe it would be an
opportunity to show just how durable it
really is
