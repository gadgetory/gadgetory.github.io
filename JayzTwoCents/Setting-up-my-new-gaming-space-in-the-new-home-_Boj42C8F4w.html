home office slash game room / vr room /
echoey room bring high performance
gaming a small footprint together with
the all-new corsair one available with
up to an Intel ninth gen 9900 K
processor and an RT X xx atti this small
PC is capable of big things
convection assisted cooling with
separate loops for the CPU GPU means the
corsair one sucks in the best way
possible to see our review of the new
corsair 1i 160 click the link in a
description below so we got a few things
we're gonna try and get done today and
forgive me for not wearing my lab mic we
are using an on camera mic so you might
hear Phil trip on things you might hear
some handling noise and some reverb I'm
sorry about that
clearly this room it's not like my old
studio where it had bass traps and all
that stuff to stop the echo so I'm sorry
but I've I don't get a lot of time to
game and so when I do like the game the
problem was I had my VR setup which was
also my simulator setup and a skunk
works and there were different rooms and
it was kind of a pain in the ass so my
whole goal with this room which is about
a 12 foot by 12 foot room it's not big
it's not small it's got a high ceiling
the first thing is I do have a ceiling
fan you because I have like 10-foot
ceilings in here so as you can see the
first issue I wanted to make sure I
wasn't gonna have is that I could have a
ceiling fan in here to keep things nice
and cool when I'm gaming but when I'm in
VR I'm not gonna stick my hands in the
fan so as you can see we clearly have a
lot of clearance because I am almost six
foot four with a long reach so that's
kind of nice this is clearly my butter
revolution you guys have seen this in
other videos we've talked about the
Santa tech setup so I'm not going to
talk about this again like what it is
there are videos you can go and check
them out I would say I would link them
below but I always forget just go to my
channel and search phonetic or simulator
and this will come up and you'll see
more about that but my desk if you guys
haven't noticed I like to use
dining-room tables as desks because of
the size of skunkworks
and this being a case labs SMA 8 and the
size of it I need big area to put things
to kind of give you a perspective of how
large this actually is for a desk this
is a 34 inch ultra wide that LG G K 950
F which is the one that I said that I
was like in love with HDR and all that
goodness here it is it's on an arm that
will show you more in a second so this
is the setup right here it's fully cable
managed will kind of show you that in
the back and I need to get my vibe set
up once I started racing in VR I can't
really go back but I'm also thinking
because my coax is right here for my
DirecTV I think I would put a TV right
here to why the heck mount right but if
you look over here this area other than
crap on the floor there's nothing here
normally I would give up the couch or
something for hanging out with friends
or watching TV in my own office but I'm
conflicted because if I'm gonna be doing
to scale room scale VR this is actually
a pretty big area like if I took the
chair and scooted it to the closet
because it is on fun sliders so I can
slide it around then I've got a pretty
big area for a bedroom to do room scale
they are so I'm kind of conflicted on
that I don't think I'm gonna do anything
with that yet but I obviously want to
decorate the wall with some of my racing
photos things up from various track
events and whatnot and that's gonna be
the setup but what I started to talk
about earlier and the reason why I
didn't get to get much gaming done is
because when I would go to game on
skunkworks
it's like okay updates are needed fine
that would take time load the game needs
updates then I would want to play dr and
that was in that note 6:05 setup i had
with the water-cooled 1080i and all of
that that got the least amount of use so
then I would go to play project cars or
something with our racing buddies and as
I hold on guys windows update
project cars update now we're stuck in
update limbo where it's just sitting
there at 30% not doing anything so I
wanted this to all work with one system
than that being skunk works so let me go
ahead and show you guys how I sort of
wired up the desk so that one system
could really kind of control the whole
room so we're going to start with the
monitor you guys saw us talk about this
on our free sink video this is the 34 GK
950 F from LG I wasn't kidding when I
said this is my new favorite daily
driver monitor I took that from the
studio right to my home hooked it up to
my mounted arm it's a 17 well this can
hold 17 pounds the monitor is
significantly less than that I actually
think the arm holds like 22 pounds or
something but the monitor is
significantly less than that so I do
have my DisplayPort 1.4 in here because
we do need it for the 144 Hertz 1440p
ultra wide plus HDR so we need that
amount of bandwidth so I'm using that
cable I do have a long 10-foot USB cable
on here 4 USB 3 so these ports do work
if I need to plug in at the end back
here for any reason here's the power and
it runs through the arm as you can see
the arm is you know full articulating so
I can do anything I want with this which
is really nice
still using the LG sound bar right here
don't remember the model it's one of the
dolby atmos ones but doesn't really
matter I don't listen to this a whole
lot usually used headphones
skunkworks back in the house where it
belongs and you can see I kind of cared
about the cable management here and
believe it or not right now which you
see with the exception of the HMD for my
vibe everything is hooked up here so I
don't have my HDMI hooked up yet so I'll
be undoing these zip ties and bringing a
HDMI to the breakout box so this is
pretty much as tidy as its gonna be and
I kind of like it this way because one
of the things I hated about not using
hubs is the fact that I just was
constantly changing keyboard and mice
and stuff I want to try out different
things and it was a complete pain in the
ass so plugging things in and having
everything's that tied back here or even
using those velcro straps was just a
pain so that's why I'm using two
different where they 7-quart right yeah
7 port USB 3.0 hubs they are powered
hubs so we can plug things in here like
our phones to charge our mice keyboard
and all that sort of stuff it's all
wired under the table we'll show you
that in a second
but I've got another one over here right
in front of Phil as you can see and this
is specifically to plug in my racing
simulator right here so because it's on
that side of the table the racing sim
can just plug into that and stay plugged
in at all times which means what I'm
dealing with updates for like the game
controller because that's how a window
sees the fan text set up as a game
controller so that's always gonna stay
up to date I decided to use the clamp
for the monitor arm kind of going
bouncing around here on a couple
different things because I had an option
I could have taken this guy right here
and again for a $59 arm which you can
buy on Amazon I do have a link very
chilly yet hopefully I were to put that
in there if you are looking for a vase
amount you are not gonna find a better
one for the price of my opinion than
this guy so you can use a clamp like
this which has a built-in wire channel
to kind of keep things nice and tidy and
this gray cable here is a an optical so
I'm using a spit if I could have drilled
right through the table mounted this guy
to the bottom of this had this go
through and then this was clamped on the
bottom of the table like so so the table
would be in between and then it would
probably be a bit more sturdy than it
even is NASPA the thing is I didn't want
to this isn't gonna be a permanent setup
for me for the table so I didn't want to
drill any holes which is also why if you
take a look at the keyboard and mouse
normally like my setup in the office I
have a hole drilled right here and
everything passes through to a hub
underneath the desk these are just zip
tied together up here and going under
skunkworks coming back around and
plugged in right there because again
when I've been done with this and I
actually determine what my full time so
that's gonna be because I don't like the
color I don't the woodgrain color I will
be selling this table with the dining
room chairs and all that stuff that it
originally had because this was my
dining room table before we moved into
the new house we got a new dining room
table this isn't on my desk so I needed
something that was sturdy enough to be
able to hold the weight of skunkworks
which is like 80 pounds and then
everything else including me pounding on
the desk when I keep losing in games
because I suck so that was kind of
important to make sure I overcame that
now welcome to the underside of my table
where things get a little bit more
intimate I'm skating so this is
basically one of those trays that used
to be able to get with the Galant system
from Ikea I don't think you can buy this
anymore but it's just screwed into the
actual tape
the nice thing about this dining room
table is the fact that it's real wood
it's not particle board or pressed MDF
or anything like that it's real wood so
it's real sturdy everything's mounted
under here my power strip you know my
surge protector everything for power
runs to this and then this has one cable
that runs to the wall and then yeah so
it gives me places just sort of shove
things out of the way that don't need to
be tied down keeps things from dangling
on my feet
when you walk into the room you don't
see wires hanging under the desk
everything is right here and on this
side which I haven't tacked it down yet
is the main power cable for skunkworks
as well as our ethernet cable so that's
one of the things we're gonna get done
today we're gonna need that up we're
gonna install the HTC vive I've got some
channel some wire channeling which will
hopefully make that nice and neat as I
mount it to the wall and then hopefully
by the end of this video the simulator
will be running and then we'll show Phil
how to actually drive these water
channels it's the same thing I did this
if you saw my HTC vive set up in my old
house I use these and I go right along
the edge of our window frame here
because they're a lot less obvious so
I'm gonna have the first lighthouse
mounted up here and then it comes
straight down and I come over and then
right to this flow here and worry about
my wall looks like this it's because
it's rim didn't originally have Ethernet
and although this house does have a
ruckus system wired throughout it in the
ceiling for wireless to get rid of dead
spots you only get like 450 to 500
megabit even do 5g and so it's like half
a worm actually came for so one of the
ether nets that go into the great room
come in actually through the ceiling
because this is a second-story up here
come through the ceiling and then drop
over into the great room and down so
what we do is we cut a hole in the
ceiling here grab one of those Ethernet
cut splice
you know two connectors which is not
recommended but we know no other options
be honest and then we drop it down here
cut a hole in the firewall drop it over
here and then so I've got actual wired
Ethernet so now I get my full gigabit or
about 920 megabytes of the gigabit with
all twelve wireless connections that are
constantly running in the house like my
security system my video cameras that
are constant going to my DVR and all
that sort of stuff from my home security
so even with that stuff
sending data to the cloud I still get
like 920 megabytes of that gig with 12
devices running in terms of security so
yeah I'm happy to say the least
but anyway this is just uh like a half
inch channel that you can get from
Lowe's or Home Depot or whatever your
favorite home-improvement store is and
then like I said I just run these right
along the edge of I think it is this way
oh no it's just taking the tape off Oh
all right so clearly we got everything
working as I'm struggling to drive my
zl1 around the Nurburgring but that's
okay this isn't this one isn't there one
hell week so it's not supposed to handle
really good but as you can see the setup
actually wasn't so bad I mean it was
pretty flawless this time in terms of I
think that's kilometers right no that's
not for our we're going very foolish I'm
going to do that everything is tracking
plus I was worried that this lighthouse
up here is gonna be too tall and I was
going to be below it but everything's
working pretty good feel got to drive in
it Phil what do you think I'm a little
too short for this up though but it's
awesome
yeah the fan of text says if you guys
haven't seen that video like I said I'll
try I probably won't make it because
I'll forget but if you just go to my
channel and look up racing simulator or
simulator you'll find it that way so now
I can actually join my racing group at
the Nissan challenge guys that I Drive
with in real life they have an online
racing kind of a little group as well
maybe project cars and the set of course
hood and they drive off track just like
real life
what would I have left to do though
obviously is I have to paint the cable
channeling that I'm using there for the
lighthouses the problem with the
lighthouses quite honestly is they're
black and it got black cables and I've
got light gray walls and so it looks
terrible and although many people are
going to be more function over form I
don't see why you can't have both and
then since I've got a nice new man cave
game room here I obviously want it to
ten this car spins a lot just like your
life um I obviously want it to look good
and pass the wife test as well as my own
test so I'm the repainting those because
I have leftover paint and those channels
which I got you can play get any Home
Depot or Lowe's or any Ace Hardware or
whatever hardware store you may have
local to you and you can see that just
with a little bit of planning you can
make it look good so anyway guys thanks
for watching and this was just a way for
me to get some work done while also
doing something
for myself and with that I'm gonna go
ahead and let the seal wad and crash
dude this part is not like fun to drive
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
