most anticipated PC build of 2018 this
is part 2 of the post Malone beer bongs
and Bentley themed custom build I told
you I'm gonna keep this to a
three-parter so we're gonna get as far
as we can get today and then in the next
video you'll see whatever finish work we
have to do and delivery to the man
himself I don't look like I'm drinking a
beer I'm not actually we're gonna try
and see if we can't incorporate a beer
bong into this my main goal today but
yeah before we do that you know we gotta
pay some bills MSI brings ultrathin
gaming to life at their new GS 65
stealth the four point nine millimeter
bezel 144 Hertz 1080p panel nvidia
graphics and 8th gen intel cpus make the
new GS 65 self a true powerhouse with a
small footprint find out more and how to
preorder by following the link in the
description below so these are the rads
I'm going to be using these are the ek
PE or cool stream PE rads I like these
because they are nice and thick they got
good FBI I have used these radiators
ever since they launched back in like
2014 and I just really appreciate their
cooling capability their cleanliness and
just I feel like the square design works
so well in so many different builds but
we're gonna go ahead and mock up our
radiators here because I need to know
how much space I actually have here and
obviously up here and we have to plan
out our tubing run before we can even
start to consider how to maybe
incorporate a beer can or possible beer
bong and this or whatever I also because
I don't have the fans like I said I want
right now I'm gonna use just regular old
fans to sort of dummy it up in here too
just to sort of get myself all situated
so I know what the distances are that
I'm working with one other thing we're
gonna probably do on this and it might
trigger a lot of people and that's okay
is soft tubing in this build because
once again why not I mean this build is
all over the place and beer bongs I mean
how many people do you see using a rigid
tube beer bomb that wouldn't be very fun
at parties see because I have to route
the wires through this channel although
it's a pretty big channel having only
one would be kind of nice
so some of the problems with dealing
with custom one-off stuff that doesn't
has been prototype is sometimes you kind
of discover a design flaw and I just got
the phone with singularity and
unfortunately this is a design flaw but
it's one that we can easily get past so
the way this all works is you know the
grille mounts on the front you've got
this plate that I'm trying out to damage
the grill here so it's on this box
you got this plate that mounts to the
grill and it's got these perimeter
screws problem is you cannot get to
these to tighten it back on because you
see this channel right here this channel
is what goes here sandwiches the
manifold you cannot get these screws
through there like this if I mount these
down first and try and put it up with
the radiator if I take the met that
plate off which is the way it's actually
meant to go with the grill still
attached to the front and then you put
the radiator plate on there you cannot
get to these back screws because they
are even with the manifold so that is
unfortunately one of the one-off
problems with this custom grill because
the actual you know retail version of
the specter doesn't have the front mesh
to have to deal with well J once you
just put the screws to the mesh well
because the mesh is too fine and we
can't get them to fit through but the
thing is I don't even have those these
two screws mounted on the inside right
now and it is sturdy it's not coming
apart so we are gonna just go ahead and
leave it like this I even thought about
putting 3m tape on the inside just to be
safe the weight of this with the rad and
all that the 3m tape isn't gonna make a
difference but we have two screws on the
top and then two on the perimeter it's
not gonna move not to mention it's going
to be kind of sandwiched in here anyway
so I'm not too worried about it I'm just
gonna go ahead and mock it up this way
but it's kind of wanted to talk to you
guys about some of the just some of the
headaches that go along with because the
super custom one-off stuff because you
have no data no build data to go off of
and obviously they sent me this case
without doing a build in it because I'm
doing the build so I am the prototype on
this one technically this custom went
off but if you're buying a specter this
isn't something you would have to deal
with it all because it doesn't apply
whatsoever you don't have a front mesh
in the way so like I was saying we can't
get to these screws back here because as
you'll see he once I slide this in there
you cannot get to it like at all because
I did there goes it disappeared you
can't see it nowhere can't get to it
darn there we go also let the weight of
it push it down where it needs to go
this is not going in there all the way
it's hitting on something yeah so now
these are hitting on the radiator
because they've got these like washers
these black washers are standing it up
probably because the screws are too long
for the caps they have on the other side
so yeah it's not just one thing it's
another so far you can actually see
where they were hitting on the radiator
see they were hitting there they were
hitting there it's a little scratches
such as the life of custom stuff still
not lining up perfectly hell
just getting pissed now I'm gonna have
to I'm gonna have to do what you
suggested which is move those washers I
think yeah this case although amazing
it's really turning to a pain in the ass
because now the radiator is hitting on
the top too it hits on the screws or for
these guys I think this might be special
hardware used specifically for this case
so I don't think that's the retail
experience but if it is they need to
adjust that because obviously this case
is built for water cooling and when
you're Reds don't fit because they're
hitting on the things that are
assembling it that's a problem but once
again I don't think this is a retail
experience so here's the top plate
flipped upside down and what we just
realized is we loosen these four screws
and we were actually able to pull that L
bracket a little farther away which is
all we needed to get our radiator fit
am i doing wrong here whether all this
slack and we're in business
yes dad because now that I put this
right and I realize this one's not line
up with the fitting that I want it to be
perfectly because I've literally been
here now like three hours working on
just getting the radiators installed and
this goddamn thing I wanted to try and
make a custom beer bong thing today but
that's not gonna happen now because I've
spent all day just trying to get the
freaking radiators in here and on top of
it they're not even the final fans I'm
going to use so I've got to take all the
fans and possibly the radiators out
again later because the whole part of
this was to mock it up so I could do the
beer bar and what's your money to get
you get
all right so we're back to the front
radiator and it's apart again
everything's going wrong today literally
you see these screws and how they have
the spacer like I talked about up here I
think the reason why they do that is
because these screws are just slightly
too long for these caps to be able to
screw down all the way because as you
can see they are a you know they're
they're true cap they're not a pass
through so I've got two options here
cut the screws shorter which I don't
really want to do I could just pull up
my dremel and just in here cut off that
much of the screw and be done with it or
I can try sanding these down just a
little bit fingers crossed
all right a moment of truth still not
great all right so we're just decided
we're just gonna cut the screw screw it
no pun intended because I does washers
not a bad idea I mean the screw is too
long for the cap I'm sure that's why
James used what he did but we're gonna
do this the proper way cuz it keeps
hitting on the red so now that these are
not sticking up because I've shortened
the length of the screws to be more
proper this should now have no problems
the slide and yeah look at that look how
well it lines up now funny how that
works
Loup order and this is a little bit
strange because you have these two
fittings right here next to each other
what we wanted to do today was trying to
figure out if we could and with these
are just a mock up parts see if we
couldn't make a little more liquid in
there a beer bong looking thing to kind
of go like right there and actually
plumb the tubing through it and that's
what we're still gonna try and do so it
looks like Bud Light being poured into a
beer bong but the other thing that's
still gonna require some work these wood
blocks yeah they didn't take into
consideration the SLI bridge so this
keeps the SLI bridge from actually being
able to mount so now I've got to
actually mark and I've got to file and
modified the wood blocks there is so
much ridiculous custom work needed on
this I'm not complaining about it I'm
just wishing that maybe it didn't need
quite as much custom little bits of work
to be done so I'm not gonna be using
these black fittings these are actually
alpha cool barb fittings with
compressions but I need to order some
nickel-plated ones because I we want to
do nickel throughout the build so it
adds more bling to it I'm gonna mock up
the tubing runs here so I can see how
much room I have to work with with
various aspects of this bill like I said
we would love to be able to fit the
whole beer bong theme in here if we can
I'm not sure that's gonna happen now I'm
gonna be doing obviously in between
right here parallel but we obviously
know that we just have two tubes out
there so I want to mock that one up okay
so let's just kind of start playing
around here so this is actually the
outlet of the pump up there and I have
already done video showing it doesn't
matter what order you do things in so
don't bother trying to have this
argument with me not today okay
not today yeah
so it was like I lost my virginity
yeah that's not gonna work it's time to
go this is the loop order this is where
I decided on with the soft tubing I know
this is gonna trigger some people and
this entire build is intended to I guess
trigger people pump out to this fitting
down to this GPU parallel to the next
GPU into the CPU block out of the CPU
block into this read through the read
out into this distribution model block
here out into this radiator through the
read out here it back into the top of
the fill slash reservoir built into the
manifold down to the pump and what I
like about this coming out right here is
we want to somehow make a thing that
goes here and looks like a beer bomb so
it can go into the beer can we would
plumb tubing through it down out of the
funnel then into the GPU so it looks
like your beer bonging into the GPU
that's what we actually intended on
trying to work on today but everything
that has gone wrong today we lost all of
our time which means I've really got my
work cut out for me especially since I'm
going to Linus tech Expo this weekend by
the way for gonna be there come say hi
punch me in the face whatever look if
you're gonna punch me film it but I can
teach you back so I'm gonna go now I'm
done I'm I'm just completely flustered
and I want to go so Phil you do your
thing guys I'm gonna go like favorite
subscribe whatever
yeah you know oh and on top of it all I
dropped my phone earlier and cracked my
screen protector okay that's the kind of
data that this has been I don't
understand how things like that happen
because you don't have a bit how the
pokey part with my nose oh you are fans
bobble dude that's why you're screaming
do you think yeah hold your tool boy
your strength they gonna hold my nuts
with your tool walls right yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
