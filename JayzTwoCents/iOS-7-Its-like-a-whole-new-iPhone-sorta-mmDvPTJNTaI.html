apple software development
they bring you functionality on your
iPhone that you never thought possible
and it makes my iphone 5 feel like an
entirely new device a brand-new iphone
or an old Android okay you can't say
that we're doing review about Apple what
one of the key things that I'm really
excited about with iOS 7 is that they've
got security at the forethought of their
design implementation and no longer do
you have to deal with the slide to
unlock in a passkey you can you can
still do the the pattern on wait a
minute there's no pattern lock one of
the things that Apple has created with
iOS 7 that is just so exciting is the
fact that you no longer have to flip
through 62 pages of settings to turn on
your Wi-Fi there is no other device in
the world that makes it so simple you
just swipe up and there's everything I
mean why haven't the other guys started
this
one of the things that a lot of iphone
fans have really been asking for over
the years is a larger screen but Apple
knows better they know that you're all
 idiots for wanting a larger
screen so what they've done is they've
increased the depth of the phone they've
tricked you into thinking that your
phone is actually bigger than it is by
having a swipe down function to bring
stuff down that you really don't give a
 about and a swipe up function to
change a lot of the settings on your
phone and we all know swipe up to change
your settings is different than swipe
down so that's not really copying
anybody at all right and sometimes when
I'm really bored I'll just sit there and
swipe up and swipe down and swipe down
its wake up now we all know that social
media is all about taking a photo and
frou-frou freeing it up to make it a lot
more like Instagram so that's why Apple
has made sure to integrate a whole bunch
of filters that you honestly don't give
a about I mean seriously these have
got to be some of the worst filters that
I've ever seen in any camera now if
there's one thing that is definitely
stand alone in iOS 7 it is the new
transitions and when you open up an appt
the way that it just sort of pops right
in there don't you know
meet the icons and the way they seem to
just float or they're seamless with your
device I mean look at that it's
beautiful now one of the things that I'm
really excited about what iOS 7 is the
fact that we've finally been given
widgets I mean day there are no widgets
in iOS 7 what well then what do you get
with iOS 7 you're getting colors and
icons what the is this iOS 7
brings over 200 new features to your
iPhone I've been able to find six of
them huh the other 194 I have absolutely
no idea what Brett day stick to the
script please iOS 7 brings over 200 new
features to your iPhone new colors
translucent depth new icons some fonts
some new sounds and ultimately i think
the Google design team has done a great
job at day
