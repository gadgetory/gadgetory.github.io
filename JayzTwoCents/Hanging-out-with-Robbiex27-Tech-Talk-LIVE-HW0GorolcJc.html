just go Oh thing us up just go you too
but something's coming on you tube
exploded okay we're up now yes
okay guys you guys can all stop blowing
up my phone now wow that was all caused
by my earphones just so you know how I
will explain it in a minute ah Buland
channel okay everyone's everyone's
joining back in yeah i'm just gonna
labor when get back in here before
explain what the hell happened it's kind
of funny actually not really it is yeah
uh how many people were in here right
now I don't know um looks like quite a
few lose a lot of comments gone up again
anyone's head Jay broke it Jay broke it
did break it actually I did break it
okay at the moment on the stream I like
little boxes like halfway across oh crap
i moved you haha oops me fix it all
right there you go white hand of you I
meant him with this there we go alright
it looks like I'm gonna have to explain
my specs again yes you go ahead well
first let me there's only it says it
aight concurrent viewers in here i think
there's more than that though is that
fame 15 watching now it's coming back in
slowly 19 sorry guys we were up to like
a hundred people when that happened by
the way Robbie's listen on no it was the
starbucks the starbucks did it okay
nobody rules i'm gonna go ahead and
explain to you guys what just happened
here um I didn't feel like using my over
the head earphones so I was using my my
initial nines here and if you can see
right here I can't even see my camera
rollin they are made out of gold and
metal and stuff and have a Kevlar string
and they have a metal there's metal here
on the end to there's no rubber and you
on these headphones and I had them
plugged into my Yeti here monitoring my
voice I could hear when I'm talking I
like the sound of these way better than
the shores and I'm wearing right now now
i am wearing my gym shorts my basketball
shorts which are you know how you guys
know how you take off those gym shorts
and they kind of like static up nickel
creek you can do you know i'm talking
about Robbie do you ever wear gym shorts
and they kinda like having one jim
schulz we weren't even close Tim shorts
oh that if you work with you guys if you
guys wear basketball shorts then you
know I know a token I that they create
like a lot of static electricity well
you started talking about the fractal
and I was trying to pull out this box to
say I got a fractal right here well when
I slid across my chair I created static
electricity that fed back through my
Yeti and shocked me in the head yeah and
so I got shocked in the ears and then
the Yeti which is what it is controlling
all of this guy's this Yeti mike is also
my sound card and everything for the
stream glitched out because the amount
of power that goes into this Yeti is way
more than would go through say your mp3
player so I got shocked the stream went
down all because I'm wearing basketball
shorts and using metal earphones so yeah
that's how Jay broke the live stream in
the meantime Robbie was talking about
his computer specs and he has a fractal
mini and that's as far as you got okay
um yeah so it's a fractal design define
mini Anna obviously it's an M ATX case
which is something that I at the time I
got because I wanted to have a smaller
pc and uh turned out the matx doesn't
actually pretty any smaller than
standard ATX which is kind of annoying
but um it's got an FX 4100 in there
which I have overclocked to 4.2
gigahertz gtx 660 8 gigabytes of ram and
60 gigabyte SSD and two terabyte hard
drive so I mean it's a pretty good
system I mean it cost me about 700
pounds so you know it's not too
expensive but it's heavy it does the job
it goes us about 800-900 dollars in that
yeah
no the conversion rate is with thee
we're now with gold and everything
crashing who knows I don't care I didn't
seem to care anymore okay let's see go
ahead and start asking your questions
guy what guys once guy wants to know how
you got such good performance with your
660 ah they're always asked asking me
this on my channel I don't actually know
you guys I mean the amount of like
people that come on my channel and say
oh I've got these settings and like I'm
not getting anywhere near the same
performance it's all about just like
optimizing your settings really I mean
that's what I do like quite a lot of
time and obviously my process is
overclocked as well so I think that
helps a bit you know what I find the
most common reason people tell me that I
find out when their graphics card isn't
performing good is they've got the MSA a
like cranked up yeah that's very true
actually because that is one thing that
I always have turned off and it really
like as soon as I put that on my
performances drops like crazy and to be
honest I don't even notice a difference
like visually I cannot really notice any
difference when it's turned on I
basically on 1080p it's not so bad and a
lot of people to don't realize that when
they go with a larger format monitor
like a 1440 or even a 1600 you don't
need MSA at all because there's enough
pixels to round out the edges you don't
need it in fact you just create more
more lag most graphics card
manufacturers recommend you turn it off
on anything above 1080p yeah but you
know spec wise when it comes to the
amount of cuda cores and the amount of
stream processors and the amount of
memory with exception of the memory bus
I believe your memory bus is a 128-bit
special plans later 28 bit memory bus
could be 256 I don't think so though the
specs on that are equal to the gtx 580
which I had prior to my city so that's
why the sea is no boss does good it's
just you it's the games are progressing
and so is the requirements yeah I mean
as long as you saw pair it with a decent
processor and all that stuff then I mean
I can play like pretty much any game
almost maxed out like sometimes I'll
have to turn some things down like
shadows but I could pretty much run
anything maxed out and get you know at
least 40
60 FPS normally a lot more so I mean
it's a great car drilling a girl like it
so for be a 55 wants to know what my
custom my first custom build was um gosh
guys I i I've owned only one
store-bought computer in my life so I
have to go back to like a kid and I
can't remember those specs I believe it
was a i remember it was like a pentium
to with like a voodoo 3 a voodoo 3d too
i think it was and like 64 megs of of
memory and um but if you were talking
like pure gaming PC where I was older
and knew what the hell I was doing I've
owned one alienware one computer ever
was nearly aware and that was already
I'll of crap I ever owned on I'm serious
I did have so many problems of those
like their rush it yeah they're
everything they have the same
reliability you would expect from a dell
because they're Adele so anyway um I
think it was a pentium d built it to run
flight simulator 10 by the way it was a
pentium d 70 it was an nvidia 7600 GT KO
graphics card two gigs of ram the
motherboard was an asus it was designed
for overclocking i remember what it was
but it was a p-series cheap cheap case
like $25 case I like ran down to the
local you know pc club and and pot one
of those and i was so proud of that
computer and i came home and i put it
together and that was before the days
when power supplies allowed you to only
plug particular plugs in the certain
spot you know how the plugs on power
supplies now have shapes so they only
get one way well the the 4-pin the at
the time graphics cards didn't have six
pin and eight pin they had four pin and
610 graphics cards and the 4-pin pci
express slot would fit in the 4 pin
power plug for the cpu on the top of the
board so i got home i put it together
and i plugged in the pci express
thinking it was the 12 volt for the cpu
plugged it in fried my board actually
while actually watched a couple of the
chips on the board like bubble
limp up oh so fortunately I was able to
silver tongue my way back into a
replacement board at the store keep
another was musical showing damage they
gave me a new one but it's why I tell
people hey you know a lot of the things
that I was because I've effed up I don't
know how many components by doing things
the wrong way mmm I was like probably
the one thing I was worried about mostly
cuz i mean i had a custom pc before this
one but it was like I didn't build it
myself as like it helped out with my dad
a lot cuz I was doing I was like come on
something like 12 when I got that pc um
so with this like I was doing it all on
my own and it was like it's pretty scary
and it was a very satisfying when I
press the on button and actually worked
somebody's denied did not think it would
somebody's asking about 660 ti vs. 7870
these are some parts Peter I may be
building today actually um I've got a
7870 right here and the TI this is the
overclock edition by the way it is not
the gigahertz edition so what you guys
have to realize when it comes to these
graphics cards is there was a early run
7000 series AMD and then there was a
revision like a like a V to run the 7100
series and that's when they made some
some progress on their 28-nanometer
chips for AMD and then they were able to
bump them up to over a gigahertz a core
clock out of the box so if you're
comparing the ti to a gigahertz edition
uh I think you might get better bang for
your buck out of the Giga hurt because
you can get a 7870 gigahertz in the
States for under 300 but you're still
gonna pay 300 plus for 660 ti and would
it and with I don't remember what they
call OpenGL as what I believe AMD calls
they're like CUDA technology I believe
it yeah opengl I can't remember yes okay
a lot a lot of process rendering company
or programs are using OpenGL now and not
just CUDA technology so the days of
saying oh if you're a video editor go
with nvidia are kind of going away and
in fact adobe cs6 is optimized for
opengl on top of cuda
khuda is not their manes their main
optimization anymore so if you use a lot
of heavy Photoshop after effects or
premier you want an AMD card so the
games are changing and I love AMD for
that even though I mean all 680 I won't
get rid of that I'm definitely a fan of
AMD like processor wise um definitely a
fan of them over Intel but for me at the
moment still like nvidia is my
preference of graphics cards my friend
that she just recently got a 7870 as
well and he has had some issues with it
we've been trying to like kind of work
out what's going on with that because
his computers just like going like crazy
whenever he plays a game but they
definitely like I think AMD for the
price you do get a lot more bang for
buck which is kind of their sort of the
way they go about all their products
really but yeah except me you heard
about have you heard about the five
gigahertz chip for AMD no apparently
apparently the same breakthroughs they
made for the graphics cards which is
putting them over the nvidia series on
many of the benchmarks they are made for
their CPUs as well it's they're still
calling it though they're still calling
of issue of asher core yeah however they
they are coming out with a chip to
compete and so ironic because tech
addiction was all about AMD talking
about how they weren't going to compete
with intel anymore they had no desire to
something happened something happened in
the lab that made them change their mind
because they now are competing coming up
later this year with the extreme series
intel they've got their sights set on
beating the extreme and write the price
leaked so far 795 dollars for the next
gen FX but it's supposed to be a base
clock of over five gigs with us crazy on
a stock cooler so i don't know i was
literally I was really a game changer I
was really looking forward to as well
because if remember I've said it before
if I have to buy a new motherboard I'm
going in tell if I cannot upgrade on
mine yeah I crosshair 5 i'm going Intel
but if this new if they're saying it's
bashiri court that's the case and they
can optimize it on FX 3
FX am3+ mmm then it has gonna definitely
put in tower in a position they're gonna
have to drop their prices a bit for sure
um yeah my friends actually just link me
start cool about the new AMD yeah yeah
yeah I mean again it's it's it's not
official from AMD but I that would that
would be good because we need the
competition in there we really do yeah
I'd really like to see them sort of pull
ahead that from Intel and I think
they're definitely again now I mean like
the piledriver CPUs they seem to be
really good and I'm happy with my don't
have any complaints like right now I'm
sitting here what granted i'm on water
but i'm sitting here with two screens
going I'm encoding while up you know
while streaming and I'm my cores are
sitting at 31 degrees yeah i was doing
720p encoding as we speak so i have no
complaints even though he's going up as
360p at processes that you know HD
coconut monkey wants to know if 3d
monitors are worth it have you ever used
a 3d monitor I haven't and I to be
honest don't have any desire to um I
think like maybe if I have like an
unlimited budget and like I was gonna
spend that much on a monitor then I
might enjoy but it's probably not
something I'd want to use all the time
and it would just be a bit of a hassle
because obviously you got you know get
with the glasses on and everything right
I mean and guys if you're just joining
because this was the second link I put
up this is Robbie x27 on YouTube here he
is a tech guy like me does gameplays he
does tech bids he does a video series
each week called a week end week in
review where he takes his favorite we
can review it a weekend weekend weekend
review sounds like a college show anyway
a week in review where he talks about
his favorite articles from the week and
kind of summarizes what's happened in
the world of tech and I put his video or
his channel link down in the description
if you guys like what you see go hit
subscribe he's a small youtuber but I
think he's got he's got potential which
is why he's on this show
just wanted to there's a lot of I see a
lot of new people coming in so I wanted
to put that out there I we're gone in
the 3d my second monitor is 120 hurt 3d
monitor it's a five-hundred-dollar
monitor that I use as a second like I
just put junk on it over there um the
only time I've used the 3d on it was
back when I had my gtx 580 so it's not a
modern experience with 3d but yeah
because it's 120 hurt the the graphics
card couldn't keep up with it because
remember guys we knew 3d it has to
render the image twice it has to render
it offset so everything gets put up
there twice it was quite soon it was
laggy it was cool looking it was laggy I
personally didn't care so much about the
3d because I my eyes I'm one of those
like five percent of the people who
can't process and look at 3d my I get a
migraine within ten seconds of looking
at a 3d image so I didn't really care
but I mean it's cool for watching like
if I put netflix over there I can I can
get that hundred twenty Hertz refresh
rate of you know like when you look at
it as a big screen TV it's got that
fluid motion so that's one of that's why
I have it too but 3d monitors still are
so expensive and if you're going to do
3d i really recommend sli and you're
gonna pay a lot of money for that just
for the 3d anna liam don't know if it's
worth it early don't mmm battlefield on
3d was definitely interesting though
I'll tell you that because you could
it's funny you can gauge the bullet drop
better because you can see it drop you
can sit bullet travel which is you can
see it anyway in a 2d image but you get
a perspective of it really it's
definitely something like yeah I'd like
to try out but it's like you've got to
definitely have like a really good
system be able to do it properly and you
wouldn't want to be like doing it with
sort of low frame rates and I mean the
minute of the price that it's you know
put out it's not really a viable option
for most people yeah but maybe in the
future and I why even even my panasonic
plasma and my living room is 3d TV and
I've I used it once in fact it came with
two sets of 3d glasses and and I took
him back to best buy and asked him if I
could exchange of glasses for some other
perks ended up giving me
for free blu rays or something like that
yeah I just don't I just personally
don't do the 3d I can't mmm see this is
a lot of graphics cards questions oh my
gosh there is yeah that's a symptom amin
that's the most common comment or or
inbox message I get constantly is this
graphics card oh that's that graphics
card and guides you can understand that
is probably one of the hardest questions
to answer next to AMD or intel because i
don't know what you guys do I don't know
what you're going to play I don't know
what resolution you're gonna play it I
don't know the rest suspects your system
I had one guy asked me six seventy or
7950 and then I asked him who the rest
of his specs and he was on an athlon x2
like you're gonna bottleneck the crap
out of yourself none of them yeah don't
get any of those get a processor what
graphics card using down yeah like a 560
other keep your 560 and get a processor
watch what happens you know hmm but you
know that I don't blame my mocha specs
are confusing for a lot of people they
yeah yeah so many numbers out there I
mean people just need to be like Clara
for sure like on what they're after but
I mean there is a lot of like depends on
factors I mean as you say like depends
on what you're gonna be playing your
size your screen loads of stuff yeah um
yeah h/h reef wants to know 8320 eight
core versus i5 3570k just it's the same
answer I give to people when they ask if
it's an 8350 either are you going to
overclock the AMD really pulls the head
of the i-5 and overclocking and
rendering if you're going purely gaming
if you can get an eye five combo package
like I did for that 850 dollar bill died
did where granted it's not as z77
motherboard it's a be 75 we got that
chip and motherboard for less than 200
American so you know if you can get a
deal like that go with the i5 if you
want to render out videos the eight
cores will give you ten or fifteen
percent advantage which over time you
know it's one of the reasons why I went
with the 8350 and ate my words when I
told people I wouldn't buy one because
it was only a twenty percent improvement
for me I got to thinking about it when
I'm doing this whole YouTube thing
and I don't because if you start using
your computer while you're rendering if
you cause any sort of a slowdown or a
hiccup you can get glitches in your
render I don't last yeah that's like
what I've heard a lot recently because
I've had a couple issues with Sony movie
studio yeah and that's something I
didn't actually know so so I don't touch
my computer when it's rendering and
granting granted this may sound like an
elitist comment here you know it takes
me eight to ten minutes to render a
15-minute video and there's people out
there that take an hour or more in two
hours oh I mean for me it takes felt
like a 10 minute video that would
probably be yeah somewhere near to 45
minutes to an hour yeah so already I
mean just 8 to 10 minutes sounds you
know amazing but the fact that I was
able to drop that down to about eight
minutes 7 minutes with the 8350i looked
at that one how much time am i gaining
back over time you know over the course
of a year I'll be putting on another
hundred videos how much time did I get
back so I looked at it that way not to
mention after I sold my 8120 the I got
the 8350 for less than 100 bucks once I
put Neil cash with it so yeah okay um 4b
8455 again J what do you think about the
quad core i5 first uh okay so he's asked
me about system specs here high five he
says three point four gigs I'm assuming
he means the 8830 578 gig yeah they're
like 1330 I'm assuming these 1333 and
AMD 7770 with far cry 3 um far cry 3 is
going to give that 7770 or a run for its
money I think mmm they were far cry is
built on the CryEngine and the CryEngine
has always been pretty demanding are
gonna quit he let my cow the door one
second I he's got to go he's got to go
tend to is his kitty so anyway okay
let's check out some more questions here
um Tom Taylor says will I be able to fit
the gigabyte HD 7970 gigahertz edition
into a bitfenix prodigy any help oh boy
for the record I really want to build
something into a prodigy I really want
to build a prodigy system with that said
I've seen several people
put titans in there so I'm going to
assume that your 77 a 7970 will fit now
I had a 7970 briefly and i will say that
that monster is huge it is very long I
believe it will fit but you're going to
want to check the specs on the case and
their specifications usually they have a
GPU length measurement in there I think
you're going to be within a half inch I
think these gonna be a boot in about a
half inch but I've seen several builds
with the beat bitfenix prodigy with
titans in it so hmm definitely gonna
want to look up well I can probably
actually just look at the comparison
between the Titan and the 7170 see if
they're any different yeah and back in
the old days instead of the power plugs
on the graphics cards coming in the top
they used to go in the back and stick
out which was even worse in cases have
only gotten bigger since then you know
that that was back when but graphics
cards are getting short I mean have you
taken a look at the is your 660 a
standard PCB is it the short one it's a
standard one but I mean it's not like
massive it fits in pretty easily have
you seen the sixth of the original 670
how tiny that thing was I I'm not sure
I've seen one they're only finally a
local shop the only five inches long
this is the 7970 right here all right so
Nate honey a 7870 right here and this
thing is more powerful than the 580 and
the 580 was like two inches longer than
this and it's just it's light it doesn't
put all kinds of droop on your graphic
on your motherboard it's quiet things
are really improving but they used to
back in the day they used to have the
plugs plug-in like this in the back and
then they moved it to the top because
they realize that you know it just
wasn't working out because it everything
was the ones are you holding now the 670
although this is the 79 or 7870 right
here yeah see that's that's the exact
one the Maya friends just got recently
but he's been having issues with it
which which want us or so out at the
moment well I'm going to be doing full
testing on this one here I'm gonna be
doing benchmarking comparisons yeah I've
got the comparison I've got the
benchmark results still from the
standard 660 which is in the same
rice range is this so i can give a solid
one thing actually yeah to consider as
well as if you're looking between like
the 78 17 660 the 7870 I she has to
power supply things right um guys the 16
he's only got one got one 6-pin the 7870
has 26 pins but every every power supply
unit now in like the last five years has
come with at least 26 pins oh yeah but
it's like obviously depends if you like
look into a save on your electricity
economic right and I'm really looking
forward to seeing what this v6 GT air
cooler is capable of I've seen some
really impressive I've seen some really
impressive results on this thing when it
comes to overclocking and you know I
hate the fact that one of the videos i
watched which I feel ashamed for with
lab coat priced x review of the thing oh
cool I felt like I needed a shower oh oh
they make me want to like just smash my
head into my desk yeah and you know I
made a comment on one of their videos
once and like their fans started trying
to call me out and I was just like hey
you guys you know what you guys can have
that corner of YouTube it's all yours
mmm I mean they try hard but that's the
probably occasionally I'll go after
channel and just look at what's going on
and I just I I don't know no you're
doing it although yours on it wrong when
practically every video has as many
dislikes his legs I know and just some
of the things that they I mean they're
like the biggest Intel fanboys you could
possibly get and uh I mean anything AMD
they just instantly hate on which annoys
the hell out of me because like for me
and these been a like great option if
you're on a budget and that and they
just won't accept anything that that I
mean to them AMD is just like nothing
it's just like a my hardon I alright um
so there's like it's there's some
comments in the chat that's making me
laugh a little bit actually is like a
little a little argument going on about
the Titan there okay upsell hitting me
back up a little bit here guys there's a
lot of comments and questions that are
coming in I do the best I can to watch
them but as of the last few weeks I have
to kind of pick and choose what I answer
there's just too many in the beginning
when I used to have like 15 people
watching I could answer everything but
i'll try and get back to them and as i
always say i come back for the next few
days and read the comments and try and
type responses as much as i can with
that said o casio 23 jay says jay what
do you expect from Haswell or ivy
bridge-e from what I understand it's
going to be back on the 2011 socket
which gives a lot of love gives a lot of
love to people who stayed on x79 and it
kind of gives a big finger to everyone
who went to z77 it's not house well
that's going to be well you know I don't
I haven't been following Intel as
closely as I've been following AMD only
because I think AMD is kind of where the
buzz is right now wherever wants to know
what's what's the nature of AMD it's
funny when you have a company like AMD
that can dominate a graphics card
industry again but still just can't gain
traction on the cpu front which is why
i'm really hoping that their their FX
finally lives up to the FX name but it
sa 195 dollar price tag I mean shoot I
mean the channel will easily pay for it
but that's still a lot of money to throw
into a processor and I'd it also makes
me wonder is the 990fx chipset you going
to handle it are we going to be up into
it into a thousand series chipset that's
gonna be required so again if I had to
buy a new motherboard I'm not gonna say
AMD I don't think somebody wants to know
Michael Michael ladder Michael adore
adore to say Jay what do you think about
Adam orth resignation and Microsoft's
continued silence regarding always on 94
7 20 here's how I think the Microsoft
the relationship and conversation went
with Adam orth he made his tweets and
everything went crazy over the weekend
it had a lot of time to sink in with
Microsoft and he was called in to the
boss's office on Monday and said hey
Adam let's have a chat come and see me
in my office please and I think he got
that by email on Sunday night Adam come
see me first thing in the morning ok so
you Moses in yes boss he goes what the
hell is wrong with you right that sort
of thing and like I said in my video if
you're a public-facing official for any
sort of
of company it doesn't matter what it is
if the public's user was a nice today
there is no such thing as privacy
everything you say and what he what he
did here was he created he created a
situation where it he's got microsoft
all over his Twitter like Microsoft
creative director Microsoft and he
worked at Microsoft you look as LinkedIn
Microsoft you look up Adam orth you see
Microsoft and you so Adam worth is now
the voice of Microsoft whether he's an
official spokesperson or not saying
always online is is the world we live in
which it's not by the way nothing we
have requires the entire work everything
still works without the internet you
just lose features and saying to deal
with it and then sort of publicly
disenroll areas which is still like a
half the United States is a rural area
if you look at it if you look at a
population map United States it's like a
big ball of density in Southern
California and it's a big ball of
density up in new New England and then
you look in the middle of the United
States and what is it it's sparse
remember the whole the halo map you were
the halo like gameplay map when you
would be sitting in the lobby and see a
little lights on where people were
playing the United States is dark that
is the majority of the United States you
know oh I think the the statistic was
over sixty-five percent of people live
more than three hours away from a major
metropolitan area and then that's huge
what does that mean that means you get
the crumbs of internet connections and I
mean I really don't know where he was
thinking money tweeted wat stuff but so
he think he's called into the office and
I think he the conversation went
something like this I think you know
what we have to do now there's two
options yeah you can resign or you can
get fired resignation looks a little bit
better on the resume yeah but the bottom
line is we're severing this relationship
and so he resigned to save face in a way
now he'll get another job somewhere I
mean he's worked for sony he's worked
for popcap he's worked for Bungie he's
worked for Microsoft he's going to get a
job somewhere but the thing is now he's
gonna have a hard time you
job I think because everyone's going to
now look at him is is he gonna run his
mouth and make us look bad Mike I've
soft is not willing to talk about the
720 because it's not time why would they
I don't blame them for not saying
anything about always online I think I
think even if always online is not a
requirement they're still going to say
we have no comment at this time yeah but
now it's looking more and more like the
social media or the interactive
entertainment version of the xbox is
going to require always-online
interconnect internet connection guess
what that's fine are your TV requires a
cable connection or satellite connection
at all times if you want to watch cable
TV or satellite TV if you don't ya watch
you watch a movie right the gaming
industry I think Adam orth did us all a
favor because it certainly made all of
our voices unite and saying that we are
not going to Korea page or something
twice which is what you have to do with
always online internet because yeah when
the internet goes down I don't care
where you live I live in Southern
California I have a fifty one megabit
connection and every now and then i'm
down for a few hours so you're going to
tell me for those few hours I can't play
a device that I own Microsoft has to be
smart enough to recognize that that is a
horrible like that yeah I think there
are I mean it's something I can see
maybe like common in like sort of ten
years time when like internet is really
sort of established itself everywhere
but definitely at the moment is nowhere
near as sonic kind of place it needs to
be to have that sort of thing and I
can't see that they gain anything from
doing it they'd only you know lose
people because I mean for me like I
definitely wouldn't buy the new xbox if
it um had that I don't even I don't even
like cloud based game libraries like
Steam yeah because what what's the
what's the benefit of that you say okay
I don't want this game right now I can
delete it and redownload it later and
not take up space you have no heart come
I'm a hard copy guy I've got like 20
hard copies of games up there and yeah
but the reason why I say that is I've
been on steam now for nine years I'm one
of those I mean you were 11 you were
nine
when I got started on Steam and you know
there's a lot of games I loved playing
back when steam first started and guess
what they're not in my library anymore
because I can't redownload them because
they're not hosted anymore mmm very true
I paid for the game hmm but because it
went end of life before I could
redownload it I can't play it anymore
and that's I've got about five or six
games in my library that are sitting
there on my own list but when I double
click and hit download it's grayed out
and then you can't get ya so that's mine
I don't know I definitely used to kind
of like having the disks more like I
mean with like DVDs I still have all my
dvds and now I don't use anything like
Netflix or right online movie stuff but
um with games like since I've had a pc
I've definitely been you know just
pretty much buying all of them on Steam
I've got like far cry 3 and a couple
classics on disk still so I think
definitely a pc is moving more towards
no all being online but um I don't know
so as xbox it'll be interesting to see I
achieve what they do if the next ex
works whether you download games or buy
them on disc still well I know companies
like Sony and Microsoft don't want you
to play used games that's for sure
exactly okay so I see a question here I
want to answer Richard Richard James
Owen says his GPU is running at seven
degrees C 270 degrees Celsius but a cpu
and motherboard is running 30 degrees
temp is that 70 degrees of idle or
during gameplay and what GPU is it that
all matters 70 degrees is not that hot I
mean even on even though I'm on water
cooling when we have 115 degree day here
which I think for you is like nearly 40
degrees Celsius my graphics card will
still get pretty damn worm hmm I mean
yeah mine never really goes above 60 30
notes never look there now well which
version of the 660 do you have it's the
msi overclocked one so the party is it a
twin frozer style like to fans twin
froze up
to I think yeah yeah so it should stay
pretty cool I think the only one that's
cooler is gigabytes three fan model mmm
it's currently at 45 degrees and it
doesn't really change too much I mean
he'll probably go up to like 60 when
i'll start gaming but right it's about
it better game system wants to know what
we feel how we feel about ROG
motherboards and and GPUs I'll start
first &amp;amp; Simone and ROG and I that four
thousand dollar bill was also featuring
an asus rog motherboard ROG is republic
of gamers if any of you guys don't know
the republic of gamers is asus it's like
their elite series it comes with a lot
of features that i think the average
builder or gamer won't use yeah mine has
nine fan headers on it and i use
software to control all of my fans on my
radiators in my case and I want them to
either turn off or slow down or speed up
based on the conditions sometimes I
leave my window open in my office I walk
in here and it's like 45 50 degrees I
leave the fence off and they don't make
any noise yeah but this I just have it
software set to do that the fan headers
on the rog boards are rated 24 watts and
most fans don't use more than 4 watts so
i can have three or four fans hooked up
to one header with no problems other
motherboards are only like 10 watt rated
they have what's called ROG connect and
what that is it's like a double-sided
USB cable or its you a standard USB on
both ends and I can plug it into the ROG
port on the back of my motherboard right
there and then plug it into my laptop
and I can do real-time overclocking and
tuning of it without having to a bios
Andrew boot bios boot bios reboot i can
also check out anything remotely if i
wanted like if i left my computer on and
i had it hooked up to the rog connect
and i have it up loading to a server I
can see real-time information of what's
happening with my computer if you're
planning on using it for some sort of a
server and nag ROG also tends to have
better cooling involved the the heat
sinks are very beefy like my motherboard
never gets over 30 degrees Celsius my
North Bridge is overclocked as well
because it's when you overclock the
processor you also overclock the North
Bridge
i think the most i've seen it get while
fully rendering something is like 42
degrees celsius so yeah the graphics
cards on the other hand I don't see I'm
not a firm believer of the custom
versions of graphics cards one because I
do a lot of water cooling so I don't
want to pay for the extra air cooling
that they put on there yeah the only
thing i like about custom graphics cards
our models that unlock the voltage
control again because i do overclocking
yeah like the msi lightning of the 680
or i believe there's a the ROG of the
680 I think also has unlocked voltage
control I could be wrong but what the
graphics card that I'm using right now
it's it's the g-force it's an msi
geforce 680 it's not a twin frozer it's
a reference model had the stock you know
nvidia style fan on it bare bones
however I got a I got a gem that
overclocks to thirteen hundred and six
megahertz the four thousand dollar bill
died did again i went with to msi 6 80's
those were twin frozr one capped out at
12 70 and another one wouldn't overclock
over like 1230 so all identical in fact
Mike my reference card is the same as
what's used in the Twin Frozr their
reference cards just different coolers
and you can see there's a huge variance
in overclocking there if you're buying
these cards and just sticking them in
your computer you will see more
performance out of like the OC models or
the for the win models or they that I
won't say the areas that's kind of like
a huge flagship model it's all up to you
I don't think it's worth the extra 50 or
60 bucks they want to charge you to
overclock it like 20 megahertz I don't
even feel that there's a noticeable
difference in 20 megahertz on a graphics
card which is the typical overclock of a
like an overclocked version they do also
look nice as well then I think compared
to the like reference models but I mean
well don't forget EVGA s4 the wind model
is still the stock cooler so looks like
ethical suppose yeah
but I mean like graph is caught over
there's something I haven't really I
mean I'll see icon anyway of my 660 but
i'm not sure if it's something i'd ever
sure you can overclock the 660 i did in
the 850 build i did try once but it went
pretty wrong um basically ended in the
computer like killing itself but like
I'm blue screen actually that's what
happened the first time I tried
overclocking my processor this was like
probably a week after I got my pc and um
I just went into the bios like messing
around and I was like all this so I've
caught this processor so I put it onto
like four point five gigahertz straight
away and the computer shut down and I
was like oh what were done and it
wouldn't stop again I've cleared by us
under CMOS it'll be right up that's what
I did yeah yeah there you can't really
break anything anymore unless you unless
you extremely / volt like frequency
why's it just won't turn on a lot of you
know where it will go into like a loop
boot where it'll turn on and then OTL
and then he'll turn on the rog boards by
the way guys one more thing i thought of
because they're overclocking boards if
they fail like five auto restarts it
reset CMOS by itself and automation on
the back of my computer there's a green
there's a green LED button that has like
a looks like one of those refresh
buttons like a circle with an arrow like
at the top of like chrome you push it it
resets everything so you don't have to
open a case up writing quite handy ax
and I mean at first like when mine
happened i didn't really know how to
sort out and i'll quickly searched it
that's when you get that bionic more
like oh my god broke it oh my god
abrooke literally four and i went to bed
that night like oh my god I've just
broken this pc i spend like so much
money on but um if you don't you know if
you don't easy Mel it and you don't hear
anything you're fine like if it didn't
physically make a little pop or a crack
sound and you don't smell anything
you're good that's really that's really
about it ok um Nico HD gaming wants to
know when with the next Plateau like the
sweet spot be in price and power with
graphics cards be like the gtx 680 in
his opinion right now because he feels
like that card is getting old well that
car in the cart is old its over a year
old that came out March 22nd 2012
mmm 20 really age so fast I mean that's
its computers you know it is yes and the
the thing nvidia tends to have about an
18-month reset recycle or a release
cycle so you can expect something new
from nvidia within the next 3-4 months
probably here's the thing though the 680
it's going to still sit at about 450
which is where it's at right now if you
get if you get a reference model it's
not going to really get much lower than
450 when I bought my 580 it was only
three or four months before the 680 came
out and it was still for 80 or 450 so
right now would be the good time to buy
one if you're not like me and you have
to have whatever the latest high-end
model is oh yeah although I kind of
broke that with the Titan didn't I cuz I
said screw that I could buy two or six
of em out today yeah so right now i
think is a good sweet spot the prices
aren't going to come down much more if
they do not be like you'll have to get
like a promo code or find a ten dollar
coupon sort of thing and then 10 is 10
bucks waiting six months for no no but i
bought my graphics card that was like
the best day ever remember actually
walked from because I'd already had like
the Hulk computer built but when I build
the computer I can afford the graphics
call at a time so I had to wait like
another month and uh I was working in a
kitchen at the time it she like the
worst job ever but basically I got my
pay packet of like 180 pounds and I left
college that day and walk straight to
the computer shop which was like to me a
good hour together and uh that's when i
bought the 660 and it was like pretty
awesome day like in my sort of computer
build in her history i suppose well you
know how i paid for my 680 i sold my mac
I is nuts I had decided that I was done
playing around with Mac I had mac my
macbook pro for a while and she was done
I went back to pc gaming because I
wasn't gaming when I had my mac so i
sold my mac then i bought the graphics
card and got a few other things because
i had a macbook pro you know aluminum
addition they did the full aluminum one
and it's uh yeah 15 inch so it yielded
some good cash
and so I was able to get my 680 and
water kulit and complete my water
cooling build so richard james owen
answered me he has an X 1950 pro which
is an AMD card 70 degrees Celsius on
general use but it seems to flux around
hey I graphics cards temperatures don't
indicate that they're dying by the way
what it indicates is that the thermal
compound on the heatsink has corroded
and cracked and dried out so you could
and the x1950 I believe just has little
plastic retainer tabs which you would
want to do is you could research how to
replace the thermal compound on it it'll
probably drop it back down into the 40s
and 50s but at that temperature it
definitely is having a heating problem
because if you were to turn on a game
although you probably couldn't game too
much in 1959 hey you would probably
overheat the card which would kill it so
somebody said that the XFX 7870 has a
really nice look to it I love XFX I
really like him too yeah I remember
before I got my 66 and silver yeah the
777 ti2 is what i was looking again but
then i decided to wait a bit more until
I've been paid and that's when I then
got kind of a step up a moment 660 they
definitely are very nice-looking cards
yeah in fact this was this 7870 was
going to be an XFX model but the XFX
model I was looking at was a little bit
more but the base clock on this one was
higher because this is a DC and because
this is a build not for me I'm only
going to do mild overclocking on it
because I want I want pure stability on
it yes is this build is actually not a
gaming build this is a this is a
workstation build I'm doing but the goal
the guy does every now and then play
like Grand Theft Auto for some games on
there so yeah I just did a lot of
shopping around to maximize the the
dollar amount the budget so I managed to
get that in there but that's also why i
went with AMD because it's a workstation
build he he has a lot of programs open
at one time and so I those eight cores
are really going to do some work
and saved money over the 3770 which was
going to be the original unit I was
going to go with so when we finish up
the stream though I'm going to start
doing some videos and shooting this and
putting it together and we'll see how it
goes and why do you guys always do this
by the way how come you guys start out
with like 30 people watching and as we
start to wrap up it just starts to go up
63 like the other day I had like 15 here
and before I logged off it was like 97
I'm like what are you guys doing come in
here when we start the stream would you
I gave you guys lots of lead way on this
one let me know I was going to do it but
I wanted to show some love though to the
european guys because i'm tired of every
time i would do a live stream everyone's
saying that i hate you guys no it's not
my fault you guys are a half a day ahead
of me I've got to live in the now I
gotta live in the here this good thing
yeah it's good to get a occasional one
in four Oscars yeah we'll probably go
for another 10 or 15 minutes and then
we'll call it a day but I hope you guys
go and check out Robbie's channel I see
him I see ubuntu addicted chatting here
in the in the stream he's going to be my
next guest who remember I told you he
was the the video that kind of prompted
me to want to start getting some smaller
YouTube's in this because I kind of want
to pay oh yeah mine were overnight were
over 9000 100 subscribers now I don't
know where the momentum is coming from
but it is and I love each and every one
of you guys for watching me ramble and
talk which is weird because my license
telling me to shut up so we just stop
talking it's funny I try and talk like
text up with my wife every now and then
and I get that uh-huh uh-huh mm-hmm
someone's asking me the best graph is
called for 150 pounds that's a hard one
I'd probably actually say like
personally right now how much is that an
American dollars maybe 200 American
dollars yeah something like that I mean
I've been kind of interested in the 650
Ti is at the minute and mainly because
obviously you can overclock them which
is a nice feature for the price it's
gonna quickly have a look at how much
they're retailing for also they're
actually like a hundred 126 is the most
expensive so 150 pounds they're going to
be looking at probably a 660
you're my opinion anyway hari nor is
asking 66 DSC which is super clock or
78-74 gaming only 7870 if it's an
overclocked much um well how much did
you get your 664 mine was at the time
180 pounds so I don't know that's
worried about two fifty dollars some of
that god I'm such a hardware elitist
because I know so much more about the
upper crust graphics cards in the lower
end stuff that's why I like when I when
I get you know commissioned to build
these lower end builds because it's like
hey I really get to start screwing
around with like the working man's a
product just such a snob when it comes
to part but I wasn't always that way man
that's 7600 GT KO that I talked about on
that first real custom-built I did I
love that card to death and the 8000
series was already out i mean the 8600
the 8800 GT and the GTX and it was like
or the GTS remember the 640 megabyte GTS
model that's one of the reasons why I
have this 8800 ultra hanging on my wall
up there because that was my first top
end graphics card yeah I got it and then
a month later the 295 came out and I
could afford it and then that was only
king of the hill for like a month and
then yeah it was back down to you know
depression bill whatever lets me most
660 was like good enough I'll probably
hang out on the wall when I'm thumb of
it but at least you have a current
generation I was always a generation
behind oh yeah yeah I love our processor
it's getting a bit other line I need to
upgrade that sometime soon but I haven't
opened this fractal box yet and it's
killing me because I've had it for a
week and I want to play with this case
that's so nice I've never owned a I've
never even touched a fractal case and
I've still never touched one I bought
this one purely on pictures
recommendations and the fact that you
love your mini and yeah I mean you
played a part in me going fractal by the
way so already yeah you influenced the
Jays two cents by the way so I some you
won't be disappointed they are really
good I really like mine and definitely
like when I if I ever decided to upgrade
this case I'll definitely go to fractal
first probably get something like an
hour for but yeah if fractal made a
fractal made something big enough for me
to support my triple a radiator and my
double i would i might consider it but
you know what I've got my eyes on right
now and I was telling my wife about it
the other day and she says oh so
Father's Day idea is I told her I really
want a 900d I really oh yeah really on a
900d and I got on you because i was at
cases are I do really like those um kind
of wish I looked at them more when I
built my pc but i will you be looking at
oh-nine-hundred deeper things like the
200 are oh and stuff yeah even I think
you can even get a 500 are for pretty
cheap of shop around mmm or 500 t even
one of the things that I really like
about the 900 days I could fit a quad
radiator in the bottom and module
radiator in the bottom and have the air
flow for the radiator entirely separate
from the air flow for the components
through the case because remember what
was that so me try and call me um one of
the know where he's going to screw you
so one of the one of the things that
people don't realize when they go with
water cooling is the fact that they
think oh why thought of these water
cooled parts now I can just put some
fans on my radiator keep the radiator
separate and they have no air flow going
over there motherboard but all of the
motherboard needs to be cool to you know
randy has to be cooled motherboard
northbridge southbridge so i can still
control the airflow separately of the
radiator so i don't have hot air cooling
the radiators i can have it go through
in the bottom of the case and go right
out up you know the side it's a side
flow goes right through the bottom and i
got to play with that in CES and i
received an email directly from corsair
the other day because I was a CES
attendant at their booth and registered
with them giving me first access to a
900 d from the very first run from China
na na I said extremely limited
quantities and I know that email i think
got blasted out to everybody at Corsair
I think yesterday but I found out it
they gave us access to this so
a week ago yeah nine are two hundred
dollars shipping because it's coming
straight from hong kong airmail yeah so
it would be three hundred and forty nine
dollars for the case and 199 shipping
i'm not going to pay five hundred fifty
dollars for a night yeah i'm i will have
a hard enough time paying for it out of
three hundred fifty dollars regardless
if it's if it's you know paid for
through the youtube channel or not
because that's a lot of money syria
there's a lot of money i mean like
personally like I probably wouldn't
really go over a hundred and less I was
on some like crazy budget but I mean you
can get pretty good value for money at
the moment with cases unless you're like
build in like a super computer I mean
like I suppose your custom computer that
you bought yourself is pretty
substantial and worthy of its you know I
well but you know what i would go with
though if I was doing a true custom
build and I and I wanted it to be unique
in mine I would go with something from
case labs and i would put together a
case myself with the components i want
in there and I wouldn't have an optical
drive I don't have an optical drive now
which is funny i do my case I still have
one nigga I just really want to redo
everything what am i hearing I know you
keep saying you go to reach everything I
think I'm hearing my my daughter getting
reprimanded by Grandma so anyway um yeah
i i'm looking at my case and stuff now
and i'm starting to get that itch again
where I look at it and go ah time for
something new you know which is just sad
because I know that so many people out
there like they want me to will them my
computer when I die I think so we're
plotting my death just to get it maybe
you should do a giveaway like hunter k
subscribers 100,000 subscriber giveaway
you could have my computer that but by
that time will be like three years
obsolete it's just say that you okay at
a hundred thousand subscribers i will
give away this computer but it will be
three years obsolete because it'll take
me three years to get there yeah all
right well um last this is like boogies
lightning round you guys getting your
questions now we're going to turn this
off
and I'm gonna start playing around with
some computer parts but I hope you guys
honestly will go and check out Robbie's
channel I like it jay is two cents
watches it when he has the time to watch
stuff hmm I hate being one those guys
it's like hey I make videos but I don't
watch them I try every now and then I go
into my subscription my sub box and it's
like 99 plus symbol yeah activities that
I haven't seen and it's like oh my god
and I'm not even thought I mean yeah
every video I was like 10 minutes plus
so I can watch all my videos in my feed
but yeah well i'm debating whether or
not i want to make a build video with
this build but I've already done me 50
build I've done the high-end bill it
would be redundant I think I don't I
don't know how I would present this as
being anything I mean you could just do
like a kind of simple one just like show
the parts and then do the build um you
can have to make it like super
complicated I need to start doing kind
of like you did virtual builds you know
because I think that's yeah because
those can be easily updated and I always
hated doing virtual builds because I
want to be able to bench him at the end
yeah I want to be able to say that means
the performance you got out of it
everything else is virtual and I don't
know if I had the money I'd love to do
like a budget um build because there's a
lot of people that I i don't know i want
to sell getting people into pc gaming
and it's something I really like now and
I mean I used to be a console game of
like 8-10 years um but you know it's
just not really financially an option at
the moment so I'm trying to help how
people as much as I can with those how
to build a pc videos and yeah i think so
far they have been kind of well-received
and people are finding them helpful but
I dig out a lot of questions like all
the time just like people coming over
from my pc videos like what should i do
i want to spend like 350 pounds and get
something that will play like the latest
games and it's just you can do it but
they just need kind of my advice I
suppose Griff draws wants to know what
the best graphics card for gaming of it
also Photoshop a video editing would be
in between the 100 to 200 uh AMD he
wants to know AMD or Nvidia I honestly
think in the two hundred dollar price
range AMD's gonna be hard to beat
but when two hundred dollar price range
you're going to be looking at like the
7770 or the 7850 non gigahertz editions
and those are constantly trading blows
with AMD or with nvidia so i really
really wish i had my 50 build that i did
that had the 660 in it with this build
i'm doing back here because I would love
to swap it out with the 660 and do a
comparison between these two cards these
two cards these two cards are in the you
know 250 to 300 range granted they're a
little more you know this is a little
bit more than a lot of people are asking
for but if I really hope I get to the
point to where people will start sending
me review product to send back which is
perfectly fine yeah because I'll have a
test bench ready to go I mean if I've if
I've got to be the fat Linus I'm okay
with that no and it's funny too because
i was at I i was at CES and I was
watching Linus do a couple of his videos
right and it was really well yeah I mean
I ran into Linus I ran in to raise the
world I all those guys were that oh good
oh yeah and so but I only had a thousand
100 subs or so at the time and it's
funny I was sitting there and there's so
many people that were like wow lying as
well I miss and I've never been I've
never felt that way about lying it's I'm
like he's just an employee of NCIX who
has access to all this stuff and he got
big cousin review anything he wants cuz
it's a warehouse so yeah but he's got
he's new to personality too and he's got
a lot of loyal followers pretty much
like a celebrity that anyone who likes
pcs pretty much thank you I walked into
a frys electronics the other day and
they had a video of his an advertisement
for the product playing on loop on a
monitor above the product yeah inside a
retail brick-and-mortar store yeah let's
find out sitting right I'm watching them
and it was it's like I'm looking at him
and I swear I almost felt like there
were like crosshairs on him I was like
I'm i getcha you wait give me a few
years I know we'll see ya I just don't
have the access to the inventory that he
does but maybe one day who knows but um
I already obliterated left go price tech
and I'm okay with that yeah we won't
talk about them there was a horse I
wasn't want to beat them all I to do is
show up no no harder to i canno BBM
Haley just needed the exposure okay guys
um we're gonna go ahead and and get on
out of here lots and lots and lots and
lots and lots of graphics card questions
oh my god i'ma start calling this
graphic rocks would talk with Jace two
cents don't forget I just noticed
actually just from this doing this
stream I am like super close now they
Andhra subscribers so thank you again
for inviting me i suppose so they're
like 10 or 15 subs or something from
this I'm sick stops away now I don't
know where you started oh now I'm five
where were you when you started today uh
770 something oh so you get them all up
in like 20 oye yeah that's good cuz I I
haven't really been watching the stats
too much lately because I get I'm a
stats whore and I don't look at the
numbers and like you'llyou'll skype me
every now and then go oh my god you're
at this number and it's like oh cool
because I didn't know until you told me
but I look at the numbers instead of
going oh I gained 50 today or I gained
120 today it's what I do that like I'll
go and I'll say okay on this day
uploaded this video and the view did
this but the subs did this and you know
it's like yeah I like to put it i
overlay like on the analytics i'll
overlay all of those different compared
to specs and it's funny too because
there's times where the subs shot up but
the views went down so it's like yeah
how it just doesn't make any sense to me
so there's weird like some days I'll go
some days and get like like one sobbing
today mm and I think like how I done
something wrong what's going on but in
like some other days I'll get like 15
and a day it's like it's crazy because
it's just completely random but yeah
actually now on 799 well who's that
who's number 800 gonna be who's gonna
lose none by a hundred alright I'm on my
email so late you know all right who's
number 800 let's see
um I tell you what you tell me who
drools with 799 who's going to be number
well you know it's going to happen
people if I oh my god it is it toxic
base UK toxic base UK say something in
the chat toxic I want to see you say
something in that chat and it might be
delayed a little bit here and I'm gonna
ask you a question oh my god again loads
now good two more human livestock you /
bucks now guys if you're if you're
subbing to Ravi you gotta watch his
videos now don't be an empty sub subs
are no good run away from g yeah and
it's very tricky it's I took that's why
I told boogie sometimes like if I do a
video that I like yeah see the thing is
I'll tell him he watches a lot of my
videos but i'll tell him a lot don't
comment don't like it just go watch you
just don't do anything with it because
sometimes i don't want i don't see
people will simply say oh boogie like
hit guys yall go click it and then
they'll cut us up and then they never
come back and I don't like tight you
know I i want i want people that want to
interact with the channel so if you guys
are subbing to robbie now you've you've
agreed you have to watch these videos at
least watch the week in review every
single week and we can review it's good
fun i think i may or may not have told
you but an especially you guys in the
stream i have been getting so many
people asking me what happened to tack
addiction where's tech addiction and i
honestly think tech addiction is not
doing anymore might have led to like i'm
up to like fourteen hundred subscribers
lost already so i think a lot of that
might have been from the stopping of
tech addiction if a lot of people didn't
realize as it was taking me like six or
seven hours sometimes more i think i
spent 10 hours when i'm gone to edit
that together to film it because i film
it behind me I take all this stuff off
the wall I have all I set all the lights
up I set the camera I have to read I
have to disconnect this mic set it up on
my mic stand get the laptop for the auto
the audio captioning and I have to set
up a whole set behind me here that then
I then tear it all down and do all of
that and then edit it together and then
you know do the proper jump cuts do the
adding of any of the
overlays or do the research prior to all
that and it was too much too soon it was
a good idea but it was getting 400 or
500 views and for the amount of work it
was and I know and I want to clarify its
not oh I want a lot of views or it's not
worth it it's the amount of time i was
spending versus the return i was getting
was taking away from other videos i was
able to create but now that i think one
of the things I'm going to do for the
the 10,000 subscriber mark as I'm going
to bring tech edition back because I
honestly think that will start getting a
couple thousand views from that yeah
again I mean it is as you say is a lot
of effort but it does pay off I mean
like just in the videos i do one of the
ones i did a couple days ago i was up
until like two in the morning editing
that I've spent like three hours on it
and we do like put a lot of time into
like all our videos and I mean this is
things I've talked about other youtubers
as well and that's why it's always nice
to get this recognition you know and
right ok I see toxic base type something
in the chat as I yeah toxic do you play
planetside 2 world of tanks or Hawkin
because if you do I'll see in this
couple days ago because I'm gonna give
him fifty dollars game cash for each one
of those games for being the 800
subscriber of yours if he plays wow
that's pretty cool each one of those
games you got relays you guys fifty
dollars in cash so hopefully he plays
one of those games and if he doesn't he
should start playing planetside or
something he's gonna he's gonna be that
new like best fan give me something and
I'll stay forever ok yeah and it's funny
to be how many people are like what is
up with you and munition it's like hey
meet issue was the first company to give
me the time of day as a product reviewer
I didn't even have 500 subscribers when
they sent me product and they sent me
expensive product and then continue to
send me product to get back to you guys
so yeah there's a little bit of love
from you nishio yeah has nothing wrong
when up coconut party fear the tits
coconut mohandas bread yeah I have tits
but I'm fatso
coconut monkey who happens to be a real
life friend of mines as I playhawken
yeah we're not getting any money man in
fact ah looks thick base says he doesn't
he doesn't well um then I tell you what
I'll do I will give you the code and you
can do a giveaway yeah we'll do that so
for all you guys who subscribe to Robbie
I'm going to be giving him the game code
that gives you fifty dollars game cash
that's a lot of money in fact I I got a
bunch of these by the way I was at
microcenter and because I let's just say
I bought all of the hardware for the
four thousand dollar build their they
gave me like a stack of those because
it's just it's not like it's in the box
of the graphics card they just they
there's like stacks when they just give
you one when you buy the card so they
gave me off a bunch of them and I gave
some away to some co-workers who play
planetside and he was all excited
because he's he apparently bought a
bunch of station cash or whatever that
means so yeah but yeah like you boo said
right I do appreciate him being honest
that he doesn't play the game because he
could've taken it and just not used it
so I didn't know what I wanted to do
with these I didn't get that many people
on Twitter that said yeah I play I play
I got a lot of wealth at games okay or
yeah I play World of Tanks but you know
I just there wasn't any excitement of
yeah I play so I just kind of held onto
the codes and then I still need to still
need to download the Bioshock in the
tomb raider bioshock infinite yep i'm
not sure about that i kind of want to
get it but at the moment it's come
highly recommended especially from
boogulah and I was on I was on a video
chat with him last night and then he was
like I'll make it out of here I'm gonna
go play bioshock and I see ya I said
yeah I still have to download mine and
he's he told me that he highly
recommends it now when I told him I had
tomb raider download then he liked about
jumped out of his chair and told me to
do it like now but I don't play games
that much so hmm yeah one hit man joe
says you don't play planetside 2 then
start I should probably take that on my
own advice but I don't play games
anymore as I'm just like to is all right
i mean i spend like probably a couple
weeks planet but it kind of loses its um
appeal after a while i found and i mean
it
is amazing like playing with like the
high player comes in that but there was
a lot of kind of performance issues and
I'm been on in a while so chances are
they are sorted I'll now but Brian
Wilson's asking planetside it's it's an
MMO shooter game mmm and I think I would
something like a 200 people in there at
a time sort of thing yeah it's like a
different color different colors will
not yeah ahead of a loss it really
depends on that's funny some might some
of my Twitter followers are just now
retweeting my tweet where I was thinking
about going live early I think he's
gonna miss it possibly a little bit
behind there the Papa do one plays
league of legends I played that is it
better than the spy one for dust 514
that a new ps3 game in that so you kind
of similar I suppose I think dust 514 is
like a mix between um what's the spate
is it Eve online EVE Online i don't know
i think it is eve online but um i
haven't actually played that so i'm not
really sure but I balances your question
coconut monkey you'd probably have to
play them both to find out I've been
playing a lot of Forza 4 on xbox lately
because I'm a car guy I just love like
him and I really really really really
really want an audi a6 by the way mmm
that's the car I went on I'd love to
have a subaru impreza that's like my
dream oh really yeah but the the guy
that I friends with over at me initio
that I was down in San Diego this
weekend we went to the munition offices
did you see that tweet I did where I was
trying out the night before yeah oh my
god oh my god i I've listened to a lot
of very high-end headphones yeah I
haven't heard anything like that and
it's cool too because they have you walk
into their engineering room and there's
like 50 of them on the wall and every
single one of them has a tag on it and
they're different sound curves where the
engineering is trying different types of
tweeter and drivers so they all sound
different and they had me listen to a
couple in fact he his name is Fausto he
is going to a show and he's gonna be
doing some demos and he had me listen to
a few of them and he's like yeah just
kind of listen to these and tell me
which one you think sounds best
he had this demo track on his phone that
i was listening to so I'm listening and
I'm like okay yeah this is good and you
know I try it i plug in the next time
like yeah and the cool thing about that
is the plug on plugs from the headphone
so I can unplug it from the headphone
grab the new headphone plug it in and
put it on and so I'm sitting listening
to it I get to like the second or third
one and I'm like whoa uh that's the one
and it was just it was everything about
it the base I'm not kidding you my wife
confirmed my cheeks were jiggling they
were like it what's insane it was like
it was like um you know some sort of
like I'm acts like a 3d theater that's
the base level in my ears if you like
bass mmm didn't know a lot of the music
I listen to its kind of dubstep you
quite basically so ya i really saw you I
need to check out I like dubstep and
stuff so anyway guys I appreciate you

guessing hurry up really alright guys
pretty awesome i get out of here Robbie
thanks for coming appreciate you for
