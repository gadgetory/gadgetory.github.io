and I'm going to do something that we
haven't done in a long time around here
and that is a giveaway we're not giving
away some small and stupid we're giving
away a gtx 980 yeah that's gonna give
somebody a lot of hours of gaming fun
you guys know I love GTX 980 s I'm a 980
whore if there ever was one but now you
can be a gtx 980 whore as well now my
friends over at digital storm and i we
have teamed up to do this giveaway and
yes it is an international giveaway but
just like any other giveaway there are
some rules and regulations if you guys
look down in the description it's down
there if you guys have never like looked
at it or even opened it it's always been
there it's down there to go you click it
open the information is down there it's
quite useful actually you guys will find
a link to glean which is what we're
using to power this giveaway and there
are multiple ways that you guys can
enter by subscribing to me or subscribe
to digital storm or following us on
Twitter and each one of those give you a
unique entry into this giveaway now rule
number two is if you are an
international winner and you live in
that v80 tax that twenty two percent tax
or whatever import taxes and stuff you
guys are responsible for getting it out
of customs not us if it comes back to us
then we're just going to give it away
again which would kind of suck because
that means we would have wasted money on
shipping so let's not let that happen
shall we third rule if you are the
winner you were going to have 72 hours
to respond and you will be told how to
respond via gleam if you guys do not
respond then it goes back in the pool
and it next winter is drawn until we
have somebody who responds and accepts
the card I don't know why you wouldn't
but yeah GTX 980 pretty freaking awesome
now you guys are gonna wondering which
gtx 980 this is well this is an nvidia
reference gtx 980 so it doesn't have any
custom coolers or anything on there but
that's okay because you guys are going
to watercool it right I would expect
there to be a custom block on this thing
and pictures sent to me by the end of
this review I mean giveaway whatever it
is we're doing so definitely check out
that link down the description for all
the give away information and details
you guys know how long it's running how
to enter and best of luck to everybody
well that's pretty much it I don't know
why you guys are still here watching you

long time ago
and actually gone and entered to give
away and as always guys good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
