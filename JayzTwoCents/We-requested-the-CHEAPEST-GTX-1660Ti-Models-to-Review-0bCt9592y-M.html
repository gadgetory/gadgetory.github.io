in the description below well this is
probably the worst kept secret ever in
graphics card history that of the new
NVIDIA GTX 16 60 TI a name that still
have no idea what it means
even in Nvidia is like reviewers guide
there's no mention of what 1660 Ti is I
mean so it's based on the TU 116 core
right the new the whole new architecture
whole new touring architecture with just
CUDA cores and obviously the SMS in
there and stuff but it's 116 right tu
116 so they could have called it the GTX
1161 1 6 TI or whatever nobody says so
we still know exactly why it's called a
1660 TI but and I even asked couple the
AIB is like hey what does it mean
they're like this is clearly a step up
from the GTX 1060 and then they're using
the 960 in lot of their materials
because they like to kind of go back to
generations because they find most
gamers hang on to their graphics cards
for approximately two generation cycles
so how long Pascal lasted and how many
years that was around solid 2 years if
you still have a 960 it means your cards
three and a half or so years old
potentially even older which means it
start to get a little long in the tooth
so we were kind of torn like what
exactly is this card aiming for it I
mean it's got 1560 cuda cores this is
the 1280 that was found in the GTX 1060
this guy right here both still have 6
gigs of VRAM however the
16 60 TI and I know I'm gonna say that
wrong at some point in here like I know
I'm gonna say the name wrong or mixed up
just know what I mean okay
it has also six gigabytes of vram
however it has G DDR six running in a
total of what 12 gigabit per second
versus the eight gigabit per second
found on the 1060 s six gigabytes of
gddr5 so there's obviously a step up
there there's some architectural
improvements as well that you guys come
sure can learn more about in depth on
some of the other more deep dive tech
channels like Steve it gamers Nexus or
digital foundry and hardware you know a
lot of different hardware sites there's
a major improvement to the way FP and
the integers you know the the
instruction sets are actually being
accessed and working simultaneously now
rather than kind of alternating so
that's basically I guess kind of like an
asynchronous compute which is where
they're getting a lot of the shader
improvements in which is why you're
seeing a lot of improvement massive
improvement actually compared to the
1060 even with this small generational
gap from I call it small secondly not
it's a whole new core obviously if the
touring architecture but that's why we
got a significant increase of 25 or more
percent across the board when you
compare these two generations but we
didn't stop there because this card does
not exist in in videos portfolio what I
mean by that is there's no founders
edition card there was a founders
edition 1060 which is kind of
interesting to me that they didn't do
one this time around this is one where
Nvidia obviously designed the core and
then they're involved in you know a lot
of the you know blueprint designs on how
they came to the AIB and how they
implement them but it's up to the AIB to
come up with their own solution now for
many many years this is the way Nvidia
operated until Pascal came out yeah I
think Pascal was where they actually
went into the retail market themselves
selling cards direct to the public where
previous to that all it was was
reference cards that were available ever
a little bit let's start through the AI
B's and then they would kind of
disappear in custom cards who are you
found so what you're gonna find is a
huge variance across the market between
these car the way these cards are
implemented so I've got a lot to talk
about with this review I'm gonna get
sort of just right into it right now
with the benchmarks and before we do
that I'm gonna tell you the logic behind
the cards that we chose
this right here is the gtx 1660 TI Strix
as you can tell is a massive card it's
got the quite essential Strix appearance
to it it's clearly the biggest of the
cards that we have this is their phoenix
card this is our entry level this is the
MSRP card this is the massive markup
card and then actually there's a card
missing from here we're actually testing
against a 2060 as well just to see how
the 260s hold up we've got the MSRP card
another MSRP card from EVGA these do not
have a markup over the MSRP pricing
which nvidia kind of controls the map on
that or minimum advertised price again a
custom implementation triple slot for
such a small card which is kind of funny
funny a single fan but massive cooler on
there and then this is the gtx 1066 gig
we're not testing the three gig that
card should have never existed in my
opinion opinion i said that then i agree
with it it's still today and then at the
last minute we got an email from AMD no
surprise it happens all the time any
time one company is getting ready to
launch something we start hearing from
both sides going hey don't forget about
us and la blah so we're gonna email from
AMD saying hey you can now get a vega 56
for 279 Knox we're like no so we click
the link we go to new AG and of course
that's that's a msi card with a very
basic cooler one that's terrible even
worse than that although this isn't
terrible cooler it's typically the cards
that come with lower style like this are
not the greatest coolers it's a garbage
cooler as far as I'm concerned but a
bigger 56 for 200 bucks say it isn't so
well they were all sold out there was
only one SKU all the rest of the SKUs on
the market were four hundred plus
dollars so I wrote them back to my guys
there's only one card at that price and
it's gone and we need I reached out for
comment are they gonna be more cards
available at this price point or just
this ones we're waiting to see so for
the heck of it because at least for a
minute you could get a Vega 56 for $230
we went ahead and put this on the the
benchmarks to to see how it compares and
because of that we sort of took the 590
off the charts all together because what
AMD effectively did is that they truly
reduce the price of a Vega 56 and not
just some introductory thing or a
temporary thing because of the launch of
the new 16 60 TI
they sort of cut off their own 590 as
making sense unless they dropped that
$200 which then it makes sense again so
that was sort of our logic so we're be
testing one two three four five six
cards and seeing how they stack up in
this sort of a 300 dollar battle royale
so here's how they stack that
so here's my first kind of complaint we
actually have three asus strix models
that range in price from three hundred
and nineteen dollars and ninety nine
cents all the way up to three hundred
and twenty nine dollars and ninety nine
cents so slight variances between the
cards fits my problem you are now biting
up against our TX twenty sixty pricing
of MSRP of around three hundred and
fifty bucks so i mean i guess three
hundred seventy nine ish at that point
it's like should you save the extra
twenty to thirty bucks or so i think so
the phoenix card even this guy right
here they are they have a dual a gtx
dual sixteen sixty TI which is 304 and
309 five dollar differences why do you
have a skew for difference of five bucks
now EVGA also sent us their MSRP model
this is another two hundred and seventy
nine dollar
sixteen sixty TI which if we compare the
MSRP cards what you typically find is
they don't stand up very well but what
you'll find with the Strix card is
obviously it's got a premium build
quality it's all custom PCB as they all
are be in this particular round still
uses single a pin power on there but
you've got the RGB header on the back
you've got the additional fan headers
all the strict stuff you'd come to
expect nice black anodized plate but you
gotta ask yourself is that worth sixty
dollars more than a base card now the
base cards build quality clearly isn't
nearly as nice there's no backplate on
here the cooler is kind of flimsy i mean
that it's just a chunk of aluminum
sitting on top of the actual core very
similar to like a stock intel cooler so
there's no heat pipes or anything in
here you do have what looks like a
copper core on there but yeah it's just
very basic single fan in fact this card
got up to 81 degrees not overclocked but
it still actually outperformed the EVGA
card ever so slightly even though this
card has a better fan in my opinion much
bigger heatsink actual heat fins and
pipes versus just a basic core sitting
on top of a you know big chunk of
aluminum and copper this feels like a
much better build quality for me for the
same price even though it boosted
slightly lower now the sixteen sixty TI
has a base clock of 1500 megahertz and a
boost clock average of 1770 now
basically GPU boost 3.0 dictates how far
the card will self overclock depending
on
a couple of parameters right temperature
Headroom power draw Headroom and then
GPU usage so if it's maxed out already
and it's hit any of those other factors
it'll kind of self-regulate it's clucks
so this card sat at an average of about
1830 when I was comparing it in
precision x1 whereas the phoenix card
although not built as robust and ran
much hotter sat at a higher average
about 1875 so that's why this card was
showing slightly better performance than
an EVGA card now overclocking was not
taken into effect in any of these cards
this was just out of the box settings no
slider touches no fan curve touches just
you stuck him in the CPU how did it
perform the Strix card sat much higher
in about the 1950 range temperatures on
the EVGA card set at a max of 66 in the
Strix card was at max of 61
so a heck of a lot cooler but as we'd
expect massive cooler with three fans
now I didn't do over any overclocking on
this because I found some anomaly as I
want to sort of do a separate
overclocking video because I there's
some stuff I couldn't really explain
that being even though I was giving this
card additional megahertz to the CPU it
wasn't it wasn't doing math properly
what I mean by that was I was adding 100
to the core on this and it still boosted
to about 1950 1930 which is what we
expected plus 100 so I might find this
do plus 200 it then tried to do 20 175
which is where it kept crashing and then
I did plus 150 and it still was doing
the 1930 range so I think there's gonna
need to be some precision x1
improvements afterburner still needs to
be updated for these cards but I can
tell you right now if I had to make a
choice on MSRP cards then I would
certainly choose the EVGA over the
Phoenix just because of the better
cooler which should give us better
overhead once we see how the software is
going to react to it
now clearly it destroys the GTX 1060 as
should be expected and considering what
a lot of people were mad about with the
2060 was they were comparing it to a
previous 1060 card and saying why the
premium why the massive hike of what 379
I think it is or 349 I remember the
exact price I'm sure phil can't stick on
screen somewhere people really mad about
that or what you can see now is that the
same MSRP basically as the 1066 gauge
launched at
you are now getting significantly more
performance for that and you're not
paying for the extra features which a
lot of people don't necessarily want to
adopt you today DXR r-tx tensor cores
and all that but you do get the touring
architecture improvements with t1 16
then running with the Pasco architecture
but what about Vega well there's still
some questions like I said we don't know
if they're gonna be reducing the price
of the card across the board I still
can't imagine them menu factoring Vega
Vega 56 even for 279 Lux I don't think
it's possible heck even gamers Nexus did
a really good piece about how much it
costs for hvm to to be manufactured and
just the chip the core and memory array
on here was about 300 bucks so I don't
know how they could possibly be doing
that which is why I think just that one
SKU for a limited time is going to be
the $250 card just trying to cause some
disruption in 1660 ti adoption now let's
talk about the Strix card for a second
at three hundred and thirty dollars I
don't think it's worth it I don't think
it's worth it I don't think it has a $60
premium in there and now it's gonna go
for any brand I don't care if it's Asus
EVGA ZOTAC MSI gigabyte all of them
anyone that wants to charge 330 dollars
for a 1660 Ti is basically out of their
mind because it's too close to the price
of the MSRP for the 2006 tee which you
can find you can find them and at that
point the speed improvement and the
gaming improvement from 2060 versus 1660
Ti makes it worth waiting an extra month
or setting aside another paycheck or two
with a couple bucks set aside to be able
to improve because you are going to be
getting what feels like an entire
generational improvement of graphics
card just between you know these two
tiers the 2060 versus the 1660 TI it's
gonna be just as much of an improvement
is going from 1060 to 1660 TI so in my
opinion there's no point in buying any
1660 Ti over $300 I think it just makes
no sense
which means what I said one of my
previous video is that 2019 is gonna go
down is one of the suckiest years for
graphics cards it's not just graphics
card performance because as you can see
Turing to you 116 is amazing in my
opinion it's just the pricing is all
over the place and everything is just up
in the air and nothing's really landed
so that's kind of
I'm mad on all of this so that's where
the pieces kind of land and I wasn't
gonna give you guys an individual review
for a Strix
and a Phoenix and this just being a
black edition I was gonna do that I mean
that's just too repetitive so I probably
won't review another 1660 T I might use
them and some build guides and stuff
depending on certain price points and
stuff Strix aside I I think the extra
features are a complete waste of money
personally but sound like a broken
record now the question is you guys were
the buyer I'm one person but you guys
speak in volumes and you do it with your
pocketbooks so if you were shopping for
a graphics card right now would you buy
a 16-6 TTI and if so which one would you
stick with MSRP or would you go with a
premium card or if you're considering a
premium card would just wait a little
bit longer and get a 2060 so sound off
in the comments below guys or hit me up
on Twitter at Jase 2 cents let us know
what you think and yeah great
performance if you stick to the MSRP
they gave us an email saying hey guess
what you could get RTX no not even r-tx
wow that would be a funny email from AMD
Radeon rx 50 split so we got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
