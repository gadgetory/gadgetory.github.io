heard through the grapevine that Kyle
took it upon himself to build a system
here in collaboration would be quiet at
CES I've built some systems with Kyle
specifically man versus build and that
system didn't work so we're gonna go
ahead and see because they haven't
actually at the monitor up to this to
see if it posts and stuff so here's what
we do right now we're gonna open this
bad boy up where we're gonna look at his
cable management we're gonna look at his
just build quality do a little bit of a
QA QC check on his build
we're gonna go monitor up to it and see
does it even work my first guys check
out Coursera course they sent us here to
see yes 2019 and you got to check out
their eye 40 eye 60 and IAT Corsair one
HP d desktops so check out the link in
the description below okay so he did the
build in a dark base 700 yes it's dark
and it's white it's special edition
check out the video on that we've
already done that so he built I believe
a thread Ripper system in here right
looks like we've got a dark Rock Pro 4
we've got some sort of auras card in
there I don't know if that's a 20 80
doesn't really matter I it's a GPU
that's 20 80 and what board is this this
is a zenith extreme so yes definitely a
thread Ripper board so looking at the
front here cable management so far looks
pretty clean but we're gonna give the
credit of that to the case because the
case has really good cable management
built into it very similar to the silent
base 801 that we did our how to build a
computer in it's got nice channels you
could pop out to run cables through so
you can keep it nice and clean but you
know the sign of a true builder is how
much time they spend on what you can't
see so let's go ahead for the first time
at least it's for us we're gonna open up
the back here and see did Kyle care when
he built this
damnit he cared yeah I can't find a
whole lot that I would complain about
that sucks I really wanted to rip Kyle
or rip it within this one but
unfortunately that's not gonna happen
but does it work
that's the question because if you'd
have never built a thread Ripper system
it is a very torque based socket and if
you don't torque it right in the right
order or even if you do sometimes it
won't boot so let's see whether or not
Kyle torqued it properly okay moment of
truth we've got Armando hooked up no
peripherals that's fine CPU code 79 oh
there goes BGA gonna turn on Kyle can
build a computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
