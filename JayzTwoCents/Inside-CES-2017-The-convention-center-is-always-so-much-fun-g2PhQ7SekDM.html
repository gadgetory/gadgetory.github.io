MSI and the new Z 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
it's that time of year again guys CES
2017 we're gonna go in here we're gonna
walk around we're gonna see what we can
find what we're gonna the goal here is
to kind of give you a look and feel of
what it's about to be at the Consumer
Electronics Show this is where some of
the world's most innovative tech is
debuted and we're gonna walk around get
lost which is the best of all I'm gonna
get law you guys always tell me to get
lost we're gonna do it as CES which is
really cool so let's go see what we can
find
I think I might have just seen one of
coolest pieces of tech I've seen yet on
the showroom floor and it's a
collaboration between Intel and Oakley
now Intel is not new to the wearables
scene but they've teamed up with Oakley
to bring you a piece of wearable that's
gonna give you telemetry on various
types of sports like jogging running and
cycling you guys know I'm a cyclist I'm
doing the best I can to try and monitor
all of the miles the climbs the
suffering score the heart rate and now
having all of this built into sunglasses
sunglasses are very similar to ones I
already own is a big deal because they
have a built-in Bluetooth connection to
whatever computer you're running on your
smart device and headphones built into
them like earbuds style and you can run
them independently or have both them in
your ear at the same time but it's also
voice-activated so if you want to know
what your current segment speed is or
what your performance is it will tell
you in real-time messing around with the
computer mounted to your handlebars is
not only cumbersome but it's also
dangerous to take your hands off your
handlebars when you're moving at full
speed
earlier this year I took a look at the
LGB 6p which is an amazing OLED TV or
organic LED now it meets all the
standards if you expected HDR 10 Dolby
HDR but we're looking at here behind me
is actually Sony's version of an OLED
panel so now we're starting to see some
competition in the OLED space which is
huge because that's going to allow
pricing to start coming down and because
of that now you're going to have more
options in the industry now this one
also has a really unique design where
the back what looks like kind of a
leaning stand is actually a subwoofer is
a subwoofer built into the flat panel TV
which is great because normally when you
have a thin form-factor TV you don't get
good sound to go along with it in your
forest with some sort of an external
audio solution but you might actually
have sound on this TV that's worth
talking about with a built-in subwoofer
now if you want to mount it on the wall
it just collapses on itself then you use
the bravia accessories to mount it on to
wall mounts and how many details about
whether or not it's proprietary or not
like LG had earlier last year or even in
2015 rather but we gotta wait because
this is super-secret they wouldn't give
me any details they wouldn't give me any
of the nits information they wouldn't
tell me any details about the oil ad
technology they're using so it's one of
those situations once again as CES where
we have to learn more about it later in
the year what I thought was worth
talking about because I have never seen
a subwoofer built in to an ultra-thin
flat panel TV and what the subwoofer on
the back folded in
it's about as thick as a standard LCD TV
when they first launched with flat panel
tech
you guys know I want to take my reviews
to the next level so I wandered over
here to the FLIR booth where they
actually just handed me out a FLIR one
with a lightning connector and what this
does is this allows me to connect a FLIR
camera to my smartphone turning my
smartphone into an infrared imaging
camera so now I can start looking at
temperature differences on PCBs and
motherboards graphics cards whatever
water loops even so that we can start
doing more in-depth testing we have a
visual representation of what's
happening with the temperatures and not
just me telling you it's 50 C 50 C
doesn't mean anything if you don't know
what's happening around it so we can see
how much that 50 C is affecting the
neighboring parts and components on your
PCB overclocking we can see visual temps
on V RMS on motherboards I'm really
excited about incorporating this into my
review lineup so yeah it's actually not
that expensive either I believe it's
about two hundred and fifty dollars this
is already on market it's not one of
those we have to wait till later to see
it but it also supports lightning cable
as well as micro USB so you can turn any
smartphone into a forward-looking
infra-red that is pretty awesome
okay cases man it's hard to shop for a
case I'll tell you but we're over here
at in wind right now checking out
someone the latest that they have to
offer and this is the Tao to point O in
wind has come a long way in the years
that they've been around and the Tao 2.0
is kind of like their this is what the
best we have to offer is to the
community it's got to 360 radiator
support it's got touch sensors on the
front for the buttons not actual buttons
they're touch sensors on there and all
of the glass on here is beveled glass
it's diamond-cut it is mirrored as well
so when the system is on if it's lit
inside you can see inside the system but
as soon as you turn it off it turns into
a mirrored finish not just a blacked out
piece of tempered glass all these angles
and things on there make it look
absolutely phenomenal availability and
pricing on this is still not announced
but you can definitely assure yourself
that a premium product like this is
going to carry a premium price tags so
we'll be looking for that here hopefully
in q1 but again no hardship date on
so we'll keep we'll keep an eye out I
rarely talk about fans but n when is
showing something here that I find very
very interesting they have a new fan
coming out here called the Aurora
it's a daisy-chained modular system and
actually of selling this as a kit that
comes with three fans a remote control
the control box and two LED strips now
what's the big deal about that we'll
check this out it has software that you
can use inside your system to control it
if you want USB connected to the
breakout box here but it also has a
remote control that you can use to
change things like the different modes
that are in there fans speed is also
controlled on here you can turn your
fans up and down it's got this little
rocket ship button rocket ship button so
that when you push that be fans
regardless of whatever mode you're in
are going to ramp up to their fastest
speed so that's almost like the go baby
go button if you will but you can
control the brightness of these with the
remote control as well and you can put
it in auto mode there are some pretty
crazy modes on this I mean if you guys
want to check out different sorts of
wave patterns colors you name it there's
a lot of options on this tons and tons
of modes as you can see we got a little
bit of a wave effect going there but the
best part about this is the fact that
these are daisy changing so no longer do
you have to run an individual fan cable
to every single fan say you're doing a
radiator says it's got 480 rad there's
four fans for power cables and unless
you're going to be cutting those and
soldering them together and then they're
only good for that one particular
situation you can now hook your fan up
have your cable going to the fan and
then daisy chain them with these small
cables and in the kit it also includes
the extensions as well so you can get
the first fan plugged in wherever you
want it this is gonna be a huge deal
when it comes to water cooling and
keeping things tidy in your system now
we're looking at maybe a cutie launched
on this it's the worst part about CES is
some of the stuff we're looking at we
can't get right now so things like
pricing again have no information for
you on that but I can tell you they do
come as a kit don't know anything about
the bearing that's in there but they
also have a rubber shock mount on the
sides of the fans reducing vibration and
such like that I can't tell anything
about volume of them either we're in
such a loud environment have no idea how
loud they are but you can bet your but
I'm gonna be checking these out in the
future
there is so much to bring you I guys
hope you guys kind of like the walk
through there the sort of a look and
feel of CES there's always so much to
cover
once again a huge thank you to our
sponsors for bringing us here for CES
