we're going to kind of take a break from
some of the 960 coverage that is
probably really blowing up your sub
boxes so unfortunately we are going to
be doing two more 960 videos so make
sure you guys wait for that we're doing
the EVGA SSC as well as the msi gaming
so anyway today's topic guys we're gonna
be talking about the Asus Strix tactic
pro gaming keyboard it's got a lot of
macros on it EVGA ACX 2.0 cooler with
its three phase six slot motor 11 swept
fan blades and double ball bearing
design offers reduced power
noise and thermals for the optimum
gaming experience click the link in the
description to learn more alright so one
of the things you may have noticed right
away
orange LEDs now I like orange and yellow
and those types of colors if that wasn't
obvious by the system that I built but
that's the only color available is
orange now why is that well because the
Strix color theme is orange just like
ROG is red and black the Strix color is
orange because Strix OWL orange is
aggressive it's obviously their theme I
like it but maybe orange isn't your cup
of tea just want to put it out there
real quick you cannot get this thing in
any other LED colors alright so moving
forward let's go ahead and talk about
what makes this keyboard I'm not going
to say unique is it interesting it's
really hard to make a unique keyboard or
Mouse today because it seems like
everybody makes them so everyone is
trying really hard to kind of get a
foothold and what makes their keyboard
or mice or headset better than the
competitors there's a couple things on
this keyboard that I personally like
more so than other brands that I've been
trying out and I'll make sure that I
cover those now first things first this
is a full-size keyboard with obviously
all of your alphanumeric keys you have
also got your d-pad and your 10 key on
here so it's not a 10 keyless I prefer a
full-size keyboard like this but you
also have two rows of macro keys for 10
macro keys over
here and you have eight programmable
macro / F keys along the top of the
number row but we also have three macro
keys that are right here next to the
spacebar all of which have a different
shape and feel to them
you have smooth you have a dot in the
middle and then you have one that has
kind of an angle on the side so it makes
it really easy to identify without
looking which one you're actually
pushing with your thumb
now who would care about that well FPS
shooters really not going to care about
that for the most part FPS you'd here's
to use WASD eqe are real og for grenade
efore use spacebar and control for
crouch and that kind of is the only
buttons FPS gamers usually care about
but all of these macro functions and all
these macro keys definitely would be an
incentive and to buy this for the MOBA
gamer like League of Legends dota 2 I
don't know what other mobile games are
are really I don't play MOBA but the
MMORPG R yeah MMORPGs tend to have a lot
of different functions and a lot of
triggers you know a lot of spells that
trigger other things and procs and
cooldowns and whatnot that all have a
lot of buttons going on so sometimes you
can write a macro or record a macro on
here
program it to a key and then you can
actually have one key press do multiple
things and programmable delays which is
again not unique to this keyboard but
the thumb macro keys on here
are definitely a plus I wish more
companies did that now one of the things
that also makes this keyboard really
nice is the fact that it does have
multimedia buttons on here once again
not unique but it has something on here
that I personally don't see very often
and I wish more brands did and that is a
volume that is a sliding or not slider
but a rolling scroll button on here I
know that there are positive and
negative buttons for volume control on
lots of different brands but I
personally prefer the scroll on top of
that you also have a play/pause button
for your multimedia movies and videos
you've got a mute button on there maybe
someone walked in and you need to mute
something really quick I don't know I'm
I'm not going to judge I'm just giving
some scenarios here but then you've also
got your rewind and your fast-forward
one thing I would have liked to have
seen though is instead having a
dedicated mute button maybe pushing the
actual scroll wheel itself is also a
button we're pushing it would toggle the
mute that would have been kind of kind
of a nice feature of course it has the
things like you would expect any key
roll over six key roll over four no
ghosting of mechanical key presses and
that is pretty much it I mean you've got
your you can control macros right here
on the keyboard with the right alt
button it's also a macro record function
and then you also have three profile
buttons up here that also serve as the
print screen scroll lock and break slash
pause button on there so you can switch
between different profiles and all of
these different macro keys now the
software is really easy to use it's very
intuitive it's very easy to record your
macros it's very easy to set delays and
all that sort of stuff they don't throw
a lot of over complicated software type
of built-in functionality it's very
intuitive very easy to use now there's
one thing this keyboard doesn't have
technically two things this keyboard
doesn't have that I would have liked to
have seen one a detachable cable would
have been nice that seems to be the norm
lately detachable cables so that if
you're gonna be traveling with it you
don't have to wrap it up and put all
that extra Bend on there even though it
has a really nice kind of a gooseneck on
there to keep you from bending it or
fraying it or breaking the cable but a
detachable cable is certainly something
I would like to see the other thing this
doesn't have that would have really
enjoyed is a USB built in hub even if it
was only USB 2.0 because it's nice to
have a quick place to plug in things
like thumb drives or other peripherals
or whatever on the keyboard so that you
can have less cluttered space on your
desk and just have it built in USB 2.0
or USB 3.0 would have been very nice but
other than that on the bottom I forgot
to mention it does have two four six
eight rubber feet on there so this thing
is not going to be sliding all over your
desk as you're getting very into your
games it also has rubberized feet on the
pop-up legs so that once again it's not
going to be sliding all over the place
this keyboard looks very nice it's got a
nice matte black finish I personally
like the orange LEDs that are built-in
maybe you don't I mean it is definitely
a personal style when it comes to color
would have been nice to maybe be able to
toggle it or maybe have a white version
but just orange it's all they've got
once again it's kind of the Strix
colored theme but yeah there it is guys
the not a whole lot to say about a
keyboard types really nice it's
available in four switch colors black
red blue and brown if you guys aren't
familiar with what those switch colors
are make sure you check out video I'm
going to put up on the screen right here
it is a video I did about all the
different Cherry MX colors and how they
feel and the weights and whether they
have tactile bumps or clicks or whatever
so you guys can know what the difference
between red blue green or red blue black
black and brown Bracke Bracke and brown
guys so you'll know what those actually
mean when you're making your choices so
what do you guys think about this
keyboard what keyboard are you using put
it down in the comments so other people
can kind of get an idea of what to shop
for when it comes to a very saturated
market like gaming keyboards if you've
ever been to a Fry's I'm gone to the
keyboard section you've know it's a huge
amount of keyboards available to the
market and this is just another one
that's definitely worth taking a look at
I like the feel of it I like the size of
it I'm probably taking this one a PDX
land with me which I'll be heading to in
February
it's amazing gaming keyboards easy to
type on so there you go guys Strix
tactic Pro keyboard from Asus one other
thing I want to ask you guys real
quickly here head on over to the forums
forum jsut since calm I'll be putting a
link in the description of this video to
this keyboard discussions you guys can
talk about it over there if you want
without the comment getting lost down in
the comments below this video
and one other thing I want to ask is
what kind of water cooling videos do you
guys want me to cover in the future I
think the most requested water cooling
video I have is without a doubt a how to
bend acrylic tubing video ever since I
did it on skunk works people have
definitely wanted to learn more about
how to bend acrylic tubing but other
than that I'm kind of I'm kind of lost
on where I want to go with some more
water cooling tutorials so tell me what
you guys think
I've kind of missed or should revisit
when it comes to water cooling style
videos because it kind of has been a
niche of mind that many people have come
to me as a water cooling resource and I
know I've been lacking on those videos
here in the in the past so there we go
guys Jays two cents taking a look at the
Strix tactic pro keyboard check it down
check it out down in the description if
you guys want to learn more information
or pricing at the amazon link and as
always guys I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
