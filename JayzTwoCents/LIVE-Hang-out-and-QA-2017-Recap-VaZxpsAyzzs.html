why am I doing this stream oh I know why
because all the videos I've currently
got in production or edited or online or
whatever can go live yet so I wanted to
at least give you guys something
although it's crits it's my cringy face
on a camera
nick is over there in his chair you can
turn say hi Nick how the thing is like
perfectly blocking your face I've gotta
bend down
you can't go down hey there's Nick his
one job is to ban you if you're stupid
so there you go that's his only job but
I figured while we listen to the piano
instructor next door playing it's
actually not him playing it's a student
that's why it sucks but I figure we just
kind of hang out and do a year-end recap
thingamabob and talk with you guys and
see what's up J I love you you're better
than the lioness this isn't a better
than this is that nothing to do it
better than you need to snap out of that
mentality that's a stupid way to live
alright notice you you're noticed now
you can go hi from Sweden update on the
post build yeah we're starting in and
we're gonna start an early q1 next year
we had to get way to get past CES he's
gonna finish his album and all that
stuff and considering this build is
based on his album I need the album to
come out so that I can get the
inspiration from the album for the build
that's how that works
do you hate Nick Nick do I hate you okay
that was easy
uh hello from Croatia
Wow that's what I'm surprised my
internet actually works that far away
the internet works shut up the chats
moving too fast again I hate that Nick
is better than Jay at some things like
today we did we just determined that he
is better at cooking finger foods than I
am it's one victory yeah those are the
things you're better at than me sleeping
whining complaining
no.not wow I'm better than you oh well
[Laughter]
oh boy
Jay you have a dead pixel on your lip
it's more than one pixel actually it's
like eight ABC World News is on so no
live show for me
Wow you must have an exciting life sir
sorry can't watch ABC World News is
going
we can't wait to watch that Dan Rather
guy wait didn't he retire anyway
can you guys hear the piano listen
we have we get to listen to that all
afternoon fortunately we do our filming
in the morning so by the time the
afternoon rolls around what not to deal
with that also it's louder up here in
the second story then it is down there
isn't it Nick yeah Nick stop playing
minesweeper so plain my super in fact I
told him just play a game or whatever I
was like he should be over there playing
games when I'm live-streaming he's like
no I'm gonna moderate the chat Mike okay
murdered with words it's anywhere really
as bad as people make it seem no it's
just you pay a premium for a company
like Alienware and that's what people
hate about alienware is the fact that
you were paying for the name on
something you could easily build
yourself for less that I mean that's
what people hate about it so I mean it's
the same off-the-shelf parts with the
exception of like some custom made
things like the cases and stuff like
that anyone could build anything any any
any system integrator is building and
selling you could build yourself it's
just whether or not you have the time
the patience to do custom mod work and
all that sort of things to make it look
that cool but I think there's some
pretty damn good stuff on the market
that you could build yourself but I do
also I do also advocate for pre-built
systems if you're the kind of guy that's
like I want a warranty so yeah there's
that well you already banned somebody
well you're fast he is he wields that
banhammer man he's got he doesn't have
that much job like description and ban
hammers one of them so don't piss him
off okay oh gosh here comes the super
chat I forgot about that J how's your
car doing cars are doing fine just needs
an alignment now when we do next minimum
versus recommended gaming PC video again
I was gonna do it with battlefront 2 and
I probably still will there was just so
much negative there was so much
negativity following around that lunch
because EA of course was being EA again
and dipping in everybody's pockets I
didn't really want to experiment
anything with EA but I haven't playing
the game I've been playing campaign
mostly because I love Star Wars and it's
not a bad game it's just it was a bad
publisher
hey J I was just curious as to when you
will be releasing your next video around
your small form-factor build with the
torque goes to s1 good question
V are the locus of torque the lok ghost
s1 or loci everyone says it's Loki
whatever the ghost s1 ok so that I have
early access to that case it's not
completely done yet there are some
changes they're making to it there's
some additional pieces I'm getting for
it that stuff is coming when they do
their mass production in early 2018 like
early early I think January so I've been
in discussion with them about that but
that will be coming later on and when
that does is what I'll be doing the
build I could technically build in it as
it sits now but I I kind of want a
silver one or a white one so I'm waiting
for that I have so many builds that are
like partially started right now don't I
Nikolas I said that so many builds are
like partially start like how many do we
have like three or four we have like
four builds that have started but can't
really go any farther yet which really
sucks yeah is essentially cancer for
games I think many people would agree
with that statement challenge for you J
do $150 gaming PC it's called a
smartphone off Craigslist can you make a
hackintosh guide nope I have no interest
in Natchitoches I could make one but I'm
not gonna what do you think about
deleting an i7 I don't personally deal
in my CPUs because my temperatures are
fine my 79 60x right here which you're
watching this on right now is a 16 core
32 thread running on a 360 radiator no D
lighting and when I'm when I am and it's
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz right now
and when I'm rendering and doing my
workflow and stuff it never exceeds like
49 see on the package and the cores will
reach like low 60s to high 50s that's
perfectly fine considering thermal
junction on these is like 95 C or
something like that
there's no reason for me to deal with it
there's no reason for me to take the
risk of damaging a $1700 CPU or whatever
it costs because I want to get a 5 or 10
C thermal reduction when I'm nowhere
near my limits as it is that's my that's
my thoughts on D lighting D lighting to
me is like something that the extreme
overclocker the guy that has to get the
absolute positive coldest and best
transfer of heat which is gonna be the
geyser do like lnto and World
overclocking attempts and stuff like
that that's not me so I don't have I
don't have the desire to take the risk
with that hope that answer makes sense
you know one of the best things that
came to market was that tool that
devourer made and he showed it to me a
couple years ago at CES it was like a
prototype at that time you remember that
Nick nobody came up to us at the
overclocking event and showed us his
prototype is a pretty damn awesome tool
making d-lighting something that's easy
for the random guy to want to be able to
do deleting where normally you do the
razor blade or the vise method or
whatever he's made it more mainstream
ever since then now the words i7 and D
lids seem to go hand in hand
we're I think like a lot of people just
throw around the whole deal a deal a
deal it without actually ever thinking
about D lighting and who it who it
really pertains to so that's kind of
been my opinion on it I haven't needed
to deal with anything so I'm not going
to dealing with something that also
became more talked about what the night
Ivy Bridge but posts that has well where
there was just such a bad application of
thermal material for the IHS with Intel
that it became a necessity at that point
even for standard clocks but it's we're
not really there right now my opinion
Moscow 239 watching comrade J's okay hi
da rocket 88 is awesome is it I've no
idea what that is
where's post Malone's build I'm not
answering the post Malone question
anymore I've answered it enough it's up
to you to go find the answers now J are
you gonna go make a rise in to build
as you did with the 1800 X sir risin -
did I miss something probably CES launch
right I didn't really pay too much
attention Jay do you like trip Lee
what's tripley you don't know all he did
was mumble so I have no idea if he knows
or not how fun is pub G I played two
matches total and that was when I was
testing like the budget build is this at
the studio no everything you see behind
me is a green screen yes I'm at the
studio let's see oh shit what up yo what
up lean I got a fart just I you should
know what is the quietest not a GPU non
water-cooled the one that runs zero rpm
on the fans hey Jay I got a Corsair 750d
is this fine for custom water cooling
and GPU and CPU I feel like I've failed
I feel like I have failed if if that
question has to be asked if you can fit
radiators in it then it's probably good
enough Jay do you suspect mainstream
Bowl to being launched soon I don't know
I mentioned that in my video and a lot
of people contradicted me saying that
there's a difference there is a
different family of GPUs coming from
Nvidia that's not technically volta I
don't know well we see HBM from Nvidia
and mainstream I think it intent
it has everything to do with cost of
manufacturing and whether or not the
cost of manufacturing is gonna allow it
to come to market under $1,000 per GPU
yes the Titan was 1200 yes the Titan was
always at least a thousand and but that
wasn't that wasn't the main demographic
you know more 10 50s and 10 60s cell
than any other GPU and I don't think
they're gonna be able to provide HBM at
that price range so I think we'll see an
HBM variant but I don't think we're
gonna see like a stack of HBM and I
think we're gonna see like a new 2000
series stack of HBM j which opinion on
the msi is e 270 n3 gaming motherboard
it's a motherboard and it's 4z 270 I'm
really indifferent to
stuff like that I mean a motherboards a
motherboard to get one that looks good
has good reviews has a well-built vrm
and has a decent network card on it has
a decent sound card whatever and if it
meets those needs for you then you're
good to go
I I don't spend a lot of time really
getting too caught up in motherboard
tech would you do you do you think
that's a fair answer do you think I
answered that truthfully like the way we
go through stuff here and then the logic
we imply when we build our stuff here
yeah and we've got a lot of really cool
motherboards but I don't I don't find
like my need of like I'm gonna be using
the rampage for myself but that's only
because quite honestly I like the
lighting effects stuff on it so it came
down to that superficial of a decision
the new Strix X $2.99 no I'm sorry not
Strix it's the rampage apex X 299 but I
don't like the angles and stuff that are
cut into it but that would have been
perfect for the Cougar build like if I
didn't do thread Ripper on that one that
would have been perfect is it wouldn't
match the case with all the angles and
stuff cut into the motherboard but I
don't like that so that's a reason why I
wouldn't use that motherboard hi and tie
it into the aesthetic for sure what do
you think about the x-29 dark the EVGA
offering Windows XP what did you say XP
support well I think it's awesome that
they're off the XP support my thoughts
on the X 299 dark they have made some
changes in the design of that case ever
since we saw it at Computex and although
it's a fantastic case aesthetically I'm
not that pleased with it
III don't like the design choice of it
anymore I feel like so here's here's
where I feel we kind of are with EVGA
and their motherboards EVGA s
motherboards
in terms of sorry I'm noticing all this
dust in my keyboard now it's bothering
me we don't we don't turn these lights
on very often so now I'm looking at my
keyboard the date I'm going to
you ever done that he warned you like
crap anyway EVGA had over the last three
years or so has been some of the most
rock-solid motherboards that I've ever
used in terms of overclocking in terms
of just day-to-day stability and just
knowing that that that motherboard is
going to work what I feel like EVGA has
really lacked is a is a real good
aesthetic element to their motherboards
they're very minimalistic in fact the X
299 boards like the for the 1k is the
first time they put LED lighting of any
sort on their motherboards in a long
time like any sort of lighting effects I
don't know that I might like cue codes
and trouble lighting and stuff like that
I'm talking about like a lighting effect
that particular design they went with is
definitely against the grain some love
it some hate it the dark for instance
has gold trim and it has the vrm fans
built onto it and I feel like it's and
this is getting a chance to kind of know
Vincent a little bit kingpin who
designed this motherboard I under
Section / forum but I'm personally like
50/50 on that and whereas the
motherboards were very plain in the past
they I feel like they that know they're
trying to apply a design aesthetic I
feel like they are on rocky ground with
me in terms of like how good the
motherboards look like the further 1k is
all right especially if you just set the
LEDs to a static color or turn them off
all together I feel like the dark kind
of went way out in the left-field for me
so that's my personal opinion and my fan
of RGB and in your opinion what is the
best CPU I can't answer your best CPU
question that's that's really big in my
fan of RGB I think it's kind of a silly
question everyone should be a fan of RGB
whether you want it to be in in disco
mode like my keyboard is at all times
because I never really changed it the
point of RGB is not to go out there and
be a rainbow puke the point is to show
that there's a spectrum of lighting and
you could choose any color that you want
within that spectrum it's just the best
way to demonstrate that is by putting it
in demo mode where it's about all the
LEDs dancing around anyone who's like
I'm so sick
our GB really means they're sick of the
RGB marketing but they should never be
sick of RGB because it gives you a true
choice in color if you if you've ever
had a red keyboard with red lighting
only and one day you're like man I
really wish I had white keyboard you
gotta go buy a new keyboard if you have
our GB you just change the color and
you're good to go so anyone that says I
hate RGB is full of shit what they
actually mean is they hate our GB
marketing that's on the new Tesla
Roadster Oh as a guy who really likes
the internal combustion engine it's
really hard to argue with those numbers
right I said for a long time that they
should make a sports car and I'm glad
that they finally did well I own one
probably never because of the price the
price puts it well out of my my range
that's for sure when do you think ddr4
prices are going to go down oh man I
have no idea
ddr4 pricing is ridiculous we have seen
it double in the last year and a half
double double that is ridiculous
does disabling hyper-threading and
modern CPUs lower temp and power like
back in Holliman Sandy Bridge days of
course of course it does why would that
change it's still hyper threading the
CPUs are a little bit more efficient but
it's still hyper today do you feel you
announced the post Malone build too soon
no I don't because if you remember Terry
Crews bill took five months it took five
months to do that but what I have to
remember too is a lot of diehard post
Malone fans came flooding the channel
thinking they were gonna see a build
right then in there and they had been
nagging the shit out of me ever since
and I've actually started blocking
and/or muting people that are like
constantly nagging about it it's
unfortunate but I'm tired of every time
I go to my social media I've got a sift
through 50 where's the post Malone
builds to find an actual comment worth
interacting with Colonel Coolermaster
vertical GPU brackets your thoughts my
thoughts are they make your GPU vertical
right it's fair
which minis you 270 board is best for OC
I don't know I haven't really looked
into mini-itx stuff too much I have to
start looking at mini ITX though for Zee
370 because I'm probably gonna have
doing like a I'm probably ended up doing
I can 8700 K or maybe 280 600 K inside
of that ghost s1 case but yeah I haven't
paid too much attention does your kid
wants fear Oh for Christmas I'm gonna
say no because I don't recall ever
hearing her mentioned Sphero I have no
idea what Sphero is what is fear she has
never mentioned that does it work on
tile she's never mentioned that like one
time is the FX 95 90 good for gaming no
it's terrible for gaming but it is
excellent for pornography what does Nix
PC has in it well the one he's on right
there it's technically not his PC it's
just a computer that's still built it's
actually the one that Jerry built in our
build challenge remember that the one
that's got the naked ladies on the front
and the scoop and all that stuff he's
still using that one he's PC at home I
believe has a set one of them has a 7700
K the one you built yeah
so be 700 K it's got a 980 TI in it the
780 oh wow everyone's gonna tell me that
I'm a terrible boss because you're using
a 780 you know this right it's your own
you guys know that Luke over at Linus
tech tips doesn't get just to get to
just take home GPUs right I mean people
don't realize that I think what people
don't realize is all that stuff down
there doesn't belong to meet personally
either it belongs to the corporation as
far as I'm concerned that's the way it's
handled so a it's insured it's not mine
that's the way I see it even though I
own the business it's different okay so
anyway so it's a 780 with a 7700 K man
that's a weird match that's really okay
anyway moon Ford was the 16 gigs of ram
ddr4 so using that NZXT case the n6780 n
the
I gave you yeah and it's water-cooled
it's one with rigid tubing but we did
right oh it's flex tubing now yeah and
then the other rig you have is the one I
built him that video I I built him it's
a yeah eighty was it was it 5820k Oh
5820k I mean remember 5820k 980ti
and it has others parts in it the
problem is we've done so many builds and
have actually like dealt with so many
parts since then it's hard to like
remember what went where yeah yeah
so we have an inventory speaking of GPUs
and how many GPUs we have that's funny
last time I counted the inventory there
were 76 we had 76 graphics cards but
that's not all of them it doesn't it
doesn't include the new the three extra
Titans that just arrived from my build
in post build yeah it doesn't include
that 1080 classified sitting right there
on the table I mean technically that's
Brian's but huh see there's a graphics
card sitting on the table right there
yeah that's Brian it doesn't include the
two 1080 T eyes that are in both those
bills are there the one under your desk
and the one on top so it's quite closer
to 80 GPUs I'm getting ready to offload
the lower and lower end stuff the older
teared stuff like all the 90 DT is and
all that stuff I'm getting ready to
offload all that either give away sell
whatever to make room because literally
our GPU like the section of the shelving
is ridiculously overstuffed whereas Tech
Talk it is on hiatus for holidays as
soon as we're done with CES the show is
going to come back with full force we
just with all of the deadlines and
projects I'm working on and stuff right
now Thursday was just really hard Jerry
got sick and so it's one of those things
where it's like let's just bring it back
in January that made better sense
have you ever stacked all of them up in
a graphics card pyramid no cuz it fell
it would kill somebody Jay you should be
mining you'd be making millions of
Bitcoin do you think I can make millions
when I pay 20 28 cents a kilowatt-hour
here no no
I don't care about that don't care about
any of that crap I'm pretty indifferent
when it comes to cryptocurrency like I
have a friend that's constantly asking
me about cryptocurrency and it's like
he's like do you hate cryptocurrency I
was like no he's a grill you don't hate
it
no I don't hate it he's like oh cuz I
thought like guys like you and gamers
and stuff like hate cryptocurrency I
said what I hate was what happened to
the market because of it but I don't
hate cryptocurrency at all I mean I'm
indifferent why would I hate it it's
just it's another thing that as of right
now is not affecting me it's still not
affecting the paper dollar which
although it's worth noting technically I
just have no interest in cryptocurrency
mining I wish I had bought like a
hundred coins back when they were like
300 bucks you know I would have totally
dropped like $3,000 on that or three
300,000 I buy a hundred coins in there
300 bucks such that's three thousand
right or is it thirty thousand no three
thousand add the zero something zeros
are there it costs money okay I would
have I would have bought a hundred coins
back when they were that much sure of
course why not but hindsight anyone
could say they would invest blah blah
blah when they saw the return GPU give
away please absolutely Igor but you are
now disqualified from the giveaway
because you suggested it I hate it
graphics card expensive I guess you
can't really argue with that can you
Ajay's Oh get it but a significant
pressure on the motherboard to unscrew
and MDOT to heatsink on an asus
motherboard those those screws are very
fine I don't know if I would necessarily
like put that much force on it 30 so 100
coins at 300 100 a piece would be 30,000
I'd still think it's worth it
any chance you want to get liquored up
and place yes I want to get liquored up
I don't wanna play CS Kyle just posted
video man versus build the tank versus
build the tank what don't do drugs okay
if you just put up the tank video then
awesome if you guys watch it
I wrecked my neck in that video it still
hurts today it was worth it though how
the fuck you choose and how to reply
whatever comment I look at and read is
the one I reply to and unfortunately it
sounds like you were trying to get my
attention and that's the one you got and
that's the answer you got so you kind of
be kind of wasted yours notice me senpai
J how old are you and Nick I'm old
enough nick is barely old enough am i
old enough to drink what a stupid
question I think you know the answer
that what's your thoughts on the Jedi
Order GPU aesthetic wise I think it
looks like a lightsaber and I think it's
kind of cool yeah but it's Nvidia the
head get green in there somewhere right
I mean sure they have the red one but
for the for the dark side but still okay
so let me tell you what I kind of hate
uh that doesn't really narrow it down
does it I hate everything but when it
comes to Star Wars GPUs and all that I
am sick I am really sick of all of the
companies that try and cash in on the on
the hype of Star Wars every time a new
Star Wars movie comes out or nears you
see all the Star Wars edition everything
the Star Wars edition cereal Nissan's
entire rogue campaign last year all of
Nissan in 2020 16 the Nissan Rogue come
on they even have Star Wars edition okay
because they're because they happen to
having it a crossover car that had the
same name as rogue one right in video
with the Star Wars GPUs whatever okay I
really don't care but we're seeing it
obviously right now all the Star Wars
stuff and things that otherwise wouldn't
care because they're just trying to cash
in on a pop culture and I personally
kind of hate that headaches question
mark no neck aches I slept wrong and
tweaked my neck and I don't think eyes
know this I have have ailments NYX
laughing as you know that's true I have
ailments and and particularly back
problems and neck problems that stem
from a really bad car accident in 2008
and every now and then I get really bad
neck pain even though I get regular
adjustments and stuff just happened to
it just happened to sleep on it wrong
today I actually woke up to the crack in
my neck when I when I tweaked it and
that's why I keep turning like this to
look at NIT because I can't really turn
my head right now and you know neck pain
travels up into a headache so yes Star
Wars razor blades were they're really
Star Wars last Jedi sucks
when no one cares about your opinion sir
which is why I didn't say whether or not
I liked the movie so movie opinions are
like assholes you all have won in they
all stink it's just some of us wipe our
assholes a little better than others I
didn't look at you when I said that
because I'm implying that you don't I'm
just saying that like you know the
people that are the saltiest tend to
have the the worst wiped buttholes which
at that point I guess mine should be
pretty Chaffey by now what's the deal
with 10 70s or what where to go what's
the deal with 10 70s going back up in
price I don't know 1700 XR 7700 K gets
depends on what you're doing I think day
to day usage in gaming and stuff like
that you'd have a hard time ever
noticing a difference between the two
but if you're doing something that
actually needs 16 logical cores than
17-hundred x is a logical choice to to
did there I kind of snuck that out
you're gonna notice it in a minute
would you ever do another build-off yeah
it's a series that we're gonna be doing
and probably gonna be doing it like once
a quarter so like four of them a year
you can't do them that often you'll run
out of contestants to do it with and
it'll just lose any of its excitement so
yeah one plus also had a Star Wars
edition phone Jesus J if you go to 8700
K can you share what mainboard you would
consider thanks if you tell about the
ITX build I mentioned I I will do a
video about all of that so and why I
chose the part I chose where's Little J
do unboxings again Little J is not
exactly little anymore and now she would
just be like watching any older kid
unbox something and then kind of be
complaining about it she she's eight
going on 18 I'm telling you she is
literally just like the most opinionated
little punk there ever was she is
definitely my daughter why don't you
talk about max or other Apple stuff on
the channel pcs preference I had my
MacBook Pro I hardly ever use it but PC
is preference and a lot of people don't
really seem to understand this but I
tend to talk about things I like on this
channel
I don't talk about things I don't like
for the sake of talking about them for
the channel that's why my channel
doesn't grow the fastest so it's why I
don't get the most views but I can say
that I'm the most interested in my
content because that's why I make it
there are lots of decisions I could make
that would that would make me have a
little bit more viral growth or would
push me towards 2 million subscribers
faster or put me over that you know that
next milestone of 10 million views a
month or whatever if I made choices that
were sacrificing things I you know like
cared about and I don't wanna do that
I'd have never done that in the last
five years I've been doing this and I'm
not going to so that's why I don't talk
about max good example it's why I also
don't talk about smartphones are
necessarily consoles I those stuff I
have I had my phone there's a
PlayStation Pro you guys use the box
there there it is there's a box for the
PlayStation Pro but we don't talk about
those things on the channel because
we're not passionate about
I say we Brian is super passionate about
that stuff I am not so it's just things
I use here and there not enough for me
to ever talk about do you think
developers will optimize their games for
AMD GPUs what a silly question
what a silly question why do I think
that's a silly question should I
elaborate on that Nick yeah
because every single game developer does
optimize in some way for both sides of
the GPUs but they're both GPU families
AMD and NVIDIA but you yeah Indian video
but would you understand is it requires
the companies to send their engineers
and representatives to the developers
like AMD and NVIDIA have to send people
like physically plant them in the office
with these developers and spend time
with them one on one to do the
optimizations now they also will send
code and things via email or Dropbox or
however they distribute it right for
them to do optimization but what it
really takes to truly optimize a game is
for the graphics engineers to be
one-on-one hands-on with the developers
to get every ounce of performance out of
it the problem is every game developer
I've talked to several of them this year
alone have mentioned that AMD has not
been spending the money to send
engineers is often or as frequent as
they need to truly optimize for the
hardware so what you're getting is very
lackluster slow response where NVIDIA
has been sending teams to the developers
to get things optimized now does that
make Nvidia a bad guy absolutely not
because it's exactly what AMD should be
doing but AMD hasn't been doing it to
the level that they need to so that is
why when you hear this bla bla bla game
is more optimized more optimized for
NVIDIA you're absolutely right because
NVIDIA invested the time energy and
money and the people to make sure that
that happens
AMD needs to do it as well games are
agnostic listen to me even if even if a
game developer receives money from one
company or the other to optimize for a
game they do not and I repeat
they do not sabotage the competition
because the game developer is still
independent from Nvidia sure the money
helps them but they want everybody
playing their game everybody on
regardless of what the hardware is so it
is to their best benefit to make sure
that the game runs as good as it
possibly can on both sides
it's just when a developer has to take
the hardware in and take the drivers and
reverse-engineer them and stuff to get
them to work on one cut cards you know
one company's card and you have to do
that internally versus letting the GPU
manufacturer do that for them and then
send them the code which do you think
it's gonna be more beneficial and have
more return on that investment if AMD
would just send the team's more often
and actually had the means to do it and
my understanding is that there just
haven't been the teams to send you would
see a lot of this you see a lot less of
this discussion of AMD is is being
sabotaged in this and that I guarantee
you that's not happening that's exactly
what's happening in the industry right
now do I think there were more DirectX
titles in the near future will it be a
long time I think we've already seen
first hand that they are not going back
really and taking old titles and
updating them to DirectX 12 but titles
that have launched since dx12 has come
out usually have a dx12 mode yeah so of
course I think more dx12 titles are
going to come out but I think a lot of
people would agree that dx12 was not
adopted as quickly as DX 11 was when it
first came out not entirely sure why
that is but when when we move from DX 10
in DX 10 C and all that stuff to D X 11
it was like overnight huge differences
for gaming didn't really happen with DX
12 nearly as fast J I'm so close to
graduating what area of IT looks good
for a job the one that interests you
more man I can't answer that for you if
you're gonna just follow the money
you're not gonna be happy anyway you've
got to find your career your career path
and whatever sub-genre of IT that you
want that interests you and you think
it's exciting it would make it fun to go
to work every day
if you go into programming because
you're like programmers can start making
120,000 dollars a year or whatever it is
here in the United States but you hate
programming you're not gonna be a good
programmer you're not gonna last long
you're gonna burn out you're gonna do
something else anyway if you love
networking though then become a network
systems engine system network engineer
whatever get your Cisco cert all that
sort of stuff but you got to talk you
you've got to really figure that out for
yourself do I have a degree I do not I
do not have a degree
I used to regret that I used to regret
not getting my degree I looked at it as
one of those like checkmarks you're
supposed to check off in life until
having long discussions with Brian some
of you have seen Brian he's the really
energetic guy that appears having done
that in my videos he's my brand manager
he's actually the guy that helps me
communicate with brands and get deals
and signed contracts and stuff so I
could go back to making videos for you
guys and not spending all day on the
phone and on email and stuff he's the
guy that's directly responsible for me
running this business he's the guy that
pushed me into quitting my job and doing
all of this he's the guy I built that
computer for and surprised him with
that's Brian and I used to really regret
not getting my degree now his wife is a
doctor of Education she's worked for
school districts and she's a professor
and she's the first person he and she
they're a team right they do everything
together they're they're very much so
they're very much dedicated to the
education of I guess humanity right but
they're also the first people that will
say that a formal college education is
not for everyone not everyone will
benefit from that
there's plenty plenty of people who've
gone and got their degree that thought
suddenly they were successful and they
be successful in life and they're
failing because their mindset the degree
does not make you smart the degree does
not make you a good worker and the
degree does not make you immediately
hireable it gets you an interview Nick
that's what it really truly gets you
today but what guys like me are able to
do is just is just perform and and make
the change changes on the fly and make
all of the adjustments I need to do to
be successful
education took too long getting my
degree too too long and I would school
for it but it was like I'm gonna it's
gonna take three to four years to get my
bachelor's and another two plus to get a
masters and another two plus to do a
doctor that's like that's I mean we're
talking eight years of my adult life to
be spent trying to get started it wasn't
for me and some people in my family
agreed with that some didn't but at the
same time look around today I'm happy
this there was a lot of luck involved
here but a formal college education in
my particular way of thinking and my
attitude they were not they were they
were oil and water that's all I can say
the s the the education establishment
and I did not get along so why I also
didn't graduate high school on time I
don't the love you don't know that I
failed my senior year of high school so
I ended up having to go to summer school
to graduate is what it is I don't I I
guess it kind of sucks so having never
walked I've never graduated I've never
walked with a cap and gown and I've
never received a diploma or any of that
stuff technically I have a high school
diploma but it was given to me like
through a window at the office when I
got it in the middle of summer school
session so it was like congratulations
you're graduated there's the door yeah
so whatever what makes you love
technology I don't know what makes
anyone love anything you can't answer
that question you can't just be like
this is why I love technology you just
know whether you're into cars you're
into games you're into tech or you're in
the aviation you're into whatever art
you know that's just the way you're
wired no luck knowledge and personality
wins every time I know a lot of Warren I
will argue with you on that but I know a
lot of people who are struggling to get
anywhere on YouTube who have both
knowledge and personality there is a
huge luck factor involved in this
otherwise you would see a hell of a lot
more people doing something like this
for a living
luck is absolutely a factor do i code
not really
J why does m/s hate PC gaming things in
the OS has been broken for so long
forced vsync resource hogging process
when gaming cig vard johan loan held mas
whatever your name is that you know you
can't take that problem and then just
deduce it down to microsoft hates gaming
it doesn't it doesn't work that way it
doesn't work that way
Microsoft is not optimizing for gaming
they are not going around checking code
and stuff to fix it for gaming because
gaming is not their focus gaming the
amount of people that actually gaming on
a PC versus the amount of PCs in the
world that are performing business I
think you'd be surprised with what those
numbers are and how small and
insignificant the gaming community truly
is to Microsoft when it comes to the
amount of systems that are out there
running in a professional environment
and that's not their focus and it's not
going to be it's not going to be I don't
think not what the changes they made
over the last couple of years doesn't
mean they hate gaming it's just a
reallocation of resources to where they
make their money it's called business
what's gonna be my next addition to my
370z my ass and the driver seat can you
recommend a cpu for your PC Intel
Celeron Baby J what do you think about
an i5 2400 whatever um I think it's a
computer and a GPU that's what I think
Nvidia ever gonna support freesync since
it's an option open standard and/or
state proprietary I think you know the
answer to that okay Edgar Hernandez says
my daily workload is 75% gaming and 25%
video rendering would you get the 89
hundred K or the 1900 X&amp;amp;Y 8900 K huh
that's that that's not out yet that's
must be the 8 core right I don't think
we have any information on that
they say three three ninety predictions
is 17 or cake or sixteen thread I 5/8
okay so I we're talking rumors here I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna even answer that
question
rumor has it you also have a thing for
astronomy do you I used to when I was
younger I used to love stargazing and
telescopes and going to the
observatories and stuff like that not
anymore I mean I ain't nobody got time
for that and unfortunately thanks at
least he replied Jay has not ah see I
just replied to you hey top 10 Union
there are currently two thousand one
hundred and seventy three people in here
there are currently chat messages coming
in at a rate of about twenty two chat
messages per second if you think for one
second I'm gonna sit here and read every
single one of them and just happen to
see yours then your your the the odds
are already against you but then for you
to go as far as to think that maybe I'm
ignoring you yeah you can you can GTFO
just say it what are your hobbies other
than the obvious what's the obvious
computers and cars computers and cars
weightlifting riding my bike hanging out
with my family avy I really am I getting
back into AV big time would you agree
yeah yeah the the sound system upstairs
now I know if you guys know this so when
I did my when I did the Atmos sound bar
so I've got a Sonos system throughout
the house when I did that video back in
like 2015 then I'll I'll let people
really got in an uproar over like why do
you have a shell or whatever somewhere
you guys ready for this I have a sound
bar on this computer right here look my
sound system on this computer is a sound
bar would you look at that so get
triggered anyway when I did the Sonos
video you chuckled Nick loves it when I
get Savage anyway when I did the Sonos
video the most common was like I don't
sound bar next a more stupid sound bar
so then I did the LG Atmos enabled sound
bar like last month once again there is
a sound bar now Mars
and we're getting a good sound system so
finally I said screw it and I went and I
bought my own 7.1 typically at seven
point two point two but whatever I
digress a deaf tech 9000 series signer
channel super cube subwoofer
floor-standing 9000 series speakers side
speakers rear speakers the whole thing I
haven't added the Atmos yet because I
actually want to add I'll actually
wanted to add those to the ceiling
properly and not bouncing off the
ceiling because I was like fine I have
not had a high-end sound system like
ever in my life I've never had a
high-end sound system so I find I was
like you know what screw it I love new
movies and stuff 4k I've got my LG OLED
z' and stuff I just went balls out
bought myself an early Christmas present
spent thousands of dollars on this sound
system and now any time comes anyone
comes to the house very late night
waiting for oh god yeah
so when anytime anyone comes over I drag
them upstairs and I make them sit down
and like listen to action scenes and
movies and stuff and everyone's just
like oh my god this sounds so good so
I've been getting into AV and I've been
considering doing a video about my dev
tech setup but I kind of don't want to
at the same time because I sort of just
don't want it I guess I don't want to be
a part of the audiophile community if
that makes sense
can I be an audio an audio enthusiast
can I be middle ground is that okay can
I be between the laymen and a and an
audiophile and just be an audio
enthusiast and be like I like good sound
can that be a thing I want to do a video
about it but not until I get the
overhead at most speakers installed
which I will do myself just like how
many people here watched that live
Twitter feed I did when I was while
mounting the TV and and sneaking the
Louisville behind the wall and drilling
out the wall and showing all that stuff
I thought that was a neat Twitter feed
but that was when I did it and I just
haven't decided yet how much of that I
want to share with the audience because
if you guys haven't noticed the audience
tends to take a lot of things that I
love and just destroy it it's like the
Joker the YouTube audience is basically
the Joker and I'm Batman they just want
to see the world burn yeah
so there's that the thing is no matter
what I buy no matter what I show
someone's gonna be like you did it wrong
or you got the wrong thing or that sucks
and they seem to forget that their
opinion truly doesn't mean anything my
opinion by itself doesn't mean anything
why do people why do people forget that
one person's opinion doesn't mean
anything
jeez Jay if you ever had a chance would
you trade your Nissan 370z for a Nissan
Skyline which skyline that's a fair
question right Nick yeah r34 absolutely
I wouldn't even hesitate even if the r34
needed a little work I see a little work
because if it needed a lot of work then
that will get really expensive fast look
the moment that our 34s are legally
available in California you know I'm
gonna be looking right yeah and so what
everyone else and what you think is
gonna happen to the price of them
they'll cost as much as in our 35 new
yeah although in January I get to go get
to go check out a mines are 32 mm-hmm JD
use the Mac for anything surfing the web
it's a nice seven Mac to our 34 yes our
33 is the sexy our 34 is the sexiest in
my opinion do I love living in SoCal I
love parts of living in California but I
am NOT a fan up there California's cost
of living and the government here
emissions is because they adopt carb
standards which are terrible and I also
like my guns I don't care if you like
guns or not your opinion doesn't matter
remember I just said that the California
hates everything I love
so energy costs are really high too
doorstop
what's a doorstop why do motherboards
have minimum ddr4 2660 of RAM when
there's 4,000 because as I've explained
the board's will automatically run the
base clock of a memory module which for
ddr4 for the longest time had been 2133
and now it's 2400 or 2666 some will run
at any advertised speed you see on a
stick of memory like ddr4 4000 or
whatever is the XMP profile or extreme
memory profile which is an overclock
I've said that so many times I've even
made videos about it I feel like that's
the most unknot understood part of PC
building for beginners is that the speed
you see on a memory stick is not the
speed at boot set how do I make a video
that people will see the problem is
viewership on YouTube sux lately it's
down it's down a lot ever since a new
algorithm it doesn't videos don't get
suggested as much people don't I know
the search just doesn't work as well
everything's down for everybody and now
there's like videos I want people to see
not because of views and because of ad
revenue it's because of the repetitive
questions of things I'm trying to answer
but nobody's seeing it why so serious
today I missed something
am I being more serious than normal Nick
yeah live J is is well it's live J do
you do you even lift bro is now do even
mine bro huh you know it's funny it's at
the gym there was a there was a bunch of
knuckleheads right just calm big bruiser
knuckleheads talking about
cryptocurrency mining it was actually
kind of funny it but but all their
information that they were talking about
was like incorrectly regurgitating
information they heard on NBC financial
or MSN financial whatever it is so they
were like using all the terminology
wrong and stuff which was hilarious
because they're all talking about how
they're gonna be rich because they were
gonna buy some can I explain adaptive
voltage offset absolutely well adaptive
means it changes right it means it goes
up and down based on demand in need
offset is either it could be a positive
or a negative offset that just means a
number to add or subtract from the
baseline so if your baseline is a 1.15
volt okay the adaptive means it's going
to go up or down based on load so
voltage when a normal clock speed or
whatever could be like 0.8 0.9 volts one
point one volts then when it goes under
load it's gonna ramp up to normally it's
got a voltage curve right and that's
based on factory settings and if you try
and overclock then you need more voltage
but adaptive is just the same when it
goes under load the voltage will ramp up
then you get into what's called V droop
that's a whole different subject we'll
talk about that later adaptive simply
says add or subtract if you put a plus
sign it's add this many millivolts to
whatever the voltage curve is so if it's
one if it's one volt at stock and then
when it goes into turbo mode over time
up until right same thing applies to AMD
let's just use Intel
if turbo mode goes to 1.2 volts and you
nad and you add an offset of 250
millivolts then it would actually go up
to the 1.2 plus your offset that you
have supply which then would make it 1.2
to 5o volts or if you add an offset of
500 millivolts then it would add 500 to
the 1.2 or in this case 1.25 so that's
how offset works adaptive offset
adaptive offset just means it allows the
voltage to ramp back down whereas if you
put in a static or a specific number
that voltage is applied at all times
every time regardless of what the CPU is
running at all so to I run all my
systems at max clock speed 100% of the
day every day this system right now is
sitting at 4.6 gigahertz with all
voltage whether it's sitting here idle
or whether it is under load because
apparently I like to abuse my hardware
it's something I've always done and I've
not really noticed any terrible things
in the years I've been doing it but even
when I'm done with the stream and I'm no
longer rendering anything and I'm
sitting at the desktop it will still run
4.6 gigahertz at one point four five
volts but on water I can tend to get
away with that
all right so Nick may I as why I got
timeout Oh
Abdul he timed you out because you kept
spamming the same question what would
you say is a dangerous voltage for 4790k
at 4.9 gigahertz 4.9 is already a law a
big overclock for a 4790 I'd probably
run no I say okay so the mainstream
stuff not including the 8700 K and the
new the new stuff 7700 K and down
I never recommended more than 1.3 five
volts even on water for 24/7 overclock
you could go farther for like
benchmarking runs and stuff like that
but I just tend to stick around 1.3 5 I
will run as high as 1 point 4 5 volts on
the new stuff like the new I 9s and
whatnot I think I said this one's
running one point four or five I think I
was wrong actually I believe it's
actually running let's turn on hardware
monitor here I think I'm actually
running point three five I can't recall
let me see here hardware monitor will
show me my current voltage is runing oh
that's CPU hold on that's not CP I mean
vid really that can't be right I don't
think it's reporting properly says I'm
running at 1.2 volts 1.2 volts at 4.6
that's not that wouldn't be stable but
my temperatures right now are sitting
out like 48 see 50 see of course I'm on
water so yeah I know the voltage is
higher than that I just don't think that
Harbour monitors reporting properly gee
hey what's up a Tech Talk the last ones
before Thanksgiving I already answered
that sorry yo what's up hey great games
2004 what's up
mm hey J do you read this I just did now
you just wasted you comment did you
notice better air flow with modded front
panel and the fan Tex and to evolve
indeed we did the problem was that loop
was experiencing other problems other
issues with it which is what's allowing
it to get warm the tight next Maxwell
GPUs were reaching like what 65 C Nick
that PC used to have the Evolve
or the GPUs getting it like 65 C on
water on water so there was something
else going on that's one of the reasons
why we tore it down the tight next
Maxwell cards although not a slouch
where it was just time to retire them so
J with net neutrality repealed any
concerns no God shut talk about this
fine let's talk about this there's those
that want to turn net neutrality into a
partisan issue and what that means is
that Republicans and Democrats have
their views of whatever that's called
it's partisanship do you have what's
called voting down the party line which
means that you're gonna vote whatever
the Republican Party or the Democratic
Party the Democrat Party suggests that
their memberships vote okay we'll call
memberships cuz I believe they're like
little exclusive clubs with like jackets
and shit right so a lot of people
thought this was a Bart Bart partisan
issue and the government first of all
doesn't have slightest clue as to how
the internet works my my personal
thought on this was the internet was
fine prior to net neutrality in the in
the turn in the sense of I didn't feel
like I was being throttled I never
noticed any problems with Netflix I
never noticed any problems with YouTube
or any of that net neutrality happened
and I didn't notice it even though I was
working an IT at the time I didn't
notice that net neutrality became a
thing because I didn't follow the
politics and I didn't really care for
know the truth when net neutrality
repeal became a conversation I believe
two reasons it became a conversation one
everyone in the world pretty much hates
Donald Trump okay and if you if you
don't hate him probably something you
don't like about him and because age it
high or whatever his name is
eze named agent pay agent pie whatever
agent pie in the face dork face dick
face whatever his name is
because he was appointed by Trump he
became became fourth like in the in the
spotlight about net neutrality and
turned into a political issue
once again because removing net
neutrality I feel was less about the
protection of the internet like they say
and it was more about repealing
something Obama did and I feel like none
of the politicians involved in this
actually understood what was going on
now I don't believe that the ISPs are
gonna immediately go out there and start
to go out there and do a tiered internet
system where suddenly it's like oh you
can connect to the the streamer bundle
get access to Amazon streaming and
Netflix and twitch and YouTube and all
that or get your sports bundle connect
to NFL at connect to NBA I don't think
they're gonna do that
I don't feel they're gonna do that
because they didn't do it before when
they could the question is people are
concerned now about whether or not the
fact that they can will they I don't
think they will I think ISPs were smart
enough and saw the backlash although
right now in the United States we lack
compa competition and choice with our
ISPs that's a whole nother issue that's
something a lot of foreigners have a
hard time understanding here in the u.s.
is that we don't have necessarily
broadband options in each area because
each city and municipality has a
monopoly and that's what I want to see
broken and technically the repeal of net
neutrality is supposed to help break
that monopoly don't know if it's ever
gonna happen but I think they I think
guys peas are smart enough to see that
the there is a huge uprising here now
companies like Comcast shadiest fuck
they have reven removed all of their
language that they ever had supporting
net neutrality you know that's gone who
knows bottom line what this ramble was
all about I didn't notice a problem
personally for me prior to net
neutrality I don't think I'm going to
notice anything immediately change post
net neutrality repeal I'd love to see
more isp options in my neighborhood
honestly i really would but that's not
the case you know what the reality is
all of you with a smartphone united
states you're already paying for that
tiered setup by the way is unlimited
data really unlimited can they strata
you a few if you go over your 20
gigabytes of unlimited data
I'd like to see something like what net
neutrality was trying to protect be
applied to mobile data plans because for
a lot of people that is their only
source of the Internet
there's a lot of people that use their
mobile phone in their hotspot as their
main connection at home and this and
that I'd like to see that applied but I
feel like we live in this crazy time
right now where technology is advancing
faster than the old white-haired men up
in Capitol Hill have a clue about what's
going on and they're the ones making the
decisions and that's my problem and red
J can I please be unblocked on Twitter
you unblocked me over a fare opinion
first of all fish-e rooster I have no
idea who you are second of all if I
blocked you up there it was for a reason
and I'm not gonna unblock you and by the
way a fair opinion if delivered like an
asshole get you treated like an asshole
keep that in mind 20 gigabytes before
throttling yeah I say I have Verizon I
think it's 26 or 24 Giga bytes of my
unlimited data once I go over 24 gigs
then they can throttle me now I've gone
way over that already in one month and I
didn't notice the slowdown but the point
is it's in the literature that they can
so there's that you didn't notice
throttling because you have a shit slow
connection bitch I got fiber shut the
fuck up this guy who's this guy who let
him in here you believe this guy Vinny
is break his knees break his knees bitch
ugh
James what's your take on Bitcoin al guy
already talked about that what's my
favorite fast food um chick-fil-a did
you know they have a 30-piece nugget I'm
not talking to you I know you know you
bought two of them one time Jay what's
my favorite food Italian
let's see here I recently got into video
creation and animation what are you
laughing it
you got what I didn't see it I'm not
looking at my camera I'm not looking at
the stream it's over there on that
monitor look at that sexy beast coming
into frame okay I recently got into
video creation animation I have an i5
2500 K should I upgrade my CPU yet or is
it still quite relevant I would like to
see a video what's still relevant in
late 2017 my answer to that's the same
but I tell everyone about whether or not
it's time to upgrade if it's taking too
long for your computer to do the tasks
you want them to do then it's time to
upgrade I don't need to go through and
test all of the CPUs feed it for you to
learn whether or not it's time to
upgrade if you if you push if you push
go on something and you're like god this
is taking forever just know any upgrade
you make past that point is going to
reduce that time if you want it to be
faster than you shell pony up the money
and get yourself a faster computer you
can hear him listen
sometimes I wonder if that's actually in
my head or if it's really happening like
the music what are your thoughts on the
BitFenix portal chassis oh I think it's
neat I think it's a neat looking chassis
but if I'm not mistaken doesn't it have
air flow issues SLI chicken nuggets mix
it hell yeah thanks again for the help
have a Merry Christmas
you were always thinking eunuch Rogers
Robert Rogers can you explain how
overclocking works with turbo boosts if
I set a manual overclock will it still
use the CPUs idle idle clock until
needed that is understanding how si
states work and yes you can actually
when you're overclocking both AMD and
Intel now you can set your your your
standard clock and you can set your
turbo clock I personally set a single
clock as my max speed for everything all
the time 24/7 all my computers are this
way all my computers have been this way
it's just the way I do J what are your
thoughts on and be refreshing Vega this
next go-around instead of releasing a
new product line they could barely
afford Vega as it was how are they
supposed to release a new product line
they're invested in Vega they were
invested in Vega when they invested in
fury I mean they they have gone down
that rabbit hole they cannot just
redesign everything the question is
gonna be what is Radeon graphics gonna
do now that Raja Kotori is gone and he's
working for Intel now so yeah one of my
thoughts on the view fluid is it still
good to use interesting question so the
view fluid we've had we have a couple of
systems here that it's been reacting
with poorly and I don't mean like
reacting and changing color or anything
like that it's just that it's not
maintaining its luster it's not clogging
anything but I talked to primo chill
about it and a couple of people have
message when I say a couple people a few
people have tweeted me showing me
pictures where they've had some issues
where it like part of that pearl add
essence stuff is like sticking to the
tubes or whatever
the only thing I can suggest with that
is contact primo chilled like with any
new fluid they do their testing with
dozens of systems and different
components and and these reds and these
blocks and stuff the problem is when you
send it out to thousands of people
that's a huge sample versus what you can
do in-house and then inevitably in
compatibilities pop up so it's one of
those things where like I haven't done
any updates all about it yet because I'm
still trying to we're still trying to
get down to the science about what's
going on over here and that is that's
where we are with that the it seems to
be specific with color just like the
Mayhem's thing it was specific specific
to color where Mayhem's Reds anything
with red in an orange red purple yellow
even was having problems but Green was
perfectly fine like skunkworks is green
has has held up its still as green as
the day I put it in there they say the
the view says or premature says the
green view is really strong so I'm gonna
be testing that because I have systems
I'm working on now and now I'm like okay
what fluids do I want to use but it's
still one of those things where like I'm
almost starting to wonder if I'm almost
starting to wonder if the smoothness of
the PE TG lines is something to do with
it because one of the systems like this
like this one right here you can't
really be able to see it it just sort of
you really touch there you go you can
see the lines right there it just looks
like kind of a clear blue right you
can't really see the reservoir there but
you can see it's just kind of a clear
blue nothing's clogged up flow is fine
but if you look at the thread Ripper
build but you can't see because it's all
the way down there in the studio the
thread were per build with the silver as
still as as vibrant and shimmery as ever
but remember that's the one where I
built the tubing with all those crazy
bends and all of those like twists and
stuff in there and I'm wondering if the
turbulence in the tubing has something
to do with keeping it more active I
don't know I don't know I'm not a
chemist I don't pretend to know so yeah
it's one of those things where
definitely keep your ear to the ground
listen to what Primo Joe has to say if
for some reason you have any problems
with yours
and definitely contact them that's all I
can say they're trying to determine a
correlation between specific products
that might be having a problem and the
issue here and I can tell you this from
other companies I've talked to is you
could take you could take ten different
radiators like from alpha cool EK
whatever you can take ten of them from
the same company but produced at
different times test the metal and get
different qualities of metal even though
they're the exact same radiator it has
to do with the manufacturing whatever
alloy they used at that time or whatever
quality of copper they used and there
might be variances between copper
sourcing they don't always come from the
same manufacturer like make a copper
from this guy and make a copper from
this guy and although they're graded the
same they might be inconsistencies there
that's the problem with water cooling as
a whole and all these crazy fluids Ahmed
Zayat says help please I'm dreaming to
have a high-end PC but I can't buy it
because it too much expensive in my
country help please do you think that
your situation makes you more worthy of
just being sent a computer than someone
else that lives in a country with where
it's too expensive
I don't beg that's all I say don't beg
mmm definitely gonna go with Premo chill
view when they get it sorted out now I
I've actually been having ongoing
conversation with them as recent as last
night even about this because I told
them I was like guys I don't want to
have a repeat of like the Mayhem's thing
I don't want to deal with fluids I don't
wanna deal with that crap I don't want
to have people come at me and be like
Jay you said this is good stuff and it's
not working well in my system I'm smart
enough to know that not all fluids work
in every single system that I mean
especially when they're mixed fluids but
what they can promise me is that it has
been a very low sampling of people with
problems the difference is I haven't I
have my own issue that crept up and the
thing was like once it started like once
it started to kind of lose that shimmer
effect it happened quickly like really
quickly it was just one day I'm like
look as thick as it used to and then one
day it was just like where did it go so
it happens very quickly
question what are your thoughts on AMD's
new 7 nanometre tech coming next year
have not investigated it I have no
opinion on it yet look at Jays video no
that's just a J's stream how long we've
been streaming for an hour and 10 yeah
that's about right well go for well go
for about another 20 minutes here guys a
case has liver channel keep up the
excellent work thank you sir
Jay won't win we'll post Malone's video
be done you know what Joe doe I'm gonna
do this just because I can because I've
already answered this question in
bajillion times I'm afraid I have a
limited Swift tech apogee SKF there's no
way in hell I'd let something with a
serial number of 17 get pretty much get
primo chill pump through it then your
best bet is probably gonna be distilled
water with a Killa coil there's nothing
wrong with it there's nothing wrong with
distilled water it's just the idea is
having you know anti corrosive sand all
that stuff in there but you know what
man I feel you I really really do
there's nothing wrong with distilled
water and a kill coil and just colored
dye if you want it to look colored and
know that you're gonna be good keep an
eye on your loop and you're fine I have
you will never hear me say don't use
water use this blah blah blah coolant on
time is autonomous chairs any good
they're comfy they just have a little
part to keep popping off if you look
right there and my finger is that's like
where there's a hinge and there's like a
like a chrome-plated little cap that
supposed to go on there they just
randomly fall off it's really annoying
well we will be sitting here Nick Nick
will tell you this is true we'll just be
sitting here not moving nothing is
moving and they just they fall out and
like not just fall off they'll bow like
they'll like pop out under force or this
hit this this headrest will be up like
that and then we'll be doing our thing
and then it will just randomly like fall
down so I guess you get what you pay for
they're not incredibly expensive chairs
it's just they're not necessary of them
you know little things like that I've
ever been to Europe sadly I have not
losing virginity story
sure I'll tell that one as soon as that
end the stream I've had Mayhem's blue
for two years now and no issues yeah I
also have had blue running now in that
glass bill you guys were the this the
define nan OS build that I did with the
glass tubing and the I mixed the blue to
match the fractal design blue that
system is still together and that
coolant is still in there and although
it doesn't run hardly at all where it
will it will settle it will fall out
right and the reservoir you'll see it
goes from clear down to like a thicker
blue but it's just like the nanos
definitely fallen out as soon as I start
the system it just remixes and it looks
as good as can be the green and skunk
works doesn't fall out though like it
doesn't fall out at all like skunk works
will go a week without starting at times
and instead of getting like that little
thin film on top or where it looks kind
of clear on top the green doesn't fall
at all so the colour definitely has an
effect on the fluid
any thoughts on EK water block letting
go of a lot of their upper management
I've worked with mark a bit and thought
he was a hell of a guy
Brian's bath I don't know what
information you have Brian but it's my
understanding and you're speaking of
mark tank oh yes great guy I worked with
him quite a bit is they weren't let go
as much as they all sort of decided to
go at the same time now Eddie's running
the company again Eddie II for the ek is
Eddie he's running the company again
he's a young guy he's in his early 30s I
was concerned because I mean that never
looks good when you're CEO you're CEO oh
and you're in your CTO all leave at the
same time it seems like either two
things are happening one there there's a
hostile takeover happening or two there
leaving to start their own company I've
been assured they're not leaving to
start their own company so time will
tell still using ek products moving
forward I just hope they don't make any
sort of manufacturing changes that would
lead to lower quality parts I hope that
doesn't happen
has my a drive
been affected at all up or down I have
been pretty much 100% unaffected by ad
pocalypse so and I have not had a single
video like deemed none advertiser
friendly and what's funny about that is
I'm probably I probably drop the most
f-bombs and stuff out of all the tech
guys and almost all the other tech guys
have gotten demonetised at least once I
don't know because I keep it to real
YouTube be like oh this guy's real hook
he'll call us out no one do that UK
Phoenix is amazing I have not gotten to
play with the Phoenix yet they went to
Corsair I don't know if that's true or
not like I said I that's I don't know
I've not talked to them since their
departure email two are working at
Corsair okay well then I'll say to our I
don't know question you are known for
being a water cooling master no not
really but anyway when are you going to
do full glass build with Mayhem's 90
degree in straight 16 millimeter stuff
that would be upping your meeting I've
already done a glass build do you
understand my frustration when somebody
tells me I should do something and step
up my game and this and that when they
suggest that I do something that I've
already done the glass
I used even was the Mayhem's tubing oh
yeah
I hope you guys understand it takes
sometimes it takes a moment to just kind
of like okay here we go
we're reset have you done a Christmas
fractal design advert yet no
unfortunately we're not doing it
christmas advert this year there was
just too many things going on and
launches and stuff to to do one but we
are we are going to be doing an advert
this month it just is not a Christmas
one must have missed it okay if you want
to see the glass build you've got to
look on my channel click the little
magnifying glass the little search
button and you have to it no I'm not
bending glass I don't bend glass I use
fittings to do the the bends but it's
glass tubing which I cut and everyone
told me I was doing it wrong because I
was gonna inhale glass and I was gonna
die but whatever
hold on G style says I'm kind of a WoW
you're kind of a dick to your viewers no
I'm just a dick to you asshole here
you're gone there how's that so anyway
look up the define nano s build on my
channel and you'll see the glass the
glass stuff don't let the bastards get
me down it's not it's not he's on a
bastard it's just it's one of those
things where like it's super frustrating
when someone suggests you do something
that you've already done but whatever
I've got nearly a thousand videos I
don't expect that everyone saw them i
just i okay so here's my personal
mentality and I'm a and I'm a subscriber
to channels that I like and before I
ever suggest that someone do something I
use the search function I feel like it's
kind of like any longtime form user if
you've been in a form long enough and
you'll see this guy that comes around
and asks a question that's been asked 18
times in the last week and they still
asked it again because it's obviously
didn't search it's kind of like that you
know the you know the pain let's see
here J why didn't you review any be
quiet products yet lack of interest or
contact with the brand would be awesome
to see water-cooling build in a done and
a dark base pro 900 no I know I know
them Roxy and all of them I'm supposed
to meet up with them at CES actually I
met up with them also at Computex I just
don't think we've had any projects
that have aligned the problem is I'm one
guy I'm one channel and I can't cover
every single product on the market
I'd like to of course but I can't cover
every single product on the market
I'm not lioness Media Group that has you
know 12 editors or whatever it is and
they're doing all of the testing and
stuff and then I you can diversify you
know 12 different paths of research at
one time I can't do that I'm one guy I'm
one guy it still has to run the business
so I'll start about 2017 here let's
let's end on this 2017
in fact Nick I think you should slide
over here for this because you're a part
of 2017 obviously you're you were a part
of it in some way you can you can wield
your banhammer more later okay he's just
over there like you're like hitting like
that like the Gopher game over it
Chuckie Cheese right yeah you know
closer to the mic
oh you don't talk loud enough as it is
yeah let's see if we get this so that
it's not blocking your face it's good
over okay are going to make later class
I need to okay so let clone Jae 2017 was
an interesting year for me because 2016
was my first year what did that looks
very inappropriate what did that you did
with your hand back there when you were
see when I was doing the banhammer I was
doing it like a handle yeah handles
don't go like this oh that's so what it
has played back right now it looks very
in approved oh don't worry about it okay
so I so 2017 I hired you technically in
February as a part-time contractor yeah
and you were only working one day a year
one day one day a year that's the only
work one day a year you were working
Fridays for me just basically doing
whatever usually inventory cleanup stuff
like that right Spa stuff it's because I
want to start getting you exposed to the
environment which I don't think you did
a very good job of truly exposing you to
the environment all the environment got
bigger
if you want to take it that way I guess
he could take it that way but I didn't
mean it like that
when when I when I went to work for
myself and I did that video in June of
2016 saying I it's been a year since I
quit my job that first year is the
scariest year because you're like
alright everything is on me now I've got
a wife two kids everything's on me
getting an employee was not in the cards
because it was like I need to make sure
my own family is settled before I even
consider taking on the responsibilities
of like can you make your car payments
and stuff based on the decisions I make
with the business yeah so we
fast-forward and it's like time to get
out of the house right the the baby is
no longer a baby she's loud I can't
record I'm out of space we had a storage
unit that was full we had a garage it
was full we had an office it was full
hallways that were full they kept
getting smaller like Tetris when you run
out it was like the trash compactor seen
in Star Wars is what it felt like to me
okay okay no matter what I put up to
like wedge it it just kept smashing okay
that's what it felt like to me and so I
decided okay I need help with this so
the first step was I hired you as of
part-time contractors you were still
going to school full-time yeah then it
was like I need a studio so we found
this place and brought you on right
around the same time so we moved it I
moved in here March 10th yeah of this
year and at that point I went okay
here's here's my philosophy for 2017 I'm
gonna take the profits above and beyond
what I need to live and survive I'm
gonna reinvest them into this place so
that's why the company grew the
equipment grew the space grew and you
went full-time May 1st yeah that was a
huge jump because I didn't want a team
but I needed a team fast forward a few
months later we brought on brian brian
and brian has been a huge instrument i
wanna say it's been a huge tool because
he's not he's too nice i don't to call
him a tool brian has been instrumental
in bringing in more business lots of
business yeah and it's been hard because
we're back at that point where were like
okay now we're a team of three and we
still can't get it all done so 2017 for
me was supposed to be a year where all
the profit was spent back in growth of
the company and it did but it still
became profitable so what's your review
of 2017 and what do you think 2018
should be my review well I think to my
seventeen Elias for here was awesome
just okay hold on Kuwait oh this is
boring so we'll fix that for him bye
bitch okay well Twain 17 was kind of
scary for me too because I jumped in
like okay we're gonna go like I'm
jumping on board with you but I didn't
know where it's gonna go from they've
also never had like a like a full time
job before yeah no this is like the
first real nine-to-five as we call it
right yeah yeah and so it's still in
ninety nine to five sometimes it's much
more than that but yeah so just lessen
that but the VGO more sometimes it's fun
like like today or Simba Simba that was
like a 20-hour day oh my gosh yeah no it
was cool um I learned a lot I'm still
learning I can't say that I'm not
learning every day cuz I'm always
learning every day it sometimes just as
a show because yeah you know what I
would love right now just to like show
all the bloopers no oh no I would love
for you to tell the audience what it's
like to work for me you know it's a
really but can you pretend like I'm not
here
it's a strange dynamic because there's
nothing you're gonna tell me that will
offend me or nothing you could tell them
that will offend me okay I'm not here
well it's a strange dynamic just cuz
he's a really really good friend but at
the same time he's my boss so we talked
about that
yeah wait okay so I water bomb that was
my boss yeah well we changed it where
Tina dynamic again so it's it was weird
of having to change modes but now we're
getting into like okay we're just gonna
keep the friendship thing and ignore the
boss part but the same time I have to
realize this is livelihood at stake so I
still have to take it like a certain
level serious seriousness does that make
sense yeah we're always serious but I
mean like so for the record like I'm not
his boss anymore I he doesn't he doesn't
report to me look at all this dust is
bothering me leave this I just oh my god
we need to clean this okay anyway it's
just saran wrap everything so
technically he reports to Brian now yeah
and I think you'll like that better
I don't know yet I haven't like I have
you will you'll like it I haven't had
the Brian experience yet um okay so what
kind of boss in my there's ups and downs
we're actually having a live streamed
year-end review this might be against
the corporate ethical standard there's
ups and downs cuz Elias I have my old
experience was my boss from the other
place and you're a lot better than that
I'll give you that much literally you're
seriously by far because I'm an asshole
but he was an asshole to there yet but
you're more blunt rather than he tries
to avoid he tried to avoid some stuff
mm-hmm
you know like you you attack it point on
and we get it to the table we get it
over with
it isn't like okay we'll deal with that
later and just keep pushing it back and
nothing ever happened the kind of deal
so I appreciate that we were getting
stuff brought to the table as soon as is
even though it was mainly who initiated
cuz you know I'm really shy of bringing
stuff up like that yeah but why you had
to be so sure that's how many times
would you say I've said you have to man
up this year and what I mean by that is
like when you have an opinion well you
have an idea or something
you back down to much like an easily
like if you bring up an idea and I'm not
feeling it at first and I'm kind of like
no I don't think so you're like okay but
I keep telling you like no you need to
just like if you have an opinion or a
thought that can you fight for that
right you need to just be like okay
hello you're gonna hear me out and
you're gonna get you're gonna hear me
before you turn this down you need to be
better at that and I think you're
getting a little better at that but you
still are like okay like too easily yeah
I kind of tend to avoid the conflict
section that's why if if it gets knocked
down I just leave it which we're kept
we're getting there I'm turning it over
can you just like these are your ideas
and then they go like that but you're
supposed to push it back up and be like
no yeah like fighting against yeah yeah
and then I'll be like why are you
fighting me then
that at that point I'll be like who's
the boss you get Brian yeah yeah we're
already talking about 2018 eating a
bigger place because we've I'm looking
they see down there that's your huh yeah
you can really tell it looks crowded
though it's we are out of space and of
course everyone's gonna be like whoo
giveaway giveaway stuff doesn't solve
our problem yeah it doesn't work like
that LOL quit agreeing with him yeah
pretty much yeah
no yes man be like man's no newt hoot oh
man's not hot oh oh I mean just stop
worrying that you're wrong I think sells
right on that one I have to be less
afraid to make mistakes your ideas need
to be like playing get over it I don't
think let's pluck that let's help them
out right there that one yeah oh rekt
gaming just got rekt Nick is the man and
you know it it surprises having people
on here I have no idea who Brian is and
and my answer is gonna be the same as
always y'all should follow on social
media you you'll know so much more about
what we're doing if you follow and
you're like no Twitter stupid then just
be like then deal with the fact that
you're ignorant to what we're talking
about
well there's Instagram too but we don't
really top my Instagram is is very
whatever I think people know that by now
right yeah yeah Jay earlier you say
we're going to do to deal a deal we're
gonna talk about that right now we're
getting ready to it and this so explain
why you're out of space please okay
here's what's called an inventory yeah
here's the box and this is what happens
like every month we get we get more
stuff they can't see down there we have
more stuff to put in the box so the box
keeps getting filled with stuff we don't
have anywhere to put the stuff yeah I
mean we keep an inventory and I it it
baffles me how many people don't
understand why we need this inventory to
be able to do the videos that we do like
I think a lot of these people think we
should keep one motherboard one CPU one
GPU it isn't it doesn't work that way
that's why I just said we're getting
do kind of a purge of the older stuff
but the bands we don't have that much
older stuff a lot of what you see here
we acquired in the last 18 months yeah
this year alone yes
and so that's why it's important that we
have these parts that we can go back and
do revisions and revisiting and do like
I would we could we still can't even do
our bare minimum spec series like we
want without having to buy stuff because
we don't have the old stuff yeah okay so
if I take the same we have now and just
get rid of it like like people out there
who are clueless think we should do we
still wouldn't be able to do the damn
series okay there's one gear dink says
how do you stay motivated to keep the
creative juices going for videos that's
a good one because I mean we are nearly
a thousand videos in mm-hmm right
I say we even though you weren't a part
of the first four years it's still a wee
but they're about a thousand videos in
and I look back at that and I go it
doesn't feel like a thousand videos I
mean it's been five years over five
years but I don't know the landscape is
always evolving
new stuff is always coming out old stuff
is fun to revisit yeah what what does
hard is is the repetitive part a new GPU
comes out the audience goes I can't wait
to see this new GPU this is awesome and
I go I've got nine of them coming how
much more benchmarking how much more
benchmarking how repetitive is this
gonna be how how do I be bugging but not
only that it's like how do I make a
video about the ten atti the fifth time
and still make it interesting yeah
you don't even and that's the challenge
and of course I'm sure there's folks
watching it's going o sounds like you've
such a hard life you know it there is
very hard aspects of this okay and
they'd be ignorant for you to just think
that we just get to play with this all
day and have fun this is business videos
videos okay start with how we make our
money I think people have realized by
now myself Linus
Kyle Paul Austin Evans Jonathan all of
us are in the business of advertising
that is our business
we advertise videos are how we advertise
so videos are our medium
at which we sell our business on we keep
running because we sell advertising
advertisements through platform through
our platform outside of YouTube so that
when ad pocalypse and stuff happens it
doesn't affect us that much so that we
can keep the business running my company
as far as the IRS and the corporate
corporation is concerned is a marketing
company videos is just how we do it so
that's how we make our money we have to
we have to find ways to make those ads
interesting right the fractal design ads
clearly are the most interesting the
most fun but I also turned down more
advertisers than people have any idea
you've seen it firsthand yeah in the
back the back the back side of things
background via the back end deals yeah
the back end deals no and so speaking of
the whack-a-mole thing earlier anyway
you've you've seen firsthand how much
money we do not take accept or even
entertain because it does not align with
my mission statement of this channel and
what I want to do if I was truly the
money-grubbing shill like everyone
thinks that youtubers are we'd be
popping up oh my god I'd be wearing I
would have G fuel going right now I mean
I'd have the whole thing right but I
don't because I still have I still have
standards and I still have scruples
hopefully it comes across that way but
the point being at the Reg s cuz I was
like you look so perfect you look so
like proper right they're like well you
scoot it away I didn't fart I'm like
right here let's see so if J ever wanted
his channel to get bigger and never
wanted it to make more money how is he
supposed to fund the videos on Titan X
P's SL eyes etc give me a break
say again we that's part of that's part
of the that's part of being a product
reviewer we get we are fortunate to get
that stuff supplied to us usually free
of cost yeah I don't think that that's
like we've never hidden that we've
always been very upfront about that I'm
surprised how many people still think
that we buy everything we buy a lot well
like this year we've bought more than
any
ever yeah but we buy a lot still yeah I
don't know I mean pull EVGA builds while
drinking a monster and RGB chicken
nuggets in the background are gonna be
chicken nuggets sound like a great build
integrity it's thing thanks guys
some of us still have it it's a team and
it comes under question all the time
like people are constantly questioning
our integrity but whatever never lose
the realness you guys are great
I can't it is not it is in my DNA to be
a real salty a a real salty guy real
common salty guy or it's real salt I
mean it's not big salt i remember old
jay the channel was the channel was a
the series gonna get banned or not oh
here we go
I remember the old Jay the channel was
up PC hardware etcetera right now is
about shit talking Linus tech tips
everything to get bigger profit nothing
more please change that in the next year
you know what shit talking fuck off the
RM so whatever your stupid name is okay
so can i buy yourself i know you cannot
the tars I go back years and years I
don't know it's a TARDIS where did that
mm-hmm Jay man's hot damn right I'm hot
and drop it to do you always be the
man's that take a stand and keep making
good vids there's people out there too
that think they're gonna stand up
against me when I take a stand you
you're not you're not gonna stand up
against me notice me senpai you spelled
senpai wrong just want to point that out
it's MP delays real salty doesn't mean
being a jerk though there's plenty of
people who almost who will mistake and
holding your grant or standing your
ground on an opinion as salty and those
people usually are made of snowflake
material so and remember salt melts snow
so there you go if you only wanted money
you could just have tunnel bear ads
around every video I wouldn't that's not
to say I wouldn't take a tunnel bury on
either why not
we're doing it we're doing a VPN n this
month
let's see hedge money prem real prime
real salty doesn't mean being a jerk
though true oh it was a it was a quote
yeah okay what happened with Tech Talk
oh my god on break you know I'm smelling
phantom farts you just farted enough to
like jinx yourself much like in my pores
you're psyching yourself out how
whatever 2017 year of the snowflakes hi
bet the truth it doesn't make like anime
gundam Gundams what's about it thanks to
you videos they helped me build my first
PC you're very welcome Jay do you have a
side hustle hustle oh no you don't have
a side okay he had to translate that one
kind of like what post Malone says I
fuck with your shit the greatest moment
I've ever had
gee are you taller than Linus oh my god
are you kidding me you both suck lol no
I think he's just see I'm not gonna ban
em coop because I honestly think he's
just trying to get it I think he's
trying too hard to be noticed for the
banhammer okay so I won't
I won't I want a pledge you're both
farting it's why oh you are a Lance
you're as in a contractive you are not
your see I can't own them both farting
like you're possessive both farting is
not an object uh it's hammer time
oh geez there we go you know what here's
what I'll do
oops I get the right guy I won't ban but
I will time them out how's that okay go
ban though
are you people fucking serious Linus is
five six j6 four is Linus five six I
know he's short I just never really paid
attention like I didn't know what his
height was did I use height
do they use feet inches in Canada I
don't think so pretty sure they're like
the centimeters get me wrong I haven't
been you've been I don't know I know
used kilometers guys the quality of the
videos skyrocketed this year absolutely
amazing to watch thank you get schooled
how do you read these so fast experience
any update report on the Terry C build
what is there the report it's been done
since April bro have you been we're
getting to the end of the year and
you've been this far out of the gap yeah
I think he's we're in a race he's been
lapped a couple times oh no the race is
over everyone's left he's still getting
it you should like me when the session
ends did you just keep going oh man I
got a black flag or red flag he had a
quick lesson
I was so oblivious that the checkered
flag went out they started black flag me
I sit and see it then the red flags came
out and they were practically standing
out on track to make this stop I was
just really into it first session anyway
you should do a motor oil cooling loop
in a PC or use KY jelly see these these
are these just every now and then go on
every hold I reset my brain it hurts
dude these are the same guys really oh
you should use semen in a loop all right
you should water clean your car oh yeah
you should water cool your car it's like
where are you fucking Amish have I been
driving an aerco Porsche for that long
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia yeah they're
gonna be doing any more videos with
Jerry anytime soon Jerry it is his own
man he is not a part of my channel other
than Tech Talk so I mean Jerry is
Jerry's Jerry he's in Seattle doing his
thing what are you looking for what
point to it
oh that really bothers you doesn't it I
mean why do you why do you let that
bother you I don't know it's just there
but you shouldn't look they're gonna to
spam it it's just gonna keep like the
previous one just like it's spamming
fine J is there a big benefit to paying
for driving classes to become a better
everyday driver mmm I'll be taught like
driver's ed and I think it's helpful to
kind of know the driving laws well you
see California do it for the freeway
stuff cuz they don't test for that
anymore
oh really yeah so suddenly you're doing
65 and you're freaked out and you know
people like me go flying by you yeah
when I'm in my Z I do like to play with
the student drivers though when I see
the cars I'm not gonna lie I do it too
because when you're when there's a
student driver vehicle I don't know if
it's like this in all states I assume it
is but in California student drivers
have to be like advertising that they're
a student driver so usually it's like a
big banner on the top of the car that's
a student driver
it's like stupid student DRI yeah and
you can always tell because they're like
hands at ten and two and always know
it's a student when there's someone in
the passenger seat just walking yeah
otherwise if there's only one person in
the driver seat it's probably the
instructor driving to pick someone up
when I'm in my car I tend to be not nice
it's just fun to like downshift rev next
to them and yeah it's scary I know the
feeling 7xl shirts please I think I go
up to five or six man I am stuck with
whatever the supplier can supply as a
guy who used to be a 6x myself I know
the struggles but I can't suggest
anything to you I mean cuz if then if I
start supplying 7 X 2 then there's gonna
be the guy with it that's an 8 X like
hey 8 X please look I I can't make the
shirts bigger they are they're as big as
Hanes we'll let them be if New York we
have the same student driver thing yes
bucks with them
yeah well oh yeah they also don't teach
a parallel parking that I spent two days
learning that for the driver's test
never had to use it why does that bother
you
damn you really are an asshole for real
I thought it was kind of a front how how
does me telling you someone's words
shouldn't bother you make me an asshole
just asking a question I mean it wasn't
a stupid question like that but Wow
see the guy who just white knighted for
just called you stupid think about that
there your block - no I'm saying you
called him stupid he white knighted for
you you just called him stupid he should
feel stupid now oh you make me feel
stupid I asked you why you let someone's
name calling like why you let someone
the specific name calling bother you I
just cut it off before that goes on okay
but then you explained that you don't
want to see it spammed and we left it at
that heats he says that because I asked
you why someone why that word bothers
you he said I'm an asshole
no you generally wanted to know so he
white knight it for you thinking that oh
I'm gonna sent it for Nick just being an
asshole
it was wrong but basically you said it
wasn't a stupid question like you asked
right to him so basically you called the
white knight stupid which I applaud you
for it was because he wasn't a white
knight he's a great use of white
knighting yeah nobody really cared about
what he had to say why this QA feels so
salty PS like this channel there we go
because the comments are alive and we're
responding to them in real time yeah
J and Nick what games do you guys play
what are you playing right now right now
destiny still still that's no I thought
I was one of those games that kind of
like everyone jumped on it and then
everyone kind of quit it well it is but
now I'm back to building the gun Gundam
models as well so if I'm not gonna game
I know but like that's where my time is
going now so you not playing any other
game sighs destiny - I haven't touched
the computer like it's been twice or
three times a week now oh well the only
game I play really is is I guess piss
off the internet that's a fun game well
we hadn't played well for a while either
Brian wants to play tonight but I doubt
I'm going to we need to project cars
again though yeah it's a nice C so the
problem with the VR rig now is every
time I want to play I'm like okay I
gotta drag the thing over I got plug it
in and get the headset and plug it in
and it's like oh I wish I had a like a
thing I could just sit down on and it
was like like the lights turn off and it
suddenly I mean like a dome I think he
need Amazon let's
for that I need like I need like cerebro
from a cerebro whatever it's called from
x-man oh okay that's what I need it's I
just will my chair in there and then
some is like I'm playing project car
[Laughter]
lift the mic boom it's crowding the shot
there are you happy till this downwards
no it doesn't work that way this mic is
a it's a condenser mic that expects you
to be right on top of it he can just
deal with it ah thoughts on Windows
mister headsets what what what are which
windows mister headsets thoughts on
Windows mister headsets Gundam building
channel I've been watching trust me do
they do like time lapses yeah this stuff
like that and I've just watching
tutorials and weathering and stuff like
that I think you guys are great keep it
up
I enjoy the videos and I have learned
lots of things listening to you Thank
You Ryan
I trust me I know for every salty
snowflake out there there is there's
guys like you who are the reason why we
stay salty for good reasons right Acer
predator x34 I know you reviewed the nun
version but I wanted to know if you
would record you always tell who's
typing on their phone because the x34 I
had which was like the early model ended
up getting a lot of light bleeped in the
corners so I don't know if they fix that
problem but mine like got really bad
we're using a surpise panels up here now
remember the model number something I
don't for eight something like that I
don't know
it's the hundred Hertz g-sync IPS 34 40
by 1440 it's basically the Asus version
of like the predator the salt is the
best part of this channel
other than the video quality best part
other people tell me I'm gonna lose my
viewers because I'm salty do you know
many people follow me because I'm salty
I've not changed since day one so y'all
could take that and just shove it
Sun don't shine and if the Sun does
shine there well then you must be a nude
beach in France you guys are the best
channel I knew I knew please get oh god
it's gone everything's going so fast
please get better than perfect then dude
perfect what what I'm a slave King so go
back to the dungeon or no chicken you
stupid nig Wow first of all what is the
dungeon and then like the Engrish no but
that era if he's talking about slavery
that area medieval era that'd be very
medieval area but if we're talking about
medieval like England and stuff they
were more likely to enslave the Scots oh
then they were anyone from Africa true
because England was just obviously too
caught up in its thing if we're talking
about like Germany - that's that's
that's not that's not dealing with like
African slaves elegy wasn't even right
yeah I mean Africa didn't come into play
until like the Crusades are we going in
history now man how the history though
why you read that Jay because I
literally read the comment and then like
something has yet to process it so I'm
kind of like anchorman Jay live the
channel been following for a few years
now but I'm only finally building your
first PC well enjoy it man it's cool
that top but that's why I go sweaters
for example though of reading a comment
like that out loud is the amount of
people that may not have seen that
comment go by is the fact that it lets
people watching this channel know just
how stupid some viewers are from our
perspective like literally just you look
at if you looked at the world through
our glasses you realise we are fucked
because I agree the amount of people out
there were strong opinions that are just
wrong is really high the amount of
people out there that you were just like
how do you remember to breathe the level
of stupid it's it's like it's the worst
part about being a youtuber it is by far
the worst part about being a youtuber I
can't there are times I
just have to when I go into those those
salty Twitter rants you guys don't
understand that is my reset button that
is my like the steam has come the pot is
like your bluff your bluff oh yeah you
know you when you when you're boiling
water and you're making pasta whatever
in the puddles right but not T I'm
talking about like the pressure builds
up and the lid is like doing this yeah
yeah when I'm Twitter ranting that's the
that's the vent
okay the venting of that pressure and
then I I reset and I'm fine there there
are people out there that just it's like
you have to be told you have to be told
how you should have ended up as a stain
in the sock I'm sorry you sure you
should have been a smear on the wall or
a more glory hole I mean I'm telling you
right now there are people out there
that I just how did this happen but I
mean some days it feels like why don't
we to all over again just to say rule
twelve-year-olds yeah oh let's see I've
gotten some pretty uneducated comments
you're telling me
Jane how much time daily you spent on
work it varies it's it's never like any
less than 8 but it's very often more
like probably more like 10 hours a day
you have to push further than that yeah
but I mean that's on average and that's
cut back since we've gotten the team now
with you here helping with things the
studio because if I leave the studio and
I can't really do much work other than
like Corey - emails Paul and what the
amount of that that's been offloaded to
Brian I work less now than I ever have
but it's still a full-time it's not like
I'm down to part-time because if I if I
go home early it's not because I'm like
yeah I'm taking some time off it's I'm
going home to do something else yeah
that I can do from home kind of thing my
wife wants Windows pension for her
birthday
okay um let's see aka your mother should
have swallowed
yeah I've used that one before Nick I
just learned to not let them bother me
you know this that's true for any one
line no no if you've got a random guy
once or twice in a month that might make
some snarky comment to you on the street
in a store some guy that rubbed you the
wrong way at the gas station you go on
most of the viewers go on about their
merry life and they don't see that guy
again yeah when you've got one point to
whatever million people following you
and the amount of those comments that
are never-ending barrage positives of
well as well obviously yeah but the
thing is that guy that rubbed you the
wrong way at the gas station oh the guy
that cuts you off and flipped you off on
the street that just bothered you that
day that's every day all day every day
for us literally I can hop on Twitter
right now and I want to go very far to
find someone that's trying to trigger
you like that yeah so anyone that says I
learned not to let it bother you it's
not lying it's just they don't have the
level of it that we have to deal with
they don't have they don't have the
volume of hate that we get so there is
no learning to not let it bother you in
this it's learning to deal with it in
various ways and I think the audience
knows the way I deal with it is when I
get to that point the guy that deserves
it I'm going to bitch-slap around
digitally it's just it just makes me
feel better it's not bullying it's
bullying back I have those moments to
where I guess I snapped back at them but
afterwards I go ahead to block yeah I
kick your ass J not a chance
absolutely no chance that's just the
internet for you boo who listen to him
cry yeah block you why are you here if
you if you're just being a stupid little
asshole making comments like that why
are you here see Royall says can't be me
bitch he made a positive comment earlier
this is an example of him just trying to
get a reaction our VRS dreams possible
yet not yet but know somebody asks oh
yeah it's on twitch they people been
doing it a lot they use a 360 camera and
you just look around with the 360 no
it's kind of like when you did chair in
the room they use that perspective
screen on the monitor and they use that
so what okay remember when I had the
headset and you're watching what I was
doing to the monitor they're showing
that monitor section not through oh yeah
I'm talking about like their tongue can
you actually look at a live stream in a
VR hmd I know they did this year with
like League of Legends he's like you
could walk around the virtual map and
then watch stuff happen they must have a
bunch of 360 cameras play
that are actually drawing out a digital
like video image you can move around
right like that's like the 360 video
feeds you can watch like racing and
stuff like that right you can look
around the car imagine that wouldn't be
hard in VR it's just literally like
looking around yeah the only time I read
about like watching VRS teams was
through that like a virtual arena got a
deal
yeah um Jay you should get a dog it
might help with the stress why did you
just assume I don't have a dog his
name's husky the irony I have a dog
I can't I'm not gonna ban royal but I'm
gonna I'm gonna put him on timeout
just because he's being annoying what do
you guys have planned for 2018 stuff
it's some pretty cool stuff coming up I
could tell you that have you ever worked
with Kyle Bennett for hard OCP good site
but he seems like a dick I think a lot
of people would say that about me right
I have been at events with Kyle but I
don't interact with him he's he's
written media he still thinks he's
better than all the YouTube stuff so Jay
have nothing in their life and this is
the tiny attempt at control and being
hard
well it's anonymity right I we put
ourselves out there we put our image out
there and our and they're just pixels on
screen so because anyone can act tough
by typing out whatever it is from there
you know from there their basement or
their bedroom or whatever it is it's
kinda like this theory if people still
play that land parties would there would
still be as disrespectful as they
disrespectful and for exactly exactly
exactly cuz like but I think different
kinds of people go to land parties
anyway most of these people that would
say like super salty hateful things
would never go to a public event anyway
sure sure most of the time I mean I went
but I guess I react more than I I don't
just put out like salty things you I
react to salty things yeah it's kind of
like that whole like perd example if you
were to hit me and I hit you back they
go to mean be like why'd you hit him
well he hit me first you should ignore
him what are you gonna have an allergy
anyway my favorite kind of dog Doberman
Pinscher for sure my daughter really
wants a husky but I I think it's cruel
to have a husky and
in California very there's lots of
people that have Huskies in my
neighborhood too and it bothers me in
the summer time they'll take them
walking burning their paws and
everything on the ground but I think
it's cruel and unusual to have a cold
climate dog in a desert sorry I said it
had to be said
I favor Labradors I bet especially the
golden ones the yellow yellow two days
well we went twenty-five minutes past
when I wanted to stop alright guys we're
gonna go I just wanted to do a live
stream here do the purge for all the
people who couldn't handle real Jay they
can they can unsub and leave and
unfollow and all that stuff your end
purging is usually pretty good but I
think a lot of people too
every day tell me they like the real the
real me this is the real me keeping it
video no public image surreal me Jay is
a paper man the review guy oh that's the
that's the guy that was like a key I
could kick your ass
here's what we'll do we are going we're
gonna go look at his channel yeah yeah
not right now we're gonna end the stream
and then we're gonna go laughs we're
gonna we're gonna laugh at him big time
there we go actually look at it right
now
so this channel the irony that it says
stop whining on his he's got 242
subscribers with nice Oh are these get
videos so see Amazon Fire HD 2017
version with dtt okay's you actually did
a review of a Kirby G 10 versus the
Dyson multifloor vacuum okay there's
that the VTEC to handset cordless
answering system you saw an answering
machine Jesus Christ its VTech you're
the train Wow
so this guy's got quite the I would say
eclectic but they all seem to suck so
that's like the constant right there
Silver Star Ultra halogen lamps nine
thousand eight thirty nine thousand
eight review I will give him this the
silver star headlights are nice I use
them on my on my gsx I have in my way
they're pretty bright yeah for sure how
to redeem DLC codes and fine purchased
kings
but somebody tells me one day he didn't
know how to redeem a code so he figured
it out and thought it was a great idea
to share it because he was like they say
you know how to do this so I'm gonna
share with you how to do it now
okay Gold's Gym cycle trainer 290
exercise bike Wow
the Brawn qml 30 SS under cabinet range
hood um let's see wheels you got here
power plug driven car air freshener
review so the bottom line is it's for
example of why I have no interest in
what that guy's opinion is because once
you look at the channel it's kind of
like oh so anyway with that said we're
gonna go you don't do it as a as
full-time no but I'll tell you what you
are is a full-time as a full-time gig
hit me up I'll tell you all about what
you are is a full-time gig anyway guys
we're gonna go thanks for hanging out
with us tomorrow videos dropping early
in the morning we actually we've
actually fully recorded edited and have
online to videos that are not live yet
which sucks what is huge gap in videos
yet but yeah so we're live I don't like
going from Friday to Wednesday without a
video but that couldn't be helped anyway
guys we're gonna we're gonna turn this
off for now thanks for hanging out and
we'll see you soon you need any final
thoughts no bye
