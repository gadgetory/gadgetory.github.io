we are bringing you our very first video
in our first set that we built we got
two more to go but that's besides the
point this has been an exciting Computex
one that I'm sad that I've missed but
alas I have to move the studio and I
have this to build so I'm kind of glad
that I stayed to do this but at the same
time man this is an exciting year when
it comes to Intel vs. AMD's we're gonna
talk about a few things today we're not
gonna talk specifically about the specs
we'll talk about a little bit we're not
gonna give you an overview of Intel's
announcements and AMD's announcements
because I'm sure you've already seen
those videos in your inbox so rather
than be repetitive and just share the
information with you again I'm go ahead
and go ahead and invite you guys to go
and look at your other favorite content
creators that are at Computex right now
covering that information and the
keynotes and stuff as they're happening
what I want to do right now is talk to
you about the the way of thinking moving
forward with the CPU purchases because
summertime is when most people tend to
upgrade or buy a whole new computer or
build a whole new computer and there's
some things I think you guys need for
food-for-thought
because the the entire status quo is
changing today's video is brought to you
by north VPN a VPN service I have been
using for years now like you wouldn't
walk around with your precious expensive
cell phone without a case on it would
you okay I guess plenty of you do but I
digress it will put a case around your
internet experience why I let the isp
slow you down and control your data and
control your packets slowing down your
streaming services YouTube Netflix and
all that sort of stuff with article 13
and make constant up in the air no one
knows what's happening net neutrality
here in the US you can stop people from
spying on your internet connection and
your data and slowing down your internet
by connecting to a secure VPN an order
VPN has more than 5,000 servers in 60
countries using military-grade
encryption meaning nobody can keep an
eye or spy on your data besides you you
can get 75% of it through your
membership and if you use my offer code
J's two cents at checkout you get an
extra month for free so put a case
around your internet stop screwing
around and letting people control your
data I'm serious get an extra month for
free and seventy-five percent off a
three hour membership by using J's two
cents at checkout
all right so we got some exciting stuff
to talk about here I mean this this we
haven't seen this kind of competition in
the CPU space since hiked back at the
early 2000s with the Athlon forty eight
hundred and five thousand days where AMD
was CPU king so highly anticipated rise
in three thousand or these end to
architecture which is already kind of
confusing in the naming but that's okay
it's besides well who cares what you
call it as long as it gets the job done
in the way you want to do it at a price
you want to get it what you're kind of
getting all of that so we've got five
new SKUs here from AMD and and I'm not
going to go through all the specs okay
I'm not gonna do that because this video
is more or less talking to you about the
product maybe have a look at the big
picture in terms of buying or building
or upgrading your new computer or your
existing computer because summertime
tends to be the most common time people
do it because of Computex so I'm gonna
put some food for thought plant some
seeds in your brain hopefully some roots
that come out your ears to help you
figure out how to look at this in terms
of building or upgrading your next
computer we'll also talk a little bit
about what Intel showcased but to be
honest and Kel Intel Intel even killed
didn't show anything new regarding
process two except for one which kind of
deserves a joke all on its own we'll
talk about that later
so we've got the risin 5 - SKUs horizon
5 - SKUs horizon 7 and a new risin 9
which is the 3900 X their new flagship
12 core 24 thread
7 nanometers a TSMC 7 nanometre FinFET
architecture which is funny because
intel has been like unable to even get
their 10 nanometers stuff out in a
timely manner AMD is now rocking a 7
enemy2 FinFET but in a different way so
we'll kind of talk about that and that's
what I sort of want to get some food for
thought and your guys's head now we
don't know yet what the boos clock is
gonna be for all cores we do know that
the base clock is a 3.8 gigahertz
on which is which is kind of funny it's
3.8 which is faster than like even the
3600 which is arisin 5 but 3.8 on all
chloric law are on all cores on the 3900
X 3.9 on the 3800 X which is an 8 core
16 thread what a lot of people were kind
of hoping for which might still come
later was an 18 core 36 thread
Desktop mainstream desktop processor
because these are running on am for
still but it's an x5 70 chipset so if
you're gonna be going to the store
looking for like an X 470 that's
compatible with someone like the the
thirty six hundred and thirty six
hundred X because remember and be
promised us am for to at least 2020
which means it's possible to put an
incompatible processor into a
motherboard and vice versa so what you
want to look for first of all is that
sticker on the box that says Zen - ready
or whatever the sticker is gonna be just
like we saw with the 2000 series Verizon
vs. the 1000 series or the 1800 and all
that sort of stuff but with the twelve
core 24 thread we're seeing a 4.6
gigahertz max boost clock now we don't
know yet how many cores are gonna be
boosted at that usually when we talk
about max boost clock it's of one or two
cores and you're probably gonna see the
same thing here but 4.6 gigahertz on
even one or two course is pretty damn
good considering the fact if you've
tried to overclock any previous rise in
processor then you would probably
remember or know that getting above 3.9
or 4 gigs is a chore on all cores so
that's why I'm trying to I really can't
wait to see what we're gonna actually
gonna be getting in terms of all core
boosts clock because 3.8 is already an
overclock for even the the older
processors and getting 3.8 on all cores
was difficult they're now doing it with
12 core 24th right on 7 animator what
you might have noticed though is the
lack of any discussion regarding thread
Ripper and they're using the term epoch
again which was their data center
processors their cloud farm processors
rendering processors that sort of stuff
it was a very high-end enterprise
solution with tons of core count member
what 32 cores or something like that 24
cores in each one something very high
core count and what it looks like might
be happening here as AMD is trying very
hard to reach that mainstream market
with a higher core count rather than
segmenting their product stack with an
extreme platform and a mainstream
platform but to have a single product
stack that can scale from extra small to
extra large rather than men having to
switch out your whole platform like for
a new motherboard and all that sort of
stuff which is what Intel has been doing
for quite a while
fun fact the only
you can get a 12 core 24 thread
processor on Intel is to go with a 79
20x which is significantly more money
then the four hundred $99 price point
also to the 12 core 24 thread is a
hundred and five watt part versus I
believe one hundred and forty watts on
the Intel 79 20x so not only have they
matched the core count not only have
they matched and technically exceeded
the boost clock and turbo clock or boost
clock of the the base clock and boosts
clock of the intel part they're doing it
at less power so all of those heat your
room and set your home on fire in the
summer time AMD jokes should just be
dubbed now intel jokes if you want to be
technical about it so that's definitely
worth looking at it all all the
processors though on Zen to do feature
PCI Express 4.0 let's talk about that
for a second I've seen some comments on
Twitter and Facebook and an online of
who cares about PCI a 4.0 it doesn't
matter because our graphics cards were
still not saturating pcie 3.0 which was
the same discussion we had when 3.0 came
out because pcie 2.0 was was still kind
of the main the norm then I think a lot
of people are failing to look at here is
this is not just about graphics this is
also about a lot of people now utilizing
the PCI Express interface for mass
storage or for raid cards or for you
know m dot 2 cards and stuff like that
where the actual bottleneck for your i/o
and your storage becomes the interface
itself so we know SATA has been
saturated for a long time SATA 6 is long
gone a 550 megabytes is the theoretical
fastest you can get on that which is why
we moved to m dot 2 on the motherboard
directly but the problem is you're
limited to how many of those m dot 2
slots you can have on your motherboard
because of spacing and that it takes up
already plus you're having it mounted
down flat on your motherboard introduce
some cooling issues especially when
they're sitting underneath of a graphics
card blowing hot air on them so a lot of
people would go with it some sort of a
PCI Express card to put your m2 s on
there which now doubles ends up to raid
cards as well you start having 2 M 2 s
and a PCI Express you can definitely
saturate that throughput very very
quickly
much faster than any graphics card cut
so PCI Express 4.0 is very beneficial
for those people looking for extremely
fast storage so that's something
definitely worth
talking about Oh also to the system
memory specification is 3,200 megabytes
or megabytes 300 megahertz on all of the
parts which is significantly higher than
the original 2133 of the original rise
and stuff the other thing I want to talk
about here though in terms of questions
the only concern I have and the reason
why I have this concern and I can't wait
to test these parts is the fact that
thread Ripper require had the Infinity
fabric that's what Intel referred to as
the glue they're just multiple chips put
on a there multiple SOC s that just
glued together yeah I know the Infinity
fabric was a very well thought out
engineered piece of ingenuity putting
multiple like Chiclets together and
having them communicate the issue was
when we learned specifically about it at
SIGGRAPH back in 2017 was the fact that
the Infinity fabric introduced a little
bit of latency and a little bit of
latency depending on the process that's
happening and the instructions could
turn into a big result depending on the
task that you're doing namely gaming
thread Ripper I don't think was ever
really intended to be a gaming CPU but
you could play games on it and the
problem was that and they specifically
went through lessons on this we went
through our press day was some games saw
a beneficial increase in FPS minimum FPS
and max FPS by disabling the Infinity
fabric altogether and going from that
creator mode to that gamer mode the
problem was you lost half your cores
with it but the problem was you then had
to go in and be like okay I'm gonna play
this game I'm gonna disable it now I'm
gonna do some work I need to re-enable
it and it was just kind of cumbersome to
have to deal with something like that so
considering the fact that Zen 2 and the
core counts that you're seeing here are
dual seven nanometer chip --let's
with a third 14 nanometer IO chip tlit
which is handling things like the memory
controller the PCI Express the chipset
all that sort of stuff I'm curious as to
what that situation is going to be again
have we have we seen enough of an
improvement in that affinity fabric
architecture to where that induced
increased latency is not going to be an
issue where you can just leave it active
all the time so those are the five new
skews from AMD the 3,600 3,600 X 3700 X
3800 X which is funny though both the 30
one hundred and thirty eight hundred are
both a course sixteen thread parts so
they are not to be confused where it was
like the X version was the same core
count but a little bit faster they've
kind of restructured the stack a little
bit they are all are featuring obviously
ddr4 they all require discrete graphics
card they also are as low as 65 Watts so
the 3600 being a six core 12 thread part
using 65 watts so obviously AMD has been
really working hard at the efficiency we
knew that we still need to see what the
actual IPC improvements are on this when
we get hands-on with that which won't be
until probably closer to July we have a
launch date July 7th the next bit of
information we're gonna get is gonna be
on June 10th or right around there at e3
so yeah we still a lot of waiting we
learned some at CES we learned more at
Computex we're gonna learn a little more
at e3 and we'll get the big picture in
July so it's kind of like enough already
but you want to know how you can tell
that AMD is putting the pressure on
Intel normally AMD was the one that kind
of had those little tongue-in-cheek
marketing campaigns like four gigs means
four gigs when the video was going
through the three and a half gig 970
debacle they were also known that
anytime Jen's son was on stage or doing
a keynote or Intel was doing a keynote
or something they were putting out these
little these little blast marketing
campaigns like hey we're over here don't
forget us we're waving our flag and it
was kind of almost like I'm becoming
because some of it was really in bad
taste it's kind of funny because Intel
started doing that now because
everyone's talking about AMD like I am
right now I started my channel with AMD
I started with an FX 8120 I upgraded to
an 8350 and then from there I think I
went to a z77 or something and I've been
playing around with Intel ever since
because the max performance games were
always on Intel but our overclocking and
stuff but what's also happening too with
this chip lit design it's it's allowing
them to do better binning because they
can actually bend the chip let's before
they're actually like final composition
or construction of the die because once
it's all put together with the
controller and everything on the exact
same die then you're stuck with it and
then if it doesn't pass validation then
you have to step down the course or lock
the cores member the old days with
or that we're locked on AMD and then you
could go in and unlock them and maybe
get an unstable processor now they can
do a much better job at binning which
means we'll probably see better
overclocking we'll probably sees better
across-the-board performance in terms of
just you know some processors that you
give it 50 megahertz and it just crashes
on its face because those are the ones
that met the spec but barely we'll
probably see a much better job at
overclocking with these processors but
Intel was kind of putting out a lot of
blast marketing like hey more cores
doesn't mean better cores are not
created equal
oh yeah AMD also doesn't suffer from
zombie a zombie low misses Zombieland
yeah rule 36 never by Intel um
that's why AMD does it doesn't suffer
from zombie load and it had very little
impact from meltdown inspector so there
was nothing new to talk about with
desktop processors for Intel they really
focused on mobile processors they talked
about some their integrated graphics
changes that are coming we'll do a whole
separate video on that we will be doing
some some hopefully some Intel testing
with some of the new notebooks they've
really stepped up their internal
graphics or their their AI GPUs to try
and compete with like the Vega stuff
that you saw with with AMD's 2200 G and
24 energy that's obviously because they
poached Raja and they've also now
poached tapped from Nvidia so I think
we're gonna see the graphics department
get bolstered we're where you might see
now his Intel get better at the a GPU
side but it's like a little more the CPU
stuff because they're putting all those
eggs in that basket where AMD's cpu side
is extremely strong we need the graphics
side of AMD to now put the pressure on
Nvidia that's what we truly need and
Intel is gonna try that too with their
graphics and discrete graphics cards as
well so it's becoming extremely exciting
but let's talk about the one desktop CPU
that Intel is sort of talking about the
9900 KS or which has been dubbed the
keep spending basically it's the exact
same 19 100k you're always been used to
that comes out of the box with all cores
boosting to 5 gigahertz which I'd yet to
find a 90 100 K that couldn't do that
already
um yeah so anyway if you're looking at
building or buying a new computer in the
near future I would HIGHLY wait until
after we see the independent reviews on
the AMD not because I don't think it's
gonna be worth it but because I think
it's gonna be better than a lot of us
are anticipating and that is a huge
claim for me because I have always said
take AMD news with a grain of salt
because AMD has always been known to
have some questionable charts and
questionable marketing and stuff and the
hype train always derailed right before
launch I think I think AMD is gonna do
everything in their power to make sure
this one lives up to what we expected
which is why we've been waiting so long
for it so anyway guys this is where you
chime in now and whether or not you
think AMD Zen 2 is worth waiting for
what are you guys excited for when it
comes to CPUs going through this summer
we are going to be doing obviously
builds and benchmarks with these I have
a lot of high hopes for this and I hope
that I'm not let down but that's why
this is just a talking head piece
because this is all speculative or
speculative speculative specular tutoria
t'v alright guys thanks for watching and
sound off down the comments below I'm
sure the family isms are gonna come out
in full force so just you know what have
at it this is also the complaints bin if
you have any complaints put him in here
welcome to my new bedroom welcome to my
lair we should dude was that could you
hear that and now we just need the
nvidia side of AMD or the a the nvidia
side yeah we've</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
