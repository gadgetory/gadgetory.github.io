I'm going to admit this is a video that
should have come out a long time ago but
I thought that this product was going to
be just sort of a basic product and it
turns out to be a very advanced product
and one that did a lot of things I was
wishing somebody would do and it's been
sitting in my closet all this time J
really is a dickhole with its
specifically tuned copper base and
maintenance free plug-and-play
operations the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
ok so today we are specifically going to
be looking at NZXT new hue plus advanced
PC illumination kit and I've actually
got two of these here so immediately I
want to give a huge thanks to the guys
over at NZXT for sending these to me
after all I did request that they send
these because I wanted to do custom
lighting in the 6700 K bill that I did
which was that you know black s340 case
which was razor themed and I wanted to
put these in there but as you know I
wasn't able to use because of the fact
that there is no USB 2.0 headers on the
z170 motherboard that I used in that
build so they went back in the closet
and I stopped thinking about them and I
thought today well maybe we'll go ahead
and check these out on the test bench
holy should I check these out
sooner because this is by far the
coolest thing you can do to really make
your PC pop and a good pop not like the
electrical pop and you'll pop smoke than
that
that's smell of burnt money basically so
they sent me two of these I got one
hooked up right now for demo and as you
can see here there are three strips each
strip has 10 LEDs and you don't have to
daisy chain them like this you can
actually use two channels there are two
channels on the control module that
allow you to independently control
what's happening with the lighting so if
you wanted to have different zones of
your PC with different lighting say like
the basement of skunk works or something
separated with like a mid plate then you
could have different lighting in there
if you use both channels now each
channel can control 40 LEDs now each one
of these strips has 10 LEDs so basic
math and arithmetic will tell you that
you can have four of these hooked up per
channel now they only include three with
the kit so that means you could buy more
of these if you wanted to do more
lighting but each one of these as I said
have
10 LEDs as we can see right here this is
what the length of 30 of these LEDs
looks like it's a pretty good length it
actually measures up about 3 feet it's
about a foot per each one of these
strips now the control box itself
actually communicates with the software
the cam software that you use for NZXT
via USB 2.0 header on your motherboard
now one of the reasons why I didn't use
this was because like I said earlier the
motherboard i use didn't have a USB 2.0
header now if your motherboard doesn't
you could know that we're talking header
on the motherboard here we're not
talking about USB ports we're talking
about header if your motherboard doesn't
have that for whatever reason you could
technically use just a standard microUSB
cable because that's all it is is a
microUSB to a header plug by running
that through the back of your case
either through a grommet or removing one
of like the PCI slot covers run that to
the back of your case and then you could
just plug it into the motherboard
through a standard USB so there are ways
around it it's just not the prettiest
way to do it but there are workarounds
but anyway it also gets power through a
4-pin molex plug which I wish was a SATA
plug because more modern pcs are using
more SATA power than 4 pin molex so it
would have made it a lot more tidy where
you would have had to say maybe run one
molex cable off your PSU just to power
this thing most pcs these days are not
actually using 4-pin molex so one thing
I would have liked to have seen a little
bit different but other than that it
gives you plenty of extension cables so
that you can route these as far as you
want you can put extension cables
between these if you wanted to extend
one out somewhere else so there's a lot
of flexibility in the way that this gets
put together now I'm going to admit when
I first saw this I thought ok it's an
RGB light strip it's going to be able to
do the basic stuff like like your
keyboards can do with breathing or color
shift or reactive or whatever marquise
marquise kind of neat and it wasn't
really all that exciting to me I'm like
ok change colors you can do different
modes a lot of people don't care about
that sort of stuff let me tell you what
it can do that I think is very very very
cool is the fact that it can continue
computer what I mean by that this LED
strip can change colors based on what
you
set for just about anything so for
instance let's say you want the colors
to change based on CPU temperatures you
can kind of keep track of your CPU temps
visually that would be kind of neat for
a test bench or even just a display
CPU or PC or maybe you just want
something different you can tell the
colors what to do based on what
temperature your CPU is or your GPU or
even the frames per second that you're
getting on your computer you can have
the thing respond to different music so
you can have music playing and have the
light bouncing around in conjunction and
sync with the music I mean this is
really freaking awesome now this is all
happening because of NZXT T's cam
software now the cam software is not
just a control center for NZXT products
but it is going to tell you everything
going on with your computer it's
designed to kind of be a replacement for
all of those kind of broken pieces of
software that haven't been updated over
time like a hardware monitor or PC
wizard or whatever you can replace all
those pieces of software with one this
cam suite from NZXT and you can see
things like individual core load on your
CPU you can see core temperatures you
can see your voltage is your current
multipliers our current CPU speed GPU
temperatures fps I mean anything
happening Ram utilization Ram speed Ram
timings it all shows up here and it's
very easy to use it's very very simple
now unfortunately it does really want
you to create an online user account by
using either a social media like log in
to their Facebook or something like that
or creating a standalone account but
that's not required you can log in as a
guest you do lose out on some of the
online features like CPU data logging
like when the computer when the software
is running it's pretty much data logging
what's happening with your CPU and you
can go back and pop in the past and kind
of look at what your PC was doing in the
past is now if you're thinking man
things are running hotter than I
remember you could like login online and
look at the history and see oh yeah my
CPU is running hotter than it was so
there's a lot of cool things you could
do but you miss out on that by not
creating an account but not creating an
account doesn't stop you from using the
software which obviously would have been
a huge if they required you to make an
account to use something you bought all
right so enough chatting about it let's
go ahead and do kind of a demo here of
some of the lighting features there's
way too much to cover and I'm not going
to do a
all demonstration of the software
because it really kind of deserves its
own video so you guys tell me if based
on what you've seen here if you think
you'd like a more in-depth video review
of the software we can do that as well
because this is something that you can
use without the hue this is something
you can install on your system and then
if you added NZXT products then it is
something that you could you know
control your nzsg products as well like
you know eat fans and whatever else like
these are definitely going in skunk
works especially since i'm uh this is
just going to make the system seem that
much cooler alright let's get into the
demo I know the camera is not going to
pick this up nearly as good as it looks
in real life especially when the you
know camera lenses have a hard time
telling the difference between whites
and blues and things like that but we
are going to try anyway
so here is just a plain white with fix
what I do like is that it does pick up
the subtle differences between some of
the different colors here like you have
you know you've got like a magenta color
so here's magenta
you've got pink there's definitely a
color difference for two magenta and
pink all those subtle the LEDs do it
perfectly here's like a more of a
lavender color here is a purple which is
not showing up too well on camera dan
damn it but anyway here's like a light
blue here's a green and you can also
change you know based on the infinite
color range a spectrum here whatever
colors you want but that you get the
idea there so breathing is pretty basic
you can choose the colors that you want
add another color let's make that one
let's say breathe purple so now it's
going to breathe between blue and like a
purple color you can choose how fast it
does it let's make it fastest it's going
to be like super fast so there's the
color so you can add as many of those
colors as you want Marc is really neat
for instance you can see here you have
this blue light that's kind of going
around you got this comment button here
which I don't know if you can tell the
LEDs that are following behind it aren't
lit as brightly so it kind of looks like
a comment trail if you uncheck that then
it's just the LEDs that it's brightest
as they go by I like the comment trail
it looks kind of neat if it was going to
comment it had to be more of a
many color comedy comedy and if that
makes any sense
so there we go there's our comment make
it red that's more of a purple huh do
red over here so you can pick any colors
you want make it really dark even
there's red I think that marquee looks
neat here's a covering marquee here
where you have two colors so for
instance you can see here we have blue
being covered up by green so you can
make as many colors go by as you want
let's make this now let's make it red so
you got blue being covered by green
being covered by red add as many of
those as you want pulse pretty obvious
it's just going to pop back up and go
down pop back up or you can add another
color so let's have it pulse red and
yellow pop into yellow pop into red
whatever you want spectrum wave this is
kind of like demo mode of sort of
everything you see on the keyboards
everyone does you know the keyboard
demonstrations are always rainbow we
make it go the other way if you want so
if you were to put these around your
case they could be doing you know
circles around your case alternating is
kind of neat we can make this Christmas
see if we change that blue to green BAM
so we got there's like Christmas colors
right there but here's the other things
you've got smart here so we've got CPU
temperature right so if we save that
right now the colors are going to be
based on our CPU temps and if I start
something up like a 264 and then do a
stress test here you can see the colors
will change based on the stress test and
it's also going to change based on where
we have it set on the actual scale so
you can change the colors here we've got
blue is between 20 30 and 40 see purple
is between 50 60 and 70 and then 80 90
and 100 are red but let's say we want
red to represent full load we can just
move these up move the red up or click
on it change it whatever we want so now
they're red because we're under low
and I changed those colors so anything
between 50 and 70 C shows up as red now
if I was to stop the test you'll see
we'll come back down to the blue pretty
quickly and what's cool is it's not just
going to switch between these colors
directly as you saw when I started it up
and when I stopped it it did do an
actual blend of the color so what's blue
plus red is purple see how we're going
to purple so we know we're in between
those ranges FPS mode this is only going
to matter if it can communicate with
your GPU I'm finding that the NZXT
software is not communicating with my
fury x very well so wasn't making any
changes based on GPU so that's something
worth keeping in mind
you've got audio here so we put it on
sync mode there's level sync and gain so
like for instance if I put on gain and
then I start let's say my youtube
channel here but he does it with your
pad that's kind of neat right what's
going on all your GPU addicts
you know that's have we change it to a
different mode like let's say sync so
that means all of the individual strips
on here are doing the same thing where
if we have it just by gain then all of
them make one big meter as you can see
so you can customize that so there you
go guys that's basically the NZXT hue
advanced PC illumination I think if
you're looking for a way to make your
system kind of unique and kind of
control something custom with the
lighting and know that no matter what
you have the right lights for the job no
matter what you want to do this is
definitely a kit worth taking a look at
so if you're looking for something
custom when it comes to lighting in your
computer this is definitely like the
only place you should look NZXT had the
original hue but that didn't do anything
smart or custom like this where all you
could do by the use of RGB dials on the
front of like a five and a quarter bay
you know slot was actually change the
color of the lights and that was it it
didn't react to sound you couldn't make
it react to temperatures or anything
like that so if you're looking for
something cool and unique this is
definitely the only place you should
look in my opinion tell me what you guys
are using when it comes to light so you
guys have asked me for a lot of lighting
tutorials do you want to see more
videos like this like I said these are
going into skunkworks and I think they
are going to definitely fulfill the
purpose that I needed when it comes to
custom lighting in my system anyway guys
time to get out of here tell me what you
use for lights and tell me what you want
to see when it comes to custom PC
modding in the future when it comes to
my channel and I'll do the best I can to
bring you guys those videos that you
think would be interesting anyway time
to get outta here as always thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
