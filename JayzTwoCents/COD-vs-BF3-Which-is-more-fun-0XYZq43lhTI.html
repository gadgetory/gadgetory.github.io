out you here with a gameplay commentary
you've requested it you've got it here
it is I'm playing Battlefield 3's brand
new expansion aftermath on the marques
monolith map and I have got some
beasting tank action coming here for you
did so did really well given the fact
that I just hopped in here had no idea
what was going on and I hope you enjoyed
this gameplay I want to talk about
something now that's gonna get just a
little bit controversial I don't really
know what to expect when it comes to the
response to this video but I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm just gonna do it I am
gonna talk about Call of Duty vs.
battlefield and how to tell which one of
these games is tailored more for you
Call of Duty it's been around for quite
a while but so is battlefield
battlefield 1942 was the first
battlefield in is 10 years old in fact
it just had its ten-year anniversary I
think last month and they were giving
away battlefield 1942 for free on Steam
but you know battlefield and Call of
Duty a lot of people like to take that
rift like Android versus iPhone and you
know Mac versus PC you know that all
that stupid stuff but you can't really
compare in my opinion Call of Duty -
battlefield because they're two entirely
different styles of gameplay and what I
mean by that is Call of Duty is all
first-person shooter running around yeah
you may get some kill streak you know
weapon operation there in a helicopter
or you know a missile or something like
that but battlefield battlefield is all
about total immersion into war you see
right here in the screen you've got a
helicopter obviously I'm in a tank
you've got smaller tank destroyers and
some of the other maps you've got gun
ships you've got attack helicopters jets
boats it's just everything thrown into
the mix here which really allows you to
you know really branch out of just
running and gunning and
you know I I'm okay at running and
gunning I'm not bad I can hold my own
but you put me in a tank or you put me
in a chopper and it's like oh my God
look out because that is where I am used
to it that's where I shine but you put
me in a game like Call of Duty where I
am just stuck running around with a gun
and what I've got on me and it's a whole
different game for me it's not the same
I'm not very good at it and it's why I
didn't really do great at close quarters
I mean I felt like close quarters was an
attempt by Dyson EA to try and capture
some Call of Duty players and maybe you
know convert them into battlefield
saying Hale okay fine you don't want
vehicles fine no vehicles checking out
all you want small mass okay here we'll
just put everyone right the fuck on top
of each other and then just bow out
madness
Oh we'll put some flags in there and
random spawn points all over the place
and bam there you go award-winning
expansion want war no a lot of people
liked it a lot of people didn't so they
came out with aftermath and ever
expansion that's come out so far for the
franchise has been a different style of
war and in this one here as you can see
everything is already demolished you
know the idea here is that a giant
earthquake hit and you're running around
and you know if you're playing scavenger
mode you start with only a sidearm and
you've got to pick up on the a gun off
the ground
there's no tanks there's no jeeps
there's nothing it's just you've got to
deal with whatever it is that you can
pick up and very very limited ammunition
so you've really got to change your
gameplay style you've got to play
defensive you've got to make sure that
you plan ahead you really use cover to
your advantage because you can't go just
running around you don't have the backup
you don't have them the ammunition but
you've got both games have their
gameplay styles you know and you've got
hard point on this one battlefield to be
the equivalent of kind of like a king of
the hill but that's only available in
armored kill and with tanks and a
shitton of tanks and very very annoying
in my head don't like it whatsoever Call
of Duty has just never appealed to a
player like me like battlefield did
because I just I was just so out of my
element when it came to Call of Duty and
I've got it for Xbox I've played it a
little bit I haven't
they had a whole lot of time to really
get in there and get you know personal
with call of duty I haven't gotten the
feel for the controller you know I do
play battlefield on PC obviously if
you've watched my other videos you know
I'm a big PC gamer that's not a fat joke
by the way I am big but I'm just saying
you know that I am really into PC gaming
and customizing my computer and that
sort of stuff and so I can't a lot of
people ask me all the time do you play
Call of Duty or I play battlefield
mostly and they just kind of go what
what do you mean you play battlefield
man Call of Duty's where it's at and
it's no not for me but I I have had fun
in the past with Call of Duty I did have
fun with modern warfare 2 and in fact I
actually had that for both Xbox and PC
and I didn't really play much on PC but
I had a lot of fun within an Xbox but if
you're watching this gameplay here
you've got to admit that the world and
the immersion of battlefield is just so
much more realistic than Call of Duty
but then again Call of Duty is a game
built for console even though it debuted
on PC first and was primarily a PC game
up through Call of Duty - just saying
but it became primarily a console game
and you know you're very limited on
consoles on what you can do when it
comes to the graphics but in PC things
are constantly evolving you've got
different settings options and you can
you I mean look at the smoke right I
mean look at the look at the atmosphere
look at the building is a sparks it's
just it's the explosions it's so much
more realistic and when it comes to Call
of Duty versus battlefield that is what
really draws me into the game is feeling
like I'm really there and the graphics
are a huge part of it but you know just
again they're stuck on seven-year-old
technology and they're getting better at
coding for it and making it look better
and but what they're really doing here
is they're kind of just tricking the
console into you know rendering things a
little bit differently I mean they're
there I believe if I'm not mistaken
they're steals they're still stuck on
DirectX 10 on the console and we know
we're already here in DirectX 11 and
DirectX 11 revisions which gives you a
lot of the
custom looks at you a lot of the realism
that you see now but you know I just
want to go ahead and put out a little
bit of video here at some gameplay and
just go ahead and let you guys decide
which is better Call of Duty or
battlefield 3 I'm a battlefield 3 player
but I do have Call of Duty so once again
if you're gonna troll me you can go
ahead and just eat me because I don't
really give a shit
so that's been Jays two cents but as
always I'm gonna go ahead and be a
little bit of an attention whore here
and say follow me on Twitter subscribe
to my channel friend me on Facebook and
check out my other videos on YouTube
what was the main reason for you
starting your channel
I just found myself constantly drawn
towards computers and electronic to get
to feel a little bit more real I have a
