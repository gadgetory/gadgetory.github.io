universal USB outlets a 2.1 for your

matter which device you have as long as
USB powered you can do a lightning
connector 30 pin or micro and it just
plug in it right there it takes about
seven to eight hours to charge the
battery inside the great thing is you

want to travel separately how many full
charges you anticipate you can get off
that battery for other devices I like to
say an example for the iphone 5 you can
get about six charges 16 charges out of
it and you can charge the ipad about
three-quarters way and how long from
dead to pull on a about eight hours so
about overnight you can have a charge

this or your iPad with a lightning
connector this will charge your phone
about two and a half times or you will
charge your iPad about a quarter too

Front's of 2.1 amp so you can charge
your other devices at the same speed as
