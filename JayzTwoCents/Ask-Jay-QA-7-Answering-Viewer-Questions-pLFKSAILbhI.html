know what I haven't done in a long time
that is AQA that I pull straight from
Twitter every now and then I get some
really good questions usually some silly
ones and then some that are just way too
long to answer in this series but it's
been a while since I've done this we're
going to do that today we're into an
easy video and then we are going to get
this week kicked off with some really
good stuff obviously we got some new AMD
stuff coming we've got some stuff with
far cry 5 we'll be doing a further
investigation of our minimum spec series
and we got a lot of things happening so
I just want to kind of start it off with
something little bit more lighthearted
and fun and answering obviously your
guys's questions via Twitter not
Facebook got on Facebook
do you want to be cooler do you want to
be more desirable well you're in luck
because right now you can own your very
own J's to send swag and immediately be
the cool kid on the block max out your
sex appeal by following the link down
below now looking through these there
was a bit of a theme a lot of people
were asking a lot of car questions which
is actually kind of cool because in 2018
we are gonna be doing a lot more car
stuff here on this channel I don't think
it's any surprise that I am as much a
car enthusiast as I am a tech enthusiast
so if you see that kind of a theme here
I can't help it it it felt like a huge
amount of these questions were actually
related to cars so the first one here
actually comes from another youtuber his
name is Armando Ferreira and he asked
what are some things you don't like
about your new Camaro that's one of
those things that if you guys aren't
sure what he's referencing I actually
have a 20 18:01 1lv Camaro which is an
extremely track-focused car
believe it or not the list of things I
don't like about it's probably as long
as the list of things I do like about it
for instance it's extremely expensive on
consumables I've already put 3,300 miles
on the car and then that have already
gone through a complete set of tires of
almost an entire set of brakes I don't
know how many oil changes because
obviously we change the oil every time
we track the vehicle and I have gone to
a whopping two track days or nine hot
lap sessions 20 minute sessions and yeah
the car is extremely hard on consumables
but that's because we're driving it like
it was meant to be driven Jacob D'Angela
asks what is more enjoyable working on
your car or your PC do you see when you
see the theme here I enjoy working on
both it depends on my mood the nice
thing about having multiple hobbies is
the fact that when I'm sick of one I can
go on to the other when I'm sick of both
I then just obviously do more family
stuff but I like both equally in
completely different ways they they
scratch an itch or they rustle a
different Jimmy inside of me and is that
right do we why are we doing that as
ever the cool kids say we rustle Jimmy
OC okay I guess I'm I guess I'm litt
epic Izzie says of all the GPUs we've
owned which one is your favorite and
which one pushed the tech forward the
most significantly you know it's really
hard to say because I mean each
generation of graphics card has about
the same interval of performance
increase am bees always been a little
bit behind in video at least since the
fermi area which is like the GTX 400
series cards but I'd have to say Pascal
is probably one of the biggest
advancements in terms of efficiency that
we've seen in a very long time with
graphics cards which I think has made it
a lot more well before graphics card
prices got inflated a lot more
applicable to many people because you
didn't need high-end power supplies and
super beefy power supplies to run
extremely power hungry graphics cards
you could do 1080p gaming with a 1050 or
a 1060 and you could get away with a 500
watt or a 400 watt power supply and not
have a problem but the most
technologically advanced I think
graphics card we've seen so far that
hasn't performed as well as we were
hoping though was actually Vega from AMD
I mean it was HBM - obviously we had the
fury cards which are HBM won but they've
actually been really pushing the
envelope on advancing technology we just
need to see an improvement obviously on
the overall power consumption and you
know the actual performance out of Vega
so I guess we'll have to see what
happens with them obviously in videos
version of stacked memory or HBM high
bandwidth memory to see what's gonna
happen in the future so I know I'm gonna
mutilate you name I'm sorry is it
Gyan me Gumi yeah soon I want to say
Guillermo but I know it's not right he
says considering what we know about
pretty much of you would you recommend
it and if so would you put some kind of
warning recommendations on when and how
to use it first of all primo chill does
put warnings on view and how long to use
it and basically you know they kind of
give you some guidelines there the
problem is those kind of came out after
a lot of the problems started so people
had already bought it
what I've got right here is my thread
Ripper build I did last year that
actually has the same view in it that's
been running all along with no problems
but as I've showed in other videos I did
had system have systems where it reacted
poorly like my day-to-day editing rig
which completely gunked-up and turned
into like a pasty material but we also
had NIC system which was running the
original green fluid we tested that
didn't have any problems and actually
clean the blocks so as you can see
there's a huge variance in reaction
depending on the part center in your
system the metals that are used the
variants of metals between the different
manufacturers so it's really hard for me
to say what your use would be like which
is why it's kind of recommended only for
like a showpiece and probably not a good
day to day fluid
Jimmy champagne who also has a channel
and stuff about horror asks my favorite
Friday the 13th you guys don't know my
real name is not Jay it's Jason Jay is
short for Jason and I have always been a
huge jason voorhees a Friday the 13th
fan having watched all of them multiples
and multiples and multiples of time gone
to fan Expos I even have a screen
accurate Jason costume that I wear at
Halloween time usually make the news
because it's so real and my favorite
movie has got to be part 6 simply
because so ridiculous the way that he
comes back to life or zombie Jason has
becomes kind of known forward is no
spoilers if you guys haven't seen it
it's like 35 years old or whatever but I
digress guys it is probably one of the
most ridiculous ways a villain comes
back to life and I think that is what
makes it my favorite to be honest
oculus nae says when will the post
Malone build be done
I should have the chassis back in the
next week or two tops
then the build can start completely
custom absolutely nothing like it on the
market yes it's based off of obviously
the specter case from singularity
singularity computers but this one as we
talked about with the last video with
him is completely custom his album is
dropping on the 27th of April he's going
on tour so we've got to get the bill
done so that when he gets back from tour
it is totally ready to go but it is
going to look like nothing you have seen
before on a PC trust me will Johnson
says do you think you'll do a video I'm
getting used video cards or maybe even
looking at last gen cards to do a future
video I don't plan on doing a series on
how to buy used graphics cards only
because the market is so different in
every different part of the this country
alone let alone the world but I do
revisit new titles with old hardware all
the time it's new series we started it's
our minimum spec series will it run kind
of a series where we take really low-end
computers and find where the sweet spot
kind of is in terms of getting that
magical 1080p 60fps number so the answer
to your question the kind of a short
format is yes we will be doing older
hardware with newer stuff as we move
forward we've been doing it we're gonna
continue to do it
Kyle metier says what makes you roll
your eyes the most and go really the
most in life it's this new age wave of
entitlement 100% Jose Luis Lopez says
what's your background in gaming what
consoles did you grow up with and what
game series were you most loyal to or
was it always PC gaming no I played
console and PC both growing up my very
first console was actually an in
television
that's like back to the Atari era and
then obviously had an NES SNES and
Playstation and all that and I had PC
gaming along at the same time I was a
huge fan over aces over the Pacific and
aces over Europe which was obviously a
world war two fighter pilot game I was
also really heavily into the Resident
Evil series on console I played that on
the original PlayStation all the way up
through the consoles after that I just
really got into Resident Evil probably
goes back to my whole love of Friday the
13th another zombie type stuff so I
don't know
I just really liked that series how long
have I been married I got married
October 15 2005 so I am actually coming
up on my 13th year anniversary yes 13th
year anniversary I've been with my wife
almost 19 years total yeah I think we've
sort of smashed this statistic and each
other at least twice Victor Pino says
what's the next step for the studio is
that where you want it to be or are you
still moving stuff around we're always
moving stuff around we've are actually
just this last week we changed stuff on
behind the scenes that you can't see
trying to come up with more space and
new sets it's always gonna be a work in
progress
peanut says when you're old enough to
retire from making content do you hope
one of your kids will carry on the
legacy of your channel to be honest I
hope my kids form their own legacies I
don't want them to walk in my footsteps
I would be perfectly fine with them
creating their own personas and doing
their own thing obviously my oldest
daughter wants to be a youtuber I think
most kids do these days which is kind of
weird if they wanted to carry on my
legacy more power to them but I don't
want them to feel like they have to I
want them to create their own legacies
if that's not the cliche enough answer
oh here's a good one David Freeman says
wide or fold by fold and I fold and then
you know what I wipe and I wipe and I
wipe and I wipe still poop Nick Poole
says if you could go back and tell
yourself something about the direction
your life took after leaving your job to
do YouTube what would you say and what
advice would you give yourself about the
future absolutely nothing I would never
go back and talk to my old self I feel
like that would metal in the future more
than actually help it which means I
would probably never end up where I am
today
not only that I would probably end up
going insane seeing myself come up and
talk to myself claiming I'm from the
future which would then put me in an
assay asylum and none of this would ever
happen this video wouldn't be happening
right now and you would have never asked
that question because I never would have
existed it's called the butterfly effect
we don't we don't flap our wings on this
out of the world no seriously I would I
would never go give myself an old piece
of advice everything we experience makes
us who we are and I need to experience
it without any meddling let's put it
that way Matt Gibbs asked what do you
think most likely happened to bit wit
Kyle's loop
I feel like he might have had some sort
of an issue happening maybe with his
pump or maybe I don't know it's hard to
say because I wasn't there I haven't
seen his system in person I haven't seen
the way that how well the tubes fit in
the fittings I have no idea what the
o-ring condition was sometimes you put
tubes and or ings that you clamp down
you can slice the o-ring by accident but
given the amount of splash there was
it's pretty obvious that the pipe popped
off while the pump was still running so
we know the pump is working but it could
have built up pressure I've seen this
happen before in other systems where the
fitting the tube will just pop off and
then suddenly it throws up all over the
system I can't say other than it's
obvious it built up too much pressure
because it had been running fine for
about a year I think without any sort of
issues so I honestly have no idea
Joel Paulino says would you do a fan
fest as Linus is doing you talk about
Linus tech Expo no I don't think I have
enough fans to ever even fill a
cafeteria let alone any sort of a
conference center but I will say this I
am actually gonna be attending Linus
tech Expo so if you guys want to come
and say hi I'm just gonna be there
hanging out and if you guys want to come
and say hi and meet me or in Linus or
anyone else then head on up to Vancouver
in July it's gonna be a lot of fun
Stephen Chavarria says why do you
advocate water cooling so much and how
did you get into it why does anyone like
anything why does someone like the color
red why does someone like fast cars and
why is one guy like a fast computer
while the other guys more into airplanes
and this guy's into trains we don't know
why we like the things we like we just
know that we do and water cooling has
always been one of them I like the idea
of taking liquid and using it to cool
electronics I mean there's a there's an
inherent risk here obviously that I find
a bit exciting I mean ask Kyle he's had
how many leaks now but no to be honest
it's it's just a thing I like and I
advocate it because plenty of people
have had good success with it I have
never had a system just blow up on me
but I've also got a lot of experience
and I think
I don't know something I'm always gonna
do I I did liquid nitrogen last year for
the first time which was amazing I still
have all those parts and I might play
around that a little bit more in the
future but it's like anything else you
like it because you like it and you
don't really argue with that see if I
find any more good moons because that
was a lesson so with that guys I'm gonna
go thanks for watching I'm gonna
probably try and do this like once a
month this is fun I like talking
directly to you guys it shows that
there's real people on the other side of
that camera and obviously there's real
people on this side of the camera so
guys I'm gonna go thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
