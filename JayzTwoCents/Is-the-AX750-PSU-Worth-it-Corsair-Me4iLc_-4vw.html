picked myself up a brand new power
supply my thermaltake tr2 just wasn't
cutting it anymore I was getting a lot
of voltage drop so I wanted to step this
up and I went with a 80 plus gold series
corsair ax750 so we're going to do an
unboxing of this I've never done an
unboxing video before so I don't really
know what to expect here but I want to
say right off the bat I picked this up
at my local frys in anaheim california
and i got it for an incredible price i
got it for 135 bucks brand-new and it
comes with a ten-dollar rebate so 125
dollars in the end and looking at newegg
right now it's 160 999 with a fifteen
dollar rebate making it 150 499 + n plus
you have to pay shipping on that so I
got a hell of a deal on this I just
couldn't pass it up considering
everything else in the same price range
was a bronze rated so every single
connector it's kind of hard to see I
know if you can see that right here you
can see it on the front here for sure
every connector is modular so you're not
stuck with this bundle of wires coming
out you know it's big clump of wires and
then some modular everything is modular
on this this is a 750 watt unit I bumped
it up from 650 i'm using a 650 now but
you know 750 is more than enough if i
decide to sli my 680 in the future
because they're so efficient but i am a
fan of single graphics cards just
because of the simplicity so i'll
probably just stick with 750 at the most
here it is a gold rated so i am going to
get a full 750 if i need it but what i
like about this power supply here is
that you know it does have a PM pwm fan
in it so the fan speed as you can see
right here does ramp up with load but
you've got two of the eight pins you've
got four of the PCI Express you got 12
SATA connectors oh my god eight of the
4-pin peripheral or the molex and then
you've got two of the floppy drives
don't need that here you've just got
your general information all different
languages
but yeah that's pretty much it here just
showing the efficiency here and this is
the fan chart and then just showing you
here you know here's your outputs here
you DC output max load okay so let's go
ahead and cut this thing open here so we
can do without cutting myself my wife
doesn't normally let me near sharp
things we always seem to end up in the
ER I want to make this a qu unboxing so
many people will open it up first and
then put it all back in the box and you
know that it's not really an unboxing
because I'm boxing supposed to be you
know your first impressions of the way
it's packed the presentation from the
company you know as well as make the
person feel like they just bought it and
what are they getting for their money
here so and we've got another another
level of security here so that's good
there we go alright so you got your
manual here you got 650 750 and 1200 I
was actually looking for a 650 they
didn't have any in stock so I just went
ahead with the 750 didn't mind having a
little bit of overhead there that's a
manual I'm a man I don't read that nice
very heavy gauge power supply wall plug
here this is much heavier than 1 i'm
using now i might switch that out they
give you some zip ties as well as a
Corsair powered by corsair stick around
there it's kind of cool got some black
screws right here if you use to connect
it to your case and here I'm imagining
this is going to be all of our cables
set this nice bag the sleeping on these
are nice so this here is our it's like
this is our PCI Express 8-pin another
PCI Express so yeah these are all our
cables here interestingly enough the
SATA cables are not sleeved
however it appears that everything else
might be yeah so the molex and the SATA
cables are not sleeved the PCI Express
ones are so go figure on that one nice
styrofoam packing right here for the
power supply power supply comes in a bag
sniffing else in the box down there
let's go ahead and loosen this up that's
not too big it's nice and heavy though
nice the whole back is a grill so you
got nice cooling features there 120
millimeter fan on the top nice Corsair
logo there's all your modular
connections so as you can see there are
no wires coming out of here whatsoever
all the way so here's your 24 pin
interesting so apparently it comes with
a different connector for the 1200
because this is labeled a 650 350 ax
only all right so there you go that's
the ax750 power supply the gold series
from Corsair so check me out next time
when am Boxxy AF one forty millimeter
case fan from Corsair that is rumored to
be one of the best fans that you could
possibly get right now next to the
gentle typhoons so can't wait to see how
that one performs all right take care
