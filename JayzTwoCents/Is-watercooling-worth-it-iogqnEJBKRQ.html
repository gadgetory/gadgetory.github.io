perspective of being the go-to guy on
YouTube for water cooling and although
that was never actually intentional I'll
go ahead and brace that and we will
start at the beginning here with the
very important question of should you
even water cool your computer a lot of
folks especially on forums think it's
very cut and dry the answer is yes or
the answer is no but I don't think it's
quite that simple so today we're going
to talk about it we're gonna let you
know hopefully by the end of this video
if you think water cooling is going to
be for you guys it's 2016 it's a brand
new year so why not learn something new
don't just learn what I'm teaching you
head on over to Linda comm / J that's J
a why and choose from thousands of
online tutorials where you guys can
learn at your own pace about pretty much
any subject you want from leading
industry experts where else can you
possibly go on the Internet where you
can learn from the best of the best
about subject matter that pertains and
interests you that's the big thing about
Linda comm is that you can check it out
and learn at your own pace and that's
what's going to help you learn things so
head over there right now and get your
free trial at lynda.com / J and check
out anything that you want from their
thousands of online videos and tutorials
lynda.com /jj a wide link is in the
description head over there right now or
at the end of this video or open a new
tab whatever watch them at the same time
I mean it's like multitasking now that
business has been taken care of let's
get down to the subject matter for today
and that being probably one that I am
asked so much I see it on twitter
facebook Instagram YouTube messages it
doesn't matter emails especially emails
been in flux with emails lately of
people asking me pretty much the basic
question of J should i water cool my PC
now I think that's kind of a loaded
question I don't think the answer is
really all that easy I think the
questions should be more rewarded in J
do I need to water cool should is always
a subjective question and that's going
to be the answer is going to vary
obviously on the perspective of both the
person asking and the person answering
now do I think you should water call
your PC uh I can't answer that I can't
say yes I can't say no the answer of do
I need to walk
cool my PC is going to be on the
perspective of what do you want your PC
to do are you going to leave your clocks
at stock are you going to overclock are
you going to be including your graphics
cards in your loop how many graphics
cards 1 2 3 4 are you going to be doing
7 like Linus did with his gaming server
that he built you know it really comes
down to that question what are you doing
with your PC now even then it's not as
cut and dry as are you gonna be
overclocking even overclocking isn't
going to be the definitive answer when
it comes to whether or not you should
water cool because there's a lot of
benefits to water cooling other than
just overclocking there's a longevity of
keeping your components nice and cool
heat is the number one killer of
electronic components there's also the
factor of noise do you want to keep it
as quiet as possible if you're going to
leave your stock clocks and your stock
voltages then you can get away with
water cooling at very low rpm speeds and
have a very silent system Arta cooling
isn't just about getting better
temperatures on increased voltages and
clock speeds it's also about noise if
you're going to be leaving things that
moderate to low voltage and you're not
gonna be pushing things to too far you
can get away with running your fans on
your radiators at a very low speed and
it's going to be able to maintain a very
low speed as things ramp up with the
usage of the CPU so things like
rendering and gaming don't need the fans
to ramp up to move as much hot air as it
can out of the system which is what air
cooling is going to do because air
cooling is capacity is increased by
adding more air through that heatsink so
to add more air more rpms or higher CFM
fans which mean more noise
same thing with the GPU the fans will
ramp up to move more air more quickly to
increase the efficiency in the cooling
effectiveness of a heatsink
now radiators aren't really any
different where the fan speed does
affect the efficiency of the radiator
but that curve is a lot less steep air
cooled heat sinks are a lot more steep
where you have to push an exponential
amount of air through them to increase
their effectiveness when it comes to
cooling now radiators and water cooling
is much more efficient which means you
can get away with lot less speed when it
comes to the effectiveness of the
radiator now skunkworks for example I've
got this thing overclocked 24/7 the GPUs
and the CPU are
overclocked at all times I don't even
have them ramping down when they're not
doing anything right now while showing
the desktop this thing is still running
a max four point six gigahertz right now
with 1.3 5 volts being pushed to it or
1.3 to 5 volts being pushed to it at all
times now you guys obviously can't hear
it one because I've got a lab mic on but
- it's very very quiet because the fans
never ramp up I don't have the fan sent
to ramp up I have them set at a pretty
minimum speed at all times but that's
because I've got so many fans and so
much radiator space I get away with
overclocking them all of them the GPUs
and the CPU all the time without
actually having to speed up the fans
because if I had to speed up these fans
it would be very noisy I've got one two
three four fans in the bottom red that
you can see right there I've got one two
three intake fans that you guys can see
out there in the front I've got another
two radiator fans on the back of the
seat of the the case right there that's
on the GPU loop I've got one two three
four fans on the top four the eggs are
the technically their exhaust fans on
the CPU loop and then one radiator fan
in the back are not radiator fan but
case fan in the back bringing a little
bit air out the back of the case that's
14 fans 14 fans in this kit system so if
they had to ramp up man there would be
no noise or decibel benefit at all to
doing water cooling so by doing big
radiators I could slow them down they
don't have to ramp up so there is a not
only a overclocking benefit but an
acoustic benefit to that as well now
another way to twist that question a
little bit like a pretzel because as you
can see here there's a theme of twisting
pretzels apparently is do I need to
water cool my graphics card to overclock
it and you know a few years back right
around the 580 the GTX 580 and older I
would have said absolutely because there
weren't a lot of custom cooler
applications being applied back then I
mean you have things like twin frozer
and stuff that existed but the the
beefier coolers that you're seeing on
graphics cards today like the one I have
here on the EVGA kingpin the 980ti
kingpin I mean with its solid copper
heat sinks and solid copper baseplate
and solid copper heat pipes these
we're not really existing back then heat
pipes were just starting to make their
way into graphics cards and the cooling
benefit of heat pipes and copper and
vapor chambers weren't being utilized
then like they are today
now back then I would have said yes to
overclock your graphics card and get the
max benefits of overclocking and the max
over clocks would require water cooling
but that's not the case today I have
pretty much found and I think I'll you
find anyone doing graphics card
overclocking would agree but the max
over clocks today are not being held
back by thermals thermals are something
that the graphics card manufacturers
have definitely got under control and on
stock bios's and stock voltages you are
not going to get your max over clocks
any better on water than you are
currently on air but if you are going to
start doing custom bios and really
pushing the voltages on cards like this
I mean this this card is begging for a
custom bios and pushing the voltages as
high as you can then you would start to
see the limitations of air we're adding
something like the waterblock for them
this is actually the one that's
prefilled for this card and I will be
doing this review here to see how much
farther we can push the king pin because
remember I didn't get the best of
overclock side of this card then water
cooling has a benefit so again that's a
kind of a loaded question of no you
don't need to water call your graphics
cards to get your max overclock if
remember there's always an if like an
if-then statement just like coding on
computer if you want to push the voltage
is higher than what is going to be
warrantied and recommended by a graphics
card manufacturer then overclocking
gives you insurance and extra Headroom
that would otherwise be held back by air
cooling CPUs are often the same way
where you are going to get benefits of
extra cooling capacity of larger
radiators and you would typically find
in all-in-one units where you can push
those overclocks farther and safer for
24/7 operation like I'm doing with Scud
works behind now this is where I'm gonna
drop a dose of truth on you guys and
here it is so you guys ready I do not
recommend water cooling if buying the
water cooling components takes away from
the level of hardware you're able to buy
thus the skunkworks loops you see behind
me here are
over $1200 that's more than most
people's entire computer budget now what
do I mean by that well it's pretty
simple it means if you have to get an
i-5 instead of an i7 and that say a 960
or a 970 instead of a 980 or 90 DTI to
afford the water cooling stuff then the
amount of benefit you're getting out of
that water cooling is extremely
diminished by the level of components
that you were stuck having to get in
order to afford all of it so I would
always recommend air cooling on say a
980ti and an i7 versus going with a
water-cooled 970 in a water-cooled i-5
because the overclocking is barely going
to match where this components you
scrimped on would have been able to
achieve on air cooling I hope that makes
sense never ever ever sacrifice the
level of hardware that you're going to
buy if it means getting lower level
hardware to afford the water cooling
always get the highest level of hardware
that you can possibly afford at the time
of building and then water cool that
later but you're never going to find
water blocks for things like nine 50s
and 1960s
or three 70s or whatever when it kind
Ries Evan to graphics cards you're never
gonna find water blocks for those cards
because it even the industry knows it
makes no sense to take a hundred and
fifty dollar graphics card and then make
a hundred and fifty dollar $125 full
cover water block of that it makes no
sense to spend as much as the card is
worth to water cooling that's the
reality there so when I see emails from
folks saying I can't find a water block
for my 950 that's because they don't
exist you would have to go with a
universal block which is not going to
cover the VRMs or the chips or any of
that stuff
not to mention that stuff is not getting
hot enough gtx 950 s get what 58 degrees
celsius is what all of my testing showed
on all the 950 s i had in here i mean
it's not even hitting 60 c there's no
benefit to water cooling it period water
cooling is also a niche thing where it
looks cooler i mean that looks badass
back that's one of the reasons why i do
it not just because of the added benefit
of of the lower temperatures and lower
acoustics but it just looks cool and
that's where you ultimately have to ask
yourself is if you're willing to spend
the money on the premium that it costs
to do a niche thing like water cooling
and you really don't care about Vizio
sacrifice
extra money and you have the the
high-end hardware that really should be
water-cooled and you want to look cool
then there's your answer but hopefully
today's video has helped you guys
understand a little bit more when it
comes to water cooling and the benefits
of it but if you're going to be taking a
graphics card like the 980ti kingpin or
90 ATI classified or the MSI gaming or
the g1 gaming or whatever from gigabyte
you're going to find that you're going
to put your water blocks on and the
temperatures came down but your
overclocks didn't improve there's other
things involved with custom bios
flashing and stuff like that that's
required but anyway hopefully today's
videos helped you guys twist the
perspective I wanted to take that
question of J should I water cool and
throw it out the window should is never
the proper way of looking at it needing
it and wanting it quite honestly are the
two perspectives that make the most
sense because asking me if you should I
can't answer that for you you need to
answer whether or not you should by
answering the question of whether or not
you need to can afford it and want the
additional maintenance and it's going to
take and the level of dedication water
cooling takes it adds maintenance to
your PC and you gotta be willing to deal
with that anyway guys maybe I'll do
another video in the future here about
all the things involved with maintaining
your water cooling loop because that's
whether or not you should do it is one
thing whether or not you can do it and
are dedicated to it is another it's like
a pet you've got to care for it you
can't just set it up and let it go when
it comes to custom water cooling loops
all-in-one coolers yes you can that's
what they're meant for but this guy back
here you guys have seen the struggles of
keeping this thing the way I want it
anyway guys time to go hope today's
videos helped you announced a little bit
longer but I like these discussions and
they tend to be a little bit more
interesting plus you can listen to it
while doing other things you don't need
to see my ugly mug just sitting here on
the screen I mean I could have done this
to some gameplay stuff maybe yeah maybe
I should have I don't know you guys are
stuck looking at this alright see in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
