say again because my guest here today
Robbie x27 on YouTube tech guy like me
we've already done this once because I
thought we were live streaming to you
guys but guess what we were having a
nice little dress rehearsal because
somebody forgot to click the go live
button so we had a we had a really
awkward story about old proper English
versus American and how my dad got slept
at a restaurant because he accidentally
asked the waitress for a napkin which
was a tampon or some but anyway we
won't go back into that because I
thought about it that was very awkward
and weird ya understand now anyways
you're like okay thanks for having me i
gotta go now bye alright so we're gonna
I see it a lot of comments in here
already so I don't even see the stream
yo you got to go into that link i
tweeted if you go to my channel it'll
show up at the top of my page now under
live now it's a section that only shows
up after all the way up yeah see ya when
you have a live events on YouTube you
get a lot of nifty controls that don't
aren't there for everybody else so
that's what happens when you're you know
a big little guy I guess I don't know
I've never face is stretched in it yeah
I put on a little weight you're a skinny
guy so I put on a little weight for you
I bulked you up a little bit yeah all
right tweet it out facebooked out guys
this is Robbie x27 I don't even remember
how we met you might have to remind me
but all I know is I've actually you know
I don't know I've been following you I
had him on skype because I've been
watching your channel for violence for
all tryna add JS two cents and I'm
tucked in your name and then you accept
it in your like I've just been accepting
all these like requests I think you
might have gotten in on the ground level
when I was like oh I'm trying to grow
socially so I'm gonna do all the follow
backs
but I can't possibly do the follow backs
anymore and so I I just kind of left
pretty much the people in who were
active and I think there you were and
come to find out you had a tech channel
2 and you're young you're what eighteen
yeah I think you're you are definitely
learning the ropes and I am by no means
an expert in this at all everything I do
is an experiment it's just crazy because
I don't really know what doesn't work
cuz so far everything's been working and
you know what I'm gonna do first for you
guys is robbie had the unique
opportunity of getting noticed by EA and
dice without asking for it he woke up
one day and skyped me and was all bold
and like holy crap holy crap look look
look and links are flying everywhere and
I'm like what and I guess EA liked a
trailer that he made of the air
superiority expansion pack for
battlefield 3 in that was pc right that
wasn't console you play yeah yeah mel's
pc it was pc so he made a video and EA
tweeted and facebooked it out and you
got like twenty five thousand views in a
day on that video something like that
and i think it was ninety-five thousand
and its own like 30,000 now i think
something like that and something a lot
i think you were under 500 subscribers
at the time weren't you yeah I grew like
probably about 200 subscribers just in
that day yeah it's it's you know it's
funny when you get the attention of
someone that you're not record you're
not expecting it just catches you off
guard like that's happened to me a few
times like I've I've seen a couple of
you know I stopped I had to turn off
notifications for YouTube because
there's just way too many like last
month last month I had like six thousand
comments and messages so there was no
way I could politely and keep up but
every now and then I'll kind of go and
skim through the subscriber list and
there's some some big ones in there then
I'm just like oh weird okay and I've I'm
hoping to get a hold of I'd like to do
something with tech of tomorrow but
that's maybe a little bit ahead of
myself right now but we'll see where
that goes but I'm gonna go ahead and
help me guys I'm going to play for you
guys Robbie's video that got ea's
attention if you don't mind because I
really liked it yeah that's why I
thought dice made it honestly
six all right with without further ado
here's the video
you
now just like everybody else I counted
one kill in that video however however
yes you got a lot of flak from people on
the haters until we wouldn't kill you
know what I hadn't downloaded the
expansion it because member it wasn't
working for me and I was all anti EA at
the time and said I don't want to play
that video is what made me go and make
it work and I thought that video did a
great job of capturing just the chaos
that goes on in air superiority because
if you don't know there's 24 jets
normally you have four jets in a map
that has jets there's 24 on this yeah
there's no and that's what the video is
all about like as I said to the people
in the comments like it wasn't about
getting kills it was about sort of the
moments you get in the game cuz I mean
always fine when I'm playing like you
capture these like absolutely amazing
like things happening and so I just
pretty much recorded like playing that
was like about four hours of gameplay
and just cut down all the like cool
moments and put on music over it and
yeah like that I mean there was
something there was some content on
there that that was like like the
battlefield logo and the sound and all
that stuff was like dice created but
what I found what I found unique about
your video was the fact that last year
because armored kill was such a flop
dice went on this EA actually went on
this major copyright infringement and
strike campaign is all the big youtubers
pixel enemy and all the lives and they
weren't allowed to put a battlefield
content anymore yet they promoted yours
which I thought was real I yeah I did
hear a lot about that stuff and it's one
of the reasons why I think that honestly
noise but it's one of the it was it was
one of the things that immediately made
me move away from the whole commentary
thing because I was starting out trying
to do commentary discussions but then I
thought you know I don't want to have to
deal with somebody coming in later on if
i did get big saying oh you can't upload
that stuff and everything gets copyright
claimed e so
oh that's why I moved away from it and I
move on to my own content now but i want
to say though um I do like guys like you
though in those games because you kind
of get the attention of the other pilots
which allows me to come in and just
finish off all the girls i want to tell
you the other day I went like 34 and
four or something like that yeah so it's
a phobia joystick those well done you
yeah but you know a lot of people think
the joystick is like a handicap where it
slows you down and such I don't agree
but then again i've been playing flight
simulator and comment simulator since i
was like my daughter's age so i can't do
the controller at all screw the
controller well yeah I can I kind of
like if I'm playing this infantry on
like battlefield then i'll stick to like
keyboard a mouse but soon as i get a jet
then it's you know i get a controller i
think a lot of people who are on console
don't realize that in pc gaming there is
no snap aiming there is no there is no
snap like in a console if you're if you
have your crosshairs close enough to
somebody and you pull the trigger it
snaps on target npc that doesn't exist
so if you try and aim with the xbox
controller on a pc you're gonna get
obliterated there's no yeah that's a
handicap so yeah okay well um I there's
a few things I want to kind of go over
today I still haven't even started I
haven't started that build yet then I've
got all the parts for that thing because
I'm trying to coordinate it in such a
way that I'm able to present it you know
I it's like I have to film a lot of the
stuff individually and then film it
going in because I want to do a pc build
at the same time I mean the memory isn't
on this is nothing special it's just
it's ballistix sport when I did the four
thousand dollar build a lot of people
want to know more about this SSD it's an
affordable 500 gigabyte SSD I mean you
can get this thing for under four
hundred dollars you can get a front of
350 a few american dollars anyway I'll
you Australians sorry you guys get
reamed no matter what you buy I'm
serious I can't believe what hundred
dollars let's to a little the price is
in australia though you're kidding 6
80's the gtx 680 i have i've had a lot
of ozzy's email me and they're going we
can't afford a 680 because it's it's
like thirty or forty percent mark
it's extremely stupid but this right
here I can't wait to this thing blows my
m4 away and i'm using a crucial m4 SSD
so i just might have to upgrade i have
like well my assistant is like probably
my biggest regret with my computer i
still had often like 120 gigabytes like
just broke completely right Anna then I
got this 60 gigabyte l1 and it's just I
just run out of space on it all the time
it's a nightmare really there's a video
I'm gonna be making and I've been
wanting to do this now for a couple of
weeks and I just haven't had the UM I
just I could sure my subscribers have
noticed that I've been on an on a slow
down but I've been on a very consistent
two videos a week thing where i was
putting up you know three for a week but
i've had to slow down i have to pace
myself one I don't want to run out of
content to I don't want to over saturate
my channel yeah 3 I've still a husband a
dad and a full-time IT guy you know and
this is a busy time at work right now
for us but they're a lot of people may
not realize that they've got about 30
gigabytes on their main operating system
drives being utilized from paging files
and that that are needed so I'm going to
do a video that teaches people how to go
in and safely reduce the size of their
paging file which for me was over 16
gigs I've yeah I've done that because it
does it the same as what your memory has
done it look romweber right cuz I'm i
found i was losing like eight gigabytes
just to that well do you put your you
put your pc and sleep mode a lot or do
you turn it off every time okay never if
you're like me do okay do you have your
computer go into an automatic you know
screen off sleep state if you're gone
for say two hours okay every now and
then i'll walk away from my computer and
not come back for hours and what happens
is i have mine set to if i'm away for
one hour to put the computer into
hibernate now there's a file there's a
file in the operating system that then
when the computer goes into hibernate
stores everything in this file
everything on the computer every program
that's open every every everything
that's on the computer running at that
moment is then stored into a
file that gets called up when the
computer wakes up opens everything up
that file never get so never gets erased
it just grows until the maximum size
allocated by the OS which is in many
cases 16 gigabytes so you can have a 16
gigabyte paging file which is nothing
more than hard drive cash in case you
run out of ram and you can have a 16
gigabyte paging file or a hibernate file
so I'm going to show people especially
if you have a small SSD how to how to
get that space back because I don't
think dear i will give you a good video
i woke up one day and went into my
operating system at 16 gigs left and I
went what is going on and a lot of
people don't realize on an SSD you have
to leave ten percent of your drive left
by now i have to point 64 gigabytes left
on my SSD yeah you definitely want to
leave more than that open because you're
running into some serious issues if you
get right to the dr and and by that but
ohio the OS is constantly writing and
rewriting so I have my opera two
terabyte hard drive as well mm-hmm okay
yeah I want to do a review of this power
supply it's a see it's a Corsair see x
600 m it's a modular enthusiast and it's
fully modular by the way well maybe not
fully I think the 24-pin is still
non-removable but this like the look of
use yeah you know um they're small but
they certainly pack a punch and they are
stable you know there's still 80 plus
and this one's a bronze so I always tell
people if you're going to buy a PS you
always go with at least a bronze and i'm
going to give you guys a little bit Oh
somebody commented about my Starbucks
this is a sugar free sugar free
Starbucks right here so don't give me a
hard time first of all second of all
it's the first one I've had since my
last one which was I had one over the
weekend and it was free because I went
to starbucks to get this before the
stream and about an hour before the
livestream the transformer in the
backyard there's a there's a power pole
in my backyard that the city Eliza's and
there's a transformer on it and it's
been raining here in California and just
to show you how stupid the state is this
state is when it rains the trans
blew up I was sitting here i had just
invited you and said hey do you want to
be on my stream and you're like yeah
cool and then i started i just tweeted
out him i'm gonna be going live in an
hour hit tweet and then boom all the
power goes out I'm like is that a sign
should I not go live today it came back
on maybe 15 minutes later and maybe not
even that may be more like five minutes
later because we have a real good backup
system but the power lines get wet here
and it's like armageddon you know there
were probably like 18 crashes in that
one little downpour so I kind of talked
about as a sign but because of that the
starbucks down the street there are
computers froze and broke and so i went
there to get my coffee and they said hey
our computers are down so everything's
on the house and i went ok cool and then
they said do you want a pastry yeah they
say do you want a pastry to I went well
I'm not I don't really eat that but I'll
take a cake pop for my daughter you know
the cake pop is right it's a small cake
on a stick right oh we're like it's
round it's like a it's like a bite of a
cake we don't have those K&amp;amp;I yeah it's
kind of interesting though yeah it's
like a little cake ball like a cake
meatball on the end of his dick and so I
said well my daughter would probably
like a cake pop and he goes with flavor
I forget i'll give you all the flavors
so he took all one at each flavor and
just like shoved him in a bag and handed
that to me and he's like you want any
other coffee so i'm like no no I'm good
they were just giving stuff away out ok
so nice see like over here and like no
one would ever do that if like oh I
don't know I just said bollocks I just
find people over here or just so like
and then i'd only go into it but no
one's very nice ending cooked someone
said I'm start I'm charged I'm doing
Starbucks add some I'll hold the cup
like this one knowing where my head ask
my channel link so I'm just gonna gonna
say something in chat you know what my
bad I I should have put that in the
description let me add that real quick
sorry oh I'll put my name in they should
see how now talk while I'm typing so
we'll go ahead and tell people what it
is about your channel and because you
have a little bit of everything you have
give gameplay yeah some let's plays so
it's basically like pretty much pretty
much a primarily like a gaming channel
but I'm i also do stuff with like things
I'm interested in so I have like a week
in review it's kind of like a yes that's
the fun one that's like my old tech
addiction yeah it's like just the wii
Lee kind of review on love the week it
means pretty self-explanatory but I'm we
announce table you taken the top like
text tech related stories in your kind
of role I'm into like a little new show
and pretty much the things I'm
interested in yeah right and what's
funny is you know I did that with tech
addiction and yeah it was and I just
taught and boogies talked to me a lot
about it took his buggy he watched tech
addiction long before I knew who before
I knew he knew who I was he was watching
it because my friend my friend Daniel
who's also a lives in the UK up in
London he was friends with him and he
had kind of like plugged me to him a
couple of times and it wasn't until I
made my thousand subscriber thank you
video where I just kind of like messed
around with you know I did a little
documentary I hope you saw that video i
did a little documentary about
pretending like i was addicted to
technology and you know i think i have a
school I I like I attacked the guy with
the camera and then we had like a party
with a cake and stuff it I mean great
ball yeah you have to get a poly river
cake yeah for a thousand subscribers and
my friend Nick built me a cake is he
says he's a car guy he goes dude I built
you a cake so sorry you built me a cake
and we just split least see that we got
together and played xbox and had some
friends and family over it was fun and I
wasn't it was entitled to be a spoof
video um and you know I guess boogie
salt and he really liked it and then
after that we just kind of like chatted
here and there and now you know boogie
and I are pretty close i mean he was on
hmm he was invited to the stream the
other day when he joined but he couldn't
make it and so that's why last minute
like two minutes into the stream i get a
skype from him saying get me in there
bitch okay all right let me let me set
this up last minute so the reason why
I've brought um Robbie here and I'm not
going to limit this to just an hour
because you know I usually try and do it
an hour and we've been rambling for 20
minutes already but there was a video
put out by Ubuntu addicted a couple days
back that just came across today and it
was about large youtubers and I'm not
going to get into the flavor of the
video because its controversial it when
you when you put out anything where you
kind of say
the big people are making the little
people stay little sort of thing yeah I
don't like to get involved in those
conversations too much because I kind of
feel like I'm breaking through every
barrier that's put in front of me I
don't know why I don't know why the hell
my channel is working but it is and i
look at boogie when i was on his channel
live streaming with him that was huge
because its exposure and I didn't ask
for it he came to me for it and it was
it meant a lot to me because I felt like
wow well I i get to i get to kind of
like talk with someone who i am already
friends with unlike talking to I get to
be exposed and just have a good time
it's I looked at it too is like you know
it means some it means something when a
400,000 subscribers channel like boogies
is willing to take a 9000 subscriber
channel like mine and present it out and
not say oh I'm like from my perspective
now well that's what I was going to say
is you know I look at that go wow that's
almost a half million subscribers and
that's a lot of people had access to it
was like a thousand people in that life
stream that day and crazy so I got to
thinking about abu's video and it was
like you know I know where he's coming
from where you feel like you work and
you work and you work and there's not
really a return coming from it because
in the beginning that's the way it was I
mean the only way you can get anywhere
in the beginning is you you rely on the
shout outs because when YouTube yeah
when YouTube made it switch on the way
that the search engine works if you
don't have the minutes watched you don't
show up but you can't get the minutes
watched unless you show up so it's like
a catch-22 yeah so it meant instead of
boogie putting himself on a pedestal and
saying hey I'm better than you so I'm
not going to include you he's like you
know screw it we're friends who cares
its subscribers here or you know
whatever so that's why I mean that's why
I reached out to you because I thought
you we have a lot in common I really
don't care what your subscriber base is
hopefully you the people that are in
here today like you know what you have
to say and they go and subscribe to you
if they like what they see and then in
my future when you grow you do the same
thing I mean that's like it is something
that I kind of want to be able to do
like help out smaller youtubers because
I mean
I you know there's nothing better than
like when you get some big youtuber
comment on your video and like a couple
days ago I mean I've had some guys with
like 150k subscribers comment on my
videos and as a small youtuber there's
like nothing better than seeing that
yeah and that's something I'd really
like to kind of do more of because well
like help people solve achieve because
you know as you say when you're
producing like videos that take a lot of
time and you put a lot of F into yeah
and then you don't get much recognition
for it is kind of you know so annoying
there are and there are some videos i
made where i get done I'm just like yes
this is gold I love this video so much
and then there's no there's no response
and you're going well damn you know and
that's when that's when people who I
think boogie boogie told me this is
that's the time you prove yourself if
you get a lot of hate on something or
you get no response or no likes on
something that's when you have to prove
yourself to YouTube that you're going to
stick around because it's kind of like
that rite of passage I guess and it's
funny now because I'm now breaking into
every single video i put up gets
dislikes every single video i put up
gets hate comments and it's it's funny
to me because i'm going well i guess
that means i'm breaking into that next
level where I now have a following of
haters but the way I see it is those
haters I don't have to fight them
anymore because my subscriber base is so
awesome they tried it for me they go in
there and flag the stuff as spam they go
in there and tell the guy is a douche
and take off and I don't have to fight
those fights anymore so that's the cool
part but the only thing i'm looking
forward to as the channel grows is I
like to go and watch the smaller
channels i don't i'm not i'm not really
subscribe to any major channels except
for like you know I guess the go to use
like boogie2988 I like Shaytards because
they're just they're just fun to watch
yeah iJustine i'm subscribed to her but
i don't really watch too much i said
i've already been into stuff I sexy is
probably my favorite comedian on YouTube
it'sit's is d is ekc I sexy he is
extremely funny i would love to collab
with him one day he is he's got
107,000 oh I know this guy I am he is
just funny as hell I love this guy he
was the one he was the one I got the
idea of doing the whole what people
think of me video I did oh right yeah
yeah cuz he did 12 and I thought it was
great so yeah alright people are getting
pissed in the chat now about yelling
questions so but guys this is my show so
no deal with it okay there are way too
many comments to just go back so start
and start writing your questions down
now and I'll start reading them again
some people want to see my pc specs yeah
go ahead and tell about your pc i've
talked about mine enough so i actually
build this pc about four months ago now
and uh it's a fractal design define mini
well that's the case running an AMD FX
4100 and a gtx 660</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
