CES was a lot of fun but of course it's
time to get back to work now as you may
or may not recall a few months ago I
built myself a new test bench which I
called Project bloodshed you know
because the coolant made it look like
blood and stuff
now I had a pretty sweet red and
gunmetal theme going on but
unfortunately the x99 deluxe didn't
really match all that well
so when asrock contacted me asking if I
was interested in taking a look at one
of their new x99 motherboards I was all
over that x99 an ex killer fatality
board it is definitely sexy piece of
hardware with its improved radiator
support and legendary noise optimization
the new define r54 fractal design is a
PC builders dream come true click the
link in the description to learn more
know motherboards are one of those
things that I don't really feel that get
enough attention
I mean sure raw CPU power video cards
Ram and all that stuff is direct
contributors to the overall PC speed and
experience but let's not forget that
none of those devices can communicate
without a motherboard and seeing that
the motherboard is also tasked with
things like power delivery to the CPU
PCI Express components hard drive
communication fan control overclocking
it's something that needs to be paid
attention to now when it comes to
choosing the right motherboard trust me
manufacturers know this which is why
they are keeping they keep packing more
and more features to try and entice
buyers to notice their particular models
now asrock is one of those brands that I
don't feel is really given enough regard
when it comes to do-it-yourselfers in
fact when I purchased my asrock z77 OC
formula back in 2013 I really was
concerned that I was making a mistake
since that brand really doesn't carry as
much prestige as say Asus MSI or
gigabyte but man the more I played
around with the board the more I
realized that asrock really does take
what they do serious now I could easily
spend all day going over the specs of
the fatality x99 killer so instead I'm
gonna go ahead and focus on some of the
main points that
I think make this board really
interesting now first off many x99
motherboard is currently only support up
to 64 gigabytes of ddr4 but the killer
supports up to 128 of ECC and non ECC
Ram 3000 megahertz plus now I already
hear you J why would we want a hundred
20 gigabytes of RAM that's so overkill
for gaming well you're right but
remember the x99 platform is already
overkill for gaming and really appeals
more to the content creator and editors
and other workstation grade builders
many of which can and do benefit for
more RAM so that's one thing that I love
about this board is the fact that it
contains things that appeal to both
sides of that spectrum making it easy to
have in an all-encompassing build
suitable for both gamers and workstation
needs overclocking on this board it's
pretty straightforward due to the very
easy to navigate UEFI BIOS we're now
getting all crazy and over complicated
like some other brands on the market but
not only is the BIOS easy to navigate
the power delivery is up to par as well
with 60 amp power choke snitch ik on 12
K platinum Japanese capacitors 12 phase
power delivery and oversized heat sinks
keeping everything nice and cool now
we'll definitely be overclocking this
bad boy and giving some feedback at the
end of the video regarding how it all
went especially compared to the x99
deluxe motherboard which it's replacing
now something else worth noting on this
motherboard is that it has got dual
Gigabit LAN one being the intel i to 1/8
v and the other being the qualcomm
atheros killer e 20 200 for gaming now
they advertise that the e 2200 is
capable of prioritizing gaming packets
which increase gaming speed and reduce
the lag and actually prioritizes all the
information based on the games that
you're playing I have no way to test
this claim but at the very least having
two ethernet NICs is good to have a
backup in case one fails so there is
that now for audio the x99 killer
features purity sound 2.0 and 7.1
channel HD audio output has the realtek
ALC 1150 codec and if you're like me and
happen to be running some power-hungry
cans for audio it also features a power
headphone amplifier that can drive up to
600 ohms of impedance and since high-end
audio is becoming more and more
affordable
headphone jack like that is actually
pretty nice to see now when it comes to
graphics this board does feature three
PCI Express gen3 16x slots and to gin to
1x slots along with SLI and crossfire
support
now since this motherboard does not have
any sort of PL x chip can become a
little bit confusing on how the lanes
operate when using a 5820k CPU with 28
lanes
versus the 40 lanes found on the 59 30 K
and the 59 60 X so rather than Oprah
over complicate this video by mentioning
all the various combinations of Gen 2
and Gen 3 you Lane utilization per CPU
I'm just gonna refer you to the
motherboards manufacturing specs and
their website to figure out how it's
gonna work for you but one thing worth
noting is that three ways crossfire and
SLI is not supported on the 5820k which
is kind of a bummer because it could if
it had PL X which has actually been very
popular on the z97 series allowing many
brands to offer up to four-way SLI or
crossfire on CPUs that otherwise
couldn't handle it now for storage the
killer features 10 state a 3 6 gigabit
per second ports raid 0 1 5 10 and Intel
Rapid Storage 13 but they also have this
thing called HDD saver basically who
power your hard drives off the
motherboard instead of the power supply
allowing you to control when they turn
on and off via software now they say
it's for added security and longer
lifespan of hard drives letting them
without letting them spin at all times
personally this is something I don't
really find all that interesting I don't
keep important storage on my local
machine and I don't know how useful you
guys would find that but it is a
function in here and unfortunately the
downside of it is you have to use a
pretty ugly proprietary cable which is
not sleeved or anything but as rock is
really proud of this function so I may
have figured it's at least worth
mentioning if you find that to be kind
of cool
now also worth mentioning as it does
have ultra m2 sockets supporting SATA 3
6 gigabit per second as well as an MDOT
2 PCI Express gen3 by 4 for 32 gigabits
per second data transfer rate now as I
mentioned I could go all day on the
features packed into this board I mean
just look at the box there's a lot going
on there in fact if I picked up this box
say off the Micro Center shelf
I would probably be a bit confused to
what to look at there's a lot going on
but I mean it's got high-density power
connectors for a better power
connections to ounce copper PCB layers
making it very heavy along with a very
sexy black sapphire PCB old-school ps2
connectors for gamers who love their lag
free old-school mice and keyboards a
fatality Mouse port for custom polling
rates 125 Hertz to a thousand Hertz the
thunderbolt 2.0 ready anti-static
protection anti moisture protection and
the list goes on and on so let's just go
ahead and get it installed and go from
there
so there we go guys the asrock fatality
x99 ex killer motherboard looks
fantastic has lots of features that I
actually like on there and the other so
some parts laying around I I literally
just fired this one up mess and all just
still chilling here showing you guys I'm
pretty messy builder which I've shown in
the past before but the killer
motherboard has a lot of features that I
really like I like how the USB 3.0 are
close together I like that it actually
has a USB plug built onto the
motherboard that she can do a standard
USB plug in there's actually a lot of
things I could actually use that for now
I've got a 264 Engineer running here in
the background and I didn't do anything
for the overclocking on this except for
going into the BIOS and using one of
their pre-selected speeds which they've
kind of determined already where the
settings should be based on their own
preliminary testing on all of their
engineering samples of the different
chips now this is 4.4 gigahertz which is
the same that I was running my test
bench on with the Asus board but what I
noticed is it's doing it at 1.30 8 volts
and the only way I was able to get 4.4
gigahertz stable on the Asus was to run
about 1.3 4 volts so it's running less
voltage and just disabled and in fact
right now we're running currently cores
in the upper 40s to mid 50s and we are
looking at a max package temperature of
68 Celsius right now sitting at 62
Celsius and that is with a triple
radiator on their triple 30 mil radiator
which is very very standard size it's
not oversized 45 mil or anything like
that now I do have a lot of fantastic
things to say about the motherboard I
don't really have anything negative to
say which is very rare I think all the
features are in line I think it gives
you tons of the tons of features with a
very good price point the fact that the
Intel NIC on there is Intel Windows was
able to identify that right away so I
didn't have to use a USB port or USB
thumb drive or anything because I have
no optical on here to install any of the
drive
I was able to install my Ethernet into
the Nick on the Intel side download all
my drivers be up and running and as you
can see a motherboard swap and my
windows is still fully up and running
that's because we're using the same
controllers for the SSD so it was
actually very simple to get that
migrated over but I just want to show
here using the and it's not even
automated it's not like the Asus you
know five-way optimization where it goes
through and does a bunch of tests and
then fails and figures out what's stable
it I just chose it in a drop-down and
it's perfectly stable so we got a pretty
good overclock on here 1.1 gigahertz
overclocked by simply selecting a
drop-down menu in a button and it's
fully stable temperatures are great it's
not throwing a ton of voltage added to
try and do that so I'm very happy with
that
overall the motherboard would have been
nice to see plx on there for those extra
synthetic lanes rather than you know the
5820k don't has twenty eight lanes on
there which makes some graphics card
utilization a little bit difficult 3-way
is not even an option on this chip
that's too bad but anyway guys the
asrock x99 ex killer motherboard here
the fatality version I think is a
fantastic motherboard in fact it's gonna
be staying on this test bench they
didn't tell me I had to send it back the
other way they're not getting it back
guys been Jays two cents I hope this
videos helped in some way when it comes
to choosing your x99 platform
motherboard they do also have this same
motherboard in the Z series as e 97
series so if you guys are on main stream
platform akyuu make sure you check that
out so all the same functionality on
there as well it's got plenty of fan
headers on there the built-in audio on
there's fantastic in fact i'm running
all of my fans on this system directly
off the motherboard itself and the fan
control software is also very very
simple to use I think as ROC has
definitely got themself a winner on this
one here I am a genuine fan of asrock
products ever since using the Z 77 OC
formula which they also have an OC
formula version of this motherboard as
well which pulls out all the
overclocking stops so there you go guys
Jays two cents taking a look at the as
rock X 99 X killer fatality edition
motherboard I think I said that wrong
fatality X 99 X killer another
borge you guys check it out if you're
looking at building an x 99 system tune
for gamers and overclocking as always
guys follow on twitter if you have any
questions and that we'll see you in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
