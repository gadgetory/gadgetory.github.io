insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and why
sennheiser the pursuit of perfect sound
and of course by generous viewers like
you so strapped in with Jays two cents
as he takes you on a wild ride through
CES 2014 hey guys Jays two cents here
CES 2014 and I'm standing here with mark
from msi and they've got a lot of really
cool stuff that they're going to be
showing you this year at CES and right
off the bat we're going to take a look
here at some graphics cards they've got
some stuff you've already seen some new
stuff and what I'm gonna do right now is
I'm just going to hand it over to mark
I'm gonna let him tell me what we're
taking a look at here what's new for
this year and what you guys can expect
as gamers when it comes to these awesome
graphics cards so mark well hi um let me
start off with what's we've been doing
so good for 2013 that we want to
continue on for 2014 especially with the
segment of of a theme you know the Blue
is for mainstream the red is for the
gaming series and then the yellows for
overclocking and we want to continue
this trend and hopefully will carry us
on for 2014 well let's start with the
high end stuff that we have new
available which is the r9 290x lightning
which is this one the r9 290x lightning
now you guys have been begging for
aftermarket cooling on the 290 because
you know they run hot from the factory
so not only did msi come out with their
aftermarket cooling solution but it's
the lightning edition on top of that
which correct me if i'm wrong we're
talking about unlocked voltage overclock
huge overclocking gains on this Oh Alan
too now what are we talking about
temperature wise on these temperature
wise right now I don't have that
specific information but I'll say mmm
probably around 70 to 80 but you know I
could be wrong right I haven't really
tested these cars these are still like
new hasn't released yeah I mean this is
the first time the world is seeing these
cards but I'm you guys know if you've
checked out any of the 290x
coverage I mean these things were
running 90 95 degrees Celsius with
reference cooling so we're talking now
70s even 80s is acceptable when you talk
about unlocked voltage and you're
talking about overclocking looks like
some of the power requirements here
we're looking at what 28 pins required
for with the 28 pins but the spent at
the end is actually optional and you
only use that if like let's say you want
to do a more extreme overclocking and it
just increase the power more ok so the
six pin is only required if you're going
to be doing extreme overclocking with
the card giving it more exhilarating
this looks great now thickness is this
still a duel associate thicker than the
780 lightning that that's because the
780 lightning was out first um the
design was the first generation so this
is actually something we change it up a
little bit we took out a couple of the
heat pipes um but the r you take it out
you know of course how we know retained
cooling you know so did we expanded the
the heat the heat sink were here right
you've beat the heat sink itself is
larger now explain the smaller fan in
the middle I know you guys use it on the
780 as well but go ahead and expand that
each individual fans have the own
control so that's why we design it like
that so it will be easier for end user
to control on fan the speed of it and
how fast you want it to spin does this
feature the same boot up reverse
spinning technology that the gaming
cards are using yes it does yeah well
that is abby's how long is this card no
I don't have that information it looks
long I mean at least 11 and a half size
well the lengthwise should be the same
size 780 lightning okay so about the
same size it's emanator yeah Wow well
this now I see some some plugs here on
the back do you know what these are look
like available fan ports on the back
yeah this should be the oh yeah the V
checkpoint sorry what okay that's fine
and brand new stuff I mean it's expected
so okay so Vee checkpoint we got all
right so that's pretty awesome there so
you're not relying on software to tell
you what your voltage inputs are on this
thing if you're
wanting to do extreme overclocking I
mean you can hook up a multimeter to it
and just check actual voltage on a
multimeter and and forget software all
together okay so what else are we
looking at over here new this year is
also the gtx 760 gaming ITX just the
first ever 760 i text there's no other
in the market right now available and
the good thing about this is that it
retained the clock speed and performance
as this reference 760 so which is uh but
in a smaller form factor yeah so you're
talking extremely compact card here
perfect for your ITX builds or home
theater pcs or or wherever you need a
small form factor but you're not
sacrificing any of the speeder
performance by going smaller now what
about the cooling on this cooling this
is the first ever also with the right a
red X cooling fan basically it the way
blows it blows out different directions
so it has a better airflow okay yeah so
it definitely make sure you have
adequate case cooling with that but the
design of this we're looking at sea in
the past we've had cards get extremely
large as you can see here but at the
same time if you want to build a small
form-factor case you're able to retain a
very good amount of power here in a
small form-factor what i like about this
is you debuted at the same time that you
provided me with the ITX the z87 ITX
gaming motherboard and it fits on the
board perfectly without extending past
the board so depending on the type of
case you're using you're able to
maintain a nice compact fit and still
have power supplies that don't interfere
with the motherboard depending on which
case you go with so there you go guys
we've got a lot of different video cards
here but the main things we're focusing
at here 290x lightning it's a massive
beast and then flipping it on the other
side we've got the 76 ITX video card
here small form factor with no real
compromise so in Jays two cents CES 2014
here with Mark thank you very much for
showing me those graphics cards and make
sure you follow us on Twitter for all of
the CBS CES coverage and as always I'll
see you in my next video I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
