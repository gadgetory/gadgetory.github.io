in the description below well the good
news is if you actually read the
instructions and look at it rather than
using brute force then you realize how
goods work we're using that today that's
what this is all about reason that to go
over there and i'm afraid of heights
you know oh people were levy a few tall
don't be stupid
alright so this video today is gonna
trigger a lot of you for many different
reasons which is why this video is gonna
be kind of fun to make I made these
panels while we made these panels last
week which is basically our
anti-reflection panels I guess you will
I look at it this way
I've done a lot of home brewed DIY stuff
that if it gets 80% of the job done for
20% of the cost of buying the actual
product and that's a win for me because
I don't want to spend a crap ton of
money in here we've got the sets marked
out on the ground how we're gonna build
them out we got these orange pieces of
tape everywhere the walls are being
built this next weekend but one of the
things they need to do before the walls
are in here is I've got to sort of get
my treatment up on the actual wall so
it's gonna be pretty ghetto this sides
gonna be screwed through the foam right
into the drywall that side because it's
concrete now I don't feel like buying a
hammer drill because I don't have a ham
and I want to put holes in the concrete
because this is concrete tilt-up
building its I'm gonna be gaff taping it
to the wall so trust me it's gonna be
getting pretty ghetto and then I've got
three dozen moving blankets which I'm
gonna be hanging from the ceiling that
is going to be doubling as sound
barriers and as they're hanging it's
gonna kind of stop a lot of reflection
from getting to the ceiling so that's my
cheap way of not having to actually get
sound clouds which can cost me 100 bucks
or more piece and we would need a dozen
more than a dozen of them up here you
can see how quickly the cost can add up
I'm already into $1,000 just in the cost
of the foam and the materials to do
everything you see here which look how
much foam we still in the ground back
here we sell more panels to make we've
got foam there we've got foam over there
on the wall we got foam on that side
we've got the three dozen moving
blankets the cost of the lift so yeah
that's the goal today it's to see how
much we can get this room to change now
we're gonna be putting carpet down as
well they're gonna be temporary rolled
out carpets that are gonna be carpeted
taped down and gaff taped around the
edges and that's where a lot of the
echoes coming from it's a concrete floor
and this concrete wall so I just kind of
want to do before and after to see if
things improve
so we'll stand in this Phil you stand on
that orange spot right there it's from
the same spot and I'll stand on this
line and then we'll go ahead and do
tests and we'll see at the end of the
day if that got any better or I die you
know what I don't even want to wear this
harness and even as someone who's afraid
of heights
I'm only doing it because of the amount
of comments I'm gonna get if I don't
there's gonna be a gif of this look at
my baby making bits now I used to
actually work in a warehouse in from
drove a scissor lift or a forklift
that was a cherry picker which is a
platform that goes up the whole thing
goes up with it yeah back in the days
when I used to deliver tires and it's
going up six stories you want to talk
about sway you'd get a tire and put it
on there and you're like
all right
oh my god
do you see this am i halfway
okay oh I'm just standing here
I can always grab on how long can I do a
pull-up you think if this fellow ah I
don't I don't like okay that'll work you
don't look perfect
no you can't there's a switch you have
to flip yes you can
that was the wrong switch yes it started
to move it doesn't lock it out yeah I
really hope this isn't and it'd be me
doing there I get dizzy
cuz it's my fear of heights oh well I
just caught that mid fall and he saw
that it's wobbling everything I want to
do says don't move please believe me
when I say I know just how ghetto this
seems by taping these to the wall but
gaff tape is gap tape gaff tape for a
reason it hold it's really tight so Phil
should just keep filming because if I
screw up this is gonna come slamming
down see whoa I'm just drop the hole I
almost dropped it while holding onto it
so just would have like I said before
it's a stupid idea of and it works it's
still stupid but it worked
it's not go look it's pretty because of
the tape on the side but I don't really
care another truth good citizens
I lived one of the good news is they're
up and I didn't die the gaff tape is
holding exactly like I said it would I
forgot to put a piece on the bottom over
there so I have to do that you guys are
gonna be able to tell on camera but
what's Artiste much different is the
fact that the echo the reverb I'll call
it reverb echo is when you say something
and then does a delay and you hear back
that's echo this is reverb the ceiling
feels lower like it's weird it feels
lower and when only one side was up and
not this side you could hear the reverb
on one side of your head but what we're
hearing right now is our sound of our of
my voice bouncing off the concrete
ground going up into the wall and into
the ceiling and back down and so we're
gonna do next is we are gonna hang those
blankets those moving blankets I got but
I decided I'm gonna get clips and just
clip them to those railings because if
it doesn't work for some reason I don't
wanna go through all the work of putting
bolts and stuff in there I'm gonna have
to undo all that we're also gonna go
loads we're gonna get carpets for the
sets cuz we have the three sets that are
laid out shop a home office set and then
we're gonna recreate my current set over
there with complete with fake windows
and everything so yeah so we knew go get
that material and I think once we lay
down the carpet and then hang the stuff
from the ceiling I think it's gonna
sound a whole lot better in here but as
it is right now let's push in our last
video we had nothing in here you guys
said it didn't sound terrible so it's
only gonna get better
hello Clarice okay so after being on the
lift all day putting those boards on the
walls hanging these cheap really cheap
from Amazon moving blades from the
ceiling to kind of catch almost like
sound clouds some of the echo here we
are exactly we were before and you can
hear now with the carpet down the three
sets you can kind of see how they're
segmented now I think things have
improved a lot okay so now that we have
the carpets down which I also had cut
today we have the set walls are going to
be built around them of course and we
are just doing cubes we're not doing
crazy non 90-degree walls because we
don't have that much room what was that
oh there's plastic under here I thought
one of those about to fall on my head
this wall will be incorporated in the
shop I probably about some stuff here
we'll leave the panel's in here for 80
bucks buzzing and all and then there'll
be a wall right here what you'll have a
gap and then these sets are gonna go
against this wall I'm not doing anything
to these walls except having conduit and
power running along them so here's the
shop set this as a little fun fact this
is bigger than the bedroom I started my
channel in so that really kind of puts
things into perspective huh so this is
gonna be the home office style set which
is very reminiscent of the old days in
Jays two cents it's not gonna look like
any of the old sets we did it's gonna be
completely designed I'm a fake window
and and lights and stuff back here to
make it look like a real bedroom why
because why not be funny maybe I do the
window on this side I don't know we'll
figure it out and then this over here
with this extremely crooked piece of
detail on camera this is very this is
cut very crooked this is gonna be we're
recreating our current set and the irony
about this is that there is there's no
carpet in the set we have now it's just
an area rug that I bought but I figured
we need the carpet here because of the
fact that we are cutting down the echo
as much as possible so until the walls
and stuff are up
still gonna have a lot of spacious
reverb sound but with the LAV Olear mic
it's clearly fine so we're gonna have
the shelf at least one of them I don't
think we're gonna fit both shelves here
fill like we're definitely not gonna fit
two side-by-side right here and that's
why one of the reasons why I want the
fake walls which are like you know
Hollywood slat slats or flats is what
they're called and nothing attached to
the wall so I can move things around as
I see fit if I wanted I could also turn
this entire set this way and then do the
shelves right here along the wall and
then we have an open area to shoot their
open area to shoot there but I was
thinking having the open side to back up
to each other means phil has more room
to kind of be able to move around and
stuff but the idea is between these two
sets right here Phil isn't hand-holding
maybe some while we're doing the
talking's so the idea is with the
current set at the old studio which is
gonna be moving here is that feel good
ideally move around here if he needs to
but this is mostly a showcase that's it
we won't be doing any building or
working here maybe build a computer but
not like shop type grinding stuff that's
for over there that's for the messy set
so anyway here is the very first build
vlog considering I'm terrified of
heights and the fact that I went all the
way up there a bajillion times up down
up down up down I'm happy with my work
and I'd get a rigged that skylight to
block that out this skylight here we're
probably gonna get an air conditioner
installed right there
take the skylight out get an AC
installed because it does get warm out
here after all it's still a warehouse
all right so that's part one of our
studio move thanks for watching guys as
always we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
