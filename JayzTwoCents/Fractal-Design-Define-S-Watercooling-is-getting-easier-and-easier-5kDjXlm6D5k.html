and we waited a few years for fractal
design to update the very famous define
R for two now what we know is the define
r5 but it only took a few months beyond
that to take it to the next step and
debut the define s the octane gaming
gear combo from coolermaster features
seven backlighting colors turbo mode a
vago 3050 optical sensor along with four
levels of dpi adjustment now you can po
noobs without boning your wallet click
the link in the description to learn
more the defiance series is extremely
popular with Bose both noise
optimization and the r5 giving just
astounding support for water-cooling so
how could they have possibly improved
upon that design well they've given us
the Defiant s which I am going to just
dub as define sexy because it takes
everything we love about the r5 then cut
some of it down but gives us more
improvements for people who are looking
for both airflow optimization as well as
water cooling so this thing is kind of a
jack of two different trades air flow
and water cooling as you can see it is
not a very big case at all but don't let
size fool you guys that should be a
piece of life advice now really this
thing shares a lot of similarities from
the r5 so why don't we focus right now
on what's actually different with the
defined s we'll start with the front and
some really squeaky rubber feet on my
desk it has the very same faux brushed
finish that the r5 has it's not real
metal but that's kind of nice
considering the fact that it's going to
be a lot more scratch resistant as the
metal is not a scratch resistant but
there is no door and because there's no
door that means there's no optical
drives in here so as you can see the
front is all about wide open air flow it
has got massive vents along both sides
of the case allowing air to come in
through the sides and don't let that
fool you it is also filtered if you just
pull from I'm going to pull from the top
because that's easier from where I am
right now this thing just pops right off
and then you have a magnetic front
filter magnets are nice to see because
they are just so much easier to get on
and off
and there's nothing to worry about
breaking no tabs or anything but that
reveals the very first difference
compared to the r5 is that we do have
triple 140 millimeter fan support on the
front so you can have three 140 s on
here or three 120 s obviously including
the same size of radiators that are
available to be installed on the front
now let's go ahead and move around to
the inside of the case where again we
have captive thumb screws keeping us
from losing or dropping those stupid
screws behind the desk if you ever go to
change them but as you can see the panel
is just one big giant window rather than
having really heavy sound dampening
material on there and it's a very rigid
side panel so it's going to give some
structural integrity you know as you
start taking the case apart it does have
a little bit of flex to it not a lot but
because there's no harddrive cages in
here in the front anywhere it's going to
have a little bit more flex to it once
the side panels are off but don't fret
when it's put together that's obviously
not going to be an issue now you're
going to see all these lines right here
in the front you might be thinking what
the heck are all those lines for well
they actually have all of these
different lines here to give you support
for reservoir mounting very few cases on
the market actually have pre thought-out
locations for installing reservoirs and
fractal design is now amongst the ranks
of those case manufacturers that are
thinking about water coolers and giving
them options not only do they give you a
place to mount your reservoir you also
have a place to mount your pump down
here in the bottom of the case and it's
going to fit all your standard pump
mounts like your D 5 the Swift textile D
5 or it just has the plastic housing or
your Lange D DC or really there's
universal holes there where it can slide
you can get creative and if you needed
to you could even drill holes in the
bottom if you wanted to to mount your
pump so dedicated rez mounts with pump
mount right below it which is ideal for
water cooling you want the res above the
pump and they make it easy for you and
that is an absolute fantastic thing
massive cutout here on the motherboard
tray giving you easy access to air
cooler backplate retention brackets some
water blocks have backplate
retention bracket so it gives you easy
access to that and we do support all the
way up to ATX size motherboards now we
can't go to e ATX or anything bigger
than ATX because they did stick with
this kind of a recessed design where the
grommets here more about a 45 degree
angle so you can't go with wide
motherboards unless you start getting
creative and modding so out of the box
support is ATX now when it comes to air
coolers it does support cooler towers
that are as high as 180 millimeters so
you are going to be able to fit you know
your favorite coolers in there like
you're not to us and your tunics and
things like that moving onto the top of
the case we have the same module vent
covers on here to keep dust and sound
out that you can remove them modular
that's why they're called Maju dense as
you need them and if I can find the tab
on this one without having to look in
there guess I'm not going to be able to
because Jays a dork so once you remove
all three of these you do have access to
the top screw mounts or screw holes for
installing either a 120 a 140 a 240 a
283 60 or a 420 millimeter radiator on
the top and of course they keep the same
design which they're known for which is
offset on the longer radiator so you
don't have impact on your motherboard or
your vrm coolers on the motherboard
which means you can use thick radiators
now in terms of radiator support on the
top anything that is a 140 millimeter
base radiator that's your 140 or 280 and
your 420 is going to have a maximum
thickness compatibility of 55
millimeters including the fan so that
means you're going to have to stick with
30 mil rads if you're using 25
millimeter fans because you have to
Center mount those and you're going to
have some impact on your motherboard and
stuff so they've already predetermined
the measurements that will fit in this
thing now moving on to the back of the
case here you have the same thumb
captive screws or captive thumb screws
this is one of the heavy panels I almost
gouge and cut my jugular which probably
made some of you happy has the same
dense material on here that's going to
help with some sound dampening but it's
probably going to be very minimal
considering the fact that nothing else
in here is really sound dampened it's
probably a saint's panel to use on our
5s which are already manufactured that's
just an assumption anyway undoubtably by
this point some people have already
asked
themselves well where the heck do you
mount your storage well that's one of
the reasons why you have this kind of an
offset design on the motherboard wall
because you have three spot for three
rear mounted three and a half inch
mechanical drives or you can install
SSDs or two and a half inch mechanical
drives on the back as well so they use
the same sled design that they've been
using in the past only they've now
incorporated it to fit three-and-a-half
millimeter drives or three and a half
inch drives three now philometor drives
would be amazing wouldn't it three and a
half inch drives on the back as well so
SSDs support you have two of those trays
that they're well known for right here
that you can use to mount your SSDs so
you can have theoretically support for
up to five drives in this case which is
still pretty impressive consuming not a
lot of people are looking at adding
multiple drives or massive amounts of
drives they're looking at higher
capacity drives and only need a few
spots so that's perfect it gets
everything on to the back here you do
still have ventilation holes on the
front so you are going to be able to
have some cooling for your hard drives
and you can still fit up to five drives
on there now last but not least the
cables on here are all black which is
nice to see huge rubber grommet to
massive grommets on the side right here
giving you plenty of cable management
options which is always sometimes what's
really lackluster on some cases not so
much these days but in the past cable
management was a real bitch and then you
had one up here on the top so let's go
ahead and throw some components in this
thing and kind of see how well it looks
once you start filling it up and let's
see if it makes the cut when it comes to
being an optimized water cooling case
from fractal design transition
well I'm pleased to report that I threw
some components in here and as is as
much of a pleasure to build in as it
looks right now it's a mid tower but yet
it doesn't feel like a mid tower because
it's so freakin roomy I mean you could
put so much junk in this trunk the
badonkadonk on this is real so I've got
a full-size ATX motherboard in there the
asrock fatality 970 a with an 83 50
there's no block on there yet I've got
two gtx 980 s water-cooled in here a 250
millimeter radiate a rad from EK water
blocks i've got an alpha cooled EDC with
custom top pump mounted in the bottom
and I've got a 240 rad in the front and
a 360 on the top now I'm pretty sure I
could have fit a 360 in the front as
well with the 360 on the top and found a
way to make them both fit without any
sort of interference in fact the manual
shows that you can do it it's a very
close fit once the fans are on there but
it does fit you might have to turn the
fittings around on the bottom or
something but I mean it's not optimal
but it's you could do it unfortunately I
only have one 360 millimeter fan or a
radiator or whatever yeah I have a 360
millimetre 30ml on the top and a 30ml
240 on the front so I'm pretty convinced
I could have fit both but what you could
also do if you wanted to get really
creative is you could slide the 240 all
the way down and have a regular fan on
the top so you have a nice cool air
enter as well as maybe some warmed up
air coming through the radiator and just
lots of flexibility the bottom line here
is this is a mid tower case that just
feels so much bigger I mean you could
fit so many components in this thing and
nothing feels like it's competing for
space unfortunately in the r5 because it
was more silence optimized and more
airflow oriented even though they added
better radiator support to it than they
are for had it still felt like a lot of
things were competing for space if you
had mechanical drives they had to go in
the front there was no on the back they
could go even with one cage in there
then you're limited to the front you're
limited to where pumps can go it just
got really tight and that became really
apparent when I built in the r5 and did
a water cooling ptg loop for Paul's
hardware when I helped him out it really
felt like things were competing for
space and elbow room but that is not the
case in the define s I mean
everything has just got tons and tons of
room now I've got sitting right here a
fire pro W 9000 x2 basically this is
what turned into the 7990 same length
also as the 295x2 and I just wanted to
show that even with the reservoir
mounted this thing would have still fit
it might be kind of hard to see from
that angle but this thing would have
still fit and cleared the reservoir so
you could fit a 295x2 a super-long
graphics card they say up to 480
millimeters
technically if you weren't water cooling
I guess you can go with the world's
longest graphics card and fill it smack
the front of the case because there's no
drive gauges there but in any case it
does have so much freaking room in there
and it that is going to make it easier
for newer builders to do water cooling
loops because they're not going to have
to really do a lot of brainstorming on
how things are going to work or where
they're going to fit or where they're
going to go because fractal design has
already done that for you
that's a trend I'm really liking to see
when it comes to case design now in the
future is water cooling it's kind of
making a comeback where it's starting to
become much more mainstream more people
are doing it than ever and case
manufacturers are finally starting to
accommodate that and it really doesn't
cost them any more to do that in fact
this case probably cost less because
there's less stuff in there so this is
my new favorite case from fractal design
quite honestly I love the look of the r5
but I'm a water cooler through and
through and down to my bone this case
right here does it for me
in my opinion there's very little that
you could come up with on this case that
would make it better the only thing I
could think of when I sat here looking
at this one was putting the components
together that would have made this any
better whatsoever would be if they had
thought about putting some sort of a
small grommet right here next to the
pump so that you could put the pump
wires through and not have to run it all
the way over to the big grommet which
would show that's the only thing I could
think of and in fact that would be an
easy mod if someone would took a drill
in a Unibet and went to Home Depot and
bought a grommet you could run it right
through there and solve that problem
quite easily so there you go guys you
guys been asking me for ever to do the
fractal design define s-video I actually
had this case since it before it
launched but I got really behind on
projects and stuff so this too
a lot longer to get done than it should
have but I hope it was worth the wait
man it's unfortunate that this isn't
going to stay together right now because
these parts are slated for another
project but man I do think I'm going to
find something to put in here in water
cool even if it just sits on display
because I think this case nails it when
it comes to mid towers I do not
personally feel that there's a better
more water cooling friendly mid tower
out there for both beginner and advanced
builders I know people are going to
disagree with that but this is my
opinion that's how I feel about it
fractal design define s in my kit my
opinion it doesn't get much better all
right guys thanks for watching follow on
social media Twitter and all that sort
of stuff you guys want to ask any
questions and as always thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
