was this on your website right now and I
noticed that you guys did look Jay from
Jay Z J's to sense a YouTube channel
with 680 thousands of subscribers we met
in Austin back in May during the launch
of it for the 1080 deadmau5 was there
I'm the tall brown-haired guy kind of
handsome no that's that's Luke anyway so
the reason why I'm calling is I saw that
you guys launched a brand new Titan or
relaunched an old Titan whichever I'm
whatever you guys want to call it and I
was kind of curious if you were
interested in study 1 over for review oh
I see ok well what if ok so how about
this then I counter the no with my soul
for one Titan X or at least what's left
of it up in YouTube it's got to have
some monetary value I see I've got kids
those have any monetary value oh okay
great great
um ok so you should have my address and
go ahead and send that over and we'll
get right to it
yeah alright yeah you YouTube yeah
j JS JS 2 says nor ryan is with pc /
that that's an entirely different site
well you know it doesn't matter just go
ahead and send it over and we'll get
right on that
all right thanks bye bye uu tuna
that wasn't really all that hard wow
they're fast
with its unique freeform modular system
the new master case maker 5 from
coolermaster allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description the GT x 1080 has been
extremely popular so popular in fact
they are not in stock anywhere they have
been nothing but a logistics nightmare
when it comes to keeping these things in
stock so if you've ordered one or you've
got one congratulations you were top dog
for all of about two months because now
we've got the new Titan here which is
promising to be quite the behemoth when
it comes to power yeah we're gonna we're
gonna kind of move through this video
kind of quickly here because I want to
do some live benchmarking with this
video and and you guys like like
benchmarking haven't done it in a while
and we're going to do that today but
before we do that we have to talk about
some of the specs because you know that
if you're a specs nerd like myself you
kind of you kind of get off on some of
that stuff but anyway it's got three
thousand five hundred and eighty CUDA
core it's approximately a thousand more
then we'll call little Pascal here on
the GTX 1080 and it's got a fourteen
hundred and seventeen megahertz boost
clock which is funny because that's
about as far as one of my Titan X's the
Maxwell version of Titan X is somewhere
in this pile here kind of maxed out
about 1450 the three that are in
skunkworks get up to about 1500 but this
one's base clock is barely below that
and it's got a fifteen hundred and
thirty one megahertz boost clock but as
you guys know we're gonna we're gonna
push this thing as far as we can I know
why some people are afraid to overclock
this thing but not me not me I'm gonna I
had to pay for it I just had to give a
couple of my kids to Nvidia and it was
totally worth it
but for memory it's got 12 gigabytes of
g5x running at 10 gigabit gigabit per
second that is up that's some fast
memory right there as 10,000 megahertz
and as you guys know that's
overclockable as well but a 384 bit
memory bus and a 480 gigabyte per second
memory bin
that's pretty huge considering this is
not HBM and I think that might be one of
the first things that some of the people
have been disappointed about is the fact
that we were hoping that Titan on Pascal
was going to have HBM but considering
all the P 100 cores that you know they
talked about earlier in the year are
probably eating up all that HBM
productivity and manufacturing it's not
surprising that the Titan X does not
feature HP m especially since they're
saying that this is technically not a
gaming card it was developed and made
super fast for the purposes of deep
learning and creating Skynet and having
the end of the world as we know it
ground zero B right there at Nvidia
headquarters but again I digress the
card itself is actually aimed more
towards deep learning that is gaming
even though it says GeForce GTX right on
the side whatever of course it has the
stuff that you would expect like pcie
3.0 HDMI 2.0 B and all that stuff so you
can hook this up to your home theater of
course you know this is a home theater
card obviously because you know you
could do HD 4k playback through HDMI
which is kind of a big deal in terms of
output here it's got the same stuff as
the 1080 it's got an HDMI 2.0 B and it's
got three DisplayPort 1.4 as well as a
dual link DVI but obviously would you
guys care most about it does have a
backplate and the answer is yes it has a
backplate but for 1,200 bucks it better
have a backplate hello better have a
front plate too for all that matters
does it support sli yes up to two-way
especially with an HB Bridge definitely
recommended does a support simultaneous
multi-project yes does it support Ansel
yes does it support g-sync no it
actually does not just just kidding yes
of course it supports g-sync but it's
got a TDP of 250 watts any recommended
600 watt or higher power supply to
supply power to the 8 pin and 6 pin PCI
Express power so that's that here's
we're going to do a quick we're going to
jump it to the benchmarks I'm going to
show you those and we're going to hook
it up on the test bench we're talk about
a few things there are some things to
talk about here believe it or not and
we're going to get through this as best
we can without it being as painful as
possible transition
you
so if you bought the GTX 1080 simply
because of the fact that it was the best
of the best at the time that you got it
or at least tried to get it rest in
peace myself included because this guy
has just been pushed out by this guy for
being the fastest single GPU in the
world but it's not that cut and dry guys
because if you look at things like
performance per dollar if you care about
that even if you're shopping for the
best of the best then you guys will know
that there is a huge diminishing return
on the Titan X versus the GTX 1080 when
you compare the price of the fact that
this thing right here is 1200 freaking
US dollars or three thousand nine
hundred and sixty two dollars in
Australia or whatever it converts to be
sorry guys you guys really do get
wrecked with pricing down there it's
terrible but yeah the GTX 1080 is still
a huge huge performer when it comes to
performance per dollar I say that
considering it's a $700 graphics card
but remember we are comparing it to
1,200 two of these is only 200 more than
one of these and two of these will
literally smash on one of these and in
fact we're going to do a separate video
about 1080 sli versus a single type next
in fact I'd like to do that video today
but I want to keep this video manageable
we're going to keep it with one card at
least compared to this one for now and
we will test other SLI configs versus
this guy right here but there are some
things I want to talk about with this
card and to do that we are going to have
to go ahead and transition over to the
test bench here so I can show you guys
actually firsthand and not just talk
about it on some of the things to expect
with a GTX Titan X or just tight next
because apparently they're going to
maybe drop the GTX moniker in the future
who knows
so from left to right this is the power
percentage we're leaving that at stock
100 this is the temperature this is the
GPU load percentage this is the fan
speed percentage and that is the core
clock remember this has a 1400 and 17
megahertz base clock with a 15 31 boost
clocks we want to keep an eye on that
number and see what happens here so
anyway gameplay is super smooth even at
4k but then again it should be as you
can see we've got a single card with MSA
a 2x at 4k achieving higher than 60fps
that's actually kind of a big deal
it's funny cuz I used to use 4k tests
and I always found it very difficult to
play in 4k because it was kind of laggy
stuttery that's obviously not the case
here as long as we stay above that 60fps
then we're pretty good I've done this
mission so many times this is the
mission I actually use when I benchmark
grand theft auto 5 because it's pretty
much on a track everything is identical
happens the same way every single time
when it comes to the world and stuff so
it's in game play stupid shove up to it
it's in the game it's not a benchmark on
a track I'm controlling it but it's very
real-world scenario in my opinion as you
can see here right now the temperatures
have reached 83 to 84 that's where it's
going to start to control things to try
and keep the temperatures down the only
way the GPU can actually keep the
temperatures down is going to be by
either increasing the fan speed which by
default they've got it maxed out at 50%
it can't go any faster than that or
reduce the voltages and/or the clocks
now the clocks and the voltages go
hand-in-hand so those work together it's
what you're going to notice here the
more that I play you're going to see
these boost clocks start to come down a
little bit now anything over 1531 right
now is considered above the boost clock
so technically although we've come down
from 1700 ish down to the high 15s low
16s it's not considered a thermal
throttle in the sense of the way thermal
throttling is intended to work yeah it
is controlling the speed of the graphics
by speeding up and slowing it down to
control thermals but thermal throttling
usually relates to the GPU trying to
save itself from certain death or the
CPU in that matter because it's the same
concept there by slowing itself down so
that it doesn't cook now we're not doing
that here because we're still above the
boost clock so that's just one of the
things I want to mention here the same
goes for AMD this is an Nvidia specific
thing where people want to say oh it
slowed down therefore it's thermal
throttling no it's it's not thermal
throttling its thermal adjusting and
thermal throttling would be if we start
to go down below the advertised speeds
because of of thermals if that makes
sense oh it's the cops the cops
they know I stole this Titan X they're
after me
Simeon's not gonna be happy that I don't
wreck this car up
whoa that's that's bad
oh geez so the temperatures pretty much
went right up to 83 84 and as you guys
saw in the benchmark chart because I did
all founders Edition cards you know or
reference cards for 980ti Titan X and
the 1080 and the type the new Titan X
they all pretty much just went straight
to their max temperature threshold which
is set right here as you can see it's
set to 84 so what I'm doing right now is
I have got Metro last light running on 4
K loop 5 times because I want to see
what's going to happen to this core
clock and I want to see if I can
recreate what was happening during some
of my benchmark testing was how far C we
came all the way down to 15 31 now so
all the way down to the boost clock that
the factory boosts clocks we and now
we're below it we went down to 14 81 for
a moment this is just the beginning of
the first test as you can see as our
temperature is sitting here at 83 and
our load is out a hundred percent our
fan speed isn't allowed to go any faster
than 50 or 51 percent I want to see how
far that this clock will actually come
down so we're gonna let the tests go
five times we'll compare the average FPS
then we'll make some tweaks here and
then we'll see how well it actually does
so the first test here at a sixty four
point seven one average frame rate then
the the clock runs zero that's so weird
then the second test was sixty two point
three then 61 point eight
then 61.7 then 61 point one so you can
see it was slowly starting to slow down
but if we take a look at the the chart
here you can see right here the core
clock bounces around so much I mean so
much that's that's GPU boost and the way
it's meant to work but I find myself
asking if this result could be better by
simply playing around with the fan curve
and you know it can be that's the whole
point of this you know it can be so all
I'm going to do here I'm going to leave
the temperature target and the power
limit the same but all I'm going to do
is put in here a custom fan curve and
I'm just going to allow the fan to go
faster
at the higher temperature so what we're
sacrificing here is a little bit of
acoustic sound so the card will be a
little bit noisier but I don't know
about you I'm the kind of guy that would
be more than happy to add a little bit
of noise to my system if it means I get
more performance than worrying about it
being stupidly silent and I think that
NVIDIA is being waved too conservative
with the 50% fan cap go faster on the
fan speed and let's see what actually
happens to these core clocks as you can
see the way it started here we're
already higher but anyway we're going to
let it go and then we'll come back and
we'll compare well if you can hear me
over the fan it's obviously kind of
noisy it's running 85% now I want to
show you where on the fifth test right
here and it's still starting in the 1700
megahertz range and it drops down into
the mid to low 1600s and then comes back
up but look at that compared to the
other test which dropped down into the
high 14s low 15s we're sitting almost
200 megahertz average faster speed
alright so the test is done and the only
difference here is as I showed you I
change the fan curve nothing else so now
we've got a sixty six point seven nine a
sixty six point five one a sixty six
point six three a sixty six point three
seven a sixty six point six nine do you
see the difference there we gained four
FPS average increase by doing nothing
more at 4k by the way for FPS at 4k gain
is a lot and that was by doing nothing
more than changing the damn fan curve
I wish NVIDIA would just make it a
little bit more aggressive from the
factory yeah and then for those that are
curious here is the core clocks right
here on the previous test before the new
fan curve this is where I did the little
video there's the segment saying I'm
gonna adjust a fan curve and there's the
new core clock right there look how much
that jumped up by changing the fan curve
and then something else I want to also
point out is if we look at the average
temperatures here's the average
temperature with the poor fan curve that
it shifts with here's the new average
temperature with the new fan curve it
came down approximately what max was 85
that was probably just a spike so really
was more like 84 down to about 77
average you can see it's 77 to 76
all the way across it's pretty
consistent so yeah this applies to any
graphics card by the way not just the
tight necks change your fan curves do it
you're gonna hurt anything oh yeah and
did I mention it overclocks really good
to it'll reach two thousand and fifty
megahertz stable I can go farther than
that I haven't spent a lot of time
trying to go farther than that but then
again the heat also exponentially rose
we're even running this fan at 100% gave
me 77 C well overclocked at a hundred
percent fan speed yeah that's kind of
hot but um anyway yeah check out the
results of this was what it looked like
with the factory fan curb and the
factory clocks this is what it looks
like with the overclock holy balls
Falls and Batman if you've got an
original tight necks like this one right
here or perhaps three of them in a
system you might be feeling like I don't
know the best way to explain it
III know how I feel but the new tight
necks for the time being anyway until
they come out with the Titan xx are my
personal favorite the Titan X xx this
thing is a freaking Godzilla yeah I find
myself with this internal struggle
because I'm installing two of these 10s
in skunkworks which I know is more than
enough I know it's more than enough but
this is $1200 like I said I don't I
don't need two of these I want two of
these so I want 200 of these I don't
need it do i I'm fine with 210 80s I
don't need to tighten X's nope nope nope
don't need to don't need to don't need
to don't need to don't I just I don't I
don't need to
I don't need you you're you don't
control me I make the decisions around
here this is my channel
hey hey NVIDIA hey Jay here so I just
did that review and I decided that it's
Jay Jay with Jays two cents know how
many Jays do you guys actually know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
