I'm going to do something that's a
pretty new and unique to my channel
because I'm going to be reviewing a
pre-built system we're going to be
taking a look here at the Zeus mini from
cyber PowerPC and I want to point out
that this is not available on the market
yet this does not launch until February
28th and I've been given full NDA
disclosure and ability to go ahead and
talk all about this product so I don't
know if this is an exclusive or not but
I can tell you that we're going to go
ahead and talk about it and be one of
the first to show you about this super
tiny mini ITX built here from cyber
PowerPC so don't go away
now you guys might be wondering why the
hell does J have a z87 I gaming ITX
motherboard box here on his desk I may
have already reviewed this thing we're
taking a look at this well two reasons
one this is the motherboard that is
powering this system and 2 it is
basically holding a lot of the stuff
that comes with your system here you've
got your driver disks and you got your
windows 8.1 disk and you know manuals
cables the antennas because it says a
Wi-Fi wireless system so they pretty
much just put everything in the
motherboard box which is pretty typical
when it comes to system integrators and
builders that are already dealing with
pre-built systems now this is really
small and the dimensions of this
actually you know guys I'm gonna bring
up the website because and the link to
more information about the system is
down the description so please don't
forget about the description make sure
you guys check that out the dimensions
on this are seventeen point four inches
long four point four inches wide and 13
inches tall so as you can see that is a
very compact system in fact it's about
the size of a old-school VHS like
cassette tape I know you guys are like
what the hell is a VHS J what are you
talking about I'm aging myself guys but
the size of a VCR yeah video cassette
recorder there you go
uh let's go and talk about the specs
before we talk about like the case
because the case itself is really unique
I'm have already torn this thing apart
and take a look at it I've always get
concerned about cooling in such small
cases so I have already torn this thing
apart and put it back together
this is featuring the Intel i7 4770k it
is not overclocked
and I kind of don't really recommend it
in this configuration and I'll tell you
why a little bit later Windows 8.1
64-bit it's got a 240 gigabyte Intel 520
series SSD it's the green Zeus 100 Mini
ITX case which we're looking at right
here it does come in other colors black
red it's all on the website check it out
it is the EVGA 500 Y 80 watt bronze
power supply it's the cooler master side
in 120 M cooler and that's kind of why I
don't really recommend
and overclocked in the 4770k 4770k too
much because 120-millimeter coolers of
really any brand and with Intel's uh you
know the has real cooling is just really
difficult because of the bad internal
heat spreader at the hole in the video
it does have an eight-time slim our 8 X
slim drive in here does have an optical
does have a GTX 780 superclocked and the
MSI is 87 I which we've already talked
about now the case you can see it lifts
out of this little stand here to make
sure that you don't knock it over now
some of these cases that are of this
style allow you to lay them flat or
stand them up I don't recommend you lay
it flat because this is designed with
cross flow in mind it pulls from one
side of the case and goes out the other
same thing with a ventilation on the top
you don't want to if you plug one side
of this you're not going to get the flow
that you need in this case which could
lead to overheating on the front we've
got the slim drive right there we've got
our power button LEDs that are in here
and light up got some cyber power
branding right there and you've got your
green mesh which is also on the side on
the side right here we have a single USB
3.0 Jack our input and output for audio
and a USB 2.0 you've got your Windows
key right there we'll make sure we don't
zoom in on that and our core i7 on the
back for i/o you can see we've got the
same IO shield that is on the z87 I
already reviewed with the wireless
adapters right there the power plug is
in the middle of the back of the case
and you can see the orientation of the
graphics card makes it pretty obvious
that they're using like a PCI Express
ribbon adapter to kind of relocate the
graphics card to a location in the case
that makes sense on the case you've got
one thumb screw that holds on each side
panel so we'll go ahead and remove these
guys right now and you can see basically
what you have here is
it's kind of difficult actually with a
little bare feet on there so there's our
side panel with our grill on they're
very basic not a whole lot to show there
and same thing on the other side you
have got your grill and you can see they
just change the color of the grill based
on the case that you get now let's go
ahead and talk about the inside and I
think the layout of this case is really
well-thought-out
as you can see it's very compact here's
the slim drive the hard drives are under
that here is your power supply here here
is a exhaust fan and wires are pumping
that because I kind of that's my fault
and then you've got the sytem 120m
cooler right there with a green LED fan
because they put an LED fan that matches
whatever color option that you go with
on the case and our graphics card you
can see mounted this way and our
motherboard is down there now I'm gonna
do some I'm gonna basically include some
b-roll this guy and I need to move this
wire out of the way here because when I
took it apart and put it back I didn't
make sure that wire was clear so oh I
forgot to mention what the memory is hot
dirt it is a patriot 20 133 megahertz 4
gigabyte x 2 kit so it's a dual channel
kit 4 gigs to 4 gig sticks for 8 gigs
total ram 2133 and XMP profile now um
the cable management of CyberPower pc is
actually really good in a case like this
you have to have that type of cable
management I mean you have to have it
really well thought out
you can't just be blocking all the air
ways here because of you know being lazy
with your wiring because you're going to
block air flow which is very important
in this case
now the sided 120mm fan is pushing air
out of the radiator so it's pulling it
from this side of the case the backside
which I guess would be the left side to
the right side for cross flow you have
this exhaust fan right here which is
helping pull air across from the
motherboard and then your power supply
here is pulling air in from you can see
right here this side it pulls the air in
and then exhausts it I guess
kind of out of the front inside of the
case and the graphics card right here as
you can see this is a reference blower
style card is going to be taking the air
in through one of the vents that are see
it at the other side so we pull in the
air in through one of these got get it
right Jay oh my god I already had it
right okay so as we pull in the air in
through one of these vents and pushing
out of the back so the graphics card
kind of has its own dedicated path for
air to flow so it doesn't really affect
the ambient case temps too much here's
the backside of the motherboard so it's
easy to access the cooler tray and what
I think is really unique about this case
and this is the part where I'm going to
introduce some b-roll to show you this
is the way that everything is mounted
they have this really nice proprietary
kind of a bracket design wherever they
have these cross beams and everything
mounts to that now inspecting the cross
beam here for the cooler it looks to me
like you could go with a 240 millimeter
radiator in here I don't have I mean the
bad side is it gets really really close
to the graphics card which could block
some of the air flow and so I don't know
how well it would perform unless you had
slim maybe slim fans it's a little bit
iffy but the backside of this fan is
perfectly fine when it comes to air flow
I mean all the hard drives are down in
here but you've got these these cross
members here which hold everything in
and as you unscrew these screws you can
take out particular components to make
things really easily accessible like the
graphics card is sitting here with the
ribbon connector here that allows you to
lay the card flat and then it's got this
bracket in the back that kind of holds
everything down the cooler has its own
mount which is mounted to the case
directly you have this exhaust fan which
again has its own mount and everything
is just so well thought out the only
thing I think would have maybe made a
little bit more sense to me this is just
me personally though is maybe instead of
having this fan right here that pulls
air
of the motherboard maybe flip it around
so that it's blowing air on to the
motherboard components that way you have
more active cooling of the motherboard
itself because it's directly on top of
the motherboard this kind of case tells
me though that you have two cooling
options when it comes to the CPU either
water cooling like they've already
included like this or a very low-profile
CPU cooler which I'm not sure the 4770k
would be too friendly with because we
all know that is a very hot chip now
when it comes to performance numbers and
stuff I'm not going to be hooking this
up and giving you guys any real
performance numbers because we already
know how the components are we already
know how the 780 performers we know how
the 4770 performs the Patriot memory is
really really fast I just kind of wanted
to open this up take it apart show you
guys what the construction is like and
what the build quality is like when it
comes to cyber PowerPC so here is Jay's
unboxing and overview of the Zeus mini
here from cyber PowerPC so what do you
guys think about this case design I
personally think it's really well
thought out thermally I don't really see
there being any you know too many issues
with it especially since I recommend
running this at clock speeds and not
really overclocking it too much unless
you're able to go with more higher-end
cooling in this but I think it's
perfectly well thought out looks like
you can even go with a larger power
supply if you needed not much room left
in there so probably not recommended I'm
sure cyber PowerPC knows what they can
and can't fit in there but guys you guys
always ask me about pre bought systems
and what I recommend cyber PowerPC is is
a company that's been around for a long
time I got the chance to talk with Eddie
over at cyber PowerPC great guy seems to
be really on top of things communicates
well and I can't talk about price on
this because honestly I have no idea
guys it's not even launched yet so you
will be looking for this here on cyber
powers cyber power pcs website February
28th the information is down in the
description and hope you guys like what
you saw tell me what you think as always
I will see you guys in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
