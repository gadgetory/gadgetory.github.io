a big box it is a big box I'm about to
show you what's in the box what's in the
box okay bad bad reference there why are
you laughing ticket anyway if you guys
want to know what's in the box stay
tuned and if you want to be able to win
what's in this box like physically this
exact one to make sure you stay tuned to
the end of the video this would be kind
of hard for me cuz I have to unbox this
and I have to keep it reusable because
it's being shipped off after I'm doing
it so what we have right here is
actually a pre-built system from exotic
PC something we've been working on
collaborating since like back in
November the problem was you know the
holidays and CES a new year and all that
get in the way and then recently with
the whole cryptocurrency mining thing
it's just been hard to build computers
so that's why we're gonna talk about a
prebuilt today because this might make
more sense than ever to actually
consider buying a prebuilt you know with
the graphics card pricing being all
ridiculous at all okay so this is one of
those so we got a box in a box here boy
I'm never gonna Jenga this back together
you know that right there Zee 370 e
Strix motherboard I have this exact one
actually that's not really the start of
the show this right here trust me when I
say you are gonna want this we've got a
mortar mouse this is a mouse pad you
guys remember when I showed some of the
custom pcs at CES
well exotic PC was one of those systems
and they you know I fancy that I myself
a pretty good PC builder but there's a
lot of people who want custom stuff like
you see behind me right here but they
just are not comfortable doing it
themselves and/or they want the warranty
or specifically today they cannot afford
it because of the GPU prices and RAM
prices alone that's why sis
come in handy how you deco look we got
more
you're gonna have so much fun Reebok
unit Oh baby oh well would you look at
that I think this might be a rigid to
system well when there's foam inside the
case two paths button so far it looks
like it's still full of fluid so that's
a plus
oh my god this is why you're here so
this is the exotic PC g7 Avenger now you
can outfit pretty much any kind of PC
you want from them they are an SI a
system integrator it means they're you
know you guys forever emailed me going
hey J can you build me a system I don't
really want to do it myself I I like
your build I want you to do it for me
that's exactly what those guys do they
build systems like this for a living
everything from mild to wild I mean you
guys could get pretty much anything out
of exotic in terms of style I mean the
sky's the limit let's see what's in the
box here this is actually pretty heavy
so they probably put all of your manuals
and things in here exotic piece d here's
your thank you for your purchase here's
a sticker motherboard manual leftover
cables and stuff from the EVGA power
supply that's in there we even have an
extra fan look at that that's like a $30
fan or throw $25 pin not that so we got
that we got some more manuals everything
that you need to understand your system
how does that matter why am I so bad at
this no when this system was ordered
they communicate with you through the
entire process they let you know it's
being built to let you know it's being
tested they'll let you know that it's
passed QA and QC or quality control and
then they give you your tracking
information and all your shipping
information and they've got several
different types of shipping now normally
the it will show up like you just saw
right here it's all the insta pack foam
double box might actually came on a
pallet and you can actually palletize
these if you want it is an option
alright so in terms of specs obviously
it's in a fractal design mesh if I see
they put a custom logo on the front
you've got an Intel 8700 k we've got an
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 atti it's an EVGA
version it says black edition we've got
16 gigabytes of g.skill Trident Z RGB
3800 and 66 megahertz it's the exotic PC
stage 2 custom water cooling so what
that basically means is the components
that are cooled on this or stage 1 2 3
that it goes up from there you can cool
motherboard it can go like I said from
mild to wild so the stage refers to what
parts are actually being water-cooled
this is obviously a rigid tubing build
right here they can do it with soft
tubing as well let's see our operating
system drive is a 250 gigabyte 960 Evo
nvm
a SSD and then we have a two terabyte
sshd or a Seagate hybrid drive for our
main storage on there so it is a fire
CUDA and then it's got Windows 10 home
on there but I want to kind of look at
right here oh and in terms of cooling
that I I'm not entirely positive of the
brand of this radiator this looks like
aqua computer I could be wrong but that
looks like an aqua computer radiator and
if it is and that is a seriously
high-end red right there but look at all
of this we got bits power fittings right
here every little detail was thought of
custom sleeved cables it looks like
something I would build and probably a
little better to be honest we've also
got our RGB fans right here from Corsair
and those are the Maglev fans but let's
take a look at this right now that the
chest for any builder is the cable
management do we want to see what's
behind here that's behind door number
two Wow
it's actually not bad at all so these
are extensions that are on here we've
got all of our rest of our cables down
there we've got our controller right
here for the RGB fans or something else
I want to point out though this right
here this is a drain valve so not only
do they have it custom water cooled it
is of course easy to maintain so here is
your drain valve right there and you
could actually fill it technically by
this as well because it's not gonna be
very easy to get to the reservoir on
this particular case because of where
they have it mounted let's take a look
at that oh and here's our sshd right
there cable management on this is
extremely well thought-out but here's
your reservoir right here so getting a
fitting up into there even a tube isn't
too easy and we kind of need if maybe
they drilled a hole up here so you could
get a funnel into that but whatever I
mean I guess that's something the person
themselves could do if they wanted to
snip that out because you have this
cover that goes on there anyway for your
fan filter but you got to admit though
they have done a great job at building a
custom system inside of a small mid
tower case like the mesh if I see so no
but you know what's next we got to fire
this up and we gotta sue this bad boy
looks like when it's turned on I'm
turned on you guys and I'm not gonna be
loading any my profiles on here doing
benchmarks or any of that mostly because
I'm not keeping this system so I don't
load I don't wanna load my stuff on
there but exotic PC puts this thing
through days of testing stress testing
torture testing game
testing to make sure there are
absolutely zero problems with
temperature or stability but the main
reason why I'm not loading any of my
stuff on here is because I'm not keeping
this system this system is actually for
a giveaway one of you lucky people
watching this video is going to win this
exact system and I'll sign it if you
want me to otherwise I won't graffiti on
your case so I'm not loading any of my
stuff on here I want you to get it
exactly as it ships but I guarantee you
it performs as well as a 1080 Ti on
water can perform and an 80 700 K I
believe it's overclocked the thinking
has a small overclock I really don't
know we'll check the BIOS but this is
gonna be yours and I don't want to start
loading stuff on here and screwing
around with it but some of the stuff we
are gonna check is like acoustics the
build quality we already saw is next to
none this is this is really top tier
build quality we're gonna check and see
if it's overclocked we're gonna take a
look in the BIOS and we're gonna see you
have the lighting and stuff looks on
this right now so without further ado
let's go ahead and make sure this is on
McHugh it wasn't says what they'll pay
for okay so without further ado and
procrastination let's go ahead just
power it on and see what it looks like
you can see we've got some passive RGB
lighting there it's set to red just not
really doing anything but what's look
that switches to white I'm glad for this
they went to white oh thank you for that
we don't have RGB crap going everywhere
looks like the ram is set to go to
spectrum mode but the fans the
motherboard and all of that is set to
looks like blue and white so that just
looks really really classy and look at
the front of this the way the fans shine
through that is pretty it's pretty quiet
- I mean I can hear the fans blowing
it's a small chassis and it's got a lot
of resistance to overcome with the
radiator and stuff in the front but this
is definitely not intrusive we've got a
pretty quiet environment right here so
when I stop talking give you an idea of
how quiet it is I'll tap the table and
we do have a shotgun mic pointing down
here
do we have any oh we got MSI Afterburner
here so we have an overclock profile
looks like we have an overclock profile
sets they have it set to plus 100 on the
core temp limits the same power limits
the same memory clock as a plus 100 I
know for a fact it can go farther than
that
like I'm so tempted right now to move
those sliders because I know where this
card will go I won't mess with it that's
hard for me though so we're under load
right now in heaven benchmark I'm using
this right now to test the GPU
temperatures I'm curious to how hot it's
gonna get looks like we're seeing at 36
C right now and here's the acoustics if
you actually just listen you can hear
the fans clearly I think some person the
mic may not pick it up as good as your
ears but this is definitely not invasive
but there is a setting I'm gonna change
after all I know I said I wasn't gonna
touch this but there is one setting I'm
gonna change check this out right here
do you see how the frequency is bouncing
all around one of the benefits to water
cooling a GPU is the fact that this
doesn't become a factor because there's
two things that can cause the frequency
to bounce around like that temperature
but it's usually not gonna bounce under
temperature it's just gonna start to
step down slowly and power limit now
while we're overclocking this graphics
card which they've done with a plus 100
they didn't move the power limit slider
so what I'm gonna do right now and I
want you to watch this number as I do it
in real-time do you see how this is
still bouncing around plus or minus over
a hundred megahertz at times now watch
if I take the power limit and the temp
limit max these out watch what happens
to this whoops watch grab is to this for
speed and check that out
locked lock the 20 60 to beat and we're
gonna go and save this profile back to
number one there we go
the reason why we do that is because we
are overclocked and underwater we are
also water cooling the V RMS on this
card because it's a full cover water
block it's an ek water block we are not
over extending the limits of this card
at all so now we've got a much more
consistent core clock it still has not
changed as you can see right there
that's the only change I'm going to make
to their settings right here max out the
power limit max out the temp limit as
you can see at 38 C under load 39 C this
might top out you know on a warmer day
maybe in the mid 40s I've seen today
TI's looked at about the mid-40s under
load that is not going to be a problem
so as you can see there 2062 overclock
yeah send it let it go don't don't let
it fluctuate like that so the only
change I'm making to their settings
right there all right in the other
testing one to do was Cinebench r15
mostly because I'm just curious as to
how the per overclock performance rather
than they sync all cores which I
normally do and I'm gonna take a look at
the temperatures right here now I'm well
aware it's not a full burn test it's not
gonna sit there and get the loop all the
way up to temp but it's I know we've got
a fairly oversized loop given the
components that are in here and the
quality of the radiator that our
temperatures are not gonna creep up too
much over time so let's just go ahead
and send it and our temperatures are
here you see 71 70 72 so it's like we
went right to the low 70s on an
overclocked 8700 k that's pretty
acceptable I mean the 8700 K like I said
runs toasty people know this so this
should not surprise anybody this is
still 35 C away from thermal Junction
max so we've got plenty of cooling
overhead and we run a 1500 exactly so
not bad okay so here's our profile looks
like it's set to is it set to 2133 is
there no overclock oh no we have an
overclock right here see it set to 4.9
CP is currently running at 24 C in the
BIOS 25 C so that's nice I doubt it's
deleted I have I don't believe it's
delete it at all but we do have an XMPP
profile loaded right here that's 38 68
on our memory and we do have a per core
overclock right now set to 4.9 then
going down at four point seven seven and
five to five so it is going to bounce
around the 4.9 cores to whichever 2 or
under the most load and it seems like a
pretty stable way to do it I mean
obviously when you're dealing with
customers and stuff and you're an SI you
want to build a system it's with me as
stable as possible when I build mine
like the ones you see back there those
are on the edge they're on the razor's
edge of crashing but that's ok because
that's part of the game for me that's
part of the chase is finding that stable
overclock obviously for a client build
or a customer build you don't want that
you don't want them being you know
inconvenienced with random crashes
stuff but that being said obviously this
carries a full warranty and this is a
good time to talk about sis and where we
are right now because a lot of people
don't know this but sis in many cases
have priority with GPU purchases I
talked to a couple of different GP
manufacturers prior to making this video
and they did confirm with me that s
i--'s get priority so that system
builders can continue building systems
and they get them either at or extremely
close to MSRP not be jacked up pricing
that you're seeing because of
cryptocurrency so with that said this
might be the best time ever to consider
a pre-built system because for the first
time ever I think it's cheaper to build
a whole system from scratch through an
SI you go up to the website and choose
the parts you want they build it there's
a nominal you know markup that they make
you know they can keep running their
business on it's still cheaper than
trying to do it yourself because of the
pricing of GPUs in the current market
now we can hope that all changes but as
you can see there are builders out there
that take a huge passion in what they do
exotic PC being absolutely no different
and I'm really happy to see that they
built a system right here that I would
be absolutely proud to put on my own
desk and use guys check the description
below there is a link down there where
you can enter this giveaway because of
the price this Jeep this system right
here is just under $4,000 so someone's
getting a $4,000 tower and the extras
that come with it right here we got the
exotic PC mouse pad and mouse so you
guys can definitely someone's getting a
heck of a prize package here but all the
rules and regulations and all that stuff
is in that link also a huge thank you to
fractal design they were also involved
in helping me arrange all of this
obviously they're metaphysis it was a
huge part of the showcase here so again
a huge thank you to fractal design but
guys I'm gonna go thanks for kind of
checking out this overview and first
look at the exotic PC g7 Avenger
someone's gonna be getting a heck of a
prize so anyway don't come to me asking
for the details everything you need to
know is in the description below as
always guys thanks for watching and I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
