it's not science week but we're going to
do something for the sake of science
anyway and I don't know why I'm doing
like little t-rex arms but I digress
with its unique freeform modular system
the new master casemaker five from
coolermaster allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description so whenever one was at CES
this year
nice stayed home with coconut monkey
hi-yah I was like you say something I
don't know you're there I thought
dynamic tripod it's moving we played
around with different water cooling
fluids and we tried milk and orange
juice and Powerade and you guys liked
that in fact one of the most common
responses to that was do it with thermal
paste well people have done that video
before but doesn't gonna stop me I'm
gonna do it anyway so we're going to do
today is we're gonna play around with
different stuff from house and see how I
guess it works as thermal based science
bitch
yeah now
I got called out in that thermal pin
that thermal paste video on GPUs because
I used a GTX 680 it everyone was like
yeah because if it went wrong he didn't
want to blow up his 980ti as well guess
what I'm gonna do this video today with
my 59 30k overclocked
to 4.3 on an X 99 gigabyte UDP for
motherboard and my ek water blocks block
and a 360 radiator so yeah we are going
to do this on my actual test bench I'm
just gonna hope I don't kill the damn
thing now before we show you guys what
we're gonna try we have to do our base
tests so I just took my finger in the
fan mail Sonia I bought this it's a
problem with the coping fans like this I
just took a finger in here yeah it's
leading so we have to get two things out
of the way one our hypothesis but we'll
talk about that after the base because
I'm not going to review reveal yet what
we're going to use for this experiment
but we need to see like obviously this
thing has been set up and running for a
while we need to see what our base
temperatures are with the proper stuff
applied so we can see how much different
the other stuff is if we just did it
although we don't really have any base
lines to base that on so remember it is
running at 4.3 gigahertz right now and
we are going to be doing this with a 264
and I am using real temp here to monitor
all of the temperatures so you guys can
download real temp if you want to
monitor temperatures it's free I'm
moving it around I'm moving it so
they're gonna get sick you're gonna get
sick so I'm using a 264 his gonna do I'm
going to start the stress tests we are
going to be stress testing CPU and cache
so we want to get as much heat built up
into this thing as we can
I'm going to let it run for five minutes
there's the timer right there anything
longer than five isn't necessary but
loop will already stabilized and the CPU
would heat it up just you understand the
two numbers here and I will put up a
chart this first number here this is the
current core temperature the next number
here is how far we have to go
temperature-wise before we thermal
throttle but this is our maximum
temperature and our minimum temp and
then I'll show you what we're going to
use because I think we got semi creative
mostly it's just so that we can eat the
results yeah we got hungry this morning
three
- one okay so the five minutes is past
this are our test results these are the
maximum temperatures right here on core
zero through five so these are our max
temperatures right there with proper
thermal compound which one am i using on
there it is the ek echo therm no it's
not I lied it's the gelid the Galant of
what the Eco therm goes on the GPU this
is the gellan here is what we're going
to use a me show you right now so test
number one you guys actually requested
this one we're going to use toothpaste
and I think anyone who's ever done this
test is used toothpaste then this is a
hypothesis part because either we're
gonna use we use toothpaste we use
creamy peanut butter we're gonna use
Burt's Bees almond and milk hand cream
comment on the counter in the bathroom
and we're going to use Double Stuf Oreos
but just the creamy filling and that's
because coconut monkey wants to eat the
test results all right so hypotheses
time we're each going to give our own
I think the toothpaste is going to work
best quite honestly my concern here is
to pay off how hot it gets with what we
don't want anything to like liquefy and
then just kind of make its way into the
socket because then you guys are going
to see two idiots blow up an X 99 rec um
what do you think is gonna do the best I
want to say toothpaste but I want to be
different yeah I want to be different
and go for the double stuff
double-stuffed yeah yeah we're just
gonna use the filling on that I don't
know what's gonna happen with that I
don't know if it's gonna get Matt
liquidy or you might sticky five but if
it caramelize --is okay we'll do a
toothpaste right before Oreo will do
peanut butter Burt's Bees toothpaste
double stuff or if we go alphabetical
and start at Burt's Bees and then go to
Colgate yeah yeah yeah this isn't this
looks like price is right all right this
is not prices right I don't you think
the Oreos were this ask the audience
that sounds so Dicky and I read you know
one of the real reasons why I'm doing
this with waterblock because it's easier
to get on and off a long time and there
it is another pretty good separation
actually like it evened out pretty good
yeah you know that's words before we
before do this I'm not too concerned
about the toothpaste oh that's right
we're doing the birds be using the
birdseed okay I'm a little bit concerned
this is very
why are we doing this because we saw
that every day because the internet
asked like this is almost impossible to
apply anyway like I can't get it as like
this is not the correct way to apply
thermal paste people I want to just
gonna smell you and starts heating up
like I'll just like spread all over face
my biggest concern is something getting
down in the socket cuz that will that
will ruin it
so let me get the runny nose all this
ever oh it's the Burt's Bees stuff in my
nose
um you allergic to me know what bud is
but this is the moment of truth we are
going to see okay well it's also get a
post every good that means nothing got
in the socket um keep working Mon that's
a good sign
get away for the screen good image yeah
we are loose key what a blue screen with
a blue light good night special okay oh
yes post let's do the idol temps are
okay so they're a little bit higher what
no rat got a normal huh everything's
booting up so there's a little bit CPU
load going on
I see it's fluctuating us a little bit
mm-hmm all right here's the real test
Randy a 264 if I'm just expecting this
to like instantly hit 100 who knows
cheers are you ready
yeah all right here we go
oh wait this it's the wrong test it's
only testing the drive yeah I was like
the temperatures didn't move there we go
all right into action
oh these well I'm kind of surprised
I mean they're a little bit higher
already but I kind of expected that to
go straight to like TJ Maxx and stare at
thermal throttling or something what's
this stuff made out of anyway um okay it
may not approve prunus Emile Galvez do
lucas oil water beeswax a low bar
bananas leaf juice : fragrance citrus :
Poland okay does Phillip K a oli n
kaolin :
we'll call color fragrance that Delta
tho 7159 I think that's just because it
doesn't have a perfect sprite all right
we'll come back at the end of the test
hey what are you doing fission chocolate
one we use a white one we're supposed to
save it for the test though so the
Burt's Bees test is about done we just
hit five minutes on there here's the
temps right there 73-65 78 67 74 and 65
so like 12 ish degrees hotter the actual
thermal compound not bad considering
it's hand cream I think obviously the
longer you run it the hotter it's gonna
get because it's kind of burning itself
off let's do this let's stop the test
did it liquify I think I might liquefied
I think you did too because the
temperatures were like kind of steadily
just kind of going up one of the reasons
why I'm only doing five-minute tests is
like I said I don't wanna I don't want
to blow my up but if it does then
think of all the reddit threads
but yeah just disappearing yeah it's
actually doing pretty good though
okay the toothpaste here we're using
Colgate whitening color it's not doing
me any good because I make Jim Carrey
look like a poster boy for perfect
dentistry I think it's enough can see
you pal it all right I'm gonna live
dangerously someone called it Mount
Rushmore of thermal compound yeah
that'll do that'll do
that's like a Kilimanjaro that's lame
enough for Rushmore it's bigger uh two
paces installed first boot I expect good
things actually because from what I
understand everyone who's tried
toothpaste I said it actually works
pretty good kind of like the best
temperature we got with the fluid was
the milk but it was also like the most
disgusting too because it started to
turn yellow and I think we might have
ended up with butter or ethylene a
little bit smells so bad we opened it up
food here is our I Oh temps you know the
routine
we'll see you in five minutes actually
need to see what happens immediately
when we started Oh dan I shot up to the
70s I can immediately we mean maybe it's
not gonna work as good yes exeunt
all right test is ending and the
temperatures actually look a little bit
worse than it did with the first bees
stuff I expected the toothpaste to be
better I really think it matters which
one you use like which type of
toothpaste you guys wonder when clicking
monkey as he ran off to get milk for his
Oreos and he hasn't come back um yeah
it's actually a little hotter across the
board
then the Burt's Bees bus I know he's
morbid to know maybe maybe people are
gonna be like he used way too much
thermal toothpaste no such thing he's
too much thermal to a paste no such
thing
so again looks like a lot like the make
it does look like you could have started
to burn off or yeah just literally
spread out all the way you know and it
doesn't have a great contact because the
temperatures were well under t.j.maxx
and it didn't thermal water but
long-term testing office I'm not going
to test this thing for like an hour
he'll know it smells minty Burt's bee
almond dish oh it's like so it's like a
skillet its retaining all the flavors it
is kind of Oh God do that it's yes like
smearing a sign I need to take out the
CPU afterwards and clean it like really
badly on the edges mm-hmm I should get
something rather stick my fingers in
this some people who are allergic to
peanut butter oh you need any a spatula
or something
rib eye I think I know a specialist uh
let's see so I'm going to spread peanut
butter oh my gosh
that's the same size
put it here we go there's been enough
again this is so bad this is so bad the
Internet's gonna be still mad at me
the change is real mm yeah a dollar but
poop that poop emoji right there
this is probably the most pointless
video I've ever made
I've made a lot of pretty pointless
videos in my day okay so okay butter
creamy jiff right it's a jiff
yes it's juice it's danfa not a sponsor
anyway it's idling in the low 30s by
2029 you know email results or you know
you know the routine right we're gonna
push start and we'll see you in a couple
minutes
to the initial temp job up - whoa whoa
Dane okay hmm
and we hit thermal throttling on one two
three cores so far you can sit there
it's throttling but there the red is the
percentage of throttling yeah I don't
think peanut butter is gonna work
no let's go ahead and stop the test that
was it that was actually a common one
twenty four seconds in and and they all
hit thermal except for the end as long
as I stopped it because here's reduced
fat oh gosh it's like not there it
started to turn kind of hard though mmm
there's only one test left to do after
this one that's going to be the Oreos
all right so peanut butter was a no-go
but it is sure tasty though you're
allergic to peanuts I apologize to this
video um so here we go Oreos I'm just
worried about this being like liquidy no
not liquidy it's it's like chalky um
so that's a nice healthy mount right
there no oh I'm worried about it not
spreading very good so I got that double
stuff little taste
mm-hmm cheese since this was solid this
isn't really like a liquid
you got some like peanut butter next to
you there yeah dude I have to take the
cpi-u out and clean it when we're done
anywhere like hole around it hey ready
ready yeah more we did not ever be oh it
just feels wrong so my apophysis was the
Colgate I was wrong right what did you
choose the Oreo Oreo okay so neither one
of us chose the bricked bees with so far
it seems to be the best winner yeah
cheese I don't know I can't even start
to dance I don't think this is gonna
work oh well they started let's get
those logs so let's get those check
engines going on because check engine
lights going yeah all right make it
light up
you ready this is gonna probably be an
instant DNF right you got it on there
yeah okay let's reset and are you going
mmm-hmm you got the temperatures and
start
one two three four five and logs was
that eight seconds in all right okay so
obviously all the temperatures went to
 quickly but that was fast
eight eight seconds yeah it didn't even
stay down it was like popped up it's
gonna be gross
looks like Cinnabon frosting why why did
I do this for science yeah this was real
scientific yeah but it all still works
anyway guys yet terrible idea don't use
any of this use the real stuff I
actually use thermal compound not what
we did do as we say not as we do you'll
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
