the mirror like if you have a mirror
either side of you in the bathroom or
something you look in there it's like I
go on for eternity hey what's up guys
Jase $0.02 bringing you another one of
these Adobe videos here where it's kind
of like the noob helping the noob if you
will I mean I've been editing videos for
a long time obviously now in YouTube but
it doesn't make me an expert but it does
give me some knowledge that I can share
with you guys to help you have a little
bit easier time with editing your videos
and rendering them and getting the best
quality that you can if you're using the
Adobe you know Premiere Premiere Pro or
CC like I'm using here and I'm today
gonna focus on what all those damn
settings mean in the rendering box and
the export functions that just confuse
the hell out of you and you don't know
what to click you need to are you just
so confused anyway we're going to go
over those settings today and we're
going to make it really easy for you to
get the best quality renders without
using up all your CPU or all of your
valuable time
now these how-to segments here with
video editing and creator topics is
brought to you by video blocks and
that's a service I've actually been
using for three years now and you guys
have seen it subtly in some of my videos
adding it just a little bit of pop and a
little bit of flair to what would
otherwise be some pretty boring like
benchmark numbers and transitions and
things like that so make sure you guys
come and check out video blogs they've
got pretty much something for anyone
right now they've got a lot of holiday
stuff going on a lot holiday motion
backgrounds you can see we got some
snowfall in here I don't know what
that's like I live in California have no
idea what snow falls like so I'm going
to take their word for it that this is
pretty accurate but you've got motion
backgrounds and all kinds of stuff that
you can use transitions stock footage
here maybe you want to make no shoe
commercial or something I don't know
that's the point anything you want to do
you can pretty much find here in there
ten million dollars worth of stock
footage you there's a lot of stuff going
on now right now there's a special promo
going on at the time of making this
video and you can find the link to it
down in the description where you can
save 50% off of your year-long
membership which is normally 99 bucks
but right now using my link down in the
description you can get a year-long
membership with an
limited use of their 10 million dollars
worth of library for only $49 check them
out use the link down the description
they know that I sent you and you will
get 50% off your year-long membership
trust me that's that I can't even tell
you how much money that's worth in 49
bucks Jesus that's only like 10
Starbucks own go do it right now geez do
yourself a favor all right so as I
mentioned the video topic for today is
all the render settings in that render
box a lot of times people spend a lot of
time creating very good content lots of
graphical overlays and transitions and
color Corrections and stuff but they
just don't know the best settings for
rendering they don't know the best
export settings they complain that it
takes too long or it the file size is
way too big because really a lot of
people suspended tend to spend a lot of
time researching how to edit an amazing
video but no time on how to export it
properly so that's what we're gonna do
today now this is as you guys have
probably already seen my video here
where I was putting the block on my new
motherboard that's going into skunkworks
and right about here as you can see I'm
inspecting the holes realized crap I got
the wrong freaking block if you guys
haven't seen that video in an epic jaeil
there's plenty of those J files but the
specific one go and check that out the
video went up last Friday but anyway if
you go over here to file now this is
also going to be adobe premier pro
cc2014
i have not upgraded to 2015 I've heard
it had some issues and then this is
working for me and I want to leave it
here so anyway this your ear menu may
vary slightly depending on the edition
of Pro that Adobe Premiere that you are
using but this is going to be very
similar for elements and even the Sony
settings are very similar they may not
be worded identical but they're very
similar in the way that they work in
terms of the types of settings that you
can select so let's say we're done with
our file here we're going to export this
we're going to click media or you could
do the shortcut of ctrl M I use a lot of
shortcut keys because I like to keep
things quick here it is right here now
we'll just go from right right down the
list right here
so export settings if you click match
sequence settings you'll see by default
it wants to export to a dot mp4
because we've got the h.264 encoder
going here by the way this is the only
encoder in the list that I use is h.264
but notice if we click match sequence
settings it changes it to an MPEG the
reason for that is the main track or the
video track 1 on this project is coming
out of my DSLR which records in an
impact format now we don't want MPEG
because MPEG makes huge file formats at
a not exactly the greatest quality of
encoder so anyway we are going to switch
that back to h.264 now preset match
source high bitrate the reason why I
kind of leave this one going rather than
coming down here and selecting you know
like let's say because you know down
here they've got the YouTube one right I
think you push what yes okay so we got
some YouTube pre-rendered stuff here
right YouTube 1080p HD now what now
watch this see how this file size here
is set to 12 46 megabyte if I click that
do you see how that went up to nineteen
hundred and 70 megabytes the reason for
that is if you look here in the video
settings it brought the actual bitrate
up to sixteen by sixteen VBR one has a
variable bitrate now I like to kind of
take control over these settings and
you're just gonna have to take my word
for this one or try it out for yourself
I have spent a lot of time checking
between the different bit rates all the
way up to 50 Mbps to see what the
difference is on the file output but
once it's rendered up to YouTube now
here's the thing no matter what sides
you render the file app YouTube is going
to compress the absolute crap out of it
I think you guys have seen that and the
end result of their compressed file is
much smaller than 16 so if we left the
target bitrate and the max bitrate at 16
which is kind of funny because the
bitrate encoding here as VBR technically
would be CBR or constant bitrate if we
don't allow it to have any variation
here it's going to be much much smaller
than that because YouTube has millions
and millions in it what probably
billions of videos online now and they
don't want to use up all of their server
space so they compress it as small as
possible the point I wanted to make out
here was the moment I change anything
down here it's going to switch the
preset to custom anyway so if you just
want to click it and forget it you can
be on your way that's fine but I don't
like to use the
prerendered or priests selections here I
the presets I don't like to do that now
the output name that's obviously up to
you you have to name that yourself here
with some files here from my 970 hybrid
we could call this here rendering vidya
actually I spelled that wrong Vidya
there we go rendering Vidya safe so now
you can see the file name would be
called rendered video rendering Vidya in
whatever folder we set that to pretty
self-explanatory export audio export
video well if we turn both of those off
it's like at least one has to be
selected to doofus you need something to
export okay fine
now on the selections here in the tabs
on the left hand side you can do a
couple of things which is kind of neat
you can add some basic applied effects
here like we can make it a black and
white or we can compress the audio of
the video day for night so we can make
something like if we shot this outside
during the day we apply this filter it
kind of makes it look like it's at night
sip eeeh like old Wild West bleach
bypass so instead of having to apply
these to all your clips in your video
which are in your timeline which would
be very intensive you could apply them
here at the time of rendering and then
everything will it'll just happen all at
once
alarm overall which is nice if you
actually have a video where you had your
white balance way off instead of having
to apply it to each one of your clips
you could just apply it overall etc so
you can turn that off image overlay it's
very neat let's say you want a water
market let's say you've got like a
little JC sense logo or something that
you want to put on the video and not
have to apply it as an overlay inside of
your timeline and I'll have to take up a
whole track with that you could click
this here you can find your file so
we'll go here to my design element stuff
which is where I keep a lot of my stuff
my twitch background and let's say I
want to put this don't put this Jace
$0.02 logo in there BAM we don't want
that in the middle of screen I mean
unless we're going to watermark it as
like a client proof or something so you
can move it the size of it here you can
make it bigger or smaller by clicking on
the size and dragging you can also move
the thing with the offset here for
position click and drag it left see that
it goes left when you go left that's
weird huh now right to go down on the
other on the y-axis
and there we go we technically have now
a little bit of a watermark that neat
that's neat so instead how to apply it
in our timeline we just do it at the
time of rendering that's always neat I
don't really do that but I should
probably start considering my videos
have been getting reloaded a lot named
overlay that's just if you want to name
the file you can you can make it
whatever you want basically file output
name rendering video dot mp4 so that
become like a client proof sort of thing
but I assume most of you would probably
not be using any of that this is the
part here where most people are going to
be interested in this is the video
format here or video tab here in the
export settings you can match the source
which is awesome it says right here
automatically sets basic video settings
to match sources properties yeah I mean
you can do that but whatever render at
maximum depth this is the one that tends
to really confuse people like maximum
depth I want maximum depth I want my
video to look amazing well guess what I
forgot to mute my phone again maximum
depth here this is only used if you were
going to be rendering something with
high bit like say something like 32 bit
and you're compressing it down what that
basically means is that most cameras
these days guys are not using anything
higher than 8 bit even a camera that has
10 bit like a DSLR or some sort of a
professional video camera is going to be
like a 10 bit camera 32 bit we're
talking like sony red epic or something
like that and what's going to happen
here is when you take that huge bitrate
and you make it smaller you start to get
what's called banding and you guys have
all seen this especially in like where
there's a color gradient and you can see
the definition where it went from like
black to dark gray to medium grade to
light gray to white and it just got this
like very sharp cutoff line that is
called banding and that's going to
happen if you don't click this setting I
don't think you need to worry about this
most of us are not using any sort of
equipment for recording that's going to
really make this matter for the most
part leave that unchecked it's just
going to slow down your render I always
leave this a VBR one pass i've tried and
VBR stands for variable bitrate CBR is
constant bitrate i've tried one pass in
to pass i've not notice much of a
difference but most of my videos are
just talking head format anyway without
fast motion
stuff if you were doing like sports
videography gaming and things like that
you might want to make it a two pass and
then you would want to make the bitrate
you know fairly decent now by default
guys I do 14 by 16 on my target bitrate
I let it go all the way down to 14 FAQ
sometimes if I'm just a talking head
like let's just say I'm doing one of
those videos where I'm sitting there
telling you guys about you know what to
look for when buying a motherboard or
water cooling I'm just literally sitting
in front of the camera I'll let that go
way down to 10 because it's not going to
really matter considering nothing with
the exception of my body is moving in
the frame whatsoever keyframe distance
this isn't going to really matter for
your videos here but down here this is
what is going to matter here use maximum
render quality a lot of people click
that because the wording in itself makes
you think well I want my video to look
the absolute best therefore I am going
to click it BAM well what you just did
was you you did absolutely nothing use
maximum render quality is what you use
if you are changing the file output size
from from the source so if we had
recorded let's say 4k gameplay and we
were going to output it to 1080p then
you would select it what it's going to
do is it's going to make the resizing of
the highest quality so that you can
eliminate jaggies and fuzzies and things
like that
same thing with if you're going up let's
say you recorded 720p and you're trying
to put it in a 1080p format and you want
to you know bump up the size of the
video you know you're going to get a lot
of jaggies because it's obviously not
this native resolution it can help a
little bit almost like anti-aliasing so
that's only the only time you're going
to use this is as I said you are
outputting to a different size than the
source and you can always tell right
here in the summary of what's happening
your source sizes right here in 1920 by
1080 and our output size is right here
1920 by 1080 so those were different
then you would select the use maximum
render quality use previews is something
I use simply because I do preview my
videos and when you preview them Adobe
will create a preview file which has all
of the effects and things that you have
put in there pre-rendered if you watched
it
if you didn't watch your video and you
just went along and edited and at the
end you just trust it everything was
good and you hit you know export and you
let it go that it won't do anything
because you have no preview files
anywhere in your folder format for the
project so if you do watch your video
and you prove it and you can tell right
here I've got this red line because I
watch my video and this red line
basically is the pre-rendered video file
then you can click use previews and it
will record and render much much faster
use frame blending this is something you
want to use if you have a lot of
choppiness inside of your video
let's I've tried to think of an example
where you'd have a really choppy video
maybe maybe you're recording at 30fps
and you've got a lot of camera movement
and it looks kind of choppy as your trip
movies as you're moving really really
fast you know motion blur doesn't really
kick in and video cameras as much
especially with DSLRs so let's say you
have a lot of jerkiness in your video
because it's very choppy then you can
click use frame blending and it will try
and smooth that out import into a
project that's not something I use
that's if you're using multiple Adobe
stuffs but you can see anything you do
here to make changes to is going to
change the output file size so our goal
here is to get the best quality video
you can for the smallest file size and
basically I like I said I leave this to
about anywhere between ten or fourteen
depending on the video and then I never
let that go above sixteen YouTube is
going to compress the out of it
anyway obviously if you're making stuff
for you to watch on your own you know
TVs and stuff and not necessarily
YouTube then you can make this
high-quality as you want because then
you'll be doing video playback and you
won't be actually uploading it or
streaming it or anything like that but I
hope this video has helped you guys and
it was probably a little bit longer but
I wanted an in-depth explanation of what
these settings are to help you get the
absolute best video quality that you
possibly can make sure you guys also go
check out video blocks don't forget 50%
off right now at the time of this video
link is in the description go and check
it out 49 bucks for a year that is a
stupidly smart value if you guys are
looking for stock footage and templates
and things like that anyway time you got
out of here guys thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
