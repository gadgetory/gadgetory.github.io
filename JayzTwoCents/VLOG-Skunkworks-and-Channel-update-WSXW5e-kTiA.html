and I figured since my office is a
complete and utter disaster
and it does not video ready for me to do
any sort of presentation for you guys if
I were to go ahead and do what is kind
of the easy slash lazy route is I'm
gonna go ahead and give you guys a vlog
yep I'm gonna be that guy whether you're
looking for a pump reservoir custom GPU
block or a complete loop in a box
ALPA cools wide range of products can
make your next water cooling adventure
an easy one click the link in the
description for more details okay so
this vlog isn't me specifically kind of
like a starter prequel video to what's
going to be the skunkworks update which
I've been talking about for a while so
there's the loop right there or the
system you can see that it's turning
more and more orange and I want to
address something real quick a lot of
people said well Jay you shouldn't be
using tygon tubing with your with your
pastel that's why it's turning that
color that's my fault because I forgot
to update the PC part picker with this
where I removed but tygon which I had in
here before and ended up going with the
Primo chill LRT tubing so which is not a
tygon base tube so it's it's still
changing colors due to other things and
it's happening to a lot of people so
that's why I am changing the fluids but
what I wanted to do today was one and
show you just how freakin messy this off
I know this doesn't look like a big mess
to a lot of people I know it doesn't but
to me it is I don't like clutter and
it's driving me nuts
but anyway what I'm gonna do today is
I'm gonna show you guys some of the
parts that I've chosen we are changing a
few things in the system again no I'm
not going with four-way SLI I've thought
about it I really really thought about
it but now I'm not gonna do that so
anyway let's look at the parts then I'm
gonna be putting in here so the parts
that started to arrive and nevermind
that right there that is a mini ITX
stuff that I'm kind of working on for
someone else but these are just some of
the parts that have arrived already you
see I've got five liters of the primo
chill PC cure which is a I'm gonna try
this stuff out it's clear as you can see
we're gonna be doing some mixing
do that today we'll mix in some orange
Mayhem's dye and we'll see how the color
turns I'm one of those bottles it's one
of the reasons why I have so much I can
pour some of it out until like a water
bottle put in some drops and see how it
reacts to it we got a few more EK water
blocks here gigabyte x99 SOC champion
motherboard and i I tweeted out that
this motherboard might not work for me
because of the way that the pci-e
configuration is we're basically the way
this board works and let me take this
out real quick for you guys okay so here
it is right here as you can see
obviously I won't with this board
because of the orange theme it's also a
fantastic overclocking motherboard it's
got the features I wanted corrects a
couple of things that I didn't like
about the EVGA classified x99 still
probably the most solid motherboard you
can buy for x99 platform but I had a
couple things I didn't like
for instance as you can see right there
that 90 degree
u cable right there it puts a lot of
stress on that plug with the way it's
laid out in the case lapse case you
can't really tell but it is being pushed
up against that wall really hard the
other thing is the way that the USB 3.0
is down there kind of comes off as a
funky Bend because it points straight
down and straight straight up it's it's
pointing to where's my fingers pointing
down that way instead of like coming at
you so it's gonna correct some of that
but one of the things to mention with
this board and why I said on Twitter I
probably wouldn't be able to use it but
there gigabyte team did get back to me
once the way that this is configured is
it's PCI Express 1 which is direct
connect to the CPU socket PCI Express 4
to 3 so the reason why they do that is 1
&amp;amp; 2 is spaced out like this so if you
have standard air cooling cards and you
have plenty of air gap in here so that
you have good airflow for your cards so
they actually include two 3-way SLI
bridges with this motherboard and the
reason why they do that is one is for
the 5820k and the way it's allocated
with PCI Express Lanes
and then one is for 59 30 km 59 60 X and
so if I was to do one up here and then
down here down here with that gap that
would look really stupid with the water
cooling it wouldn't like look nice and
evenly gapped like that is it would look
terrible with this big gap here now in
the manual it says if I was to do the
top three that it would do 16 X 8 X 4 X
and I'm going back that's not gonna work
at all so I contacted gigabyte someone
on Twitter I actually told me
well no J actually should go 8 X 8 X 16
X the manual that I have doesn't say
that I read it multiple times but I did
ask gigabytes a technical team that did
say it will go 8 8 6 so you were correct
Sarah shout out to you good call on that
and so I might lose a couple of percent
of you know benchmarking performance by
going 816 rather than having 16 PCIe 3
on the native pci express lane to the
cpu but that's not a big deal this
system is more about kind of show and
just being really over the top and it is
about breaking any records or any of
them and going for record breaking so
doesn't matter but it's got the headers
that I want in the positions that I want
them to be in and so the other thing
that this motherboard had going for it
is that we have a water block for it so
I am gonna be including the South Bridge
well actually the chipset not South
Bridge smell a long time svet a South
Bridge a North Ridge stuff going on here
the chipset and the vrm the VR ends are
going to be cooled on this motherboard
now one of the things some people have
said was you all J it it only has 4
memory slots well that's okay I never
run 8 channels because or any channels
but 8 DIMM is because when you're
overclocking the more dims you add puts
more stress on the memory controllers
and it can actually reduce your maxover
clocks and your memory speeds so having
4 is why gigabyte did this it's actually
better for stable overclocking and that
is what the SOC is meant for as you can
see here I do also have it it's a pretty
close match if you ask me look at the
color on that that's a really close
match these are special tops here for
the RAM as you may have seen is already
in this
right there I've already played that in
playing around some of the overclocking
on the RAM of corsair dominator Platinum
32 gigabytes of it 3000 megahertz Ram so
that's going in there but I mean putting
these orange tops on there so they are
going to also have some orange going on
yep
taking the orange theme very serious EK
supremacy Evo block the reason for this
as it's gonna look identical to that one
it's that one is not an Evo it it's not
actually it doesn't have the the ideal
channeling in there for x99 and because
that block has been around for a while
and this has been out for a while the
upgrade kit wasn't available so I just
performance pcs sent me over a new block
by the way all this stuff that you see
here - the motherboard was sent by
performance pcs so huge shout out to
them they'll be getting quite a few
shoutouts in this series there's
probably gonna be several videos here
yeah they've made that possible a few
more fittings here to make sure that I
have plenty of the revolver fittings
here from prima chill for the rigid
tubing that way I can make sure when I
put them on the motherboard and stuff
they've got plenty I don't want to run
out rather have more fittings than not
enough and then we've got some more
fresh soft tubing now J makes mistakes
and it's you know I do videos about how
to choose your tubing and stuff when I
accidentally didn't pay attention Royals
ordering as you can see right there I
ordered thin wall tubing and my
compressions will not work with this
because I need thick wall tubing so K
I've got to get more tubing but I can
turn this stuff into like a drain hose
or fill hose or whatever I don't like
the thin wall stuff because as you can
see it kinks like really easy I mean if
you don't have to put much of a bend on
this stuff to get it to ticking do you
see that it's the kinks really easy so
that's why I don't like thin wall let's
see what else we have here oh we got
some more this is pH EG crystal link
tubing the tubes that i have in between
the graphics cards right there that's
acrylic its bits power acrylic very very
thin ten by twelve millimeter so you
can't bend that or anything but I also
don't want there to be any chances of
cracking it's been reused on every build
so I don't want to reuse that tubing
anymore I have got PE T G here and then
this is also just 1212 sticks of three
foot or 36 inch PE TP tubing so that I
can redo any bends I'm not certain that
the sockets going to be in the same
position on this motherboard here as it
is there so as a chance may have to redo
that bend again and then obviously this
Ben isn't gonna work because I'm doing
the motherboard block so I'm gonna have
a lot of tubing going on right there now
but anyway let's do this now let's let's
open up one of these Remo chill PC pure
performance fluids and let's go ahead
and pour some of it into like a water
bottle and get my phone to stop ringing
and we've they're calling me to tell me
that my car is ready my 350z was getting
some getting some maintenance done but
anyway
yeah let's pour some of that into a
water bottle and then we will see how
that how the dye actually mixes see what
how what it takes to make it kind of
match this orange and also to the only
thing I'm waiting on start the build
here is cables which sanctum is hooking
me up with and they're making them as we
speak should have in my next week and
then I probably will end up reusing
these fans again repainting these rings
a matched orange so I guess we'll go
from there alright I mean yeah I'm gonna
get a water bottle I'll BRB so I just
went and drank me a refreshing bottle of
water to be nice and healthy but here's
the primo chill clear they call it their
performance fluid PC pure so it's clear
it looks slightly cloudy but that's
because of the bottle it's got their
corrosive inhibitors in there anti
growth inhibitors but it's it's very
pure fluid and I kind of want the fluid
to look like orange Gatorade if you will
like I'm I'm kind of over the pastel you
know I can't see through it kind of
thing I do like the shininess that clear
shows but anyway I'm go ahead and pour
some of this in here and then we'll do
some of the orange
even though the lid it looks like yellow
it's just the way the cameras picking it
up one of the dots is much more orange
than the other but they are the same at
least according to the labels they're
all the same
this one just just looks like a little
bit newer bottle so no I guess we'll see
hopefully these are all the same I
better make sure I use the same bottle
for all of it
well it doesn't look like it reacted
weird at all obviously when I shook it
it aerated it up a little bit but that's
kind of the color I'm going for so it
kind of looks like orange Gatorade since
it doesn't seem like anything weird is
happening I guess I go ahead and pour
this back into that bottle we'll put
some more drops in there and see how it
does
well yeah I'm liking that color though I
mean it's a little bit darker than that
made the tops are for the RAM but that's
okay because we got some you know plenty
of orange going on here that's kind of
neat looking I like that that's actually
air those are air bubbles they look like
floaties like you know backwash but
there's not that's kind of weird I think
it's pretty good I think that's what
we're gonna do you're gonna use it like
that not too orange but not too clear
like not too light either it's just
right in my opinion I like that that
looks good
let's put the RAM tops over there yeah
see that's all you gotta do I mean if
you guys want custom color you know what
the rack your brain trying to find
someone selling the color you want you
just make the color you want and if they
don't sell the dye you want dyes
especially in clear fluid you can mix
them just like paint and get the color
that you want looks sweet I like it like
I said you don't need to go crazy trying
to find someone who makes the color
fluid you want just make it yourself
absolutely but anyway the build will
probably be starting next week
trust me I want to get started now and
get it done with because I'm tired of
looking at that I really really am
closed I'm really tired of looking at
that and and I even have to be creative
in my videos to make sure it doesn't
even get like in shot that wait like
that or something because I'm so tired
of the comments of oh my god I did your
fluid changing color again when I
already made a video about it also -
there's something else I did over the
Thanksgiving weekend and I'll kind of
give you guys a sneak peek at that real
quick I'll just kind of do that at the
end of the video here and like the end
slate but before I do that I just want
to say thanks guys for all of your
support I didn't get a chance put up
Thanksgiving video I took some
much-needed history oh sorry
EDD I took so much needed time away from
gaming and from computers and from
YouTube and even social media I just had
to completely like unplug for the most
part
still responding to some things but I've
just I needed a break
I love you guys but I needed a break
it's like it's not it's not you it's me
I swear it's not you it's me work it
that worked work good now we're past it
yeah this is just this is a very tiring
time of year that's why this office is
such a disaster with everything messy
everywhere because of the fact that
everyone everyone especially this time
of year everyone wants their videos
every wants their videos and they want
it now they want their products they
want everyone to go buy their products
and stuff and they want me to like show
you guys hey check this is what's new do
a video do video I am one person I'm one
person with a release schedule that's
manageable for one person yeah I could
do daily uploads but then the video
quality quality would suffer more than
they already do and I would completely
burnout burnout is already a realistic
thing that I'm facing and I'm doing the
best I can to manage that but I think
everyone who does this for a living
obviously faces burnout I mean I know
even guys like lionesses face burnout
but when you go at a constant pace it's
important to find outlet so that's why
lately I've been golfing again even went
back to take golf lessons because it
I've golf for 25 years
yeah 25 years but my golf swing stuff
went to you know I just lost a lot
of the fundamentals so I got that dialed
back in now I'm enjoying the game again
you guys know I had the 350z it's taking
up a lot of my attention away from the
office
you guys follow on social media you
noticed I put up a post saying I'm
selling the 350z because I well you guys
will see it at the end of the video
anyway just make sure you stay tuned at
the end but anyway yeah things are good
with the channel in fact things are
almost too good and that's part of the
problem is it's like I can't handle
everything everybody wants which
inevitably means that some companies get
left out and then they get their
feelings hurt and then they want to hold
it against me and it's just sex and then
on top of that it's like okay you deal
with fallout from the audience because
you try and put food on your family's
plate you know you try and keep a roof
over your head as best you can and at
the same time live you know it's people
people like to be judgmental and say oh
my god Jay why are you buying a sports
car you know you if you do
running all these dad's you know then
you could afford your sports car but
it's not about that I'm still a person
with hobbies and it's my business what I
do with my money on a personal level so
that's what I'm dealing with and that's
why now that we're coming to the end of
the year every year I had like a sort of
like a really a resolution but like a
year of because I make sure I call it a
year of for the fact that if you call it
a resolution those who fail a lot of
people's resolutions fail so that's why
2014 was the get out of debt year where
I got got completely out of credit card
debt got out of IRS debt got out of
medical bills debt every single debt you
can imagine I had my wife and I had 11
credit cards all of that is gone paid
off completely debt-free except for you
know car payment but you guys can learn
more about that my blog channel it's
Jay's says Jay why is it ESA why yes you
guys can go over there I've got lots of
blogs about that stuff if you want to
know more about it 2015 was my get into
you know get into shape better you're
healthier I think I've done that too
2016 is more I feel like the year of
expansion where the channel has to
expand in some way but it needs to
expand in an organic way where it's not
gonna feel like the the foundation that
I built my channel on is gonna change
because I don't want to change that I
like this off the cuff video style where
it's like you guys are just in here with
me hanging out while we do this thing
and I think a lot of you like that too
or if I turn to corporate or to too big
if you will in the production style and
all of that that I think that may
although it may help the channel grow I
think it would create a disconnect at
the same time between you guys and me
and I enjoy this connection that we have
we have we have a beautiful thing we're
totally on fleek but anyway guys I just
thought I would do a vlog today it's
been a while since I've I've logged and
talked to you guys it's just mano-a-mano
anyway I am gonna go ahead and hop on
out of here make sure you guys check the
insulate and you guys will see what my
new hobby has been all about and we'll
be doing a video on that I promise
anyway guys thanks for listening to me
babble and just show you some of the
stuff coming up on the channel also to
huge giveaway happening with no youtuber
I'm doing this week and then a little
bit later this month around
Christmastime I am giving away a
complete computer system monitor key
mouse complete system totally built
ready for gaming just wait for that news
anyway guys that's my way of saying
thank you to you don't make sure you
stay subscribe so you don't miss that
unless you don't want a computer and you
can get something going now see you
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
