completely and utterly failed in my last
water-cooling video because I
accidentally I still don't know how I
did it I could have swore I edited it
the entire segment about pumps and
reservoirs so anyway we're gonna go
ahead and talk about it again although
first time for you guys
second time for me doesn't get any
easier guys I swear have you been
putting off water cooling your computer
because you're afraid that you're a
klutz and you're just gonna screw it up
well that's okay because Ek water blocks
is launching its brand new line of
predator water cooling loops that
feature the exact same components that
you would find and standalone
custom-built loops already put together
for you okay so water pumps for your
computer are no different than any other
water pump on any system on the face of
the planet it's nothing more than a
device to move body a body of water
through a system doesn't matter if it's
a car or an aquarium or a pool they all
work pretty much identical where the
impeller is going to move and water is
going to flow that's all there is to it
now water cooling pumps over the years
have been pretty much nothing more than
adapted industrial solutions to work in
our pcs now companies like Lange have
made the famous D 5 and D DC pumps and
at the risk of sounding like a fanboy
those are the only two pumps I
personally recommend period they're the
only pumps that I use in my systems as
long as your budget can afford it
because they're not really very cheap
but they are quite literally the best
that you can get now you might be
sitting there at your screen going Jay
you're so full of you just said you
only use laying D 5s and DD C's but
you've used Swift tech and you've used
AB cool you've used D K water blocks
well you just hold your horses there
because Lang is the odium for those
brands or those brands buy the pumps
from Lang and they put their sticker on
it and then they come up with their own
pump top solutions that way they work in
your PC's because the pump itself it's
still no different than I need to stop
my chair from rocking back here I'm
going to like fall back in the middle
this video there's still nothing more
than industrial pumps for being used in
your PC so it was these PC manufacturers
like XS PC and UK water blocks and
a swift tech alpha cool it have all come
up with their own pump tops to make them
work in your pcs now pump top is nothing
more than something that attaches to the
pump so that you can attach fittings to
it and mount the pump that's all a pump
top is now usually this is a this is an
alpha cool d5 pump top here with
multiple fittings on here for a couple
inlets a couple outlets depending on
depend you know how you're going to
mount it in your system this is a very
common one that you're going to find
it's kind of a plastic plain square this
is made out of acetal which is a type of
plastic it's very durable very
lightweight and easy to manufacture so
that's why you find a lot of these
acetal materials you're going to find
other types of materials though just
like how EK water block does use plexi
on some of their you know cpu tops
you're going to find you know materials
like that that are used just like on
this water block here we've got for this
980ti this is a plexi top so you will
find pump tops in both acetal palm and
plexi now let's go ahead and start with
the d5 pump because that's my personal
favorite the d5 pump moves a lot of
fluid and I mean a lot and there's two
specs when it comes to shopping for a
water pump that you need to understand
the first fecking liters per hour now
that's pretty self-explanatory it means
at full speed full operating speed for
that pump it can move X amount of liters
in one hour timeframe now more liters
per hour sounds like a very good thing
but just like fans airflow and head
pressure in the case of pumps works just
like static pressure in the case of fans
we're having more flow does not equate
to better pressure so if you have a lot
of resistance in your loop and you don't
have a pump that's good a nice powerful
head pressure then you're going to have
a lot of drop-off the more resistance
you in introduce into your system you
know over here we have skunkworks
and we've got two loops going on there
and the reason why I mentioning head
pressure is because there's something
you need to understand with that where
even though the d5 is a high flowing
pump it does not it is not the best pump
when it comes to overcoming a lot of
resistance
now radiators themselves are not
inherently very resistant in fact the
amount of rows that are in a radiator
usually equate
race to a very similar amount of volume
that you would find inside the inner
diameter of your tube especially if you
have like hard piping like I have so
radiators for the most part don't add a
lot of resistance what adds resistance
is like we just looked at
you've got your block here as you can
see here you've got an inlet and an
outlet and it's got to make a very sharp
90-degree turn go through a lot of
resistance in here different fins and
channeling to touch certain parts of the
die and then it's got to make a
90-degree outlet so it's got a lot of
turns it has to make right there same
thing happens here with the GPU block
it's got to come in make a very sharp
turn through a very small opening it's
got to come here through all these fins
inside the die cooler here the right on
top of the GPU die and it's got to make
another 90 and it's going to come here
make another 90 out every time your
fittings go into a radiator it makes it
90 into the radiator another 90 and a
180 at the other side of the radiator
and another sharp 90 coming out so what
adds the resistance is these blocks and
these sharp 90-degree bends in the
fittings and the different parts that
add this resistance now most of the time
fittings are going to be channelled in
such a way that they're smooth because
if they were just like 90 degrees
literally like this then that adds a ton
of resistance for the ax for the water
flow now as I started to mention a
second ago I have two loops going on
inside skunkworks I've got a CPU loop
which is one radiator at the top one CPU
block and then the reservoir and pump
combo and then the hard piping for the
CPU block the CPU loop I can run at the
lowest setting and have no difference in
temperature whatsoever because there's
plenty of water flow but the other loop
which is an identical pump identical
reservoir mounting unit for it and
identical reservoir is running two
radiators a five hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator plus a 280
millimeter radiator plus a lot of
90-degree bends down the underneath here
where the side rad is and then we've got
three GPU blocks that are all making
very sharp bends I've actually got to
run that pump near full speed and it
moves water slower then the CPU pump
does at the lowest speed so as you can
see the d5 although a lot of water flow
does not have
the greatest amount of head pressure I
you guys can correct me but I do believe
it's about 13 feet of head pressure
which means it can move water 13 feet up
before gravity overcomes the pump and
then the pump can't move the fluid any
farther
now the didi state pump is much smaller
it's much more compact but it also spins
it a lot higher RPM and because it's a
smaller impeller the higher RPM does not
necessarily equate equate to more litres
per hour but it does equate to very good
head pressure so people have used DDC
pumps and even used pump tops that allow
you to hook to DDC pumps into a single
loop have overcome systems much more
restrictive than mine and have no
problems doing it whatsoever but the
downside to a DDC is that they get very
very hot so that's why you see that this
unit I have put together here which is a
reservoir combo with a DDC top from bits
power in an ek heatsink on here the
heatsink is needed to keep things nice
and cool because that's one of the major
differences between a D 5 in a DD C
where a D 5 is actually being cooled by
the fluid running through it the heat is
transferred to the impeller and then the
coolant that's moving through it takes
that heat and travels you know takes it
away into the radiator so it's one of
the downsides with the D 5 is it can add
heat into your loop but as long as you
have plenty of cooling it won't matter
the D DC is going to get very toasty and
relies on heat sink and air cooling to
keep it nice and cool
I pretty much all water blocks on the
market today come with things that you
would find specific to PC like PWM or
pulse width modulation where the CPU
load is going to control the speed of
the pump rpm sensing wire so that you
can hook it up to your CPU fan header
and not have to worry about your BIOS
thinking there's no fan hooked up and
then giving you a warning at startup
thinking that there's no fan that your
computer is going to cook itself to
death so you don't have to disable that
setting because at the same time you
would want to know if your pump isn't
working and if you hook the RPM wire up
to your CPU header and the pump stops
spinning for some reason because it goes
bad then the CPU can warn you and you
know something went wrong rather than
just disabling it and blindly having to
wonder why your CPU shut down or your
computer shut down because the computer
overheated obviously both of these pumps
have reservoir combo units available on
the market now they're not cheap in fact
the price of the pump with the combo
unit and everything can run you over 200
250 bucks it's not cheap whatsoever but
it's certainly a nice option if space is
you know very important now as you can
see skunkworks has two of them going on
in there for the D 5 those are ek
options and then over here I have a bits
power option for the D DC which is
running a bits power reservoir with the
bits power reservoir top that mounts on
to this is actually ek heat sink that
has the pump in there so you screw
everything together through these bolts
on the bottom and this is what you get a
single unit that you can mount
horizontally or vertically into your
system doesn't take as many fittings and
it's it's much more compact it just
looks really really cool
now speaking of reservoirs cylindrical
reservoirs are very very common they
look cool they're easy to place you can
run them both vertically or horizontally
as long as they have multiple fitting
options here like you can see from this
ek res x3 if you can put it on its side
if you have fittings down on the bottom
as long as the fittings are underneath
the water level then you can run it
horizontally and do some cool stuff but
you could reserve wires are something
that we didn't always have back in the
past so that's why in the previous video
I called it optional because what we
used to do was cut the tube at the top
put a tee fitting in there run another
piece of tubing off of that put a brass
plug at the end of it and when we wanted
to fill our system or drain or system
we'd remove the plug and use us like a
rib it's not really a syringe it's like
a fluid syringe where we could stick it
in the tube and then slowly pump up our
systems using that syringe to fill it
full of fluid it just it took a long
time it didn't have a lot of place for
air to go so that you could bleed your
system which is what makes these
reservoirs really really nice because
you get tons of fluid in here it makes
filling and priming your system
extremely easy because of the fact that
when you turn on the pump it's got a
huge supply of fluid to pull into the
system and push up into your tubing and
into your reservoir or into your
radiators and your blocks and then once
it empties you stop it fill it back up
and do it again you guys have seen me do
that in videos it makes it a lot easier
the bigger the res the easier it is the
reservoir has nothing to do with your
cooling capacity whatsoever you could
have an entire gallon of fluid and it's
not going to run any cooler than if you
had no extra fluid than what the
capacity of your components can hold
because the fluid will just continue to
heat up over time until it gets to the
maximum operating temperature of your
system so don't think that reservoirs
are big reservoirs are going to give you
any better cooling capacity because it's
not period end of discussion
it won't happen but does make it easier
to fill and drain because if you had
this sitting in here and you didn't have
any tubing coming in the top like I do
on one of my loops on skunkworks you can
just undo this entire cap and you have
this giant opening here to put a funnel
in or put another tube in and use that
to pour your fluid in there
you're not spilling everywhere you've
got lots and lots of room to work with
so that's what makes this really nice
now sometimes you might need to use a
reservoir in a very small system because
you might have to use like a five and a
quarter Bay type of reservoir I'm not a
fan of five and a quarter Bay reservoirs
especially the single slot ones because
they tend to be a lot harder to fill and
and bleed your system and fill your
system because there's only like an inch
worth of actual fluid level in there
that can drain really fast into your
pump so you find yourself constantly
flipping on the pump and it drains and
then turn it off and fill it and it just
becomes tedious to fill your system but
it's an option if it's the only option
you have and a smaller system where a
bear bait reservoir is the only thing
that you can get to fit in there but
ultimately my recommendation would be
something like this if you can fit it
and your budget can afford it like I
said these aren't cheap so there you go
guys my video that I unfortunately
screwed up on but maybe it was a good
thing because I got to now talk more
about pumps and reservoirs and I would
have been the other video where we got
to go deeper so it might make sense to
pick each one of these and even do like
another 15 minute video about GPU blocks
specifically about you know how the
different designs work and what
materials and maybe I don't know just I
love talking about this left water
cooling is fun to me and if it's fun to
you then make sure you share this video
with someone that you think it will help
I hope you guys have enjoyed today's
video hope it's helped just the ultimate
goal between these beginners buying guy
buyer guide videos where it's it hurts
and it sucks to buy something and you're
excited about it but then you got the
wrong thing because you simply didn't
understand and then it costs you money
in return
being in time and they just get upset
before you even get started and then
that can lead to disaster so the whole
point in these videos it's not about
views it's not about subscribers it's
simply about helping you guys do what it
is or help you get to know what it is
you need to know to do it right the
first time because then you can enjoy it
I enjoy this stuff I've enjoyed it for
years and I will enjoy it for years to
come I want you guys to enjoy it too so
what set with that said I'm going to get
the heck on out of here
I'm gonna go play some Forza 6 I love
Forza 6 I love cars if you guys couldn't
tell you got to see my Instagram my
Twitter it's always me uh so as me
showing pictures and talking about my my
old Nissan 350z that's old and ratalie
and dammit I love that car and it's mine
and it's paid for that in itself makes
it valuable to me alright I'm gonna get
out of here guys as always thanks for
watching and we will see you in the next
