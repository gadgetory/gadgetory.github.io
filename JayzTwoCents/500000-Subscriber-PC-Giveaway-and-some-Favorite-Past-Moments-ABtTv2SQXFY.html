cannot believe that this has actually
happened the channel has reached 500,000
subscribers I quite honestly never
expected this to happen so as I've been
teasing and poking and just completely
flaunting this giveaway coming up it's
finally time I'm gonna give away the
single biggest thing both physically in
both in price that I had ever done on
this channel but before we do that let's
take a look at some of my favorite
moments along the way and I mean who who
would have thought that on August 26
2012 that I started something that was
going it to prove that it would have
never worked that we have reached
500,000 subscribers anyway here's some
of my favorite moments that I have it's
really hard to choose my favorite
moments you guys have made this just an
incredible journey so far and the
journeys clearly not over because we are
on the road to 1 million and we will get
there we will get that gold button but
for now the silver 100,000 play button
stays up there true my my remind me just
how awesome you guys are and that's why
we're doing this giveaway today but
let's go ahead take a look at some of my
favorite moments from the last three and
a half years or not even quite three and
a half years yet and then we'll get down
to brass tacks I want to welcome you to
my new channel formerly JS VFX now Jay
is two cents and the reason for the
change is i discovered i have so much
more that I can actually offer the
YouTube community when it comes to my
technology knowledge my personal career
in my life path and the things I know
are so much greater than a video effects
I wanted to make a change I wanted to
kind of reclassify myself in the
community here as somebody who you can
come to to get advice technology
opinions and just general reviews when
it comes to anything digital whether
that be cameras or games or consoles
cars doesn't matter bring it to me i can
give you everything you want to know
about it and if i don't know i will find
out and I will give you an unbiased
opinion our next question comes to us
from Pottermore fan he asks what advice
would I give to an inspiring YouTube
gamer well seeing as I'm just starting
out on this YouTube thing myself but it
seems to be growing really fast
I don't know if I'd be the guy you want
advice from but if I had to give you
advice I would say play what it is you
like to play because if you like to play
it chances are someone else does
somewhere else and you're just gonna
have to you know grind at it and keep
making videos make them funny make them
entertaining and eventually your
audience will come but the most
important thing is you got to be able to
interact with your audience you've got
to make them feel like they're a part of
the video and you've got to engage them
so do something in your video that gets
them to respond to you whether that be
through Twitter or comments or whatever
it is above all make sure that you're
having fun because if you're having fun
your audience to tell they're having fun
and they'll keep coming back and they'll
hit that subscribe button where'd that

just right there day so I'm
 know about I tweeted you i
retweeted you yes you did cuz you're my
friend you you
seriously seriously have you see you
guys have allowed me to take my hobby
and turn it into a career although I was
already working in IT so you like me to
take my career and make a different
career out of my career but this is much
much better than I could have ever hoped
for so you guys definitely deserve this
now let's talk about some rules here
real quick obviously i'm giving away a
fully built gaming tower an AMD theme
gaming tower it's the same one i built
for the battlefront video i have no need
for it it's all brand new stuff and i
figured you guys could definitely enjoy
that but we're also giving away in aoc
144 hurts one millisecond free sync
gaming monitor that's going to work
perfectly with those dual 380 x XFX
graphics cards you're going to get that
444 FPS on there and all of its free
sync buttery glorious glorious is that
really a word at this point I don't
really care but I'm also getting some
brand new peripherals with that in fact
those are to be determined because i
only have used mice and keyboards
hanging around here and I want to get
you guys something brand-new to go with
all the other brand new stuff that
you're getting so we are going to
determine that at a later time but
you're getting a tower and you're
getting a monitor and you're getting a
keyboard educating a mouse and if I can
swing it maybe even a headset but don't
get greedy now unfortunately guys this
is the part where everyone's going to
grumble but this is going to be a
domestic us a giveaway only and before
the fruit starts flying my way guys I
can't help it I can't help that the
import taxes in the VAT fees and all
that stuff are so expensive not to
mention the shipping shipping of a
system like this I've already priced it
out would cost me about five hundred
dollars depending on what part of Europe
it goes to Australia even more sorry
guys this also with the import taxes you
would end up paying as much as the
system is worth to receive it and
remember this isn't just one big box its
box for the tower it's also a box for
the monitor and the peripherals it's
expensive to ship I'm sorry guys but
this is this is coming out of my own
pocket and I can't really do that not to
mention it would then be coming out of
your pocket because it would be very
expensive to receive so we'll try to do
something here specifically for you guys
I know Europe is always feeling like
they're getting the short end of the
stick I can't help that it is the way it
is unfortunately too
eh that's the way it is but anyway if
you look in the description you're going
to see a link to gleam i'm using gleam

winner quite honestly and there's other
