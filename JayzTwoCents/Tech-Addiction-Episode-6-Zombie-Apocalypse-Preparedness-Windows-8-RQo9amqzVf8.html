knows okay so windows 8 lunch this week
hmm I've been looking at it a little bit
not sure if I'm going to use it yet or
I'm gonna jump right on it but since
Tuesday 4 million people have already
jumped onto the windows 8 bandwagon and
Microsoft corporate chief executive
Steve Ballmer has already said that four
million copies have already been sold
this week when does a is supposed to
make some very large leaps forward over
windows 7 and the older encoding
platform where it now uses a lot less
system resources and it's supposed to
really bump up your gaming and is
supposed to improve your experiences
when it comes to multimedia games web
browsing so if you use Windows 8 let's
hear how well it works for you does it
actually give you a gaming increase I'd
like to know I never personally jump
right into a brand new operating system
until at least first service pack is out
so it'll be a few months before I jump
on the windows 8 bandwagon so apples
being sued again this time they're being
sued oh wait a minute not Apple oh my
god somebody's being sued now that's not
Apple it's amazing so windows or
Microsoft is being sued over the windows
8 Live Tiles found in both its Windows 8
operating system and the windows phone 8
a company by the name of surf cast is
claiming to fail in the patent to the
live tile feature with the live updating
tiles that you can pin to either a
desktop or a cell phone desktop and they
are saying that Microsoft is willingly
infringing upon that patent not only by
directly infringing on it by putting it
on its phone and it's Windows desktop
but also by encouraging app makers to
develop Windows Live Tiles for their
phones and their apps so they're
claiming that Microsoft is booked
directly and indirectly promoting
infringement on their patent so I guess
we'll see where that goes but it's like
Apple gets a little bit of a break from
being sued so how many of you use space
book i use facebook I'm sure you do so a
lot of people really didn't like
Facebook's timeline and they put off and
put off and put off upgrading and
finally there was a mandatory upgrade
where if you hadn't upgraded yet to the
new timeline it was pushed upon you well
guess what Facebook has made changes to
that timeline and now they are testing
it so if you're just now getting used to
timeline the way it is well guess what
it's about to change again and nobody's
really seen what these changes are yet
facebook is being very secretive about
it I don't really mind timeline but I
don't get on facebook all that much so
it didn't take long for me to get used
to it I don't live on Facebook I live on
youtube and I know the feeling where
every time YouTube changes the layouts
it's like oh my god I gotta come up with
a new background blah blah blah I guess
I can understand the pain when it comes
to Mark Zuckerberg suckling on the
timeline teat he really gets off on it
all right so how many of you use
limewire in the past how many of you use
frostwire now the Pirate Bay megaupload
well if your isp is verizon Comcast Time
Warner 18t or cablevision you just might
see some warnings coming your way in the
next couple of months you see these ISPs
are really trying to crack down on
illegal downloads of programs torrents
with music and movies and all sorts of
other illegal downloads pornography
stuff that's normally controlled that
you have to pay for is now being
monitored by an algorithm that is
designed by a third party and these ISPs
are buying this and what they're going
to do is they're going to send you a
warning that says hey you're not
downloading this legally so here's the
link to go and download legally whatever
it is you're downloading so the
algorithm is supposed to be able to tell
what it is you're downloading now
they're not going to actually sue you or
at least the ISP is not but what they're
going to do is if you continue to
infringe and you continue to illegally
download through torrents and other
websites and you know peer-to-peer
programs they're going to take your
information in your IP and your address
and your account everything about you
and they're going to send it off to the
people who own the copyrights to the
items that you're downloading
so if you're really into illegal
downloading I think just like the days
of Napster as a whole it's going to be
coming to an end because of advancements
in technology now I'm sure that the
hackers and the cracks are going to
evolve just like the ISPs are but what
good is it do for you to download things
if your ISP shuts you down because that
may be the next step it's all part of
the cyber age and the US government is
actually really some of the cyber
protection acts for this very reason so
the organization one laptop per child
it's actually the name of it one laptop
per child it's an organization will they
really push to get technology into the
hands of children as learning aids has
teamed up with a group of researchers
from MIT and that's the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology if you're not
aware and what they've done is they've
gone to a couple of remote villages in
Ethiopia interestingly enough my
analytics say some of you or any Theo
Pia and what they've done is they've
gone to some of the most rural and most
disconnected villages from the modern
world what that means is we're talking
villages where the children can't read
can't write have never seen or been
exposed to modern writing or books
they're completely illiterate when it
comes to the modern world and the only
things that they know are some of the
natural human instincts that they are
currently living in in their villages in
Ethiopia so what this group is done is
they've taken a few dozen Motorola Xoom
tablets put them in a box and stuck it
in the middle of their village and what
they're doing now is there observing to
see what these societies that have never
ever seen or touched technology and see
how they react to and how they evolve
and what they're hoping is that the
children of these villages will be able
to take the tablets and start to self
learn and self discover modern
technology and so what they do is every
single week they go and they take out
the SD cards they put in a new SD card
and they have monitoring system loaded
on these cards and what they can do is
they can see everything that's happening
with that tablet and it's actually
pretty amazing it's kind of like what my
daughter does with an ipad I tell you
she knows more than I do the researchers
admitted that they expected them to play
with the box
and not the tablet because they have
would have no idea what these tablets
are you know kind of like you would see
an infant or a baby playing with the box
and not where the caring about what's
inside the box that sort of thing well
their very first report indicates that
one the children did in fact open the
boxes take out the tablets learn how to
turn them on on their first visit back
these kids were reciting the alphabet
singing songs in English and writing
words that correspond it to images for
instance they showed one of these child
a picture of a lion and the kid wrote
lion on one of the draw apps this is
really interesting story this one I'm
going to link down in the description
because I want you to follow it I think
it's really cool about how it goes to
show how kids today are truly programmed
with modern science and technology in
their minds whether they've never seen
it or they've ever touched it otherwise
how in two months could they have
already taught themselves how to read
quite a few words the alphabet songs and
how to use this piece of technology that
just had never ever existed to them kind
of want to go to Ethiopia now they're
giving away free zoo so if you like high
depth like I do and you put some money
into your TV in your home like I did you
have a nice surround sound system you
want it to look sharp and clear right
bigger is better right well depending on
your situation bigger is better I
wouldn't go there LG this week has
unveiled its 84 inch ultra HD ultra slim
flat panel TV at a whopping 19 thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine US dollars
now why is so expensive there's plenty
of other 84 inch tvs on the market
that's because it is a 2160p it is
doubled the resolution of 1080p that's
really silly because right now there are
no standards above 1080p hell even
directv dish time warner verizon they're
still broadcasting in 1080i which is an
interlaced rather than a program
sooo and they only have a few channels
that are full 1080p HD blu-ray is still
1080p DVD is for a TI y this huge push
oh there's two reasons for that one it
still can take your 1080p and blow it up
without losing too much resolution so
you see the bigger the screen gets the
larger the pixels have to get to fill
that with with 1080 pixels so if you've
got 32 inch wide at 1080p it's going to
look sharper than a 65 inch wide TV at
1080p well in the meantime what they can
do is they can double up or quad up up
those pixels so what that means instead
of one pixel being read you've got a
quadrant or four pixels being read so
you get the same sharpness at a larger
screen and when the standardized
technology moves forward beyond 1080p
the screen is already ready so I spoke
about it at the beginning of this
broadcast and let's just hope I don't
get shut down before I can get out this
message you see on October thirty-first
San Diego in conjunction with the local
US Marines and first responders of fire
departments and paramedics and hospitals
performed the very first joint local and
federal zombie invasion exercise now
this was real by the way this was not
one of those hey let's have a fun little
zombie exercise you see the US
government with all the zombie movies
and zombie shows out lately probably
mostly The Walking Dead have really
gotten them thinking that if this were
to happen what is the best course of
response so what they did was I came up
with an exercise in conjunction with the
local Marines and on an island off the
coast of San Diego they took a VIP in
his detail whatever the detail is I
guess his entourage and it basically
charged the local police and the Marines
with getting them off the island
unscathed from the zombies and they had
hundreds and hundreds of zombies and
they weren't told how the zombies were
going to react they didn't know these
are going to be running a zombies you
know they didn't up these roomie Dawn of
the Dead type zombies so they didn't
know what to expect and if you wanted to
be a zombie in this exercise you had to
pay a thousand dollars just to be a
zombie you know when the CDC last year
put out a emergency preparedness and
include a zombie invasion guide it just
really makes you wonder whether or not
that sort of thing is actually science
fiction or science fact but either way
I'm prepared are you this week's
technology dumbass of the Week is going
to be a little bit different you see
they didn't catch the guy and that's
probably good because I would put his
face right here but if i had to guess as
to what he looks like based on what he
did it would be a little something like
this you see this guy in New Jersey
hailed a cab got in and told the cab
driver to drive to a particular part of
the city and when he got there he
proceeded to point a gun at the cabbie
and ordered him out of the car and he
were gonna carjacked a cabbie okay fine
so the cabbie gets out and he starts
walking away cuz he's told to do the
guys like gets to steppin just bounce so
he does he bounces right he walks away
and Nelson here's hey how do you how do
you get the car to start it is not
running and the cabbies like yeah it is
it's a hybrid and the guy's like a what
it's a hybrid it's running right now and
the guys like no it's not I don't hear
it the cabbies like the car is running
so the guy goes head and gets back in
the car and and the cabbie walks away
and calls police and says hey I just got
carjacked here's where I last saw the
car and the police arrived and guess
what they go back to the place where the
car was hijacked and there it is sitting
right there ignition on electric motor
running and the guys nowhere to be found
you see it turns out the guy had no idea
how to drive a hybrid it's no different
than ending of a car fellow you touch
the gas it goes so yeah this week's
technology dumbass of the Week is the
dumbass who couldn't figure out how to
drive a hybrid maybe he's from Ethiopia
that was incredibly disrespectful Jay
shame on you alright guys that's all I
have for this week I hope you enjoyed
this week's tech addiction it looks like
I got my green screen finally figured
out and it's not going to be all
horrible looking like the last one check
out last week's tech addiction over here
