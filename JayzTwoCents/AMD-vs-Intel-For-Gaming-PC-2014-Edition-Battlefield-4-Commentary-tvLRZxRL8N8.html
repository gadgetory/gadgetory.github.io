bringing you a new and updated version
of Intel versus AMD for gamers and what
to buy if you guys are in the market for
a brand new processor for your gaming PC
or maybe you're just looking to upgrade
now the last time I did this it was 2012
and since then we've had some refreshes
on various CPUs and chips and things so
uh you know it's a my goodness where to
start with this it is a very very
debated topic on which is better for
gamers AMD or Intel and you know what
whether you like AMD or whether you like
Intel I think the bottom line is that
you guys are right both chips are great
at what they do
Intel tends to be a little bit more
expensive and AMD tends to have a bit
more bang for your buck there's no doubt
about that
but when it comes to i7 versus the FX
8350 or something along those lines
you know the only place now I've owned
both of these chips I've owned the FX
8350 overclocked to five point one four
gigs at its highest and stable
benchmarking it at that speed and I'm
currently using a 3770k overclocked to
four point eight gigahertz day-to-day
usage now you guys know I do a lot of
rendering and things when I'm doing this
whole YouTube thing and so I really
pushed these processors to the limit and
sometimes for extended periods of times
of 2025 minutes worth of rendering at
one time and I can tell you right now
one of the most wasted changeovers I
ever made to my PC was switching from
the 8350 to the Intel 3770k now why do I
say that why do I say it's wasted well
when I made the change I paid for
everything out of pocket I mean I did I
wasn't getting product sent to me so I
wasn't talking out of a biased oh well
you know eight Intel's great because it
was free haha no I paid out of pocket to
make that switch and it cost me well to
go with my asrock a
Oh CC 77 formula board yeah that was
over two hundred and 230 bucks and I
paid mmm about three hundred bucks for
my Intel so we were talking well over
five hundred dollars once you take tax
into account and I moved for my 8350
which was my crosshairs formula
crosshair five formula from Asus
Republic of gamers line and the 8350
which was overclocked to five point one
four max and again I ran that at four
point eight day-to-day doing all my
tests and things and all my overclocking
and all of my rendering and gaming and
you know the only place that AMD lost
was in benchmarks and in gaming and
gaming yeah you made there may have been
a couple of frames per second difference
but really it was negligible it wasn't
even noticeable to your human eye
because we were talking you know
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
right now I'm playing battlefield 4 in
this commentary ultra settings
everything is maxed out as high as it
can go
msaa and be inclusion everything maxed
out and I'm getting I think I was
getting about 90 frames per second right
now when we were playing and an AMD I
haven't used my AMD on be up I didn't
use I didn't have bf4 when I have my AMD
rig however my brother-in-law just
upgraded to the 8300 series FX a core
and I can tell you right now there is no
difference I mean we have the same
graphics card both of GTX 680 s hacked
and overclocked and custom BIOS so
they're really really comparable and you
know what that's really the only thing I
can say when it comes to the two is that
the only place the differences really
show are on the benchmarks now who cares
about benchmarks unless you're in it
you're an overclocker and you're looking
to compete and go to competitions and
things like the OC overclocking event oh
into at CES you know you're not going to
notice this so if you're looking at
building yourself a gaming rig I see no
reason why you should overlook AMD now
at the same time this doesn't mean
there's anything wrong with Intel but
what it does mean as consumers
and as gaming rig builders you should
really consider AMD for the simple fact
that you're going to get very close
Intel performance in real world
application what I mean by real-world is
right now while we're playing this game
you're not going to notice five frames
per second difference you're not going
to notice that Intel may have scored a
little bit higher on the physics then
AMD and AMD I mean you know CPU can do
physics I well that's a whole different
conversation but anyway I digress you're
not going to notice the difference
enough to warrant paying AI extra 100
150 dollars for an Intel build now if
you're considering going AMD FX series
or like an X 79 platform got the price
difference it's just so different
between the two there is just I mean
we're talking more than double the price
even to go with the lowest and x79 even
if you're staying on the Ivybridge
platform or the sigma the sandy bridge-e
platform like the 3930k or something
like that that's a whole different
ballgame and I can't even begin to
justify that in fact the x79 platform
isn't even something that would really
be suited towards gamers in my opinion
anyway it's more towards renderers and
graphics artists and photoshop and
things like that that become really
intensive where you need all 12 threads
that CPU the X 79 platform can offer if
you happen to go with a six core CPU
anyway with those with the Intel line
but again I'm getting a little bit off
topic here if you are right now
considering building a computer and you
are torn on whether or not to get AMD or
Intel my official two cents and J's two
cents is saying it here today going with
AMD is not a mistake in fact I've
already said it in this video going from
AMD to Intel was a costume mistake I
gained like I gained some points in 3d
mark and I gained some Cinebench score
and things like that but I didn't gain
anything in the real world
in fact when even when it comes to
rendering my 8350 had no problems
whatsoever rendering in real time
I mean I was able to render video if it
was a ten minute video and it had all
kinds of transitions and effects and
stuff I could still render the video in
ten minutes
sometimes 11 depending on how many
overlays I had but the bottom line but
the bottom line here is AMD is a great
contender and I'm talking specifically
with the FX line mostly because I have
not gotten a chance to use Kaveri mmm
it's not even really out yet I'll
probably get an opportunity to do
something with Kaveri I'm sure I've got
some motherboards that are gonna be on
their way and and maybe we can put the
can very to the test against the 40 60
70 K the i5 I have in my test bench but
guys if you're building a system do not
overlook AMD do not listen to the haters
and the fanboys out there telling you
that AMD is garbage because you know
what the reality of it is you're not
going to notice the difference you're
going to save yourself some money that
you can drop into higher quality
components where it does matter for
gamers like your graphics card and you
can get a higher quality memory or even
a motherboard with a little bit better
features maybe a little bit better
built-in sound card so Intel versus AMD
I'm saying it right now there's nothing
wrong with Intel and there's nothing
wrong with AMD I'm using Intel doesn't
mean I won't use AMD in the future
you're not going to notice the
difference ignore the fanboys save some
money on your cpu go with an AMD FX 8350
even at FX 6300 or 6350 it's going to be
more than enough for gaming battlefield
4 is using all eight threads available
to it but you know this is just the
beginning computers are going to start
using more threads as time goes on which
means the CPUs are going to start
becoming more and more optimized towards
gaming which means that the FX 8350 or
the six core and eight core am DS are
going to become much better utilize
which is why they're becoming a much
better player in the gaming market
so in conclusion because I'm once again
losing my voice because I haven't talked
as much since I came back from CES
though God do not overlook AMD ignore
the haters ignore the fanboys and please
ignore those who definitely have no
first-hand experience my first-hand
experience is telling me to tell you to
consider AMD for a gaming build that's
the bottom line
there's nothing wrong with Intel it's a
little bit better on some of the higher
performance tasks like rendering and 3d
imaging and things like that but you
know what most of you that are watching
this video right now and if you're
getting this information and you're
listening to it right now you're not
going to be doing that kind of stuff and
so you can save yourself money guys has
been Jays two cents thanks for listening
to this video if you liked it you sure
as hell know what to do and if you
didn't like it
please mash that dislike button believe
it or not it helps I'm gonna get on out
of here guys and as always I will see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
