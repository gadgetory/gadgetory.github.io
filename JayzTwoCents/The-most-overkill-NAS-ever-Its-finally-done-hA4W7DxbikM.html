built this server yeah this one right
here it's been befitting that I'm gonna
do something with it now finally that's
got a lot of cool hardware in it and
we're gonna use it for something
seemingly remedial yeah I figured I
figured and I figured who better to talk
about a delayed project and bring the
King delay projects himself vertically I
made a video once you know what guys I
got new merch it's available now
karma calm /jc sense we got zip up
hoodies we got tri-blend we got a new
logo I digress since 2012 but the rest
logo you guys been asking for that
anyway well go live it up we can all
kinds of stuff zip up hoodies beanies
polos don't take my word for it cuz
obviously I can't do this ad so just
look in the description below and you
guys will find the link Thanks no in all
seriousness I flew Jerry down here for
two reasons one to prove you guys I
haven't murdered him I don't hate him as
much as you guys think I do and to prove
that you can still get away with only
buying one to good to give you on the
plane House supper it was a first-class
ticket if it needed two of those there's
it the fighter it doesn't work okay so
hardware wise I'm gonna kind of go
through this again very quickly we did a
whole build video on this where I was
like the next part we're gonna actually
turn it into a raid and we never did
that so it's got the same drives in it
that I had initially we had 15 10
terabyte iron wolf drives we have got
eight of them in here two of them were
in Phil's rig now and then five of them
are still sitting in a box that we won
oh we can expand it right that's the
heart of the thing with underneath we
are using ungrate for this though for
its ease of use and this flexibility
we'll talk about that never actually set
one up Jerry has already played around
with this and I did fly him down here to
help us make sure that this was in its
best shape possible he's way more
informed than I am when it comes to the
software side of things I'm a hardware
guy there's no there's no hiding that
I'm running a RAID controller here which
is the SAS slash RAID controller to
control our eight drives so it is using
a SAS break out to four SATA per side
and there's technically two controllers
in there I guess and then they're going
to our drives right here and they are
numbered so we can kind of keep tabs on
what's what but the beauty of is we're
not using it as RAID controller we're
not reason that SAS basically a SAS or a
SATA controller at that point you have
more ports to our motherboard because
even though we are using an asus WS X
299 pros
workstation where do you remember that
no geez that's all I do is remember
numbers now for some reason on the
previous X - 9 WS - 10 G it had like 10
SATA ports this one's got 6 so for
whatever reason asus kind of peddled
backpedaled and went backwards in the
the hardware side of this getting
trolled buddy it also doesn't have a 10
G u yr Wireless does have a 10 G wired
NIC built in so we had to add one of
those too for this we went with the
action a qn1 - 107 I'll put links to
these in the description I did get them
off Amazon the controller if you're
curious it's the LSI - 2008 - 8i we were
gonna do FreeNAS yes yeah so unread was
always the plan because it gave us the
ability to with freenas you can't use a
box with the head on right it's headless
you can't use VMS and i guess you can
but it's really convoluted it's very
convoluted and from the command line
primarily think of it as like it's
alright linux backbone or better go
freebsd sit similar there's a lot of art
you'll get a lot of arguments with the
tech community but yeah and yeah ok next
based I forget I said that but the point
is unread was gonna be a lot easier for
us to build a server in a tower like
this that you could physically sit at on
a box that would run a virtual machine
that you could use this as if we're a
desktop you could never know the
difference but it was also connected to
the network to work as an ass our
situation for the company has changed in
the way that we're doing things now so
that's no longer the case or the
necessity so I could rip out this this
1929 1920 m79 20 X 10 420 threat Intel
CPU solver and go with like a small ITX
like a 3 or something is it's just a
controller 400 that's all yeah yeah but
because the original hardware that's in
here is already here we're just using it
but I wanted to mention that with unread
that was something you could do the
reason why we have the Titan X sitting
in there is because of the fact that all
of that passed through was gonna happen
through the GPU so the faster the beef
here and the higher degree RAM and all
that stuff to teach you the better would
have been for that virtual machine
experience interacting with the virtual
machine and the physical mass inside
we're not doing that anymore but we are
still using unread now I've never
actually done unraised so we're going to
do is I'm gonna sit down and just kind
of work my way through it Jerry's gonna
kind of help me as I go this is not a
tutorial I just want to preface that
this is the second part of us building
this we're we're finally gonna have a
play
to archive all of our footage because we
are definitely starting to use up our
storage we are gonna be also turning
this into a steam game server so it's
going to be mounted to our network
through a 10g connection which we
already said and I would love a 42 but
don't have fiber and all I'm here to do
that but I know right it's going to
allow us though when we do our
benchmarking the problem with our
benchmarking is we'll pull out the test
bench or maybe have to reinstall an
operating system entirely and like when
the new rising stuff you know that was
all fresh installs of everything and if
you've ever had to install a game like
let's just say GTA 5 that's like 78
gigabytes or something like that just
run everything including even if you
have a gigabit down like we do here it
still takes like 30 minutes to download
the game and that's just for one game so
what we want to do is mount this on the
network have our games installed here
and all of our machines are just pointed
to this network drive for the
installation location which means your
game or Phil's games are gonna be on
there my games are gonna be on there
Knicks games could be on there and then
whoever's I can't you log into on
whatever machine is still gonna pull all
those files and then when we log in from
a machines it'll trigger the updates and
all that sort of stuff so that's the
other idea behind it I'm most excited
about that to be honest and the
archiving of footage and the backing up
of data and super sensitive stuff it's
the fact that I won't have to wait
Christine yeah plus Phil combined crypto
coins in jail oh yeah all right so let's
see the user name here is roots and then
there's no passwords you just hit enter
could you know that magic of editing so
this is the GUI and obviously you get
dashboard make sure they plug in be
running under Firefox that's why you
need 64 gigs around alright so what we
want to do right here is the first stage
setup J so go to your dashboard right
here and click on that you can go ahead
and give your machine a name we've
already gone in on the last boot and did
some of this stuff you got your your
nasty server what are we gonna call now
I'm gonna call it J ROCs like it like a
dog what are you gonna put in there
let's see it's important to personalize
guys it's really important to
personalize your stuff and I know this
sounds like some sort of a Hoover Shoei
like find rate video but they don't even
know we're making this video right now
this no as a matter of fact we were
gonna use free now
really guys look at this yeah we started
with three nests at 9:00 a.m. and that's
how long it took us today we finally
just said okay we're doing under age we
were gonna do FreeNAS because we were
like well we don't need the pass-through
option anymore for BM and all that stuff
cuz we're not gonna use it as a physical
box if you're sitting at so I ordered
these 10g cards and FreeNAS and even
though it says they've supported by
FreeBSD and fariñas has built a thong
FreeBSD it is these NIC cards are not
supported and because there's no 10g
built into this motherboard we were
gonna have a 1g connection for our
server which is obviously not good
enough
so we basically said screw it yeah we'll
go with unwrite anyway I think we're
happy that we did alright so let's get
the disk set up it's very easy to do
just go up here and click on main let's
your next little option over and down
here you have parity disks parity disks
are your disks that basically when
they're built if you have a failure of a
drive in the system the parity disk
steps in and saves you basically the
reason it's called unrighteous because
this is literally not a raid and there's
a lot of pros and cons of that but in
our case pros it should have called it
na DDA are you not a raid matter e there
you go patent pending so we want to do
here is assign the drives to their roles
would and pick one of these drives and
then your parity drive to let's go ahead
and pick one more now we have to parity
drives that's going to show you the
smart type of them - oh dude it shows
seasonal merge so one of my concerns was
that these are these our drives are
designed to be in like 2 or 4 you blades
to you blades
yes which normally have like either
Delta or L Takagi fans blasting air at
them they're in a data center who cares
no masses yeah
am i concerned about me filling up all
in front of these with drives and being
in a standard box like this yeah what
didn't have decent airflow but what the
fans running full speed on the front of
this through an AI o action of an e io
on this yes should be an air cooler for
the ultimate reliability
they're running nice and cool although
they're not being taxed right now but uh
I can monitor this though yeah if he
goes if I'm on the GUI and he goes in he
starts like just slamming it with data
and reading writing all that we can see
a - I will set it up to send you
notifications if anything goes sideways
so now we've got six drives remaining
let's go ahead and start assigning those
to these six disc slots just grab the
first one from each one go so it doesn't
remove absolutely okay they said no no
all right so go ahead grab that one and
just go down the list until you exhaust
all your drives I should give you six
but not the SSD not fastest II do not
want to add that
that's our cache yep go ahead and assign
user if I wanted to add another cache I
just put the other drive in put it back
up and then add it here yes then another
that is that so all right so here's our
cache drive I assume there's our SSB so
we could have done this with all SSDs I
guess like - did with one other stuff
yep and if we want to add more cache you
can just plop does it does it have to be
a match drive the same capacity do we
know this as far as I know no so I could
just pop in a 500 gig if I wanted so
okay what I saw earlier I'm gonna assume
that but it's possible that if you want
to raid those which is another option
you can rate the cache drives improve
the performance then I would assume you
want alright so now what you're gonna
see right here is that down here it's
building the parity and formatting the
drive side so this is at point 1 percent
on parenting ok correct so if we wanted
to build it out right now test it get it
get our network locations and all that
set up yep we can do that and then when
we're done at the end of the day just
tell it to go hope we're on the power
outage go ups add up to it and you
should have yeah I know that's Nick it's
support it supports it - is it all set
up now mmm the drives offer
we don't have shares with Amelie to
access it yeah all you've done is told
it you want to make one well we have the
warehouse but no doors correct
well one does want to pause the rebuild
operation that's in progress go ahead
hit pause you don't want to hit cancel
because if you cancel you're starting
over from scratch okay so if you're at
like 30 percent after 5 hours then you'd
start okay cancel you're gonna kick
yourself in the teeth alright so now
this is this is pause what we want to do
is we want to go and create a share okay
so share is basically is it's gonna look
like a drive on the network yeah so how
we have 8 drives in this machine if we
added multiple shares it look like if we
added eight of them of the put eight
drives
yeah so we don't need that we just need
a main access point to this box so we
have one chair and then M&amp;amp;E broken out
in that one chair
unless you want to have more granular
control you can create other shares so
I'm gonna I'm gonna call this big
Fang you can rename these at any point
now that none of this column yeah okay
what you really want to look at those
included disks notice how it says all
that's good that means that when you're
copying stuff to this it's gonna spread
it out amongst all those discs best that
it can
alright so for users you don't need to
make a user to X this is this is visible
on the network right now yes okay but
having the default route with no
password account is dangerous because
anyone with access to this then could
log into it and be disrupted literally
anybody on your network to take out okay
so we're not gonna do it right now
because it's just Phil and I but it's
probably best practice to go in here
create another user and probably change
the password and step on group yep so
just like you wouldn't take your default
router out of the box and not change the
admin password okay so there's a lot of
other tools and stuff you could probably
look at here but for the city I mean
this was never meant to be a tutorial
just just kind of showing some of the
use case of unread because one of the
biggest things like when we when we
built this and I said we were gonna be
using on raid in that video someone
could we're like why using a great free
Nasri nastiness
we spent two days well you spent all of
yesterday that was visible Hardware
misconfigurations but it is but and then
and in three quarters of today just
trying to get FreeNAS to work with our
freaking knit card yes and that was and
that was both of you and now both of you
kind of know what you're doing with
Linux at least to some degree you do he
does and you guys kind of overlapped who
knew what and you guys still couldn't
get the damn thing to work I think what
you found one user online I got it to
work alright so here's what I do I'm
gonna get my laptop am i fired up and
and then or actually just do this let's
go to Phil's machine real quick okay
because he's on the 10g my wireless what
good is that I mean we can access files
but speed is important because you could
edit off this if you wanted yes that's
not the idea behind it but you could and
so let's go ahead since this is wired
through cat 5e I want to point that out
we are using a 100-foot cat 5e cable
running all the way across this video
and into the office just to show you
don't need cat 6 if you're not running
long distances and still why not use it
if it's if it's there and it's the same
price but this is probably not the best
way to do this we're gonna show you
still with the read/write speeds are on
this we're going to talk about what
effects those beats alright so the
switch we use here is the Asus xgu 2008
it's a 10 gigabit base which means it
has two 10 gigabits connections on there
and then the rest are the standard one
gigabit we also had to change up our
step network set up a little bit some of
you guys might have noticed that when we
redid the wiring here I
the wiring I completely screwed it up
where I was going modem to switch to
router which was kind of really screwing
up our network path and was the way IPS
were being handed out was not right and
so it was causing us all kinds of
problems so what we did was we actually
relocated the modem from here he says if
that's nothing back out next to the
router and then we're going from router
to the switch and then the switch to the
computers and stuff here
but his computer is hooked up to the 10g
port and so is the server we just set up
out there with that really long cat 5e
cable which we talked about so this is
the other end of that hundred foot cable
so let's go and see now how our cat 5e
is doing in terms of dragging and
dropping a file so how BIG's this file
fill so I made a custom little really
big zip that's 15 gigabytes and right so
here's a big ol thing the one I made
right there right so if I just drag and
drop right yep we were getting 1.1
gigabytes per second and that's dropping
down a little bit so right to about 475
but I mean we don't normally work off
with 15 gigabyte files in fact an entire
video when we shoot on our FS v RFS 7 is
usually around 20 to 22 gigabytes
depending on the project if it's like a
PC build with lots of b-roll it's lots
of smaller like 1 gigabyte files - so
this is actually really really good even
500 megabytes a second considering we're
dealing with spinning drives on the 10 G
connection is actually something that is
um
really good so that's that basically um
I mean an idiot can do it I kind of sort
of did Jerry need it needed to help me
so I guess you have to get your own
Jerry if you want helpful so we're gonna
have Jerry actually copy the file again
because I want to see what's happening
here with the interface once it's
happening with the memory I want see
what's happening with the drive temps
because my biggest concern is obviously
gonna be he's gonna start doing it right
now so my biggest concern was gonna be
drive timpz this is up soon we're not
gonna bleed sir
here we go so you can see the CPU
beautiful wow that's a decent amount of
CPU being used actually might get that
but the drive temps are not really
changing at all we didn't take a
h-street HT thread and you can see
inbound 10 gigabits yep copying it to
the server is only one way right so do
me a favor change the name of it on the
server and then pull it back to his
machine you got it all right I like
having a Jerry to go back and forth so I
don't have to walk I'll bet you I'll bet
you 2 cents JS 2 cents that it's the
same it just sound out lower because
it'll be bottleneck by the SSD on my
computer one gigabyte that's this is
literally faster than any of the drives
in there except for the enemy and me
maybe all right so now he's copying it
over 3.3 3.9 your internal drive is
bottlenecking
how fast this can copy down nowhere SATA
drives here in this warehouse just
they're too slow so that's pretty much
it for this vlog I guess this is super
nerdy stuff that I wish I knew more
about like I wish I knew how to actually
set up like like windows raid and Nas
and all that sort of stuff but the nice
thing about the GUI system here the GUI
setup here with under aid is that it
literally is just click and play I mean
it's just that simple it's up and
running it's more than good enough for
what we are doing we can confidently add
drives to this add cache to it and if it
wasn't for the fact that Jerry came down
here I swear to god this would not have
this would still be sitting on the floor
in the other studio collecting dust
because I was just completely like this
was a daunting task for me because I'm a
hardware guy not a software guy and I
know you run raids and stuff and servers
at your house yeah I've used free nails
in the past but you've never used this
before no ok so why don't you give us
like your 60 second review of how this
was working with it all right so the
thing I like about on raid is that it
works a lot like Windows Home Server you
used to to work by using each disk
independently having its own file system
so that if everything blows up and goes
wrong you can pull it out and put it in
your system and recover your data I love
the way that they handle the parity you
do lose some performance yet because you
don't have that striping capability of
RAID controller but what you lose you
gain inconvenience the nice thing about
this because we're allowing the software
itself to control the rate instead of
using a complicated RAID controller that
we may not be able to get our hands on
if we blow it up
we're always assured that we can get
another drive in there if my SAS
controller dies I should be able just
replace it with a no SAS controller
would be up the road says it could be a
me there's anything that can connect
those drives you're right it's very
resilient drivers support yeah yeah
people love that card by the way too so
I was really disappointed freenas didn't
support that but I'm glad everything's
working so hey yeah he'll you have a
server now we didn't do it but we have
it though he'll build it but we haven't
you guys saw it though it's it's a
pretty capable piece of software for the
little money they're asking for it and
they're really good about support so I'm
much more comfortable leaving a guy like
Jay with this offer then I will be open
source free Ness what you got there sir
we're gonna we're gonna configure this
