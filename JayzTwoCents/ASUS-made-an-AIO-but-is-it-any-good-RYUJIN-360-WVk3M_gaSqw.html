million times very widely known for
motherboards and some pretty high-end
graphics car it didn't low-end as well
peripherals lately but what happens when
they entered the custom CPU cooling game
well they've teamed up with Noctua to
bring you the ROG right ryu raul growl
Jin Ryu
ROH so while the warships came to me
with an opportunity to try their game
and see how I feel about it and what
they didn't know was I'd already been
playing they came for a while in fact
you probably even seen me tweet about it
so this sponsorship was pretty much a
no-brainer
well the warships is free-to-play and
called the thinking man's action game
because it's the perfect balance of
action and strategy you could command a
massive fleet featuring some of the
history's most iconic war vessels and as
you play you can unlock new ships and
dominate the oceans with seven million
players worldwide world of warships uses
3d scans of the actual ship to make it
as accurate and lifelike as possible
with over 200 ships across 11 nations
you're likely to see some pretty famous
ships in each battle click the link

guys come across me out there on the
battlefield I guarantee you don't stand
a chance
okay so it's no surprise that asus has
been building their own ecosystem
they've got power supplies now like the
Thor power supply which has a live power
draw from the wall readout on the side
of it in an OLED panel we'll be taking a
look at that as well but we saw these
first at Computex and they were pretty
neat that OLED displays on the water
cooler or the water block themselves
giving you some pertinent information
your system like CPU temperatures clock
speed all that sort of thing but it's
taken quite a while please to actually
come to market because here we are now
heading into December and we first saw
this back in June so the particular
model I have right here is the 360 it
does come in a 240 and a 360 variants
but I believe this is an ASA Tech
patented collaboration with Asus here so
we're just doing the unboxing here
because what's really difficult for a ia
IO a i/o aerial I hate that a IO
4 all in one or closed-loop cooling
especially in the United States with the
ASA tech patents is there's not a whole
lot of customization you can do I mean
anything on top of the pump is up to the
manufacturer but you're using the same
like aluminum radiators you've got
either fep tubing or like in this case
here sleeved rubber tubing and then
there's not a whole lot you can do to
really make it custom so what happened
here is asus is teamed up with Noctua so
we actually have three Noctua industrial
PPC fans these are PWM controlled fans
and this is a 2,000 rpm fan so it's got
the legendary air flow performance and
today I crusher performance of a knock
to a fan without the ugly brown on it
it's solid black so no excuse for them
to not just sell black fans all the time
all the coolers come with black fans
that's just me though I digress but you
know what's just as important as your
radiator fin density and all of that
junk is the actual you know performance
of the fans now this is going to support
all of your standard sockets all the way
from a little LGA 1175 all the way up to
all the standard LGA 13 you know xx
processors of course your 2011 your 20
66 all that stuff basically like I said
it's AIT's a tech so it has all the same
mounting options but what's different
here is it's
got this nifty little cover and this
OLED display on the cooler so as I said
this is going to connect to or a sink so
all of your Asus products are going to
link their Ora sinks you can control
things like the RGB lighting so it will
sync up with the rest of your system we
are using an asus motherboard here for
testing obviously so that we have an
ecosystem i'll be using an asus graphics
card as well but then this isn't all
that attractive looking so it actually
has this cover that can go on top of
this like somehow it goes some way now
the inherent problem with water cooling
a lot of people don't really think about
or consider is the fact that there are
still components on this top part of the
motherboard that need some sort of air
cooling you have your vrm blocks on here
in this case this motherboard actually
has a built in water block / heatsink we
need air moving over that we need air
moving over the RAM we need to cool the
components and the chokes around the CPU
these are things that have to be cooled
and when you put a water block on there
you're removing a lot of the airflow
that's created by your air cooler when
you have an air cooler whether it be a
down fire or a standard-size or you know
upright air cooler there is air flow
hitting those parts so when you go water
cooling you tend to go well my cpu temps
are amazing but you might notice a rise
in temps on both your RAM as well as
your V RMS so asus has thought of that
so if you look here it might be kind of
hard to see there is a fan down in here
that blows down on the socket and the
air will splash out and touch all of
those components in a 360 fashion now in
terms of connectivity we have got a lot
of wires here it's unfortunate one of my
favorite things about closed-loop
coolers there's no wires and stuff all
coming off of the pump and stuff but as
you can see in this case there is a
matrix squid like spaghetti monster
coming off of this which is unfortunate
but I digress coming off of here you
have your fan splitters so you got three
here in this case because we have a
triple fan our SATA power which is good
to see it's nice to not see molex we
have a USB 2.0 header because this has
to obviously communicate with the system
somehow to give you the information
the screen as well as be able to control
the pump itself and then we have the
actual PWM power for the pump so we've
got supplemental power coming through
the SATA because we're not pulling all
of that that wattage and amperage
through one header to control the pump
and the fans so we supplement that with
the SATA which is whether SATA and a PWM
on there so y'all we gotta do now we got
to install it and see how cool it can
keep our 8700 K
all right so here we got a problem we've
been dealing with right here the fans
weren't spinning up on the radiator at
all no matter what we did remember these
as I showed you are connecting off of a
breakout cable or a splitter that is
hardwired into the pump and when I came
over here I just I realized that one of
these wires is actually bad like it
there we go oh wow more of them are
coming out loo that right there fill so
you see those wires going into here well
that's my hand on the fan the wires are
pulling out of the very first fan hitter
so let me show you so this one was the
one that was just sitting here and had
disconnected from the crimp you can see
that I didn't even crimp on to there at
all but if we look at the other side you
could another ones popped out so yeah
something that I would have seriously
hoped for better quality out of a two
hundred and eighty dollar AIO and the
thing is because this is hardwired into
the pump it's not even like Asus could
send you a replacement cable so the more
I handle this
the more wires just keep pulling out
because upon looking at it you can see
this one's crimped you can see how the
metal actually folds over and digs into
the sleeve or the insulation so that it
can't pull out it goes in like this you
crimp it it folds over and digs into the
insulation that wake the wire can't pull
out that didn't happen on some of these
as you can see on both of these
splitters and they're just the wires are
just pulling out we're gonna continue
testing to see how well the unit does by
just plugging this into a PWM three-way
splitter onto my motherboard and then
using the AI suite fan controller you
know fan tuner to actually tune which
means that the cooler itself is not
gonna be controlling the radiator
anymore it means that the motherboard
will okay so I'm using Asus fan expert
for to kind of get all the RPMs and
stuff set on the fan so it's going to go
through the pump it's going to go
through the CPU headers and all that
stuff and it's going to find the RPM
range of the fans that way when you
click silent or you know turbo and all
that stuff it knows kind of where to set
the RPMs this is the same thing you
would do though if you were going to be
tuning it for plugged in you know if
you're plugged
to the pump as the way it's supposed to
be so the only difference now is instead
of the radiator being controlled by the
pump it's being controlled by the
motherboard CPU and CPU optional headers
have a splitter going to one of them and
then one fan going to the other header
because I couldn't find my 3-way
splitter something I shouldn't have had
to use for this video unfortunately but
the little fan that's actually on the
pump will show you in a second that
thing is loud holy crap is that thing
loud it's a really high-pitched it
reminds me of the old chipset fans on
the old old-school motherboards back at
Vic LGA 775 stuff wait for it there goes
wow that thing is so high-pitched and
loud now another thing I'm not a huge
fan of is the fact that you have to have
a separate program for the fan control
of the cooler and a separate program for
the actual OLED display where you can
change the display and the readout and
the animation and all that stuff I don't
see why a snooze couldn't combine this
into one piece of software instead of
going the bloatware route so live - this
is how you control the little displayed
if you have a motherboard an asus
motherboard with an OLED you'll see live
- OLED there otherwise you'll just see a
Oh cooler this is where you can change
the stuff you want to see so a i/o we
can change your hardware monitor this
tells us what things we can see imager
animation custom banner and lighting
controls that's how you control the
lighting if it doesn't use Asus aura
which technically we could but we're
gonna use the built-in here you can even
turn it off if you want and you can
rotate it because yeah it's not always
straight so you can rotate the display
so it's always upright that's kind of
nice this is where you select the things
you want to monitor so let's see
frequency CPU it's good to see voltage
would be nice and temperature so these
are the things we selected it's cycling
through the temperature the voltage as
well as the frequency so we're four
point seven gigahertz we are one point
three one two volts which is kind of
high and we are at 27 degrees Fahrenheit
on the CPU so obviously our 8700 K is
doing pretty decent we can also do a
custom banner a little background banner
here step to type text English only
that's funny
how would it know okay whatever there we
go J's to senses dope and the best
youtuber ever
lulz winning best dude 2018 so
I mean it's a little bit of fun factor
there okay anyway you get an idea you
get the idea you can play around the
display make it's a really cool things
or super true things like that right
there and that's all that's all fine and
dandy but how does it cool so we're
currently idling at 26 see it's showing
37 right now so we just load it up all
right 25 see at idle let's run this and
see it we get 30 57
you know I Wow it's actually doing
pretty decent I'm actually pretty
impressed 8700 K is a notoriously hot
CPU so this tells me we have quite a bit
of overclocking Headroom even though
we're at 4.7 gigahertz on all cores it's
technically an overclock let's see if
this can handle five gigahertz what do
you think go for broke
blow it up alright so I've got it
running at five gigahertz right now one
point four volts this is a lot to ask of
any a IO on an 8700 K because of how hot
they run so let's see if we get you
ready for I'd only at twenty nine fit
are 29 C 2032 let's bounce around a
little bit 28 okay here we go three two
one go seventy-five eighty for number
105 is our max on this chip 85 Wow okay
I'm pretty impressed
I pushed more voltage and I think I
would have needed I mean five gigahertz
is not that hard to get on at 8700 K but
it's hard to keep cool this a oh
definitely can keep it cool I just would
have really liked to have seen those
wires not pull out I mean these are the
kind of things you deal with with first
round manufacturing I don't know if
anyone else has reported the problem
ours clearly has a non crimped cables
which caused us some issues and we have
to use a separate way of interacting
with fans but I mean in terms of quality
for two hundred and eighty dollars it's
two hundred and seventy nine dollars
MSRP for the ryujin 363 Noctua fans
obviously the OLED display on there
we've got some innovation happening
getting more than just a typical boring
a i/o you you do get some pretty good
build quality in terms of the radiator
and the extra stuff it's just
unfortunately this one if for an average
user would have been considered bad out
of the box so guys sound off in the
comments below and tell me what you
think about this cooler we saw it first
back at Computex it's nice to see it
finally hit the market it's hard to
improve upon a Sutekh patented a i/o and
obviously asus is putting their spin on
it what a IO coolers what a IO coolers
do you guys like to use sound off in the
comments below and let us know and as
always guys we'll see you in the next
okay so so well if effort listen to what
I'm saying
