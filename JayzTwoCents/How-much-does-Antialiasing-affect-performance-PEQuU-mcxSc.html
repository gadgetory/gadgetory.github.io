you with another video about graphics
cards they're the single most important
component when it comes to your gaming
experience they're the hottest thing in
your system they are the most expensive
thing in your system but now we're going
to talk about a different type of cost
we're going to talk about the cost to
fps and anti-aliasing exactly how much
performance do you really lose by
cranking up those settings with its dual
BIOS 10+2 power phase delivery rgba CX
3.0 cooler and factory overclock the
EVGA gtx 1070 and 1080 for the win are
excellent choices for gamers who demand
the best learn more by following the
link down below now on a high level here
because I don't want to spend too much
time making this video 45 minutes long
or in aka a Barnacles video love you
Jerry but anti-aliasing is nothing more
than a processing method in real time
that makes your images look a lot less
Jaggi as you're gaming but unfortunately
because it's a process that takes place
in real time depending on the type of
AAA you use and the level of AAA you use
can have a huge impact on your gaming
now all anti-aliasing really does is
fake resolution if you will if that
makes sense because your screen is made
up of a ton of square pixels the higher
the resolution the more square pixels
you have but the problem is the lower
the resolution the more significant and
severe the jaggies are going to appear
720p gaming 1080p gaming and even 1440p
gaming can still have quite a bit of
jaggies so that's where anti-aliasing
comes in it sort of fakes the softness
of those edges and processes the image
in real time to make it look more
rounded and smooth therefore less
jarring of a gaming experience when
you're just looking at all of these
different squares trying to make
something look round over the years
though there have been tons of different
types of anti-aliasing so we're gonna
talk about three today we're going to
talk about because it's a pretty wide
spectrum of impact and there's some
proprietary anti-aliasing and there's
some open-source anti-aliasing so we're
really just going to talk about three
different types today that kind of
occupy a pretty wide spectrum here the
first type being well of course no AAA
so that's our
baseline how much of a performance here
we're going to take if we have none
turned on whatsoever but we're also
going to take a look at SSA which is a
super sampling anti-aliasing it's an
older technology it's got a little bit
more of a performance hit we're also
going to look at FSA a which is a fast
approximation anti-aliasing and then
we're also going to take a look at SMA a
which is a much newer type found that
has a lot less performance hit and
actually applies it to the entire screen
some anti-aliasing types only apply it
to the edges or the extreme edges of a
particular rendered item on the screen
which could make the edges look smooth
but things happening inside of that
particular polygon rendered image would
look Jaggi still so the two benchmarks
we are going to use in this video
because of their age difference and the
different types of anti-aliasing
available in there is the original tomb
raider benchmark and we're going to take
a look at the rise of the tomb raider
benchmark now the tomb raider benchmark
uses SS AAA or super sampling and FXAA
and then the rise of the tomb raider
uses SMA a so we want to see how much of
a performance hit we really get as we
step up those particular settings so
without further ado let's look at the
results
obviously from those benchmarks it is
very taxing on your graphics card to
start bumping up the anti-aliasing
settings remember it's got to go through
and process all of those images in real
time so the more time it has to spend
processing the less time it can send
that image to your graphics or your
monitor so that's why you see such a
huge hit to performance noting some of
you might been scratching your head on
why he used a fury nano a couple reasons
actually one I wanted the fast
HBM on there I wanted to see the like
real tangible benefits in dx12 on the
rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark and -
it's got 4 gigabytes of vram which i
think is much more relatable to a lot of
the viewers especially with those on
lesser an GPUs without running you know
6 8 12 gigabytes or massive amounts of
VRAM so I thought that this was a pretty
good representation of what would be
kind of midline on the level of GPUs
that are out there so that we could test
the true impact on the FPS when the core
is having to handle all of that
additional load without the vram being
able to store nearly as much images in
there when it comes to you know having a
huge buffer of VRAM so in conclusion if
you guys are playing your favorite
triple-a titles and you're just not
getting the level of performance that
you think you should be consider
lowering the levels of anti-aliasing or
even the type of anti-aliasing if it's
definitely a trade-off with how much
jaggies you're willing to put up with
versus the level of performance hit
you're willing to take there's always
going to be a trade-off you can make a
prettier image but it's going to come at
the cost of FPS thermals and likely
noise as your fans have to really ramp
up to handle all that extra load being
put on your GPU the GPU load it grows
exponentially with the levels of
anti-aliasing it is just asking a lot of
your graphics card so there you go guys
a quick video here showing you some of
the impacts obviously there are tons of
titles out there with tons of different
types of anti-aliasing and the results
are definitely going to vary so this is
where you guys come in you can run these
same tests on your games if you've got a
game with a built-in benchmark run it
with different settings on the
anti-aliasing and then put your results
down in the comments it I could try and
do that myself but there are so many of
you out there it would be a huge pool of
data if you guys are willing to run the
so if you decide to do it down in the
comments list the title the resolution
the type of a a and the level of a a the
2 X 4 X whatever and then put your
respective fps on there but keep all of
the settings identical and only change
it AAA settings and I think together we
could really get a good idea of how much
impact there really is if all of you
guys kind of play along and participate
as always guys thanks for watching
today's video it is so much fun being
able to play around with all this
different stuff and share information
with you
so that's why I need you guys to tell me
what do you want me to do when it comes
to some of these different tests and
reviews and project types let me know
what you guys want to see on the channel
moving forward also welcome back to
school guys get your homework done
before watching my videos but make sure
you watch them on your recess breaker
lunch break or whatever I know you guys
all bring your phones to school no
excuse that you shouldn't be watching
Jays two cents during school time that's
called multitasking or as I like to call
multitasking AAA or MT AAA watch Jays
video while doing homework in class
alright guys as always see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
