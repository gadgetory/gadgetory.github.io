here and if you remember a couple weeks
back I took a look at cooler masters
brand new micro ATX version of the
silencio case vessel NCO 352 now it only
makes sense we would go ahead and take a
look at the big brother for that which
is the Silencio 650 to see you toot they
did there because it's small and three
is like half six gigabytes flex display
technology automatically detects and
connects up to four displays or the best
gaming experience in multi display ultra
HD click the link in the description to
find out more but before we do the build
we're going to go ahead and talk about
some of the key features of this case
who in this case might appeal to will
put a system in it and we'll see if this
case delivers what it is it's supposed
to deliver that's how that's how reviews
work usually well here it is the
Silencio 652 and I will admit it's
actually a little bit bigger than I
thought it was I've had this case for a
few weeks now I'm just now getting
around to doing the build with it and I
don't necessarily like doing case
reviews of empty cases but I didn't have
a situation where I needed to build
anything yet so this case got shelved
for just a little bit until recently
well my dad is actually needing a new
computer so I am going to be building
him a computer and we're gonna be
putting those parts into the Silencio
6:52 and I think that this case fits the
bill perfectly and I'll get to that in a
minute now we'll go and take a two
around the case we've got the front here
which is once again a magnetic closing
door that again to me always feels like
it opens the wrong direction but you
notice I didn't say one direction
royalties free of royalties it has a
nice foam padding here on the door which
is supposed to help with silencing the
case and some of the fan noise on the
front here you know interestingly enough
you do have a little bit of a fan grill
here on the front but I do find that to
be a little bit interesting though
considering the the door actually closes
up flush against it and there's no way
for air to actually get in through there
all the fan is pulling air into the side
so what's the point of the grill kind of
my question I guess but nonetheless
you have a grill that you can easily
remove and you could clean the fence and
a little bit if you want obviously as
you can see here we have the new
Silencio which are a very like swoop
bladed very sharp blade style fan which
supposed to be really good for static
pressure as well as airflow static
pressure is important with where these
cases are these fans are placed we'll
talk about that again in a second here
but you do have three expandable drive
bays up here five and a quarter drive
bays and then you have your power a
piece of hair apparently if your power
and your reset switch and hard drive
indicator light right there so there's
that power switch I'm assuming is going
to illuminate for when things are
powered on and then you have all along
the side left side right side
ventilation to get air into the case
removing the left side panel they do not
have captive thumb screws so if you
don't screw them too far they're just
going to fall out on you we do have a
sound deadened side panel very very
similar to what fractal design does on
their cases so it's really not anything
new or really surprising when it comes
to this then you do have a removable
side plate on here so that you could
have more ventilation to the graphics
card area on the back of the case back
here you have another 120 millimeter
Silencio fan so that's three Silencio
fans that are included and then you have
one two three four two and a half inch
drive sleds on here that again have
cooler masters very awesome technology
look at that actually spread out to be a
three and a half that's kind of cool
but you can just pop these out put your
drive in there and then close it up they
automatically key into the side of the
drive you slide it in and it's 100%
toolless and I guess as you can see now
they have one drive sled that meets the
need of two and a half inch and three
and a half inch that's kind of cool I
like that strapped to the hard drive
cages you do have all of your hardware
so it's going to have all things like
your stand off screws probably some
extra thumb screws all of your
motherboard tray screws as well as this
is one likely going to be a radiator
mount or something of that nature
because you can fit a 240 millimeter
radiator in the front if you remove
these hard drive cages as well as a two
hundred and forty four millimeter our
240 millimeter radiator in the top as
well now there are no top fans included
with this they have two intakes on the
front one
austan the rear as well as some rubber
pass-through fittings here if you want
to do external cooling of some option
huge cut out here in the motherboard
tray for your CPU cooler this does
accommodate up to 168 millimeters of CPU
cooler hype and it looks like a maximum
double check here because I don't want
to get this number wrong a 423
millimeter maximum length of graphics
card and you can use a screw driver to
actually remove these hard drive cages
if you don't need them to increase air
flow as well I'll probably end up
removing these this one right here to
get a little better airflow as my dad's
computer here doesn't actually need that
much hard drive space and that's we're
only going to be putting an SSD and a
hard drive in this thing so so it is a
standard ATX form factor but it can also
fit micro ATX and mini ITX su if you
wanted and it does not look like it
actually supports EA TX because it looks
like you're going to have some
compatibility or contact issues here
with the five and a quarter drive cage
which is not removable now as I
mentioned the top of the case does fit
multiple fan options and it does have
this little piece on there that you can
use to cover up the top if you don't put
any fans in there does not come with any
fans on the top has already mentioned
but as you can see right here it is
meshed and grilled it looks pretty nice
if you're going to leave the top off you
can fit up to two 140 millimeter or two
120 millimeter fans in the top if you
want to add more airflow into this case
now last but not least on the
motherboard tray side of things again
you have that very heavy dense material
here that's supposedly going to help
keep things quiet and then you have a
place right here that you can mount
another SSD giant grommet right here
that you can use to get all your cables
through only about a little bit less
than an inch worth of space here that
you can actually work with so it's not a
lot of room right here for cables you
don't want to keep that in mind when it
comes to routing of your 24 pin I'd
probably bring that around this way
we'll see how we do it when we do the
build but massive motherboard cut out
here for being able to install your
cooler after the motherboards in the
case so that's kind of nice and then all
the wiring that comes with this case is
also all black and sleeved which is
going to be very nice and then as you
can see here on the front you have
of splitters that come with all the fans
that way if you're not gonna be using
the motherboard headers on your
motherboard to power your fans you can
power them off a 4-pin molex now that
we've taken the tour around the case
let's go ahead and build something in
this thing it's not something I do often
in case reviews like I said this case is
going to be going directly into service
so we're going to see if this meets the
needs of of what I needed in the case I
think it's going to fit perfectly for
the user case scenario that it's going
in we'll talk about that at the end of
the video but why this case with chosen
for this build and why maybe you should
consider it and if it's going to meet
the needs of what you need for a more
budget oriented case that's not going to
wreck your bill or wreck your bank
account but still give you a lot of
really cool features so with that said I
guess there's time for only one more
thing well here it is guys the silencio
652 is now built out with a PC that's
going to be used and not ones can be
taken apart now I know that you guys
might have been thinking this was going
to be the build I'm using for the AMD
vs. Intel on how much you really need in
terms of horsepower but this is not it
like I mentioned earlier this is a build
that I did for my dad who I guess is
starting a youtube channel about
programming and stuff kind of inspired
by both myself and code gasm series that
barn achlys does I apologize ahead of
time but anyway he needed a computer
that was capable of doing some light
rendering and stuff nothing heavy when
it comes to rendering and so that's why
we've got the parts in here that we do
have I just want to mention this is not
the AMD build that people have been
asking me about that's coming soon I
promise now building in the 650 to s was
actually pretty easy there's nothing
really terrible with the case for
instance the the grommets though I would
say they're a little bit thin because a
couple of those actually tore off
unfortunately the little flaps on there
but that's kind of a minor deal
considering where they tore off the
cables are just now cleanly going
through there so it works out okay
plenty of room in here though standard
ATX case motherboard works perfectly the
graphics card length is no problem here
I took out the hard drive cage like I
said it might have done
considering a wanted more airflow where
possible hyper 212 Evo was definitely an
easy choice to go with on the cooler
because of the fact that it's so
legendary for how well it cools and how
cheap that it is and I went with the
coolermaster v6 50 power supply even
though it's seen a lot of coolermaster
stuff in here believe it or not we paid
for all this stuff this was not sent for
review just the case but a complete
parts list here we do have an AMD 8320
that I'm gonna be doing a little bit of
overclocking on we've got 8 gigabytes of
ballistic 1600 megahertz ddr3 RAM we've
got the fatality 970 motherboard from
asrock we do have an MSI 960 in here for
him to be able to use some of the cuda
capabilities of assisting with some of
rendering of his videos we do have on
here a v6 50 power supply from
coolermaster it's a semi modular gold
rated we do have a 2 terabyte Barracuda
7200 rpm art hard drive as well as a
Kingston SSDs SSD and then he needed a
card reader in there so pretty much this
thing is a fairly basic bill but it's
also believe it or not the most powerful
PC he's ever owned so he's pretty
excited to get this thing up and running
and I guess when it's channel goes live
I'll let you guys know if you guys are
interested in that you got to be nice
though if you're mean that's up I
did up to keep the top cover on and only
use one 120 millimeter rear exhaust for
two reasons one we live in a really
dusty area we're in the border of the
desert and it gets very windy very dusty
my parents have a cat and a dog and so I
want to be able to keep as much crap for
making its way in the top of the case as
possible the second thing is we have the
2:120 intakes so I wanted positive
pressure and considering the fact that
we already have some restricted airflow
on the front I didn't want to add
another exhaust creating a negative air
pressure effect where it would start
pulling dust and dirt in through all the
gaps and vents that are in this case so
that's why I'm leaving it like this I've
already run it to see how much air flow
there is there's plenty of air flow
coming in the front and plenty coming
out the rear it's always fun to say and
considering I know for a fact he's not
going to be doing any long gaming
sessions or anything like that
I'm not having
any concern whatsoever about thermals
inside this case now I know I say he's
not doing gaming it's kind of funny to
see the MSI 960 gaming graphics card in
here but like I mentioned we are using
the 960 so we can utilize CUDA and give
him a little bit of extra horsepower
when it comes to rendering and who knows
maybe he'll play a game or two now that
he has a gaming / rendering machine it's
actually interesting how much gaming and
rendering machines truly do have in
common
so there you go guys the cooler master
650 2's I think it fits his needs
perfectly it's filtered on the bottom
and the reason why I chose this case for
him as I mentioned earlier was the
restricted airflow which is going to
assist with the dust and pet hair like I
mentioned the fact that we can cap off
the top and the fact that it's got a
huge gap on the bottom here because his
PC currently is on the floor he says
he's going to move this up to his desk
but until he does it will be on the
floor so I wanted to make sure that
we're going to have plenty of
ventilation on the bottom plenty of
filtration as well a nice compact case
that looks good and he fell in love with
the 352 so when he asked me to build him
a computer and he told me he liked the
352 it pretty much came down to being a
no-brainer that the 652 was going to
certainly fit the bill for what it is he
was looking for in a case so there you
go guys the Silencio 652 from
Coolermaster tell me what you guys think
of a cooler master kind of making this
move towards more silent optimized cases
and kind of stepping away a little bit
from the very over-the-top high airflow
or HAF cases with you know vents
everywhere in lights and LEDs and stuff
so there's more kind of a simple elegant
yet very functional and very capable
case line so I think the 650 to s is a
winner I'd have no problems building
myself a system in this and using it
whether it be for gaming or productivity
it's a very sleek case I'm very
impressed with it so the only thing that
could have made it may be a little
better would have been a side window
especially since the components in this
thing are so pretty it would have been
nice to be able to see them but you know
I guess adding a window to that
theoretically would make it louder but
not necessarily honestly anyway there
you go guys Jay's $0.02 here looking at
the cooler master 650 - fantastic case
as far as I'm concerned so
Oh following social media if you guys
have any questions Facebook Twitter
Instagram all that fun stuff just to
hang out I love hanging out making
videos for you guys and as always thanks
for watching
pretty much every single month you get
one item that they freak out over which
kind of I guess kind of makes it worth
it unfortunately there's still no kid
shirts in the kids nerve blocks no one
touch my else</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
