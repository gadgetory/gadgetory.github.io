maybe some pain and I'm not committed
yeah yeah you gonna lie school there
anybody in here I'm not convinced I am
not convinced whatsoever ermahgerd all
right let's get some more people in here
before we start talking about some of
the news it's been very controversial in
the last couple of days regarding a
video I put up on Monday or Tuesday
choose it and that is of course that of
these steam box the valve console we got
news on you a bunch of phone the Intel
foam 4k TVs we've got all your
information that you need and we've got
a lot more we got a whole lot more we've
gotta cover this Expo convention is so
freaking big assigning the funny you
have to take buses to get in between the
venues is spread out all over Vegas is
that the venetians at the Las Vegas
hotel it is at the convention center
which is well over a million square feet
I think it's at one point two million
square feet of Expo and exhibitor space
it is crazy and right now i am at the
what they called a central hall and this
is where all of your major venues are
vendors are you've got sony nikon LG
Panasonic and gadgets right back there
behind me i'm telling you right now this
is just absolutely mind-blowing at how
big it is
and I think right now I am the biggest
little guy on YouTube bringing you're
probably one of the only live streams
aside from cnet and engadget and those
guys so I don't believe that the
comments are going to update is live as
I'd like them to so if you can see down
below in the description I said use
twitter and hashtag JS to sense i guess
i didn't put the actual hashtag in there
let's fix that and if you got questions
anything you guys want to know ask me
but I have a feeling a lot of you guys
are really wanting the inside scoop on
what I was given regarding xi3 is piston
/ steam box you've got Giants on youtube
like woodysgamertag were sitting at home
while I'm here talking to them in person
touching it and having discussions with
the owners of the company and that they
want to then tell me that I don't have
the inside scoop all right buddy listen
you're at home I'm here so let's go
ahead and get these questions coming in
here I've got like lots and lots of so
I'm going live at 9 10pm what let's go
in there and fix that how could that be
I said 1 10pm and if it's nine ten where
you are then maybe it's correct maybe
it's not and again if you ask your
question here in YouTube no guarantees
that I'm going to actually see it
because youtube comment streaming and
updating is very very very poor booboo I
don't know what's up with you man the
links were there the other day when you
said you couldn't see the username and
I'm looking right now at my stream and
it says starts 1 10pm ends 2 p.m. so I
don't know
uh no no check maybe your uh I don't
know I don't even know what to tell you
to check but it's correct on here buddy
I think Linux is lying to you my friend
we've got seven people in here I know we
can get more in here before I really
start dropping some bombs here about the
yes Jay's two cents at our hashtag Jays
to say at CES no just Jays at CES mr.
look at the descript the descriptive
door holy crap tweets are coming in
quick there's got to be more than the
seven viewers it says it has can
somebody tell me what it actually says
and pink guy if you don't like the mic
you're more than welcome to buy anyone
or you know leave whichever you want I
don't know how many of you people think
it's easy to do a live stream on
location like this it's quite an
interesting setup here so if you don't
like it not too bad seriously okay so
tgb Kyle wants to know what the drama is
that went down regarding these steam box
on the piston well xi3 is a company
that's been around for a while making
these very teeny tiny uh you know like
four inch by 6 inch he sees very very
small and it was rumored that it was
going to be the next console or the
steam box or aka piston has gone by a
few different names and the question is
whether or not that was the next steam
box and so I took video and pictures of
it and the new guys started responding
say hey that's the best the new you know
that's the new console so imma wait a
minute I hadn't actually heard that news
so we're back and asked him which at
what at that point they said I'll talk
out about it he says I'll tell you all
everything you want to know but you've
got to put down the camera we can't do
it on camera okay so naturally all the
information I started putting out was
without proof
of the you know when it comes to the
actual steam box the way that they said
it was that it was a strategic
investment by steam and we all know that
steam already invested into the xi3 but
you know they were walking around with
hats on that said piston and you know I
don't know they said that it's something
that you can expect to see very soon and
so they didn't give me a time frame they
didn't say how soon but they the smile
went from ear to ear when I said you
know the rumor is that this is the next
console and you know here's the way I
look at it steam is a software company
steam does not make hardware and steam
is not about to try and in my opinion
take a crack at becoming a hardware
company company overnight and have a
success so I believe that they may have
bought the the actual hardware and the
design off of xi3 because the way that
it sounded like it was going down was
that steam was going to become a major
partnered owner into the company in
order to develop the steam box but it
may not look the same and may not be in
the same case but the internals are very
clearly going to be that type of modular
design they want to do a modular
upgradable console over time but you
know the one of the things is okay so
what makes this an actual console when
it runs a full-fledged operating system
on it again it's one of those things
where it would probably be launched with
a proprietary operating system like you
know big picture or something like that
but you know the debate was whether or
not the thousand dollar price point was
going to be it or the you know three
hundred dollar price point I can
guarantee you the three hundred old pc
to throw up offering right now is not
going to be capable of running the games
that they're claiming that it is because
the way that they described the higher
end model was that it was like an 810
AMD equivalent and it is running an AMD
chip in it I really like to get
your questions here but the stream does
not want to update and it would be a
holiday daxing CES is going to ban and
block rampage on YouTube for people
uploading content that boosts are giving
out not the directors well you know
there's there's nothing here at CES that
isn't allowed to get out that's why they
have private booths set up they have
private press areas where only the press
are invited in and those are the guys
who are getting to release the
information like course there's brand
new keyboard I should have to see that
and play with that didn't get to take
any photos or videos of it so I'm not
worried doc thanks for your concern
however it's under control check twitter
here and see what you guys are saying
okay this look like it was used yet all
right guys start tweeting your questions
I'm only gonna be on here for a little
bit this is very interesting setup I had
going ok so what's some of the news
coming from a video except the shield I
asked I went directly there broken up
into different compartments of the booth
they have they have their GTX they have
their shield I have grid and all of that
stuff set up and they also had again a
private press area where they were
getting some of the inside scoop I did
ask about gtx770 even with the shield
they were very secretive on which makes
me wonder if that's the reason why they
called it shield was because of the fact
that it wouldn't give me a price you
wouldn't give me availability all he
would tell me was that it was a
streaming device which I kind of became
a little bit disappointed with at that
point because i don't i personally don't
like streaming games because of the
latency in the lag but he talks about
the fact that it can play bf3 and
whatnot so it just becomes a
Oh screen but i don't know that i
personally wasn't too impressed with the
shield it's not very comfortable it's
not too heavy but i know what the design
on it's going to improve i doubt it
since that's what the way they released
it I'm not too impressed with the shield
but know what you would have already
reported on is what you're going to get
regarding nvidia nvidia held their
keynote already there's nothing new and
the keynote was all about the shield i
did actually corner them i cornered them
and said hey I want to know explain to
me why the 7970 drop new drivers are now
beating up on the 680 and he did tell me
that there's drivers that are already
been released for the 680 that
apparently took the top spot back from
AMD I haven't tried yet anyway out
there's a 680 go and give it a shot I
haven't even looked up any of the new
benchmarks so I couldn't tell you but
they claim to have the top spot again
for the single GPU performance and
taking it back from the 7970 what was I
looking forward to most at CES I haven't
even gotten there yet i'm looking
forward most to google's concept as well
as Audi's on the self-driving car I want
to find out I really want to ask them
about fail-safes and safety procedures
and what they have in place to take such
a technology and make it safe on a
system a road system that's not designed
for self-driving cars so what what can
they do I did see a booth that they were
talking about proximity awareness and
cars for these self-driving vehicle so
that they're constantly speaking to
other cars nearby and they always have a
a like digital 3d map in their computer
that tells them where the other vehicles
are to keep them safe but that doesn't
do anything for pedestrians do I think
we'll see transparent computer screens
there is a transparent TV here and I'm
going to be bringing you a news coverage
on that may be doing an interview it's
over at the LG booth and there but they
do have a transparent TV LCD so it
actually looked really good I showed you
one momentarily at the video i did
yesterday for the
recap of day two at CES and the other
one I looked at was very kind of pale
obviously it was very translucent so it
lost a lot of its color brightness but
this one here it looks like when the
screen turns on its very vivid it's very
dense when the screen turns off it looks
like a almost almost like a mirror in a
way but it is completely transparent I
just I was actually at that booth when I
left to come back here and do this this
quick live stream alright let's see I
really wish the stream would update say
we got here if you guys are asking
questions in the stream again because
i'm on a 4g hotspot here it's not what
was the new mobile console i hear about
there's a few mobile consoles here
actually some of them i had never even
heard of I didn't it's over at the South
convention center cliff tension hall
right now i'll probably make my way back
there tomorrow there's still the North
Hall haven't even touched yet and we're
already halfway through day three so run
ahead of time quickly a lot of these new
mobile consoles I'm seeing the oil based
on streaming I think as the wireless
connections and the 4 g's and the Ltd's
is maturing and the speeds are
increasing they look and more and more
at doing streaming based gaming rather
than hardware console a handheld type I
mean that's that's what the shield is
from Nvidia it is a streaming console
when you have an actual pure gaming
console or handheld like yeah the razor
edge you get at a ridiculous price point
that goes along with it about twelve
hundred ninety nine dollars for a gaming
tablet that's not even 1080p if you ask
me it's a bit ridiculous on the price
what is AMD shown this year I haven't
made it to the AMD booth yet I spent a
lot I probably the last hour and a half
at the intel booth got a nice interview
there regarding them to look the lenovo
phone the
intel-based there are new mobile chips
which are running off their atom-based
processor a lot of people were wondering
what the actual processor core
architecture is gonna look like it's not
a it's not an i7 or i5 it's running on
the atom that was very impressive but
that was a nice interview looking
forward to putting that up tonight up on
the channel I asked about has well they
were only willing to really talk about
ivy bridge yeah but you know how
companies like Intel are they they want
to they want the spotlight regarding
that type of technology releasing so
they're going to hold their own press
event whenever they do actually release
as well all the tablets everything here
on our Ivy Bridge based so there is no
as well on display whatsoever what is
the best thing I've seen at CES oh man
really I'm really impressed with the
waterproofing technology for electronics
it's too bad that it's something that
will probably never make it mainstream
or become a factory applied to many of
our electronics because you know a lot
of a lot of device insurance companies
would probably see a tremendous
reduction in claims which is what makes
them money because people wouldn't be
needing the claim because most of the
one of the most common damages are one
cracked screens and to water damage and
with the gorilla glass 3 here and the
toughness of the grill gas glass 3 as
well as Samsung revealing the bendable
screen and the near future we're going
we're looking at a lot less a screen
breakage due to dropping if you add this
with the waterproofing insurances would
be really like companies like asurion
would probably end up shaking
have I seen Sony's booth what do they
have nope in fact the the rest of my
party was at the sony booth when I came
over here to do this dream I'm it's as
far away from here as you can get it's
all the way in the back of this
convention hall and you got understand
the size of this convention center I
like i said the conventions that are
alone as a million square feet Jay I
have a AMD 77 take another sandstone or
new graphics card 77 seventies really
towards the bottom in there so you know
I I don't know if the 70 is 770 would be
really worth cross firing but yeah I've
gotten some free samples they're all
back at the hotel right now I haven't
really gotten too much today but the
central hall that I'm in right now is
where all of the tech giants are I do i
do have one company that's going to be
sending me it's that tilt company
they're gonna send me one of those
mobile charging stations as well as a
really neat um windshield mount for your
phone what that runs entirely it's it's
entirely based off of a non residue
sticky compound and they're going to
send me one of those and possibly one of
the backpacks there's a mic company all
right number than my company but it's a
electronics company that's developing
electronics right now that I'm going to
be and I'm going to be actually helping
with the rd of a shotgun style
microphone that's designed for youtubers
that would work both with cameras
point-and-shoots as well as laptops and
full recording studios so that you can
have a single mic solution and looking
forward to the participating the R&amp;amp;D on
that it's a company that's actually
right near my house so I'm not gonna
have to go too far to go and see their
lab
how much were those tilt bags they
ranged in price he said they started out
of $99 odd and they went up to as high
as I think he said 169 it really depends
on the features of the bag as well as
the size of the battery it's gonna have
multiple size batteries go along with it
and boogies made it in here so I hope to
see a nice increase in viewers here I
prior to go back over my steam box
discussion another book is in here but
you know the bottom line when it comes
to the xi3 in the steam box is xi3 has
definitely pioneered the micro computer
and I don't think the steam box is going
to look anything like the piston but I
believe it's going to support xi3 s
internals that's the thing steam is a
software company they are not a hardware
company there they are not going to be
able to build you know jump into the
hardware game and build anything that is
going to be you know constructed by them
they're going to outsource it next I
three is already established they're
already there and steam has mated a very
large contribution to the xi3 company
and rumors have it that it's even taken
up a part ownership into the company and
so a lot of people saying that this is
this is not the steam box this is not
the steam box you know you girls are
just gonna have to wait and see the
components are there the components are
perfect it's more than likely going to
look different obviously because steam
is going to want to look unique and
something that's going to fit into their
particular style but I can tell you
right now based on the conversations
that I had the xi3 internals is the
steam box and they're working on a
operating system the the ship with it
obviously it's going to want to likely
be the big picture is going to be the
operating system but they want it to be
a lot like Xbox where it's going to be
here you can be able to do a lot of
things on it like Netflix and live
streaming and everything else
I think it's realistic that Sony's gonna
put the 7970 in the ps4 I haven't made
it over to Sonia and I mean these are
the kind of questions i'm going to ask
them when you guys give me a question
i'm going to i take it directly to i put
them on the spot some of the time
sometimes they've asked me to stop
recording is they don't like the
questions I'm asking so we'll see where
that goes all right let's check Twitter
here what I think of a SmartWatch which
one there's a few here there's actually
a few smart watches here um you have to
tell me exactly which one I have not
seen the eating screen by the way is
there anything I'm a hundred percent
sure on buying when it comes out oh boy
I did an interview on otterbox regarding
their new charging a cell phone case
it's a bit pricey it's one hundred
twenty nine dollars i haven't put up the
interview yet because i have to try and
work on the audio he wasn't very loud so
it was very difficult to understand him
but it's a i think he said 2,800
milliamp battery pack but the cool thing
about it is the fact that it's not like
conventional battery packs from like
mophie or you know some of the other
companies out there where it just drains
the battery down and then you know it
keeps the phone one percent while it's
draining the battery pack and then it
runs off the phone battery what it does
is it the phones at one hundred percent
and when the phone drops down to 99 it
will pull one percent back from the
battery pack bring the phone back to one
hundred percent and then show off the
battery pack so it's constantly going 99
you know and then back to 100 and then
the battery pack will just drop down
slowly and it runs off of an app there's
an app that
it controls the battery pack which
allows you to set up profiles and
different things that you wanted to do
it also shows you a real-time meter of
percentages between the two batteries
and it gives you a down to the minute
expectation of how long your battery is
going to last and what time the battery
will die and since I do a lot of on
location shooting I do a lot of the
vlogging and stuff I'm in the market for
a battery pack and I'm really interested
in this otter box so maybe I'll put up
that interview tonight I haven't decided
yet again I have to work on the audio
because it's not too great see is it
going to be a better firewall there yeah
there cisco is here unfortunately when i
went up to cisco it's one of those
companies that again they only want to
have certain people in there so it's
private it was closed off and but they
were talking about cloud-based firewalls
cloud-based security as well as client
base firewall and security see boogie
wants to know about that nanotech
waterproofing by the way was that
for real yeah it's for real the fact
there's several vendors here that are
sporting that exact same technology if
you go back and look at my day one recap
of CES you'll see that one of the
companies has a display setup where they
have an iPad in the Samsung and an
iphone and LG phone at thinks whole
bunch of phones and they have like a
waterfall just like constantly falling
on the device as well as I can aquarium
tank below it and they were you know
they'd poke they wanted you to come up
and just dump the stuff in there and I'm
telling you now it's one hundred percent
real at one point I saw a galaxy that
was put in the water kind of like the
screen kind of flickered for a second
but it came back my question to them
which they they didn't answer was about
the this is designed to be under
constant users this is kind of like a
one or two time use where once it's
exposed to the element if it's going to
wear off so because it's a gas it's not
actually a pitts not actually a solid it
is a gues and apparently it's creating a
barrier between the electronics and the
water so I don't know exactly how that
works the shitty part about it is the
fact that this isn't something you and I
can buy and just apply to our device
that
I had to be completely disassembled and
every component individually coated with
this stuff and what they're looking at
doing here is selling the technology and
I looking at selling the application to
us as consumers they want somebody to
come in and buy the technology and start
using it with their own particular
products and somebody just popped up
back there and is now on the live stream
the wife that doesn't exist now just
walked away anyway yeah I think it's
really really cool you know water damage
i guess i said earlier is probably one
of the most common types of damage done
to our mobile devices break the wallace
wants to know are my am I going to get
Samsung's 110 inch TV i'd have to get
110 inch wall first what I think about
microns new terabyte class SSD I think
it's amazing i was talking them about it
was talking about twelve hundred
megabytes per second read/write speeds
the price on it though my god it's going
to take a do i think bendable phones are
going to be released this year there was
already a booth here that was
demonstrating the bendable phone it
wasn't samsung even though Samsung salon
its building the bendable screen at the
keynote yesterday they displayed some
pretty neat concept applications for
that with a rollout screen so the phone
almost look like a tube and then you can
pull out the screen when you're done put
it back as well as a really neat like
almost like a wallet it's there they're
talking about building an entirely new
class a mobile device where it's a thing
of a flip phone but it's about the size
of it's about the size of the galaxy
when it's closed you have a galaxy you
know style screen on the front like the
s3 or maybe the note but you flip it
open and then you get a bigger screen on
the inside and it's a foldable screen so
you switch between the two they also
demonstrated the concept of a wrap abul
screen where the screen would wrap
around the side of the device it's nice
and contoured so that when the device is
closed you would have like a thin strip
you know at the top of your Android your
iPhone do you get your notification bar
and something comes in
you can see the text along the top the
idea about that is as you have your you
know you have your device like this on
the edge of the device you would be able
to read and see notifications without
actually opening up your device it was
actually very very cool says I her ps4
can't play used games is that true I you
know I didn't I've been made it over
Sony yet we all know about the rumors
when it comes to the their patent about
blocking use games and stuff in the used
game market go where boogie2988 channel
of Francis's rant about that granted it
was a rant it was an it was a persona is
every word of it was absolutely true on
the way we should feel about that about
as consumers I've talked about this in
an earlier techadon about the movie
market where people want manufacturers
were and production companies were
looking at blocking the selling of used
movies which really sucks because of the
fact that actually I take that back it
was about the selling of used
electronics and and companies like Sony
wanting to get their hands on you know
that money that trans that takes place
between private sales and getting a
royalty on that which I don't think is
right because once you've already sold
the product they've made their money why
should they get multiple incomes on the
same product it's a little bit different
than what Sony was trying to do with the
use game market but I don't know it
really pisses me off because it's going
to put a lot in the time right now when
the economy around the world is
definitely garbage the last thing you
want to do is try and close off the
private sector because I mean they're
gonna see they're gonna shoot themselves
in the foot because people are no longer
going to be buying used games because of
you our new games I'm sorry because new
games are just too expensive for a lot
of people to buy I mean twenty nine
dollars for an old game 49 to 69 or 59
$69 for a new game a lot of people can't
afford that so they're just going to
stop buying games and companies like
Sony or their greed is going to
ultimately
it's gonna kill the gaming market i
refresh the stream here I'm not getting
any updates strong up I'm at a hundred
percent though off like opponent okay um
no 110 inch screen I answered that all
right what do we got here was the steam
box there okay Carlos aight i have a
feeling this is what i'm going to be
talking about a lot it's the discussion
between xi3 s micro pc and whether or
not that's the new steam box the debate
is whether or not whether or not it is
the next console and the information
that I was given says that that steam
has every bublik everybody knows that
steam made a investment into xi3 based
on the information that was given the
internals of the xi3 are certainly going
to be the internals of the steam box but
however the casing of the steam box will
probably be something custom designed
for steam steam is not a hardware
company everyone's coming back at me
saying no steam is going to make their
own students who make their own steams
are they're gonna make their own steam
is not a hardware company steve has to
outsource that just somebody who's
already developed the hardware and that
company is xi3 in fact all of the reps
walking around there weren't willing to
even say the word piston to me but all
of their hats said piston on it so you
take that for what you will as razors
shown any new computers all they showed
was an update to their razor blade a
very a very pricey 2499 dollar gaming
laptop that only comes with a 660m
complete waste of money in my opinion
when he was demonstrating um I remember
Jamie was demonstrating gun I think it
was I don't even care the game he was
demonstrating actually looked quite
laggy to me 30 to 40 frames per second
at best so I mean it's an econ it's a
neat computer but for the price oh god
no no way is it free to get into CES
it depends on who you are I got in for
free but CES is not open to the public
yeah boogie wants to kill Gabe if it's
not in a companion cube have at it hey i
dishonored thank you Johan it was
dishonored he was playing and I what's
funny about that is the fact that it
looked like it ran better on the tablet
then it did on the pc then again the
tablet wasn't running 1080 i think it
was like 768 of what it was running it
at see what other comments we got here
make sure look at the twitter looks like
i failed on the twitter link down there
tonight let me fix that twitter link
it's going to be better for you to tweet
your questions to me because this
YouTube streams are garbage when it
comes to the comment updating so I get
it like five minutes after you guys say
it probably took you okay I just updated
the comments there that is my Twitter
minus the ! bail Jesus there okay use
that link down in the comments and tweet
me a question if you want a question
answered what if I thoughts about
project shield I don't know I can't
formulate a real response to that yet
for two reasons one he wouldn't give me
a pricing on it so I can't formulate an
a thought on it until I know how much it
is because it's all face it everything
around here is based on price and so
it's two hundred dollars okay great
that's awesome if it's seven hundred
dollars no hell no yeah fart guy good
name yeah that the razor blade was
entirely overpriced and I was thoroughly
disappointed with it I did get an
interview about the razor blade maybe
I'll put that up tonight so you guys can
see um you know I'm completely
independent here I'm not gonna I'm not
going to sugarcoat any interview
so i'm going to show you guys exactly
what it is and you can see it did not
perform very well whatsoever and it was
five hundred dollars less than that
Sager notebook that I reviewed last year
and the sager came into 6 ATM and did
absolutely amazing the stream priests
are we still live LTE for the loss okay
over life what do I think about the
nvidia grid I think it's any concept
like i said earlier in the stream i
think a lot of things are are moving
towards cloud-based not just your
storage or your I mean ultraviolets here
you know they're really pushing the
they're really pushing this the the
cloud-based you know they're trying to
get away from what Apple has been doing
with itunes and so you see a lot of
things are launching now blu-ray why's
that have ultraviolet and don't come
with a digital copy because the idea
here is that you should be able to watch
it on all your devices the problem with
the way digital copy works is you a lot
of them require that you use iTunes and
once you download it on the one device
there was a while there you couldn't
even download it onto other devices
because of the fact that they wanted you
to you know that DRM content so ultra
violet says you can keep an entire
storage of our movies online and stream
it to any device so that's what they're
doing now with gaming and that's the
concept of grid grid you can take any
game that you already own store it in
the cloud and play it on the shield
which is nothing more than a tablet that
has a controller attached to it and play
any pc game any console game on a
wireless device hi Josh how does the 4k
TV look like I saw that today I walked
up to him with my wife and I kind of
went I was looking at it and it was
incredibly sharp obviously it was so
sharp you they were they were
demonstrating a foot hose over that
Panasonic okay i was looking at
Panasonic's first and then i went to LG
and LG had a head like at least a
hundred of these things so its up into a
3d wall
was amazing two things regarding the 4k
TV one it's incredibly expensive like a
46-inch TV we were looking at like five
thousand six thousand dollars and that
was cheap that man is a that's a cheap
Freud I mean with some of these guys are
just displaying you know 100 inch
screens that are running for you know
twenty thirty thousand dollars but the
it's almost too sharp for me it takes
away a lot of I mean let's face it you
take a lot of post-processing on movies
and what happens is they will add grain
and they will add some fuzziness to it
to only show just allowed to eat so I
guess they'll add some fuzziness and
some grain to it to give it kind of a
gritty feel but then you take something
that's this sharp and when you have a
company that's added grain to it like
let's just look at the Batman series for
instance they've added grain to that the
grain is too sharp you can see you can
actually see where the overlay of the
grain was put on to the video and so
what that really does to me it makes me
feel like it's going to put a lot of
stress on post-production and special
effects artists because the special
effects amount going to start looking
very fake kind of like how the 120 Hertz
CD first debut you know ten years ago
whatever was maybe not quite 10 but it
made things look a lot less believable
in my opinion so I don't know what 4k is
going to do when it comes to the special
effects field but in my opinion it was
too sharp way too sharp fusionfall boy I
can't answer that right now on the
stream and that's just too in depth of
an answer you know um the oh yeah I
haven't seen it I've been looking it's
not I guess rumor said it was here I
don't see it then again since it's a
Kickstarter based company the one of the
requirements again in the CES is you
have to be a company that's already
established and have sold a product to
eat and qualify to reply so if it's not
released yet you can't if you don't have
pre-release product you can't get into
CES
hi terminal okay let's check the Twitter
going to see the tweets and there is a
lot of okay we'll start from the I've
seen so many booths okay anything under
stand by what I think of a SmartWatch I
was pretty cool there was a lot of
features of it it ran off a little
little version of Android they had a the
one I looked at had a little camera on
it and you could do like video calling
on it it was it had all sorts of things
and it was almost like it was at the
health summit to it could measure your
heart rate it could measure all sorts of
things it was really neat I didn't get a
price on it though where my thoughts on
the luminate glass keyboard haven't seen
it Frank do I think the cloud gaming
concept will replace two thousand dollar
pc gaming I don't think so because the
way that they described it is in order
to get that stream through the cloud
it's still having to run ultimately on
us on a pc so I not clear on whether or
not that means you have to have a PC
that's capable of running these games or
if it's gonna once you save the game to
the cloud if their servers are going to
be doing all the rendering and streaming
it said to me at the cloud and like the
grid sounds more like a gateway to
disperse the signal to your devices
rather than actually being the host of
the gaming experience so I don't know
about that one yet I met to get some
more clarification what is my pc specs
you can go to a my main channel page and
look at the info on the right so that
will drop down and to give you the specs
to my pc intel said they might not talk
about intel TV did you happen to catch
any info on that I didn't because I was
at the intel booth and had just finished
an interview with them Lenovo and the
intel atom processor for smart phones
and devices and looked at the time and
practically ran over here to this
samsung station charging station to be
able to do my livestream what I think
about the Microsoft CES conference I
didn't see it
I didn't say I was more interested in
Samsung's kino there any xbox stuff here
haven't made it to the microsoft booth
yet but the microsoft booth is in here
and i've got i've only seen maybe a
third of this conference so far at even
the third that i've seen i missed a lot
of stuff what I think with AMD 8350i
think it's a good processor for the
money why am i why i thought JS was
black they thought i was black have you
ever watched my channel bro Oh jay-z
yeah well I can't rap so sorry to
disappoint did I see the table computer
for 1699 yeah I saw it I saw plenty of
videos of it but I think I think we're
well beyond the table computer in my
opinion AMD or intel depends on how much
money you got Jason since how are you
streaming from there a laptop a 4g
hotspot a built-in webcam and a
cheap-ass microphone and i'm using a lot
you guys are saying why am i not why am
I not seeing stuff on a Twitter
regarding video and stuff this is what
I'm taking all of my video with right
here so it's takes time to take this
back to the hotel and render it and
stuff I haven't made it to bed before
midnight any day that I've been here yet
and so when I leave here usually end up
going back to the hotel and spending the
rest of the evening rendering getting
everything together I haven't seen
google's booth yet in fact I don't even
know where they are yet I really really
want to go and see the self-driving car
that's what I really want to see $300
AMD or intel you got 300 bucks go intel
get an 80 to get a 3770k someone's
asking about pizza has nothing to do
with CES
hey guys I'm only streaming for 10 more
minutes get your questions in and then
I'm shutting this thing down 20k for TV
yeah the first lcds were they were like
small to they're like 30 32 inch TV s
that worth twenty thousand dollars back
in two thousand what a sign Heiser have
sine sine Heiser sennheiser is in the
first there in the first haul that we
went to yesterday i didn't stop by their
booth i plan on trying to get back to
that particular hall before this event
is over if i don't but they had a lot of
stuff there that you know microphones a
lot of wireless technologies were there
of course dark darkness direct i'm
having a ton of fun here in vegas this
is going to become an annual thing for
me now that I'm in I'm always in in my
goal and I need you guys's help with
this is I want to get into those press
areas guys like linus tech tips and
whatnot they're getting in there and
they're doing it because of their
exposure to youtube and even samsung
mentioned how YouTube is the driver for
technology youTube allows anybody to say
anything they want and they more people
are getting out on YouTube than any sort
of advertising period so they are really
driving for mobile connectivity to get
guys like me and linus tech tips you
know any any of the major youtubers can
now get online do their phone and such
so they're trying to make things a lot
more connective a lot more connected so
now they have the Google the Nexus I'm
sorry the galaxy camera which has full
operating system android on it which
allows me to take a high-definition
video edit it right on the camera and
wirelessly throw it up to youtube so
they're recognizing that YouTube is a is
the future driver of Technology and
awareness and so my goal through 2013 is
to grow enough in YouTube to get to
where I can get a press pass and get
back seeing or backstage with some of
these companies and get you guys some
real information
so I added a resolution in 2013 to see
just how far I can grow this channel
that way I can make a reality of next
year getting behind these boots and
getting into these private suites I did
manage to actually finagle my way into
Corsairs private suite I mean that was
at the hotel the Venetian it was up in a
private room and I managed to get in
there and get hands-on with some stuff
that I wasn't even allowed to see I
guess simply because um you know again
it was one of those things he did want
to let me in but you mentioned YouTube
and they're like okay come on in so
again that's my goal in 2013 boogie
wants to know let's see where'd you
tweet go Emma boogie wants to know which
most highly recommended item I've seen
so far anything everyone needs
definitely the waterproofing the
waterproofing the electronic device ro
the waterproofing technology
unfortunately I don't think is ever
gonna make it mainstream because it puts
too many companies at a loss of revenue
you know because one of two things are
going to happen they're going to make it
so expensive to to put this on the
device and divide the device knowing
they're not going to get replacements
due to water damage that we're going to
want to make up that cost through a huge
markup on the technology or to the
insurance companies that ensure these
devices are going to make it
astronomically expensive to insure the
device because they know that they're
not going to get those claims in for
water so I that has got to be one of the
coolest things I've seen here at CES is
out and take a take a phone or a tablet
and just stick it under water he was he
was talking about the benefits of those
people who are addicted to their smells
their cell phones and if you go watch my
cell phone addiction video you'll know
exactly what I'm talking about or you
can just take a shower with your phone
it's a little bit extreme but hey you
know if that's how you want to use it
did I see the virtual pharrell reality
hardware yet not yet my friend there's
just so much here to see with my opinion
on the steam box will it rid console
gaming for good no nothing more rid
console gaming for good console gaming
is there for a reason it fills a gap
between PC and handheld some people
including myself one I just
uh go sit in the living room turn on the
TV and just have it instantly turn on
and play a game I don't always want to
go sit at my desk my computer I don't
think console game is going anywhere in
fact console gaming is only going to
evolve oh you know what someone asked
about Xbox earlier I did get to see a
demonstration of the Microsoft mented
reality technology that they kind of
prey alluded to in there 720
demonstration or the other low
presentation okay I can't really you
guys might be able to see it back this
like some sumo guys walking around
dancing who is that I can't show you
guys that okay hey sorry got a little
sidetracked there by a bunch of a sumo
dancing disco ok what else things I got
to see a demo of that augmented reality
where it takes your screen and it
extends it beyond the screen with the
lighting effects so it's like an
immersion you know emergent field where
if you get any shot you know the whole
room would start flashing at you or you
know fire would go on the wall sort of
thing and that was really cool i really
like that stop asking about pizza i'm
not answering you console gaming will
die a little if they decide to block use
games yeah but that's not the console
makers fault that's the publishers fault
of the of the games so be mad at them I
see anything from blackberry black who
if much if me my wife were here where is
my girl then where is our daughter I'll
get back to you on that one she in the
trunk okay guys five more minutes five
more minutes and also I mentioned it on
my on my vlog channel which I know
probably none of you have seen because
nobody watches the vlogs and that's
perfectly okay I am giving away an aim
at brand new AMD a10 3870 k processor
it's an FM two socket I believe sorry
and I'm going to be giving that away
sometime when I return from CES so you
have to be following me on Twitter and
you have to be subscribed to my
technology channel let's just want to
hear Jays two cents hit the subscribe
buttons right under the video you can't
miss it you want a chance at winning
that processor then you better subscribe
now the sea Intel's perceptual computing
I think it might have been in their
clothes portion of their Intel boos I
walk all over the intel booth and I
didn't see it said it earlier my
favorite product is by far the
waterproofing concept for electronic
devices and that's not something that
would work just for cell phones works
for anything electronic so if you if you
fly RC cars or RC planes fly RC cars you
drive RC cars and fly RC planes you
could waterproof your servos are sort of
us with your speed controls and your
receivers and now you can go take your
electric cars out into the rain and not
even worry about it how many big
youtubers have I seen at CES haven't
seen too many of them but people who I
know we're here Lamarr Wilson from
Wilson tech one is here linus tech tips
he's here shaycarl is here iJustine is
here her sister jenna is eric is here
frizz is here there's a lot of actually
a lot of youtubers here
waterproof your your laptop there for
more minutes guys let's get these
questions in here because I'm going to
shut this thing down and you guys are
not going to see me again ever I'm gonna
get lost i'm going to stay i don't want
to leave wanted i'm gonna strap myself
to a pole with duct tape if you loved me
you would take me to a pole and not let
me leave I want that me that I want this
this lanyard for this lanyard play this
it's like it's like I'm a like I'm at a
rave you guys can't really tell but its
its flashing make it slower where am I
going home I am leaving Friday how am i
enjoying CES 2013 in general oh my god
it's some if you're trying to report on
CES like I am it's a hell of a lot of
work whereas you know I feel bad for the
people in my group because of the fact
that what at the end of the day they
want to go out and go and do things but
you know i'm i'm stuck in the hotel
recording until are not recording about
editing until like 1130 at night and our
days start early yesterday started at
6am and i think i hit the bed at like
1230 at night so it was a lot there long
days but man you look back there and you
just walk forever hey f hey f34 if you
want to know about the steam box you're
going to have to rewatch the stream i've
already talked about it about four times
mostly because of the fact that it's so
controversial there's been so much
discussion on it already on my on my
tweets from day one so do me a favor
RiRi watch the stream you'll see it it's
one of the first things I discuss maybe
10 minutes into it and you'll get some
of that information there Adam Johnson
says hey hey
yeah it's fine that you just got it I've
been streaming since about 110 I'm going
to stop the stream in like two minutes
two minutes last chance for questions
checking Twitter there is a game summit
today I don't think I'm going to make it
to it though unfortunately sorry guys
for this whole different hall it's like
a half mile from here it's an all day
thing then maybe I will make it to the
okay there's six speakers or four panels
and it's called the game summit and it's
all about the future and technologies of
gaming and I need to make my ass over
there but there's just so much to see
and this is gonna be an annual thing I
will be here every single year like I
said now that I'm in I'm in the system
and I can come whenever I want for free
and tickets for late registration is I
think two hundred and fifty dollars but
again it's not open to the public at one
guy say oh I just walk right in there no
you're not there is there is security
here like you wouldn't believe there are
some little old ladies here that will
hit you with their cane I swear let's
see it's two o'clock okay let me get in
these questions as they sit now I'm
locking it down or as boogie we call it
Thunderdome how do I become your
favorite youtuber so fast I don't know
how'd you become my favourite viewer
just that quickly you serve game a
subscriber thank you very much
appreciate that any cool game
accessories there you know turtle
beaches here razors here others other
companies here you know I didn't see
anything new MC not everybody you
understand CES is it's not just the
place where people are bringing out
their emerging technologies and doing
releases of brand new stuff but it's
where people are trying to get customers
a lot of people walking around here are
just met international distributors
their business owners and these is where
everyone collaborates and starts getting
business connections CES is all about
business connections and so a lot of
people here are simply here for the
that they're trying to expose themselves
to other companies and get people to buy
their products so it's not all new
product so I didn't see anything new
from from turtle beach razor already
talked about their gaming console never
a new laptop they're extremely
overpriced laptop I'm a refresh here
three two one alright since our resident
celebrity in this stream is boogie I'm
gonna give boogie an opportunist one
last question and if he doesn't have one
that we are going to go ahead and say
goodbye and if you guys want to know
what I saw today you're gonna just
you're going to absolutely have to watch
the footage tonight and there may be a
chance that I won't even put up footage
tonight make you guys wait till the end
of the show because there is some of the
coolest stuff I've seen the show yet is
all here and just to give you guys an
idea of how crowded it is oh yeah I
ready I'll see that yes I miss ya it is
the 150,000 people here in over 150,000
people at this conference and I use a
Logitech MX 18 oh that's another thing
that really pissed me off buggy I know
you're still listening I wanted to go
check out logitech and guess what it was
private invite-only that really pissed
me off cuz you know how much i like
logitech products i really wanted to see
it I want to go in there and see what
was new but new we didn't give you knew
he was fluency to poland p yes
150,000 people in this front at this
conference
I have a feeling though that the coolest
things I'm going to find at this
conference are going to be in this hall
and I've only been in here for three
hours or so and I stood in line at
Starbucks for 45 minutes because we
actually overslept this morning all of
us did there's four of us here all right
I don't see any questions from boogie I
don't see anything else I want to answer
so alright guys that's when Jays two
