few seconds of it without
to get clean

weekend flavor day right
yeah another so many American holidays
oh I I dread the drive back that's why I
brought the carpool lane buddy with me

getting there but getting back there's
lots of time for shenanigans Oh
yesterday I'm fine oh it's going it's
good I was going I hate the alive that
stuff right actually walked away from
coconut monkey a little bit he he
doesn't actually know that I'm going to
be buying him an SSD while we're here on
this trip he's needed one forever and he
helps me out so much with the channel
and things that I do and he comes over
anytime I need him to come help do
something I figured least I can do is
help him out so hey des come check out
what I found
Thank You chef isn't it cool

a raid
yeah which okay so it's a batch 33 4 2 4

stepping wood I heard that m0 was like
one of the good steppings steppings bro

build these are really cheap high and
this brand doesn't actually put the
inhalant like bittering it I'm just
kidding guys it please I love it just
kidding
and then we bought we bought Nick and
SSD huh so this is this is for you
helping me as much as you do on the
channel so oh this is yours thank you I
already told them I was gonna buy uh
what you told them I told them oh you
just found out they already knew got the
event I just watch youtube feed books no
I just said it the video isn't made yet
no but in the Ryan come on I'll figure
it out I'll figure this one out when you
watch this video uh-huh you will see
that in there I walked away from you so
I could tell them I was gonna buy you an
SSD oh so yeah anyway it but it that
that's kind of an expensive price so
yeah I got it on sale it's worth Nick
coconut monkey is worth sale price yeah
cuz you know carpool dummies Thank You
Jake now I like to wait for you to
freakin load in battlefield constantly
it'll happen watch but I think it's
glorious look at it
it just Labor Day weekend a little bit
minute having babies ever gone what
every self-respecting fat man does feed
our face somewhere down here there's an
in and out and a chick filling oh yes
and I said should we get in and out or
chick-fil-a because they're right next
to each other and coconut monkey said
why not both and how it's like she knows
something
fat man approved Paris man look at all
these cars that we're they all coming
from don't they all know I'm trying to
get home don't I get home too I'm with
you sir there's no carpool a mister no
that's a shame
he'd run it
it's empty brat go baby
and two miles there's a bed in this trap
think of it okay I do fully expect it to
take us three hours to get back by the
way and what time is it now 438 438 all
right so next time we check in on
Technica Oh merging traffic it's a
Toyota my natural enemy
I'm in a Nissan that's the joke Oh best
to class my ask what you it was
like beat people lay down the best like
how we're now referring to Honda's as
rapping on or boy you ain't brown this
is what you this is what you do when you
have a three hour drive ahead of you
with some cool PC hardware that you
don't even get to play with until like
tomorrow and well I don't think
skunkworks is going to take me that long
I only have to pull out all of the
tubing pull out the motherboard pull out
all the wiring at the third 780 putting
at the tubing actually cut put in hope
the actual CPU tubes line up yeah that's
like a that's like a half an hour job
oil change not bad is it like in 15 of
transmission for me yeah I run over
which exit to get off I'll be like oh
there it is and I'm a flip a bitch
hey 441 copy right all right man come on
that is what happens when you many
subscribers comes as much responsibility
that's responsibility if you gets a
place in Egypt okay do that's the same
business off through it that's the same
beautiful freeway no it's not
big off one exit really yeah no
something's changed in the matrix
Tippett deja vu it's in here we need
weapons
you know good food me fool
Wow now you got clearance well how would
it not feel me bad there's times like I
said okay where do where do we want to
go chick-fil-a let's park right in the
middle so we can just watch either side
yeah we have to put the processor and
stuff under lock and key but see
wherever position you can see it from
both places okay it's not like if I saw
someone breaking into the car that I
could actually run out here fast enough
to catch anybody that's true can't
decide if we want to eat a chick-fil-a
or in doubt if you guys actually live in
the area you guys know exactly where we
are that's a 55 and that's Lincoln so
you could be like hey I know where they
are
okay so we're gonna actually flip a coin
to see where we end up I suppose
Thanks all right so what's what guys is
in and out tails is chick-fil-a all
right it's not that was how the coin is
it no good there we go whoo pretty go oh
took away yeah I said yeah or do we have
to watch the replay it's the bird we're
going to the chicken okay we about to
get run over by a motorcycle that's a
scientific way of figuring out where to
eat actually you flip a coin and then
you still argue over which side was
which as I forget you said heads of
Internet that's true so I guess by
default the opposite side would be the
other place yeah but tails makes sense
because it's an eagle bird chicken
Wow Wow Wow can't believe it
I don't know still look like a pedophile
without my goatee it's got done eating
at chick-fil-a and apparently this guy
was serious now we're going over to in
and out feet way more than I do even
right 5:33 and it chick-fil-a and in and
out run later bosz for food this guy
wanted to dinners like I said is a snow
burger I just got a no I got I have a
chicken sandwich and my Chris cut fries
and I was good this guy's like oh I
thought we were going to in and out I
was like I'm just just kidding he's like
no but I was serious so we went to in it
out and I got a shake which I drink half
of and threw the rest away
about to get plowed in to buy a Prius
and then we could just sit in food cut
my blog smart but I figured we could do
that right now since he ready get food
all right you steer ROFL okay I used to
actually do that to my wife when I was
bored he sounds really mean and you know
some of the pranks I pulled but like
we'd be coming up to a turn or something
the freeway I'd be like alright you
better steer and she's like haha no I'm
like you better steer and I would flat
out that just not grab the wheel and she
was like okay come on come on she's like
steering it front Pat's with her side of
my god this is kind of cool so yeah
there's probably plenty of risks I've
taken with my life for the sake of a
good joke like going in public with this
guy it's risky answer collateral
yeah I'm guaranteed to get pulled over
at least can't say that can you oh I'm
guaranteeing that's what I'm saying you
in the car
