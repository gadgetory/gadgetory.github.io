may have seen our last talking head
video where we talked about the new 20
series family from Nvidia I talked about
some of the specs and really it's just
sort of a recap of the keynote without a
lot of opinion in there because it takes
time for us to absorb that information
obviously the public has absorbed that
information and there is a lot of
opinion floating around and a lot of it
negative so I kind of want to address
some of that give you guys some food for
thought and give you my two cents now
that I've had some time to kind of
absorb and process the information that
is out there MSI brings ultrathin gaming
to life at their new GS 65 stealth the
four point nine millimeter bezel 144
Hertz 1080p panel Nvidia graphics and
8th gen Intel CPUs make the new GS 65
self a true powerhouse with a small
footprint find out more and how to
preorder by following the link in the
description below so after the keynote
is over typically what happens at these
events is they drop black curtains
everywhere and then there are gaming
stations set up there's real time you
know VR and racing simulators and all
the games that were kind of showcased at
Gamescom that are gonna be utilizing ray
tracing and stuff with the new cards are
on display for the people in attendance
at the keynote to get hands on with and
inevitably you probably saw a reddit
post and or a Twitter post and whatever
it got this got really reposted and got
a lot of traction about a gentleman who
played shadow of the Tomb Raider with
ray tracing on and was only getting 30
FPS in 1080p and that caused a lot of
stir in the gaming community
unfortunately there's a lot of ignorance
in the gaming community and people who
truly don't understand they just the
only language they speak is FPS and they
don't understand what's actually
happening with this we want to
straighten some of that out I want to
talk about pricing and I want to talk
about the mentality of pre-ordering and
why you should never pre-order in my
opinion anything not just graphics cards
or games or cars just pre-ordering is
always a bad idea the company should
earn your money and let's talk about
that
now the twenty series cards specifically
those cards that are going to be using
touring the 15 the 60 are gonna be
geforce not touring they are designed
and built around ray tracing that's no
surprise we've talked about that ray
tracing is the newest well it's really
not new but it's the newest available
thing on
grade cards that's able to actually
handle ray-tracing in real time that's
why the keynote was like 95% rate racing
let's face it 100% rate racing and
Jensen was really really getting off on
that because it's something they've been
working on for 10 years obviously he's
hugely emotionally and financially
invested into that core and that's why
that keynote talked about that but the
thing that really was missing from the
keynote which is which was very odd
because every in vini event I've ever
attended where a new card is introduced
they showed generation on generation
improvement in terms of fps even then I
take those slides with a grain of salt
you always should with Nvidia AMD Intel
you should always take the independent
reviewers and kind of mash up a bunch of
those and form your own opinion but that
was missing entirely there was not a
single graph showing FPS all they showed
was rate racing performance generation
on generation which is why I showed in
the mentioned in the last video take it
with a grain of salt it's marketing BS
you can't take a card like the Pascal
core which is just rasterization and
compare it with rate real-time rate
racing of course a card built for it is
going to destroy it
it's like taking a card that's not built
for double precision and pairing against
a card that's built for double precision
is saying look how much better this card
is of course it was built for it so
that's exactly what happened here but
because there were no FPS benchmarks
people lost their minds maybe that could
mean there's not as big of a gap as
you'd be expecting of course it's not a
5x gap like they're showing on Pascal
it's probably more like 8.25%
or 0.25 percent no 25% improvement which
is kind of what we've seen year-on-year
linus has done this video I've done this
video in terms of where we take five or
six generations of cards compare them
with the latest games the latest drivers
and we see 20 to 25 percent year-on-year
improvement and I think that's probably
what we're going to more expect to see
rasterization is literally how every
game has been rendered until today
because now we're doing it with ray
tracing rasterization and ray tracing
are not directly comparable which is why
when you saw this article going around
of a gentleman that was very upset that
he was only getting 1080p 30fps with ray
tracing turned on or r-tx on and that
caught a lot of traction a lot of gamers
were like oh my god this car a stupid
card is super slow why are we only
getting 30 fps
getting 30fps with that mode enabled
which is hugely impressive if you even
remotely understood what has to take
place for real-time ray-tracing to
happen now that doesn't mean
rasterization gaming performance is
going to suck it means it's probably
going to be through the roof the thing
is you're just seeing two completely
different approaches and how it was
handled the problem is - you're seeing a
card that is not out yet with drivers
that are not fully matured yet on a game
that is not fully built yet so I think
this is just this was just fuel for a
lot of people to get super upset and
salty I saw a lot of people even say I'm
canceling my pre-order I don't I don't
believe you let me tell you why if you
were the kind of guy that's gonna run
out on day one and do the pre-order on
the same information that we all had now
suddenly you're just like this this card
sucks I don't think either one you never
pre-ordered to begin with or to I don't
think you really cancelled your
pre-order but that's besides the point
you can't directly compare the two but
that leads again to the speculation that
it almost at AMD that Nvidia this felt
kind of like an AMD press conference to
be honest the fact that Nvidia never
showed any gaming performance figures at
all with the standard dx12 and
rasterization and all that stuff that
led a lot of skepticism which meant a
lot of room for people to speculate
which is what you're seeing now you are
seeing speculation passed off as fact
when nobody has the details no reviewers
have their cards yet no reviewers have
been hands-on with the exception of what
they experienced at the after-party
after the keynote we all have to play
the waiting game now because you're not
gonna see any reviews until like
probably right before launch or at
launch that's my that's my best guess
now let's talk about pricing because
that was the other reason people got
super mad why is it 80 I'm gonna say 10
atti at least once in this video guys
it's I've been saying it for last two
and a half years why is a 20 atti $1000
oh my god why is it $1200 on NVIDIA
site-wide they raised the price 300
bucks or whatever it is there's
something I think a lot of people it's
just it's in your face it's staring at
you and nobody is seeing and realizing
and I want to explain this do you guys
remember back when the Terry Crews build
was just about done
and then they launched the second Pascal
Titan the Titan XP but
a little pee when we dubbed the other
one the big PE because it was Pascal and
not to be confused with the X and the
max with you guys remember all that crap
that was the second Titan of Pascal that
the 1080 TI launched right after the
standard Titan X launched and then after
the 1080 T I launched the Titan X with a
little P launched all three of those
were the same core all three of those
were the exact same architecture the
Titans had one extra gigabyte of RAM and
the Titan XP had more CUDA cores than
the Titan X big P and the 1080i it was
an extremely confusing situation that we
all complained about and this is where
Nvidia actually did the right thing in
my opinion they took the Titan name with
Titan Volta stripped the geforce off of
it entirely made a completely new
drop-down a family of graphics cards on
the website for drivers called the titan
family and now it is segregated entirely
which is what it should have been
remember the Terry Crews build they
initially didn't want to send me titan
cards they wanted me to use the 1080 TI
because they said the titan card is not
built for gaming which was complete
 because it was the exact same
core and family and architecture and
everything as a 1080i kart so now to get
rid of that confusion they have stripped
the Titan name entirely the other thing
in video was always known to do is
launch these standard 80 and 70 series
cards were later a few months down the
road the Titan card would launch and
then immediately after that sometimes
one month as soon as one month after
you'd get the atti series card which was
a kick in the face to the Titan owners
because it was always the same chorus to
Titan but for much cheaper and the Titan
was always $1,000 or more
the first Titan launched at $1,000 and
then the Titan exon Pascal was $1,200
and that's the price it stayed all the
way up through the Jedi and Sith
versions of the cards it was always the
case the ti never launched at lunch but
now we are actually seeing the 80 series
ti launched on day one which shows you
the full stack from the top down and
it's going to work its way down to the
Serie the 60 series card the 50 series
card which will be geforce cards not
touring by the way this is a good thing
all they did was take the titan card and
rename it ATT i which is why it's
available on day one
it's $1200 for the founders edition card
MSRP of $9.99 it's another good thing
because the titan card was always an
in-house brand
kept close to the chest you couldn't
make custom pcbs you couldn't make
custom coolers etc for it now you can
because now the AIB is actually have
they have the plans and the reference
and they can make custom cards so you
know you're good technically the ad TI
is a custom tighten the 80 series cards
with the non TI is a six hundred $99
MSRP that's technically fifty dollars
less than the 10 80 TI launched at at
7:49 the 70 series card is four hundred
ninety nine dollars
so five hundred bucks which is
essentially the same price the 1080 had
launched debt I guarantee you the twenty
seventy is going to be faster than the
standard 1080 it might even be faster
than the than the Titan or the 1080 TI
but again we don't know because all of
the marketing stuff was based on ray
tracing and not rasterization and
standard gaming performance that's why
there's so much speculation but
everyone's mad about the pricing when
all that happened was a name shuffle
that's all that happened
so the ad TI is really a Titan the ad is
still the ad in the 70 is still the
seventy and you're getting those four
this roughly the same launch price they
always were within 50 bucks but now you
get all the ray tracing technology put
on top of the gaming performance that's
going to be at least 20 to 25 percent
faster than the previous family of
graphics cards benchmarks will obviously
have to stand by that and show that I'm
really hoping that it does otherwise
there's no one sent by the card which
brings me to my last point today if you
have a Pascal Series card it's probably
not in your best interest to go out and
preorder n or even buy xx series family
unless you are just the kind of guy like
me who wants the latest and greatest you
want the bragging rights and you
straight up get off on hardware then
that's probably the card in the series
for you you have to have the latest and
greatest and you're ok with paying for
that you don't care what anyone else
thinks
you shouldn't anyway no matter who you
are you shouldn't care what anyone else
thinks then it's right for you but in
terms of generation on generation gaming
performance it's going to be a 20% at
least improvement across the board with
all the ray tracing stuff available in
the future what's not going to happen
though is ray tracing is not going to
get easier to render so if you seeing
the 1080p 30fps with ray tracing on on
the shadow of Tomb Raider demo that was
that was shown
that's not gonna get any better this is
first-gen for this guy is that's
something that's going to improve over
time as the hardware matures so if
you're buying this card specifically for
the rate tracing don't expect cutting
edge performance in terms of FPS just
the fact that you can even do it in real
time is the amazing part and that's
obviously what Nvidia is hugely excited
about there was a massive investment in
time and money on that and I don't fault
them for being excited about that
because like I said performance which is
still somewhat secretive and pricing in
my opinion is still in line with what
you would have always expected from a
new family of graphics cards anyway guys
prove me wrong if you've got a different
opinion put it down in the description
description no you don't have access to
the description I do put it in the
comments down below
tweet it at me put it on reddit I don't
care this is a discussion that's worth
having I don't think anyone should be
pre-ordering these cards I never
preorder anything the company should
earn your money first
don't give them your money before
they've earned it I've always felt that
way about anything that includes a
pre-order especially games and that's
something I'm always going to stand by
but obviously you can see our reviews
here once the embargoes lifts you will
be seeing the twenty series family
reviews here on this channel and we
can't talk about any of it until we have
something to talk about and we're
allowed to talk about it
so guys sound off in the comments below
if you've got a difference difference of
opinion or if you think there's
something I missed in all of this thanks
for watching guys and as always we'll
see you in the net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
