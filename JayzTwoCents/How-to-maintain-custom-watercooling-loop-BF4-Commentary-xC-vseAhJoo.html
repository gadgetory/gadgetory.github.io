hey what's going on guys Jays $0.02 here
bringing you one of those traditional
gameplay commentaries if you have no
idea why you're looking at some gameplay
on the screen and you're hearing me talk
well this was actually the way I started
my channel way back in the day where I
used to play some games yeah believe it
or not I used to play some games and
then we would just talk about a fun
topic that was interesting educational
and maybe you got something out of it
and it was more fun to watch gameplay
than it is to look at my ugly mug on the
screen so I'm gonna go ahead and spare
you guys the pain of taking a look at me
and we are gonna watch some battlefield
4 zaba 311 gameplay here not too bad it
was a decent gameplay plane as an
engineer what else very exciting well
the most exciting thing that's happened
to me today anyway was having a decent
game here in battlefield and it didn't
crash but anyway let's go ahead and talk
about talk about today's topic which is
how to maintain your water cooling loop
there's a lot of information out there
when it comes to how to maintain your
custom loop and there's actually good
information and there's bad information
and I've actually got some pictures I'm
gonna show you today that is gonna be
both educational and maybe a little bit
i opening and at the same time a little
bit controversial and we like
controversy around here keeps things
exciting keeps you on your toes
at least it keeps me on my toes or you
guys do something like that when it
comes to custom water loops you guys you
know the easy part is actually picking
the parts and putting it together the
part that people tend to get really hung
up on is how often do you have to flush
it do you have to flush out the rads
before you put it together if you just
don't know what to do and we're gonna
simplify that for you today now when it
comes to putting together new parts
typically the blocks and things are
pretty well fleshed out nice and clean
the radiators there's a lot of different
brands out there and everybody treats
their radiator manufacturing process a
little different now radiators are
soldered together and with that solder
there's what's called flux and that flux
basically is kind of a byproduct of the
soldering process and it can get kind of
dirty and flaky and bits of it can break
off and start floating around your loop
now when it comes to building my systems
I tend to just use hot water with some
and some vinegar swash it around and
then keep
replacing the hot water and keep doing
it quite a few times until you get as
much a junk out as he possibly can now
why do you want to keep replacing the
hot water well guess what as you swish
that radiator around and you're putting
that hot water through those fins and
through those rows it's actually cooling
it yeah so anyway I do recommend just a
vinegar flush when it comes to your
brand new radiators it's not gonna hurt
anything most of the time you'll be just
fine but why take a chance you don't
want a little piece of that breaking off
and killing your brand-new pump that
would that would be a terrible terrible
day now when it comes to the fluids the
other thing people get very very hung up
on is how often do you need to flush
your system now flushing means taking
out all the old fluid cleaning out the
system and replacing it with brand new
fluid now fluids have changed over the
years in fact fluid has changed much
more dynamically than the parts have the
way a radiator works in the way a heat
sink or copper block works really basic
it's a piece of metal it's got lots of
fins on it to give it a larger surface
area and as the fluid runs over the
block it cools the part that it's
touching and as the fluid goes through
the radiator the air moving through it
removed the heat very simple the way the
heat exchanger works just like it works
on a car but when it comes to the fluids
it's actually quite a different story
you've got nanofluids out there you've
got old-school fluids like fluid XP
you've got two still water and you hear
everybody swearing that they're
distilled water or their fluid or their
deionized water is better than the
competitor and it probably is the most
confusing part to buy is the fluid well
for the most part guys how often you
need to change that fluid depends on
what kind of fluid you're using now in
skunkworks
I am using a nano fluid I'm actually
using a Mayhem's pastel which is a
basically a smaller nano fluid inside of
a distilled water mix you mix it
yourself you put it in it's actually got
a shelf life of two years and it's
equally as good in your system for two
years now when it comes to distilled
water that's something you tend to want
to flush out a bit more often my
recommendation is six months every six
months you should be emptying out your
loop completely be running brand new
distilled water through it and some anti
microbial like a biocide or a what's
called a PT
Nuuk a couple of drops of that just two
or three drops you put too many drops of
that in there you're gonna coat your
system a nice aqua shade of blue which
is terrible
yeah it looks awful I've done it before
now the other thing that people ask when
it comes to maintenance is their tubes
they've got they've got clear tubing and
they're wondering why the heck their
tubes are turning cloudy well here's the
reason that happens rubber tubing has
what's called a plasticizer in it but
basically the plasticizer will start to
leech out of your soft tubing and it
will start to coat the inside of the
tube which gives it a very cloudy look
sometimes people mistake this cloud for
being a fault of the fluid and that's
not the case in fact nanofluids will
never do that to your tubing but
distilled water based non nanofluids
will tend to do that because they have
anti corrosive compounds in there which
tend to also exacerbate funny word
exacerbated it will tend to exacerbate
the leaching effect of the plasticizer
so that's why I tend to not use clear
tubing when I can avoid it because clear
tube tubing no matter the brand tigon or
you know other types of plastic I don't
pretend to be an expert on plastics will
always eventually show that leaching
that nasty how deenis there's nothing
you can really do about it now when it
comes to acrylic tubing there's really
not a whole lot you got to worry about
it's a hard tubing it's non-porous and
nothing is gonna ever leach out of it
because there's nothing in it it's just
solid acrylic or whatever that other
material is forget again if it's a rigid
tubing you not to worry about anything
leaching out of that I'm going to show
you a couple of pictures here this is
actually a system that I ran for five
almost six years without ever bleeding
the system and that system as you can
see that tubing used to be clear and it
turned a lovely shade of peach very
golden girls ish 1990s looking thing I
have no idea why it turned peach if you
guys look the actual coolant is green
this was a fluid XP fluid which was one
of the very first aftermarket fluids you
could buy in the mid 2000s early 2000s I
have no idea why it turned peach but as
you can see the coolant stayed nice and
green
now if you look here when I drain the
fluid we got a bunch of little debris
down in there I wasn't too sure where
that came from so I decided well this
particular system since it's not going
back together let's go ahead and cut
this sumbitch open and let's see exactly
where that was coming from well as you
can see here this is a coolant solid
copper water block and it tarnished bad
really really bad in fact all of those
little brown flakes came out of this
water block I have no idea why but it
did now when it comes to the GPU block
it's an old-school ek block I mean look
at that logo that's you can't tell that
it's just really old I mean it actually
looks very very retro if you asked me I
things have changed quite a bit for ek
but you can see the passages and
everything inside the blocker just as
clean as the date was put together this
is exactly the way it came apart after
being ran for five years
no tarnishing of the copper everything
looks fantastic now if we look inside
the radiator this is a black ice GT
radiator it was a different story you
can see there's a lot of dunking going
on on one side of the radiator and the
other side is actually fairly clean now
the dunking was actually building up on
the inlet side and that's where all of
the fluid was having to kind of swirl
around in there and make its way in the
row and then the exit side of the
radiator because it was smoothly flowing
out of the rad was not having that gunky
buildup
so that gunky buildup as you can see was
it's kind of gross and you know you know
what that floating around in your system
but all in all it actually was very very
clean I mean the pump itself also had
some gunky buildup in there but this
wasn't really a problem for the parts of
the time now this system was actually
built in 2006 now as you can tell parts
have changed quite a bit now this system
was able to run five years without any
major issues because if you look closely
both the CPU block and the GPU block
have very large passages today they cut
these passages very very fine and that
gunk enos would have over time clogged
up these blocks at least the way the
blocks are built today and you would
have ended up having a terrible time of
keeping your system cool you would have
over
exerted your pump and you would have
eventually experienced a failure now I
don't recommend running your system for
five years simply because I did what I
wanted to show was how far we've
actually come in the last five years
when it comes to the technologies in
these blocks in the way that they're
made so I would highly recommend
flushing your system at least once a
year even if you have a nano fluid once
a year is definitely recommended
now you're gonna be doing a custom water
cooling loop and you don't want to pay
30 40 even 50 bucks for your fluid once
a year well then maybe you shouldn't get
into custom water cooling loops because
with them comes a bit of maintenance now
you don't have to worry about the tubes
cracking or coming apart or leaking or
any of that for the most part as long as
you have a nice solid connection at your
fittings you're never really gonna
develop any sort of leak as you can see
these blocks and things are held
together with a rings and really that's
not change you're not gonna have any
sort of leak issues coming about of
these these products but once a year
fluid flush is really all you need if
you're running a distilled water like I
said two or three drops at max of PT
Nucor antimicrobial or a biocide you
don't want algae building up in your
loop that is kind of the worst case
scenario is having algae buildup in your
loop and if you can keep the algae at
bay corrosion isn't really an issue
anymore even distilled water tends to
not really pick up too much of the ugly
ions that are in the metals and I found
that basically conductivity is not an
issue as long as you continue to keep
your system nice and clean and change
out that fluid at least once a year so
guys it's been Jase two cents talking
about how to keep your custom loops
maintained it's really not that hard you
built your system you can maintain it
drain it just run some distilled water
through it drain it again refill it
that's it guys very very simple and I
hope you enjoyed those pictures that I
showed because they're actually a little
bit educational not many people are
willing to cut open their radiators but
I did it for the sake of science alright
guys as always we will see you in the
next month kind of normal for all of the
classified GPU
that's the 980 but the 780 and the 680
they were all taller defused because
they're sitting and awful locks on to
the CCB yeah we'll talk about the back
in a minute don't worry we'll get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
