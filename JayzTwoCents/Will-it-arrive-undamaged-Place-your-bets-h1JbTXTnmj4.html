something I've never done before
um 1100 videos or something like that on
this channel and I've never done a video
about how to pack and protect your
system I get emails all the time people
telling me hey I'm going off to college
and I gotta my PC or hey I'm going
overseas or I'm I'm moving I need to
protect my PC how can I do that
well this is the system I showed you
guys a few videos back that I built for
my driving instructor and it's got to
make its way all the way to Illinois and
hopefully today if I do this right it'll
survive the trip vengeance RGB pro ddr4
memory from Corsair features optimize
peak performance for both the latest
Intel and AMD based ddr4 motherboards to
learn how to bring your computer memory
to the next level click the link in the
description below so we have a few
challenges with this system one we have
a tempered glass side panel so obviously
we want to protect that we are going to
be shipping it in its case box as you
can see by the wave effect this has
already been handled with care by your
friendly neighborhood courier service
we're gonna be doing a box in a box the
nice thing about this though was even
though when coolermaster sent us this
case it had these nice dense corner
pieces on here so that's gonna help
we're gonna we're gonna be taping these
back on I know you probably won't have
these unless they came with your box
this is a hard sell foam so it's not
soft and squishy so we can't really
count on the foam to necessarily absorb
a lot of the drop impact it's gonna have
now yes you can put things like fragile
on the box if you're shipping it you
know what fragile means over a fence or
something we're gonna be utilizing
something today that I got off of Amazon
this is insta pack this is the stuff
that you saw us show at our NZXT video
where you put it out and you snap it and
it pops and then you gotta
you gotta play the bongos on it and then
it starts to expand so we'll be using
that to protect our internals one thing
you can do if you are confident with
this or you're shipping it to someone
who is able to do this or you doing it
yourself the easiest thing to do is
going to be to remove the cooler
especially if it took an air tower like
it like a yo cooling heatsink and the
GPU those are the two things that are
gonna be most likely damaged because
once it's upright like this you've got
all the pressure of the the the thing
that makes the Vidia happen pushing down
on the system pulling on the motherboard
and the same thing with the tower or the
cooling tower now fortunately because we
have a water cooler in here there's not
really any weight or any leverage being
pulled on the CPU socket this is a big
heavy graphics card I went with the
zotac amp extreme because he is gonna be
doing VR racing and stuff and I wanted
to give him a good VR experience we I
went with that unfortunately because the
card is so big and heavy and already has
some sag Emelia all I did was set it
down you see that look watch do the card
now how is this gonna survive a trip
well that's where the insta pad comes in
because it expands it is gonna fill the
void we're gonna be using the insta pack
to push it down and as we push it down
right here it's gonna start to expand
and it doesn't push against thing it
just goes oh there's resistance and goes
around it so we're gonna basically form
a cocoon around the graphics card which
we're then gonna put the side panel on
and squish it down so it goes down and
protects the graphics card the graphics
card won't be able to move that's really
the only thing we have to protect in
here okay so this side down always wear
eye protection
Oh once the bag starts to expand it will
become very warm and release steam
oh it's getting warm oh there goes you
will hear another pop what pack
immediately I know I see it it's getting
hot whoa that's hot holy crap oh no it's
backwards Oh me wait we got this why was
I feel like that was harder than it
needed to be okay well alright so that
parts done you could take a lot less
risk with your system if you're shipping
it to yourself free shipping to someone
that can reinstall their own graphics
card then there you go but you know I
figured if these system builders if the
system builders you know are sending off
these systems all day long like this
there's no reason why I can't either
Phil loves that sound
okay so I've still got some leftover
foam and stuff that we're gonna use to
sort of you know protect the tempered
glass on the side of the case I just
want to be over cautious right we that's
what we want to do I almost feel like
this thing deserves a drop test to see
if it is gonna survive okay I mean if I
can't survive that it's not gonna
survive a trip in a browner white and
purple truck so the nice thing about
these things is they allow the case
corners or the corner of the box to
become a lot stronger so I could take
the impact it's usually the corners of a
package that become damaged okay so we
went ahead and decided if we're gonna do
this video we need to do it right so we
ran to the hardware store and we picked
up packing materials I feel like yeah I
feel like this needs a pole that this is
going through because I can't hold the
two things on the end that let it like
rotates now I said box in a box so this
box is gonna get packed in that box but
we need to put padding around here for
that and to do that we bought this stuff
now some people might look at this and
be like 50 bucks for packing material
what the heck we also got to ask
yourself how much is your computer and
how much are you willing to spend to
protect it so now I'm gonna basically do
the same thing on all four sides of our
package the box is all like smooshing
out of the side so there we go we're
just gonna close this up put a whole
bunch of tape and then we are going to
saran wrap the outside of this box as
well
we need like one of those things they
have it like warehouses where it just
goes on a spinning pallet and that's how
you pack a computer if you can't survive
that it will make it to Illinois so as
you guys saw we used insta pack for 10
bucks or so off of Amazon the saran wrap
us 24 bucks from Lowe's and then it was
a like another 18 or so 20 bucks for the
bubble wrap we got two of them but like
I said I'm moving and I needed the
bubble wrap and the saran wrap for other
stuff so about 50 bucks worth of packing
material you can hopefully ship your
package safe and sound the insta pack to
hold the guts of the computer in place
the foam that came with the case box
that it's packed in foam shoved down in
there to protect the sides of it then it
put inside of another box with saran or
not ceramic up a bubble wrap all around
that and of course saran wrap around the
main box all kinds of bubble wrap enough
to where it's actually bulging out but
not enough to actually cause it to push
down on the Box on the inside and then
that saran wrap to hold everything
together not to mention the the stiff
corner pieces we have on the inside box
yeah this should hopefully make it to
Illinois in one piece in fact once you
guys do me a favor following on twitter
and instagram at JS to sense it both and
i'll do a follow up when this arrives
its destination let you know whether or
not it survived i'll even ask for some
pictures from stephen before he unbox it
to see what it looks like when it gets
there this is the worst time of year to
ship something and to get it handled
with care because you're also dealing
with a bunch of brand new unseasoned
part time box runners basically the
person that's hired to go from the truck
to the door and just run and throw it at
the customer and run back to the truck
while the driver is in there organizing
the next packages yeah I've worked a few
peak seasons those of you that are
couriers out there know exactly what I'm
talking about
long days 16 hours plus and yeah it
should hopefully survive that
aspect alright well there you go you
guys are asking me all the time how to
ship a computer that's the method I use
if you do something different and you
consider it safe put it down in the
comments below and helped everyone out
as always guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one I'm
serious
follow on Twitter and Instagram so you
can see if it survived subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
