while since I've touched this that
through other projects that were taking
up some time I got some more that are
coming up obviously you guys know Intel
launches are happening right now left
and right we got Z 370 coming up but I
need to finish the read Ripper because I
want to do thread Ripper versus the 79
60 X and yeah we just need more time in
the day level up your gimme experience
with the Corsair one small form-factor
gaming PC featuring water-cooled intel
seventh generation processors m2 nvme
SSD support and liquid-cooled GTX 10
series GPUs to learn more just head to
Corsair com so I've currently got this
set up so that we have the fittings on
the top of the radiator in the back
right here kind of coming out the rear
of the case which i think is neat but
I'm kind of wondering now if I want to
flip this over the other way so that way
the fittings are here making it easier
to keep the tubing inside the case
rather than having to come around some
crazy way so I'm having a hard time
deciding how I want to do that
because although this is neat looking
it's very constrictive constrictive it's
great it's limiting what I can do
it's so tired of having to take this off
and like flip it around I've already
done this on the top like five times
because I couldn't decide how I wanted
it to go it should be kind of obvious
though based on mystique that we decided
to go with the silver for this build
because you know I want it to be a very
I want to be a very monochrome look and
this and the blue gives it a nice pop
but I can't hurt this is when we did it
with we actually put blue clear UV dye
in one of these bottles because I do
have some you do UV lights but I don't
know if I want to light this up more
with like a kind of soft white glow or
if I want to go with UV the problem is
the it doesn't light up that much under
UV so
and decisions some of these edges like
look like they've been scuffed or
something I can shipping like the inside
of this screw is not black
it'll ding right there so I have to
bring up my little black paint pen and
kind of touch up some of this case here
stuff and decided what hardware I'm
going with in terms of storage there's a
lot of unknowns in this right now
all right that's we're gonna stop for
today I my goal today was get the GPUs
installed get the power supply wrapped
which we did that's I mean it's pretty
easy but there was some contouring to do
and at least start the loop the hardest
part on something like this is always
figuring out loop order and I think I've
got that how I want it now this is the
part where I always get asked why am I
going into the GPUs first won't the GPU
heat up the CPU now you might actually
be able to measure a couple of degrees
difference in Celsius between the two
components
but the bottom line is the radiators are
going to keep this system more of an
equalized temperature where there's only
a couple of degrees difference even in
front of rads and after ads that's
another video I'm tired of talking about
that constantly because people just
don't understand the way that it works
trust me it's gonna work fine but we
have kind of limited space to work with
in you can see it's kind of crammed
right so I I wanted to at least get this
loop order something that looks tidy but
not too tidy this this is a very
abstract build so it doesn't have to be
super tidy but I I can't seem to help
myself I'm almost like hiding the tubing
away which is gonna be sad because we
are using the silver for this if you
guys saw the 79 60 X build I did I used
the blue in there because this is just
going to look best in here in my opinion
I wanted a very monochromatic we chose
the name symbiote for this because of
the venom and spider-man things so this
is this is like my venom build this is
gonna be like I know this is this it
actually kinda looks like it's alive
right so this is why we're calling it
symbiote because oh yeah the fluid and
the colors we're gonna be a drain plug
right here which is kind of ironic
because it's a terrible place for a
drain plug like ideally having one down
here would have been best this this
loops gonna be a bitch to drain no
matter what just because of the angles
and everything's at so whatever this at
least will allow me to drain the
reservoir but in order to drain this
loop properly it's gonna require a
disassembly so yeah also do you guys
might notice we put the black tops on
the Dominator Platinum's these are
the cable mod blacktops we tried the
silver we thought it was too bright too
much shininess in there so I ended up
going with the black which I think it
looks really good these are gonna light
up white underneath here like just a
soft glow of white because remember
these are lit naturally yeah I think I'm
gonna have to rotate the block a little
bit too though because now that we're
going into the GPUs we'll be coming out
on this side and this is the other thing
too a lot of people who've never seen a
parallel build don't understand how this
works and I need to put screws back in
there I forgot this it's gonna split the
flow between the cards so half the fluid
is going to go in here roughly half the
other half is gonna go in here and as
long as your inlet and your outlet are
on opposite sides it will work fine if
your outlet is on the same side then
you're gonna flow straight through when
you're not going to promote flow through
the graphics cards so it's going to go
in here it's gonna split half is going
to go out Hassman go through the
graphics card it's gonna meet back up on
this side where half here is going to go
through the other half is going back
through the inside of the block and then
it will all come out right here and go
into the CPU that's why I think I need
to rotate my block I can take this off
remove the bracket rotate the block
because this is the inlet and this is
the outlet so I'd like to kind of go
straight into it but I might also just
do something crazy where I kind of come
out and do some funky thing and go back
in and then out right because we we want
it to look we want to fill up the space
with some of the fluid right this is
gonna be the star of the show the only
thing I'm not sure about yet I have to
sleep on this I'm not sure if I'm going
to use this piece right here and it's
still so wobbly so we get the glass on
there man I hate that this is meant to
hold SSDs or hard drives or a single
like three and a half inch drive I don't
know if I'm gonna be going with any
standard SSDs at least right here so I
might remove this teeth piece entirely
but then the problem is the orange piece
that's right here which is at home
because I have to paint it it's not
gonna have anything to mount to right
here but it will still have a mount here
here and up here so I think that will be
all right we'll play around with it and
see if I remove this piece so now I can
have a much cleaner route from the
return here to the inlet on the
reservoir as you can see now I've got
this crazy kind of a fitting contraption
here to sort of go around it which i
think looks terrible so I've got a
really kind of player
but anyway that's just an update here on
the thread Ripper build project somebody
out sim by out whatever his wife is
texting me so I means it's time to go at
this edit this video and get it up
online the same days what you guys saw
today we did today yeah huge thank you
though to the sponsors on this again you
of course AMD for sending up the CPU a
suits for sending out the motherboard
hopefully asus aura will work on this
one but that's a different subject of
course performance - pcs guys i've used
them for years well before even started
youtube they sent me all the fittings
the reservoir pump the blocks for this
ETA actually sent me blocks as well but
they came too late so I'll use those in
another project and then of course primo
chill for sending me the radiators the
custom powder coated radiators at that
for this build specifically as well as
my custom powder coated revolver
fittings so yeah definitely got a lot
here in this build oh and of course of
course they're for sending me to a X
1200 i PSU that I'm using in this build
which is wrapped in carbon fiber which
looks so much better anyway I'm gonna go
guys hopefully I can wrap this up in the
next video and I hate doing multi
parters but builds like this take time
and appreciate you guys checking it out
also too to what your own J's to sense
gear fall is here and winter is coming
and I don't mean like Game of Thrones
although I'm sad that it's over for now
but get your hoodies and stuff linked
down in the description below and keeps
me for having to do things like patreon
and whatnot least you guys get something
for your money other than these mediocre
videos so with that said I'm gonna go
guys thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
