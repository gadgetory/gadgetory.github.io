the enthu primo that's like yeah sure
send it on over it's a hell of a lot
bigger in person if he thought
skunkworks was cool then head on over to
mod cooler master calm and watched the
biggest names in case modding compete
for over $20,000 in cash and prizes hey
what's going on YouTube Jay's two cents
here and this has got to be by far one
of the most requested videos I have ever
been asked to do now somewhere along the
lines of doing this whole YouTube thing
I kind of became known as a water
cooling guru and yeah it's no joke or no
secret that I really enjoy water cooling
pcs but I didn't really think that that
was kind of my claim to fame or the
thing I was really most known for
but you guys have obviously dubbed me
with that title you guys have begged me
to take a look at this case now I
started this review off very very
traditionally where I was just going to
start talking about the case some of the
features some of the adjustability
aspects of it figurations what size
radiators and stuff can fit until I went
to take it out of the box and what I
thought was just a crap ton of padding
making the Box huge was actually full of
a huge case so I did what any
self-respecting water cooler would do I
went into my closet of water cooling
parts I mean what self-respecting water
cooler wouldn't have a closet full of
water cooling parts just laying around
doing nothing so as you can see I've
started putting some hardware in here
now I didn't do a complete build in this
because I have to keep my tubing and
stuff intact for some other stuff that
I'm working on but I will say that I am
dying to do a complete build in this
thing if and when I have the parts to
actually complete it this case was
dubbed as being the water cooling
enthusiast case it was the case that was
built from the ground up with water
coolers in mind now I've messed around
with some cases before in the past that
claimed that but I don't think there's
been a single case on the market that
has ever taken it to this degree now
some of the hardware that I crammed in
this thing
is a 480 millimeter by 30 millimeter
slim rad on the bottom which obviously
as you can see we could have gone much
much thicker radiator in this thing if
we wanted although I mean an 80
millimeter radiator in push-pull would
fit down here that's insane I put a 120
here on the back just because I've got a
480 by 445 millimeter rad on the top
that still has room for push-pull and a
240 millimeter radiator on the side
using the rear or the side intake just
again for the sake of it and we could
have still fit another 140 mil or 120
millimeter radiator in the front that is
absolutely insane now in terms of
motherboard compatibility this thing
does fit ATX e ATX micro ATX SSI EB
which is a double wide motherboards kind
of like Bartok Lee is using that has the
dual CPU configuration the amount of
room you have is absolutely insane
especially if you remove the bracket
that goes right here they have this
really nice bracket it's actually this
guy right here and unfortunately I did
have to remove this because as you can
see even with standard length graphics
cards these are these are 2 EVGA 970
SSDs the bracket does not fit in there
the graphics cards are too long so this
is designed to kind of make the cabling
look much more tidy
unfortunately using any sort of just
mainstream graphics card is pretty much
too long and you have to remove it so
that's one thing that I was not really
too happy about considering these cards
or not and they're not very long at all
so you definitely want to keep that in
mind on the back here we actually have a
mount here for 280 millimeter fans if we
wanted or they actually have
compatibility here for mounting
reservoir brackets so you have a
well-thought-out place to mount your
reservoir which is quite honestly one of
the most frustrating things about trying
to build in a case that's not designed
for water cooling is where to mount
things the speaking of where to mount
things there is also a pump mount on
this on the back and we'll get to that
in just a moment as you can see I was
able to fit SLI in here without any
problem whatsoever
vomits galore grommets everywhere that
you can just kind of stick your fingers
through and have a little bit of fun
with if you get really bored or whatever
up at the top as I mentioned here this
is a 45 millimeter radiator for 80 long
so it's the entire length of the case
and it does have enough room for you to
have gone push-pull inside the case or
you could go all the way up to an 80
millimeter race radiator 80 millimeter
race whatever that means you could go to
an 80 mm heater radiator in the top and
still have room for fans above the case
or you could go with a 60 ml and have
push-pull still with fans inside decide
the case underneath the radiator or fans
up here in the top of the case because
the top of the case is actually recessed
it has a lot of room in there so you
have room to actually mount your fans
above the top of the case that goes
underneath the mesh filtered grille that
is also quick-release and removable
there it is right there
now all of the intakes in this case our
dust filtered including the bottom right
here the bottom of the case as you can
see does have two slide-out filters on
there and so that's going to keep things
nice and tidy for your your system it's
also going to keep you dust free and
they're actually pretty free-flowing
they don't really seem to hurt the
airflow too much whatsoever you do have
one two three four five five and a
quarter bays they are all tooless
probably one of the easiest to list
systems I have ever used and one of the
most high-quality as well they don't
feel cheaper like they're going to break
like a lot of other cases do but I've
dealt with in the past and we have here
on the side a nice metal fantex
emblem here which you could also put
your own emblem there if you want to do
something custom
now speaking of something custom if you
don't put a giant rad right here you can
fit on the bottom here a 480 at 360 a
240 or 120 or you can go up to a dual
140 radiator down here and up at the top
you could also go with a triple 140
radiator at the top but if you don't go
with a super thick radiator here you
actually have a canvas right here as you
can see this open area where you could
put a graphic there you could put make
like a custom acrylic plate or something
with like a logo or a design if you're
doing a case mod or land party or
something so I I like this big space
right here this almost
like a blank canvas to do something
custom with moving around to the front
of the case you can see we do again have
a hinged front door that hinges from
right to left again that's unfortunate I
do wish you could switch the side but
unfortunately you can't do that and then
your front dual 140s up here in the
front are help I push to the right spot
they are again filtered and they're easy
to access to clean and then you can see
they include 2:140 fans for the front
and they are actually pretty quiet out
these up to the test bench just to see
how loud they were and they're not that
loud at all moving around to the back of
the case you can see that we've got a
lot of well-thought-out cable management
here now I didn't install a power supply
in this thing just honestly it came down
to being lazy once I realized I wasn't
going to be able to do a complete build
in here anyway so I went ahead and put
my cable extensions in here so you can
kind of get an idea of how cable
management would work in this thing over
here on the side you can see I do have
the dual 120 or the 240 millimeter
radiator bracket installed and I had to
remove the hard drive cages to do that
let's kind of want to see what it was
like with that mountain in there because
the back panel actually has a grill cut
out on the side so that you could remove
a plug on that and you could get side
air flow bringing air into the case or
exhausting it depending on how you
install it but the hard drive cages are
tooless and removable you can fit one
two three four five six three and a half
millimeters or you could fit also on
these SSDs if you wanted to have the SSD
hole mounts pre-drilled so you could fit
as well just as many SSDs on there
inside the back of the case here next to
the five and the quarters you do have a
quick tool list SSD cage and it holds
two SSDs per cage here so you can have
four SSDs mounted right here or you
could relocate one for some reason if
you needed to all the way over here if
that was more you know your your your
thing I guess whatever your whatever
tickles your fancy but you can move it
over there if you wanted there is lots
and lots of cable management thought-out
in here you've got these velcro straps
that come you know with everything
already tied it together there's one two
three four five six seven eight nine of
them pre-installed
fantex is all about giving you cable
management built-in and my god do they
do a good job of it what I do like to
see in this and this is amazing I'm
always asked from people je how do you
control the fans how do you control your
fans I'll check this out they actually
include a PWM fan splitter so you've got
this cable right here that is a four pin
PWM that plugs into this adapter and you
plug this into your CPU header or any
other PWM controlled four pin header on
your motherboard and then you plug this
right here into SATA power and then you
are able to control any fans that hook
up to this with PWM so they will speed
up and slow down with PWM circuit on the
CPU so you could speed up and slow down
your radiator fans your intake fans
whatever in fact you can add even more
of these if you want to buy them
optionally from fantex
now they also have fan splitters on them
so you can see right here I've got one
two three four five six fan headers on
this and you can split all of these
except for fan one fan one can't be
split it has to be a single fan but you
could split these off so you end up
having two four six eight ten controlled
fans if you use three pin splitters like
this that again I wish more cases
included that because then you have fan
control built in with software on your
motherboard all motherboards have a PWM
circuit and you would be able to control
your fans without having to have a bulky
fan controller somewhere
now the power supply does mount down
here on the bottom vertically up and
down it does have rubber standoffs on
here to cut down any vibration or noise
and right behind that you do have a tool
list removable pump mount and this is
where you can mount your water cooling
pump now the DDC I tried to mount to
this didn't actually line up with these
holes but technically you could just
drill new holes if you needed if this
bracket wasn't here you could move that
away the only thing you want to keep in
mind is this might interfere with your
power supply depending on how long your
power supply is the cables are coming
off of that could interfere with your
pump right here but right above the pump
you also have a round grommet that you
could bring a tube right down into your
pump again well-thought-out
to giant grommets right here that can
get to your fans
or you can bring your PCI Express cables
out of there or you can come out the
side like I did and everything is just
so well thought out now on the top of
the case right here you have your power
button and then you have your LED it is
a separate LED control built into this
so you can plug LEDs into it as well as
LED fans I have a separate LED plug and
you can turn the LEDs on and off and
then you have of course your USBs and
you do have your mic and your headphone
jack now the one thing I don't like
about this case is some of the powder
coating on the interior is a little bit
uneven I wasn't able to pick it up on
camera so this is kind of a very minor
complaint sometimes it's really smooth
and other places it's really rough the
finish seems to be a little bit less
than as smooth as you know say the
exterior grinder these are plastic
pieces here some of the corners and some
of the crevices it doesn't seem like the
powder coating got in there very evenly
so you can see some bare metal through
there but it doesn't really show at all
when you're looking at the case from the
outside you got to get real up close to
see that the other complaint that I had
was probably not so much fantex fault
but I did try and put a 80 millimeter
radiator that I have down here in the
bottom to show how thick of a rad you
could go down here the problem is it's
very very tight at least until it loses
its virginity that was probably a little
bit too far I apologize but because that
radiator is slightly wider than standard
it wasn't able to fit down here so you
need to keep that in mind if you're
going to be doing bottom mounted
radiator like I am going with the
radiator that's extra thick sometimes
has extra width with it and even a few
extra millimeters on this will not fit
as it is it even scratched my radiator
slightly getting it in there because the
disc the width right here is barely
enough but as you can see I did get a
480 millimeter radiator down here but
that's really the only complaints I had
and those are extremely minor but
considering the fact that this was fan
Texas like one of their first attempts
at a case they have clearly gotten it
right I really am looking for an excuse
to do a full-time building this that I
can
keep together but part of the problem is
unless you're doing like SLI and filling
it with radiators and water cooling
tubes and reservoirs and pumps and stuff
everywhere
it's just going to look completely empty
it's going to look very empty and that
in itself will will pose a challenge at
making it look good like this space
right here already looks extremely empty
so this is like I said I would put like
a graphic or a plaque or something in
there something cool just to fill up
this space but really first world
problems if there ever was one alright
guys well there we go tell me what you
think about this case I've told you what
I think about this case and I think it
is a damn good option for the hardcore
water cooler or even the person looking
to get into water cooling because it's
all fought out for you and it makes it
even easier to install there you go guys
