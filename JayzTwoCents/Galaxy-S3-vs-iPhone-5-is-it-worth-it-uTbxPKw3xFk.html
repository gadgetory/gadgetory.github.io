and as I promised I've got my galaxy s3
brand-new back from Verizon so I'm going
to do a no-holds-barred head-to-head
hand hand combat of the galaxy s3 versus
the iPhone 5 and we're going to find out
which one deserves a spot in your pocket
getting started here we'll go ahead and
take a look at some of the dimensions of
the phone the Galaxy s3 features a 4.8
inch screen it's a 1280 pixel by 720
given a native 720p resolution the
iPhone 5 on the other hand is featuring
a 4-inch screen with an 1100 and 36 by
640 resolution which is giving it a
natural 16.9 aspect ratio but it's a
funky doesn't really equate to any
standard when it comes to resolution but
either way it's packing 326 pixels per
inch
versus the Samsung's 306 pixels per inch
however I have to say that when you look
at these up close you can't really see a
difference the iPhone 5 is coming in at
seven point six millimeters thin and the
galaxy s3 is coming in at eight point
six millimeters thin we're only talking
one millimetres of difference here
although the galaxy does feel a little
thinner in your hand because of the
rounded edges as well as the fact that
it's a bit wider go ahead and power
these bad boys on here on the count of
three and see which one boots faster one
two three
all right so as you can see the iPhone 5
is already booted and set the lock
screen however the galaxy s3 is still
sitting there showing us some of the 4G
radio waves and blah blah blah hey I've
got a new subscriber let's go and give
this new subscriber a shout-out shall we
oh there's a few of you well we'll go
ahead and give oh my god Joe root Korn
found in chat Aviles Wow okay well you
get a shout out sir because you
subscribed in the middle of this video
congratulations and text messages I'm a
popular guy oh my god how's a guy
supposed to do it an iPhone versus
galaxy review and they're all tweeting
and whistling and emailing and
notifications and blah blah blah blah
blah anyway the galaxy's lockscreen
you've got quite a few different options
here you've got a pattern unlock you've
got a pin unlock you've got us swipe to
unlock or a slide it across your table
to unlock out it's all the same the
iPhone in the other hand you get two
options you get the slide to unlock and
you can either use a pin or a passcode
and that's it there are no patterns or
anything if you want to do any of that
stuff you've got to do a jailbreak and
this video is not about Joe breaking
this is about head-to-head Android 4.0
for Ice Cream Sandwich which is a little
bit old but Verizon slow on getting with
program versus iOS 6 and the iPhone 5
well we'll go ahead and do here as both
of these phones are currently on Wi-Fi
so we will go ahead and do a speed test
comparison on both of these we'll go
ahead and start with the galaxy s3 and
let's see how they do okay so the galaxy
came in at a twenty eight ping a twenty
point two three megabits per second
download speed any seven point seven two
megabits per second upload speed I have
a problem with this test and here's why
my Wi-Fi is captain five megabits upload
speed so how in the hell is it getting
two point seven two megabits faster than
my Wi-Fi is allowing I don't get it I
don't trust that test it's been
happening all day I don't know what the
problem is there can't figure it out but
I don't trust those numbers on that
upload
it's not accurate iPhone 5 here we go
alright so here we go the iPhone 5 is
done we got a 25 ping a 26.93 megabits
down any 4.88 up that up is a little
more what I expected to see with my cap
on my Wi-Fi but it looks like we're
getting a little bit more download speed
I don't know if it just has to do with
antenna 2 configuration of the phones or
if the modem is simply better than the
iPhone 5 but I've ran this test over and
over over the last 24 hours
and the iPhone is consistently faster on
Wi-Fi than the galaxy
let's go ahead and put these bad boys on
some 4G I am in a very strong 4G area so
it should be a pretty good test and we
will come back with some results okay so
we've got 4G LTE loaded up on both of
these devices we'll go ahead and start
these at the same time on the count of
three and one two three okay so it took
the Galaxy s3 a little bit longer to
complete that test but again there's
some interesting numbers here that I
want to point out both of these are
connecting to the exact same tower
through the same cellular service it's
Bryson's LTE 4G and they are connecting
to the exact same test server yet I'm
getting 109 millisecond ping on the
galaxy versus 836 millisecond ping on
the iPhone speeds are pretty close at
4.03 down on the galaxy and a four point
five eight down on the iPhone however
the upload is only one point three four
in the galaxy versus a three point two
seven on the iPhone kind of funny that I
was just bragging that I'm in a strong
4G area yet these are some of the lowest
numbers that I've seen alright so as you
might expect the home screens on both of
these devices are significantly
different from each other
you've got Android that is all about
open source and you know customisation
of widgets and multiple screens and
being able to customize and add all the
panels you want if you want to remove a
screen you simply take it and drag it
into the trashcan and that's it it's
gone if you want to add a screen you hit
the plus sign it's very intuitive it's
very easy to use it Scrolls very nicely
very smooth the iPhone on the other hand
you're still stuck on icons in iOS 5
they added the Notification Center as
you can see here however you know you
get the weather widget there's a stock
widget there's a couple of other widgets
that you can add in there but they're
very small they're not really nothing
like Android you can't place them on the
home
screen whether visible you've always got
to do the pulldown one other thing I'd
like to show you here is that if I was
to swipe this I can get rid of the email
right away no problem but on the iPhone
if I want to get rid of a particular
notification I can't do that I have to
either get rid of all of them or none by
clicking that little X and hitting clear
and they're all gone nothing I can do
about it
so not really too happy about that when
it comes to iOS it does feel a little
bit archaic or old maybe a little
antique II I don't know why iPhone and
Apple are just waiting so long to jump
on to the widgets bandwagon I think it's
very I think it's cool why not be able
to customize your screen and make your
phone tailored more to you that's
holding back iPhone as far as I'm
concerned and Android definitely wins
when it comes to the UI layout because
Android is just all about turning the
phone into your phone one other thing I
really like about the Android layout
versus the iPhone is if you pull down
this tab here you've got the connection
status bar at the top so you can turn on
and off Bluetooth Wi-Fi you can turn off
your data airplane mode you can go into
power saving mode all sorts of different
things can be controlled by that on the
iPhone however if I want to connect to
Wi-Fi I've got to come over to the
Settings tab and I've got to go to the
Wi-Fi and then I turn that on and then
go back and there we go
so when it comes to connectivity and
ease of use of turning on and off
various functions of the phone the
Android again in my opinion wins that
battle hands-down so what we'll do now
is we'll go ahead and do some
application launch test we're going to
launch Netflix here both of these
devices are connects to Wi-Fi again so
there's not going to be any of that
radio weirdness going on in the galaxy's
corner slowing it down so we'll go ahead
and do that in 1 2 3 splash screen first
on the iPhone followed by the galaxy
about a second later galaxies loaded the
grey screen first contents coming in I
think that was a dead heat and I don't
know about you but I think that was it
absolute ty so let's go ahead and load
an episode of something here something
I've never been to before
oh look at that they've got my princess
hose
y'all see my princess shows okay so
we'll go ahead and load open season
three here and on the count of three
we'll go ahead and click the play button
one two three
looks like we got video playing first on
the iPhone yes we do the galaxy is still
just wow it's a little bit more delayed
than I expect it to be to play anymore
this music I'm going to a royalty okay
I'm gonna go and shut that down we'll go
ahead and try that again go back to
Netflix okay so this time let's go ahead
and load an episode of Breaking Bad 1 2
3
and that time decal ik cs3 was ahead by
about a quarter second over the iPhone
that one's definitely very close we'll
go ahead and do a tiebreaker here let's
go ahead and load let's say episode ten
and one two three I phone looks like it
was open a little bit faster but we got
video first on the galaxy s3 so the
galaxy s3 has one that two out of three
competition I'm thinking something just
might have gotten a little hung up in
the code on the first one but it does
look like they may have loaded two
different episodes oh well I'm still
going to go ahead and give it to the
galaxy we'll go ahead and load up
another application here we'll open
Facebook that's one that most people use
and we'll go ahead and do that in a
count of three one two three it looks
like we had content first on the iPhone
but I don't know if that's necessarily a
fair test since you have a bigger screen
on the Android or the galaxy s3 it was
rendering more information so I don't
know if that was entirely fair but
either way it was close enough to where
you're not going to be able to tell a
difference with either these devices in
your hand it's going to be very fast
both of these devices are very quick
very speedy the screens are beautiful
the app stores on both of these devices
are full of awesome apps the Android
Store or the Google Play Store does have
a lot more free apps and you're going to
find on Apple Apple apps tend to come at
a little bit of a premium they're going
to range anywhere from a buck all the
way up to ten bucks depending on what
you want you're going to find a lot of
quality free apps on Android so when it
comes to the value of the apps or I
think I'm leaning a little bit more
towards Android because of the fact that
just there's a lot of free apps and
granted they may have ads and whatnot in
them I would rather have an app with an
ad in it that allows me to play the full
game versus the free apps you get an
Android wear you get may get one or two
levels of a particular game and then you
get a in-store or in-app purchase screen
that pops up and says if you want to
play more go ahead and buy the app and
that
really just really gets annoying to me
we'll go ahead and load one more
application will load the YouTube app
see if I can find it here alright and
we'll do this in the count of three one
two three and it looks like we had
content loaded up first on the iPhone
and there we go seem a bit more on the
galaxy because of the larger screen and
you're gonna see here on the iPhone
alright so the question we've all been
waiting for which phone wins well I
think you've already learned by now and
by the time you're watching this video
there's probably already been Android
sucks
iPhone sucks iPhones you know a bunch of
girls and androids a bunch of geeks and
you're gonna see those comments no
matter what I welcome those comments
they're very funny to me and I dare you
to flame me because guess what both
these phones are mine so either way I
win and you lose
let's go ahead and hear what you use and
why I like both of these phones equally
I can't choose a clear winner but I can
tell you there's things about the phones
that I don't like and let's go and go
into that I already mentioned I don't
like the home screen on the iPhone it is
just plain there's nothing to it than
icons Android has you know the easy way
of adding removing pages you've got the
widgets the iPhone has non expandable
storage space in it so what that means
is if you buy a 32 gig like I did that's
all you got 32 gigs I've got the 16
gigabyte Galaxy s3 but I want the LUP
but I went with the lower model because
I know that I can just buy another
microSD cards
lap it in there and I've got support all
the way up to 64 gigabytes so it's kind
of a no-brainer to get the smaller model
there however if I went with the 16 gig
on the iPhone I have no doubt I would
fill that sucker up in no time
whatsoever one thing I don't like about
the Android though at least this
particular phone is I don't like how the
power button is on the right side I'm
constantly picking it up
and where does my finger go BAM right
there so I'm always locking the phone
turning it off and constantly bumping
the buttons are here for the volume it's
because they're really soft and really
easy to push so I mean it's nice but I
think if the buttons were firmer it
wouldn't be as much of an issue I also
don't like the rear battery cover here
on the galaxy it's very cheap and flimsy
every time I take it off I'm afraid I'm
going to break it if you're an Android
owner you know that every once in a
while you have to pull the battery to do
a little soft reset because sometimes
androids memory usage just gets a bit
clogged up and a software reset doesn't
always cut it so sometimes you got to
pull that battery out I also don't like
how flimsy this cover is and how thin it
is because you've got the battery right
underneath it so if you're using the
phone a lot or you're watching videos or
playing games you know these batteries
and these devices get kind of warm so
the heat comes right through that and
into your hand now on the iPhone it's a
metal back and so it's still going to
conduct the heat it just takes a little
longer to do so and eventually that heat
is going to come through I like the fact
that the Android has a standard micro s
hit I like the fact that the Galaxy has
a standard micro USB port on the bottom
I have tons of those chargers laying
around I've got tons of those for the
car the iPhone 5 as you may know
switched from the 30-pin connector to
the new lightning adapter so none of my
old peripherals work not my iHome not my
car charger not this docking very dusty
gonna be using not this docking station
here because it no longer uses that
cable and Apple has the nerve the nerve
to charge $30 for the adapter shame on
you Apple
even your MagSafe one to MagSafe to
adapter for your MacBook Pros are ten
bucks ten bucks and that uses more metal
in it than the adapter for the 30-pin
you're just trying to make money off of
us because you know we have no choice
lastly I will say that I personally
think that the screen on the galaxy s3
is a little bit bigger than I would like
I think somewhere right around a 4.5 or
4.2 kind of like the old X
is perfect the 4.8 is gargantuan let's
go ahead and hear what you own and why
what do you like which do you use and
let's hear your best Android versus
iPhone and iPhone versus Android jokes
