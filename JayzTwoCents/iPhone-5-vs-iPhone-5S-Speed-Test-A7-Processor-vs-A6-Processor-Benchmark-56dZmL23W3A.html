Jays two cents and today we're going to
take a good hard look at the iPhone 5
versus the iPhone 5s just launched this
week by Apple
now before we get into the software
comparisons we're going to go ahead and
take a look around the phone as you can
expect from the 5 to the 5s model they
are exactly the same when it comes to
dimensions with the exception of two
immediately blaring features when it
comes to the exterior of the phones
obviously the iPhone 5s has a
fingerprint reader right here in the
button is made of glass on the back the
external microphone is perfectly round
vs. on the iPhone 5 which is kind of
hard to see here it's slightly
rectangular but there are two LED
flashes on the iPhone 5s versus the
iPhone 5 and that's because it has an
amber bulb and a white bulb that way you
don't make all of your pictures at night
look like you're taking photos of Casper
other than that they are exactly the
same they have the exact same speakers
and microphone jack on the bottom
they're the same lightning port that
we've all come to love and hate from
Apple at the same time and the screen
size is absolutely the same as the exact
same Retina display that is in both
devices the front-facing camera
apparently is a lot better on the iPhone
5 I forget the megapixel rating but the
iPhone 5s camera also does have a 60
frames per second mode it's got a
slightly lower f-stop when it comes to
low-light now Apple is claiming that you
do get DSLR quality images out of this
iPhone 5s and since I am a DSLR fan
myself have a couple myself I can tell
you right now that that is just
basically a big load of so we'll be
taking some photos with both these
cameras and comparing but we'll go ahead
and get started here with a couple of
speed tests we'll go ahead and start at
both these phones at the exact same time
on the count of three and we'll see
which one boots first one two three so
you do have an Apple logo first on the
iPhone 5s and I'm not sure why I have a
white background with a black Apple I
think that's because the iPhone 5s is on
7.0 point one and I'm on 7.0 point oh
because the point one was only put out
there to address some issues with the
iPhone 5s okay so we are up here on the
iPhone 5s we are still loading on the
iPhone
five will put a timer up okay so I don't
know the difference was I want to say
it's probably close to ten seconds but
there you have it I wish these screens
will stop dimming out on me so often
there we go
and we'll go ahead do a slide to unlock
we do not have a fingerprint setup on
the iPhone 5s just to make things fair
when it comes to getting into the device
so we'll slide to unlock together and
you can see those are pretty much
identical once you're inside the phone
is really not a whole lot different
between the two devices so I've loaded a
couple of apps that I feel are very
common apps that people tend to use
we've got Netflix we're going to do a
speed test we got Pandora and we've also
got a benchmark utility called pass mark
that we're going to use to really
compare the hardware of these two
devices make sure there's nothing
running on both these phones okay so as
you can see there's nothing running on
either of these phones we're gonna go
ahead and do it goddamnit we're going to
go ahead and do a speed test here on the
count of three one two three what the
 location settings are on okay so
now that we've got both phones uh once
again reset no apps are running
hopefully no tweets will come in we're
going to load up speed test this is on
the Verizon LTE network we're going to
see if there's any sort of radio
improvement on the 5s versus the five
we're going to open the apps together
one two three they opened up at the
exact same time we'll begin the test one
two three the preparing dots are
slightly ahead on the 5s but the pink
test is nearly identical 37 versus 61
though but when it comes to speed I mean
these two are pretty much identical as
you can see the Verizon LTE speed here
is pretty much garbage and they're both
struggling to upload if the iPhone 5s is
pulling a little bit ahead on the upload
and there you go they're both connected
to the same server nearly identical
download speed the upload speed was a
little bit faster on the 5s but you can
see the ping was half let's go ahead and
restart this test for continuity and
we'll be right back
and we're back comically enough we now
have more than almost wish I have just
about tripled the download speed and now
the iPhone 5 won on the download test
1.82 versus a 1.06
let's do one more test just to see if we
get the same results all right well
we're done looks like the iPhone 5 took
the cake two out of three times four
point five three download versus a two
point seven four on the 5s and one point
nine eight up versus a one point three
one on the 5s don't know what that's all
about
I mean this could be margin of error
between both devices connecting to the
tower and putting a load who knows who
cares that's the way the test actually
worked out so now we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and close down
the apps here we're going to make sure
that nothing's running and we're going
to go ahead and take a look at loading
speed on Netflix and we'll touch both
these apps at the exact same time one
two three
looks like the iPhone 5s pulled quite a
few seconds ahead we're still loading on
the iPhone 5 there we go iPhone 5 is up
they are the exact same account so they
loaded the exact same data as you can
see right here got all my cartoons let's
go ahead and load a program or a movie
that's never been played before and see
there we go how about how about Sesame
Street we'll play a couple seconds of
Sesame Street we'll see which one loads
first count of three one two three they
both came up at the exact same time
we'll hit play one two three
and we have video first on the iPhone 5
that was a little bit unexpected all
right Abby Cadabby will talk later I
mean I mean who is this how do you close
this thing
Oh Batgirl
there we go let's go ahead and go to in
one more program let's see if we can get
same results let's load up some how
about this lego ninja guy one two three
exactly the same one two three
and once again we have video first on
the iPhone 5
now that could have something to do with
the radio performance that we were
seeing out of this 5s a second ago when
it comes to connecting to this
particular wireless or this Wi-Fi
network here for Verizon we're still
loading on the 5s now these are uncashed
videos guys these videos have not been
visited before on either of these phones
and I'm going to go ahead and say the 5s
may have timed out on this video because
it's not even there we go Wow ok so that
that's a little bit of a discrepancy
there on performance I'm gonna load up
one more just to see if we get the same
results let's go ahead and bring up how
about Undercover Boss we'll do that okay
same episode episode 1 season 1 1 2 3
and once again we have video first on
the iPhone 5 but the 5s was only 2
seconds behind on that one but the
bottom line is on all three tests the
iPhone 5 loaded video first so take it
however you want that's the way the
results came out on that one these are
both on the exact same wireless network
the LTE from Verizon and I am only about
a quarter-mile away from the tower so we
can't blame reception on that one ok so
now we're going to go ahead and do a
couple of browser tests here just to see
what kind of performance we get in the
browser so let's make sure all the apps
are shut down over here we'll go to
Safari and as you can see the Disney
website came up slightly faster on the
iPhone 5s than the iPhone 5 but that's
because these are cache websites we've
been to both these websites in the and a
test I was doing without realizing that
the the camera wasn't even recording
yeah there you go so anyway we'll go
ahead and go to the Apple website
neither of these phones have been to
Apple's website ironically and we will
see which one loads faster here on the
LTE for Verizon 1-2-3 and once again the
iPhone 5
loaded faster than the iPhone 5s okay so
we got new ENCOM and the menu bar on
both these phones one two one two three
iPhone 5 is already loaded before the
iPhone 5s even brought up any content so
I don't know if maybe there's something
going on with this iPhone 5s when it
comes to the radio but the iPhone 5 is
just dominating it every time it gets
raw data over the internet now if you
visit a cached website that you've
already been to it's an entirely
different story especially when it comes
to bringing up the app you can see the
iPhone 5s well I guess they're pretty
much the same but let's go ahead now and
compare the hardware just right up
against each other we'll go ahead and
use performance which is passmark a
performance benchmark run both these at
the same time we'll run the benchmark
and see exactly how they compare
hardware wise so we'll go ahead and come
back once this test is complete and we
will compare the numbers at the end okay
we're back both have finished here let's
go ahead and take a look at the results
and okay so now when it comes to the
numbers it becomes pretty obvious that
the iPhone 5s definitely beats the
iPhone 5 when it comes to the system the
iPhone 5s scored a fifty four hundred
and twelve system score versus the
iPhone 5s 36 hundred fifty-three when it
comes to disk speed believe it or not
but the storage right speed of my iPhone
5 is well 13 megabytes per second faster
than the iPhone 5s but the read speed is
half of what it is on the 5s so the read
speed is being smashed by the iPhone 5s
memory wise and memory is quite a bit
faster on the 5s 886 megabyte megabits
per second or megabytes per second
versus 601 on the iPhone 5 2d
performance look at this a 2488 score
versus a 1230 so double and then when it
comes to 3d 1928 versus 1806 simple test
60 frames per second on both and the
complex test 49 point nine frames per
second on the iPhone
versus fifty five point six so simple
test they were capped out and the
complex test was faster than the iPhone
5 now I can't explain why the iPhone 5
was beating the 5s on the apps that
ended up using cellular data they're
both on the same network they're both
LTE the iPhone 5s is brand new so
there's not been you know any anything
going on with the phone that could be
slowing it down the only thing I can
think of is that maybe the iPhone 5s
isn't being fully utilized yet with the
64-bit processor now time will tell if
developers are going to start really
tailoring their apps towards this faster
processor a bit rate of the processor on
the iPhone 5s obviously they will
because that's going to be the future
for the iOS apps but ultimately I think
if you're on an iPhone 5 it clearly
makes no sense to go to an iPhone 5s not
from this perspective if you're on an
older phone like a 4s or a4 or obviously
anything earlier than that or you're
coming over to iPhone from a different
carrier or a different platform like
Android or Windows Phone it makes sense
to go with the 5s if you can afford it
the iPhone 5c is going to have the same
kind of performance that you see here on
my 5 because it's the exact same
hardware so if you want to make the
decision for you the iPhone 5s makes
perfect sense if you are not coming from
an iPhone 5 it's just not big enough
jump the apps in the 64-bit process
isn't there yet it's something that's
going to be evolving it's the very first
64-bit phone so it's going to take time
for it to catch on with the developers
so we'll go ahead and do now is go ahead
and leave you with some pictures taken
between both phones so that you can
compare and then we'll see you guys in
my next video and if you want to learn a
little bit more about iOS make sure you
click this video on the screen right now
and you'll learn all about iOS 7 and we
will see you guys next time
take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
