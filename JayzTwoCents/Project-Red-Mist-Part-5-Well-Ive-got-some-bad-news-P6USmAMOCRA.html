cents bring apart five a project red
mist I'm getting a little bit sick of it
too to be honest with you guys it's late
it's after midnight it's summer around
12:30 I've been working on this thing
since the moment I stopped tech talk
tonight and we signed off and I am just
really friggin exhausted so bear with me
on this one okay so the jokes aren't
going to necessarily be flying out
because even though it looks like I got
a lot done believe it or not a lot of
this is gonna have to come back out
because unfortunately I've got some bad
news we'll get to that in a minute as
you can see here I've got both the loops
together we've got the white loop we've
got the red loop and it turned out
really really good I'm very happy with
the way that it looks
got the white LED strip here I've got
the backlighting going on the reservoir
it's kind of hard to pick up on the
camera but trust me it's there we've got
the red and the white going on I've got
all the lower plumbing going on I've got
the drain ports I've got some of the
wiring in in fact there's not going to
be that much more wiring going on inside
here so it's going to be really easy to
see just how clean and tidy this is
going to be in fact this build is
starting to look like something that
belongs in a trade show on display
rather than something that should be
played with every single day so and I'm
gonna miss this thing I've spent a lot
of hours if I had to estimate the amount
of hours I spent today on it and the
amount of hours I've already spent I'm
about 65 hours invested into this build
so far which means that my hourly rate
at what I basically been paid means I've
been working for about 50 cents an hour
not steady anyway it's totally worth it
because I get to do custom build like
this for you guys so the bad news what
happened there's two pumps and two loops
going on here unfortunately one of the
pumps is bad I'm going to give you a
little education here in part 5 on
what's going on with the pumps and what
this means the way that these pumps work
is they're centrifugal floating bearing
pumps so what that means is you have an
impeller that's being turned by an
electric motor
that pulls water into the middle of it
spins it and centrifugal force pushes it
out now it's a floating bearing because
the only lubrication these pumps get is
from the water surrounding the bearing
allowing it to stay centered inside of
the shaft rather than I said shaft yeah
I did it stays floating in the middle
without touching any of the sidewalls
that's why it is extremely bad to run
your pumps dry you should never run your
pump dry even for a few seconds because
that can cause immediate life-shortening
and damage to your pump now one of the
pumps the one on the red loop is fine
where it works perfectly from the moment
I turned it on
unfortunately the loop pump for the
white loop is making it that very bad
sound that you can hear now what it
sounds like to me is that the impeller
itself might be slightly out of balance
it sounds like it's kind of flopping
around in there and and it's hitting on
the sidewall just slightly what can
happen sometimes is air can get in there
in that Anette fluid bearing if you will
where the the air can actually cause
turbulence in there will make it move
around now before coming to the
determination that it was bad I played
with the speed on it I die let the pump
run for a while I let it bleed turned it
off turned it on speed it up slow it
down and no matter what the sound is
there so that tells me the actual
sleeve or the bearing itself or the
shaft
I said shaft again is out of balance so
I get to start the RMA process which
means I get to chest test out my drain
plug drain the white loop get the plug
or the pump swapped out and start all
over on that one
it's not a big deal at least nothing has
to come apart on this actually it's all
going to be done in the bottom so thank
God for the for the drain port you guys
ask me all the time when it comes to
water cooling like hey how do you get
the fluid out well you've got to think
ahead and put a drain core or train plug
or ste fitting with a plug and a cap on
the bottom something to get the fluid
out of there so glad I thought ahead and
did that on this one now as you can see
here we've got some of the lighting
going on now one thing that I want to go
ahead and address here is about the way
that the graphics cards are set up in
the loop here because I already know
that there's gonna be people thinking
that I did this
and I'm going to be having temperature
issues and trying to convince me that I
made a fatal mistake here and I'm here
to tell you you guys are making a fatal
mistake by thinking I don't know what
I'm doing now without sounding cynical
or egotistical guys this has nothing to
do with the fact that I've been water
cooling for ten years it has everything
to do with the way that fluid dynamics
work and here's how this works the fluid
is initially going to flow through the
first card entirely it's going to bypass
the first card entirely flow through the
second card up through the top and then
back down through the first card it will
bypass that first card until that loop
is complete at which point that becomes
pressurized where the fluid will then
separate off into the first card
completing that loop and meet up with
the fluid coming out of the second card
thereby completely dividing the flow
fifty-fifty evenly where both cards are
getting the exact same amount of flow
the amount of time it takes for them to
bypass the first card fill up the second
and then meet again in the first is only
a couple of seconds and that's done
during the initial filling process at
which point when all of the system is
bled they are getting an exact equal
flow of water between the two of them
and if I had wanted it this was one loop
I could have gone all the way through
the left side through the first card
into the second card out of that top
port into the CPU and have the suite CPU
come back and come through that side so
they just look like two tubes coming all
the way through graphics card graphics
card CPU the exact same concept applies
so just putting that out there guys you
guys want to try and tell me that I made
a mistake here just wait don't waste
your time please this is fluid dynamics
has nothing to do with my opinion it is
the way physics work and there is
absolutely no conversation we had here
this just looks a hell of a lot cleaner
so the bending on this I you can see I
got all the bending done quite honestly
the most difficult Bend I had in this
entire thing and you might think it was
this lower tube or maybe the tube coming
out of the Southbridge into the return
of the white loop no it was actually the
tube going from the upper radiator down
into the motherboard block that was the
hardest one because it's just slightly
out of alignment
it's perpendicular so you've got coming
down and in
so in its off-center so that was
actually a little bit hard I took me
five tries to get that Bend finally
nailed it and I think it looks pretty
good considering so there it is guys I
actually had a lot more LEDs I could put
in here I don't think I'm going to
because I think at that point it'll be
too damn bright so I had hoped that part
six was going to be the build is done
and we've got some benchmark numbers and
stuff
unfortunately now maybe I'll just
document the replacement of the pump and
see where we go from there so guys this
has been part five I think I don't know
it's late and I lost track so my eyes
are bloodshot whatever is what it is I'm
going to edit this together real quick
I'm going to get to bed I'm going to
spend a Friday which is like technically
today hanging out with the family and
maybe I'll get some more done on this
unfortunately most of it now has to wait
for the replacement of the EK pump and i
just want to address that real quick
guys this is nothing this is not a bad
thing for EK i mean sure it sucks to get
a bad part
but you guys ask me all the time you
know have you ever gotten anything
that's bad in the mail very very rarely
and this happens this is not i'm not mad
at EK I'm not at frozen CPU this just
happens every now and then you get
something in the mail that is just
broken by the time you get to it or
defective in some way
don't stress and don't sweat it yeah it
screws up your timeline a little bit but
just go through the RMA process
communicate with them without like
trying to be mean and be like your
products suck I can't play my games now
because I have to wait that doesn't get
anything done so just be adult keep your
head cool go through the process you'll
get your stuff replaced and you know ek
unfortunately this one was bad but I
know that they'll make it right so I may
get on out of here guys as always I hope
to talk to you guys on Twitter or
Facebook or Instagram pictures of this
build as it's happening or going up on
Instagram and I'm really tired and I
remember what I was going to say so
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
