class is in session I've got an
important video for you today this is
you might recognize is the FLIR one I
picked this up at CES and this allows me
to do something that my eyes cannot and
this is see keep seeing he is a huge
deal because believe it or not when it
comes to the temperatures inside of your
system some things are happening that
you may not realize which is why today's
video is extremely important we are
going to check a couple of different
things today we're going to look at an
air-cooled system like the one you see
behind me and we're going to be taking a
look at a water-cooled system to see
what some of the differences are and the
way heat behaves both an air-cooled and
water-cooled environments this should be
good this is my 7700 K system that I
built take a look at it with the naked
eye right here you can see other than
some LEDs on the motherboard you can't
really tell that it's turned on but the
moment we put infrared in front of it
you can see there's actually quite a bit
of heat already on the motherboard just
from simply being powered on let me look
at that that in itself should be pretty
eye-opening on what's going on with your
system when it's plugged in and not even
doing anything
but what about when you turn it on and
there's no load on this system let's do
a little time lapse to see what happens
it's pretty interesting how the VRMs are
already pretty warm even though the
system is sitting here idle it's not
under any sort of load and you can see
the chipset there is looking pretty warm
as well on a teeth spreader something
else putting off a little bit of heat
here that you can see is the actual
built-in sound card so that's kind of
interesting you know I just loaded up an
overclock profile here at 5 gigahertz on
the 7700 K and as you can see
immediately the upper vrm heatsink
started to get kind of well you can see
the temperatures of change in there went
from kind of a yellow to an orange
immediately during booting what I'm
going to do next here is I'm going to do
an 8 o 64 stress test on the CPU and the
memory so keep an eye on the memory
going up and down right here I don't
know how much that's going to actually
increase on temperatures but the bright
red area right there is V RM and the top
right there is also V RM and this is
chipset so keep an eye on this area
these are the tubes right here for the H
100 that's keeping the system cool and
let's see what happens over time when we
put this thing under a little bit of
load
you can see the tubes have warmed up a
little bit the VRMs are pretty damn
smokin and the chips that didn't change
to too much but yeah you can see right
there though that we've got some pretty
intense loads that take place on the cpu
especially when they're overclocked and
like right now overclocked to 5
gigahertz at one point 4 volts yeah in
fact this h100 can't even really keep
this cooled like it needs to so I'm
going to go and stop the test before it
before I blow it up ok so next up is
graphics cards side note my skin is
actually cooler than the temperature of
the chipset there you go so that's what
my hand looks so yellow and not red
anyway we're going to go and do graphics
card testing here one of the things I
want to check for here on this test is I
want to see what's actually happening
with the heat pipes the heat pipe design
is what so many of these companies
actually tout as being you know what
makes them so good so I figure let's
check let's test that let's just let it
time lapse once again see what happens
over time with an MSI 1080 gaming X all
factory fan control but it is
overclocked to 2050 and the voltage is
at 100% so let's see what happens
and
interestingly enough the pipes are
pretty dang hot when I touch them but
they are still cooler than the PCB is
which is why they look cool on camera
but the PCB is the hottest point
remember this is showing us a range of
temperature not a color as a
representation of temperature so red
does not necessarily mean red hot it
just means that's the hottest thing on
the image this could be negative 20
degrees Celsius and still be red if we
were comparing it to something that was
negative 50 degrees Celsius if that
makes sense now back plates are one of
those things that's always been a
question is actually doing any good or
is it causing harm
some people believe back plates cause an
insulation issue where heat can get
trapped between the back of the graphics
card PCB and the back plate causing more
damage than good now we'll need more
testing in the future to determine if
that's true and there's a lot of
variables and a lot of different
backplate designs so there's no way to
really give you a definitive answer on
that one what I want you to take a look
at here is a couple of things once you
see the way the heat kind of spreads
across the back plate as a graphics card
gets hotter and I also want you to pay
attention what's going on on the
motherboard and around the graphics card
I want you to see how the graphics card
is actually affecting the temperatures
of things next to it that's the whole
point of this also to is I do have the
span currently locked so that it's not
going to allow the range of temperature
to change as your graphics cards getting
hotter so that's what I have it pointing
at right now I want you to see the
graphics card temperatures change in
relation to the environment you know
around it as a whole and you're going to
see it probably jumped twice maybe once
or twice on the temperature range where
once the graphics card turns white it
resets internet starts to turn white
again so that's why you're going to see
that all right enough talking let's go
ahead and get the test going
look at that look how hot that is the
actual backplate is about as hot as the
VRMs up there so that's why further
testing on back plate designs is going
to be a big deal for a lot of
manufacturers to make sure they're doing
it right and you see it just reset range
again because it couldn't go any warmer
than white so you can see we are now at
55 C on the back plate where it's
touching right there and it's actually
now hotter than the vrm you see how
there's more white here in the graphics
card than there is on the V RMS right up
there yet the graphics card is now
warmer than the surface temperatures of
the vrm pretty amazing but check this
out do you see how much heat is actually
affecting the motherboard do you see how
those three dots right there above the
graphics card are just as warm as well
some of the parts of the PCB here on the
graphics card well that's where your m2
would be that's why case flow and air
flow is hugely important when it comes
to your case we'll talk a little bit
about that in a second but yeah your
graphics card especially air cooled
cards blowing down on the motherboard
are creating an issue where it is
warming up parts around it well I
wouldn't really call it an issue but
something definitely keep in mind and
why m2 placement is huge when it comes
to motherboards it's also why putting
them on the back of the motherboard tray
sandwich between a back panel with zero
airflow it's not necessarily a good idea
so what about water cooling builds
obviously that's going to be better well
guys what we're looking at here is my
water-cooled ITX build I did for fractal
this is the define nano s it is a single
loop incorporating both a gtx970 from
gigabyte this is the g1 gaming and of
course a 4790k i7 and an ITX EVGA
stinger motherboard so the hotter part
on the screen here that you can see is
the chipset that is not water-cooled the
you can kind of see the outline of the
block right there that is where the
water block is for the CPU and of course
the graphics card is facing towards us
so what we're really looking for here is
I want to see what happens to the loop
temperature as the temperature inside
the system starts to go up so we're
going to that's what we're going to kind
of look for you I'm going to start a
heaven benchmark and we're going to see
what happens as we let it go I'm curious
is what the loop temp is going to look
like this loop is with glass tubing
which is also an insulator glass as an
insulator so we want to see here what
I'm curious about how that's going to
work out so let's just shut up and do it
well temperatures are pretty much
equalized to want to point some things
out here you can see the loop started to
glow because obviously it's getting
warmer you can see the chipsets pretty
darn warm and the vrn started to warm up
one thing I want to point out here real
quick though is you can see the warmth
of the fluid right here in the glass
what looks like right here the fluid
leaving the graphics card being super
hot is actually not what you're seeing
right there is a bleed effect of the
heat of the motherboard behind the tube
actually glowing through the tube which
is why up here it's not nearly as you
can see right it's not that it makes
this Bend right here it doesn't cool off
as it goes through the bend it's just
less heat glowing through but look at
how hot the motherboard is the mother
look how hot that motherboard actually
got even on a water-cooled system right
here part of the reason for that right
now is I have the side panel off the
case so there's very little directional
airflow you see the RAM actually started
to get pretty warm too so that's an
eye-opener let's talk about this guys
this is important okay class what do we
learn today well although it's important
to keep things like your CPU and your
GPU as cool as possible with things like
CPU blocks GPU blocks big-ass Noctua air
coolers and such keep in mind that there
is an entire system that is going on
inside of your case that's the reason
why we put our stuff in cases it gives
us an enclosure to control the
environment for cooling the problem is
some folks believe that because they
have a CPU block and a GPU block that
they can run an external remote radiator
somewhere else through tubing and not
have to run any fans in their system
giving them a nearly 100% silent system
the problem with that is as you've seen
with your very own eyes today there are
still parts in your system putting off
heat that have to be cooled your RAM
your VRMs your heat sinks that are on
your motherboard doing different things
like your chipsets all of those things
have to be cooled now I had already seen
this sort of stuff before I may have got
a laser temp probe right here I've used
laser temp probes all the time but I've
never had a chance to see how the heat
of certain components affect things
around it this is my first time spending
any time with thermal imaging and it
really was an eye-opener and it's going
to change the way I build my systems
moving forward so hope this has also
shed some light for you guys on what to
think about when you're putting too
your systems what types of fans you use
and where you place them there's
actually some system integrators
actually do this with all of their
system design puget system being one of
them they actually use thermal imaging
to design their systems and that is huge
that's why you're going to be seeing
this now used in any graphics card CPU
testing cooler testing in the future
anyway guys that's all for today I am
actually kind of sweating right now
because I've been doing all this thermal
testing in here and it's hot and I'm fat
and so anyway yeah I'm going to go now
before I start dripping sweat all over
the place let me know what you guys
thought about today's video if you have
any ideas you think I should use this
thermal imaging gun or the thermal
imaging camera on let me know keep it
clean
let's keep it PC related only ish
whatever experiments are bound to happen
time to go guys thanks for watching as
always I'll see you minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
