cents bringing you a video that I think
it's going to help a lot of you out now
with the introduction of project red
mist
in my last video obviously we're doing
some pretty extreme water cooling and
I've sort of over the last year and a
half become sort of an expert on the
topic of water cooling here in the
community considering I've been doing it
now for well over ten years I've been
doing impact since when we were
modifying aquarium equipment in our
systems to water cooler stuff there was
no such thing as frozen CPU or
performance pcs or any of that stuff or
you know specific water cooling
radiators for your computer that stuff
didn't exist man we were taking old
heater cores from cars and using those
as radiators and making all the brass
fittings from Home Depot do the work so
I decided I'm going to bring you a
commentary and talk about the most
common misinformation and myths that I
see when it comes to water cooling and
try and debunk those for you today so I
can help you determine whether or not
that is going to be the right move for
cooling your custom systems now
traditionally a commentary means that
you guys get to see first-person
perspective of some sort of a shooter
game typically Call of Duty you guys
know how I feel about Call of Duty's
we're not going to do that but I thought
I'd bring you something unique today and
kind of give you an over-the-shoulder
perspective of my Nvidia surround set up
with some assetto corsa driving
simulator because as you can see I got a
logitech g27
and you guys may or may not know this
but back in the days have some highly
modified cars one of them specifically
set up for road racing was sponsored by
Bach and Hotchkiss and so I really
really used to be heavily into the road
racing scene in fact I even had my
racing license for a while there so I
figured it'd be cool to kind of give you
guys an over-the-shoulder perspective of
me getting used to the new simulator
here while we go ahead and talk about
the topic at hand and which will be
voiced over so you guys we watching me
drive while I voice that over so without
further ado let's go ahead and talk
about common misinformation and
misconceptions and myths when it comes
to water cooling your computer alright
guys so just a real quick note about the
simulator here it is a set of course as
I mentioned I am going to be running on
full manual mode with clutch and shifter
all the assist turned off I'm going to
have a driving line going because I'm
not very familiar with the track here so
I just want to know the braking and
acceleration points of the track but
other than that this is an open track
day there's three classes here running
in this so we're going to have a whole
lot of fun hopefully I don't make a
complete ass of myself here on the track
even though the single-player I don't
want to get asked to you guys especially
since I just bragged that I used to do
this sort of thing so anyway here we go
ok guys let's do this here water cooling
your PC things that you hear that just
simply aren't true now I get this all
the time like all the time I get these
messages and it's from people they're
repeating things that they've heard from
somebody else that they think is true
now common misconception number one is
that water cooling your computer is
dangerous now that is absolutely true in
many perspectives but I would say it's
only going to be as dangerous as the
quality of parts of what you buy now
just like anything else you are going to
be taking a certain amount of risk when
it comes to water cooling your computer
I mean if
you're having fluid move around your
system now your system is not waterproof
I mean they do have you know water
resistant motherboards asrock has one of
those but there's no such thing as a
fully waterproof system now what people
will often try and do to basically make
you believe that you can have a
waterproof system is by going with a non
conductive fluid now let's go ahead and
talk about what a non conductive fluid
is technically distilled water in its
pure format is a non conductive fluid
water in itself is actually very very
low in conductivity what is actually
making it conductive is the minerals and
a lot of the other contaminants do you
find in water specifically water that's
carried through metal pipes or it's
contaminated by you know your faucet and
just depending on where it's stored it
could be picking up minerals from in the
container water is not pure especially
when it comes out of the faucet so
that's why you have distilled water it's
a special process that the water goes
through that makes it even more purified
than purified water so because of this
people will often ask me Jay are the non
conductive fluids worth it now here's
the way I feel about non conductive
fluids non conductive fluids are worth
it if you're a first-time builder that
you may be afraid of having some sort of
a leak in your system at its first boot
or in the beginning of when you first
start water cooling now the problem with
water cooling fluids that claim to be
non conductive is that they eventually
become conductive for the very same
reasons that I explained that tap water
becomes conductive by the time it comes
out of your faucet because of the fact
that it's picking up all kinds of ions
and minerals now how can it be picking
up ions and minerals or different types
of metal in your loop well think about
it all of your blocks your radiators the
pump it all has metal in it eventually
at over time as it's constantly in
contact with these metals the metals
will break down in a microscopic format
that eventually create conductivity and
contaminants in these non conductive
fluids so if you take the time to build
the system right my recommendation to
you would
- realistically not go with these
quote-unquote non-conductive fluids they
tend to carry a very hefty price tag
they also contend to be somewhat toxic
believe it or not I mean they do have
non conductive fluids out there that are
to have you know much better anti
corrosive built into them but they also
tend to have some contaminants in there
that are not entirely environmentally
friendly now I'm not speaking out of
like you know Treehugger or you know
let's go green type of side of my mouth
I'm basically just telling you that if
you're gonna potentially have a spill
you're gonna leave you or you're going
to flush your system you're not going to
want to go dumping these fluids down
your gutter or down your garbage
disposal into your sewer or your septic
tank it's just not a very good idea
my honest recommendation when it comes
to fluids for you would be to really
consider distilled water it's cheap it's
easy to replace and it's readily
available at the grocery store for a
buck typically maybe a dollar and a half
depending where you live and it's it's
easy to use and if you spill it you're
not going to hurt anything on your
carpet or your desk or your clothes or
anything like that now common
misconception that you also hear
regarding fluid is that going with fluid
that have dyes in them are going to gum
up and gunk up your system now that's
partially true fluids have come a long
way in the last few years when it comes
to advances in technology when it comes
to getting the pigments and the colors
that companies want to allow you to
customize your system with without
having a lot of the gel type dye in
there that typically is what falls out
of the fluid and gums up in the lowest
portion of your loop or inside of your
you know tiny micro fin blocks typically
your CPU block has the smallest fins in
it and it tends to gum up in there if
you're going to have a fluid that is
known to gum up now some colors are more
prone to gumming up than others red is
notorious for being the most unfriendly
color dye that you could possibly use in
your loop for many reasons one typically
dye that is red will eventually gum up
it's big study after study after study
and test after test after test on all of
these water cooling forms will show you
that red dye is notorious for this red
dye is also notorious for being nearly
impossible to flush out of here
I mean I had red dye and I ended up
trying to clean it out of my radiators
to the point to where no matter what I
did
boiling it vinegar using actual radiator
flesh over I used gallons and gallons
and gallons of this stuff to try and
clean out my radiators with red ek dye I
could not get the readout what would
happen is my fluid would turn a slight
purple color because it was purple dye
that they used to make their red base so
it got to the point where I ended up
actually replacing the radiators
altogether to get rid of my red dye now
common misconception I hear when it
comes to temperatures of water cooling
is wow you have a lot of radiators your
room must not get hot I mean if we have
gaming computers you guys know for a
long gaming session it can get pretty
damn hot inside your bedroom or your
gaming room or whatever it is these
computers put out a ton of heat
especially if you have high-end graphics
cards that have a lot of weights watts
to displace now the misconception here
is that water cooling makes your room
less hot I'm here to tell you that is
not true in fact in my experience I have
found that water cooling makes your room
more hot because instead of having all
of the heat sitting inside of your case
and the only heat that's making its way
out of the case is what your exhaust
fans can exhaust you have the high
efficiency of heat transfer from your
water blocks to your radiator exhausting
directly into the atmosphere typically
your radiators have exhaust fans on them
bring in the air straight into the room
now because of that you have a much more
efficient heat transfer meaning more
heat is getting out of your system and
into the atmosphere hence the lower
temperatures of your CPU and your
graphics card so please just think if
you're going to boot do a water cooling
system to try and make your ambient room
temperature lower while you're gaming
just know you may have an adverse
backwards effect that you're actually
expecting you may get the opposite of
that where your room technically gets
Charter in fact when I put the second
480 in my system here and I added the
second 780 my room temperature went up
by at least five more degrees over my
old system now when gaming because I've
got another 400 watts for the graphics
card that's being displaced into the
atmosphere so the misconception there is
that water cooling does not make your
room any less hot now another really
common misconception that I hear when I
see a lot of people who maybe aren't as
experienced with water cooling trying to
help out other people now I want to go
ahead and give kudos to those people
trying to help other people but giving
people the wrong information is not
exactly helping them in fact you're
doing them a disservice now what I'm
about to say here plenty of people may
have actually thought this and may have
actually given this advice and I'm just
going to tell you right now I'm not
looking down on you but I just want to
set the record straight increasing your
pump speed does not increase your
cooling capacity of your system
whatsoever let me repeat that increasing
your pump speed does not increase the
cooling capacity of your system period
there is no discussion here there is
absolutely no rebooting this this has
been proven time and time again the only
reason you have higher flow pumps and
variable speed pumps is so that one you
can control the noise and two you can
overcome higher restrictions as you put
more components in your system now I
ended up doing two graphics cards two
radiators and a CPU block so having two
pumps or one pump because I do have two
pumps in my system does not actually
give me any better cooling capacity
whatsoever the two pumps in my system is
for nothing more than the wow factor
it's not increasing the cooling capacity
at all and having my pump on setting 1
versus setting 5 on a basic system will
have absolutely no difference in
templates
ever so why do we have variable speed
pumps like I said it's to overcome the
amount of resistance that inevitably
grows in your system as you add more
components if you're running a basic CPU
block in a single radiator you can get
away with just about any pump that you
want the difference in pumps is going to
be how noisy they are the voltage at
which they run at and whether or not
they're adjustable I tend to like those
features that's why I go that route but
I just want to be clear the dual pumps
setup in my system does not increase the
cooling capacity and probably the most
common misconception of all is that the
order of the components in your loop
matter absolutely not the only thing
that matters is that your reservoir is
directly before your pump and is placed
higher than it so that when you're
filling and bleeding your system gravity
will feed the pump and prime it for you
that is the only component order that
matters period you're not going to
increase the temperature of your CPU if
you have the water going to your
graphics cards first in fact if you want
to know the truth I have two seven ATS
feeding into my CPU before going into
another radiator and it makes absolutely
no difference on the temperatures so you
want to find the most convenient path
that you can for your loop to make it
nice and easily accessible and without
looking like you know intestines and
tubes going every which away because you
think a certain order matters it doesn't
so please hear me when I say that it
absolutely doesn't matter what order
that your loops are in or that the
components of your loops are in just
keep these misconceptions in mind listen
to things I've had to say and you guys
will be just fine if you decide to water
cool well yeah the guys second place
isn't too bad
we're not the cleanest race out there
but anyway I'm still getting used to
this whole you know force feedback thing
it doesn't feel exactly like the real
thing anyway guys thanks for watching I
hope you've learned something today
about water cooling and as always follow
me on Twitter if you want to ask about
water cooling or I'll just see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
