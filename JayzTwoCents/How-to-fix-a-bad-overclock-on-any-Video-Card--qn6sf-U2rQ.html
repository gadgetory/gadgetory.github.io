all the reasons why you need to
overclock and unlock the full potential
of the hardware that you own and every
single time I do that some of you push
back telling me you're too scared you're
too afraid you're going to break
something and you just are really not
comfortable doing that well today I'm
going to intentionally overclock some
stuff too far I'm going to show you how
to get it back and hopefully by the end
of this video puts you at ease that it's
harder to break your stuff than you
really think it is with its unique
freeform modular system the new master
Casemaker 5 from cooler master allows
unparalleled flexibility with its
adjustable internal layout and exterior
customization options learn more about
how you can start customizing your own
case by following the link down in the
description now this is you might
recognize is MSI Afterburner we're going
to use MSI Afterburner for simply the
sake of simplicity today because it does
pretty much apply to all the different
overclocking utilities but we're also
going to make sure we have this button
checked right here that says start up
now what that does is it means apply the
overclock to the graphics card at
windows startup whether msi afterburner
is running or not now there is a
separate setting in here where you can
start msi afterburner with Windows I use
it I set it minimized that way I can
monitor things like temps but we're
going to just let this thing go by
applying the overclock when we start up
windows now what we're going to do here
is we're going to say you know what
we're going to overclock this thing 100
megahertz we're going to go oops and
we're going to apply it to a thousand
megahertz and we're going to hit apply
and we don't realize we did that right
because it didn't do anything right now
it just simply said oh we're going to
apply a thousand megahertz when we ramp
up the GPU so you don't realize you
actually did that you're going about
your business you might start up here oh
oh well now what oh ok that's easy
we'll just go ahead and do it we'll just
do a soft reset on the PC we'll just hit
that reset button now first it's not
really much of a problem
because what we've got right here is
well it didn't do anything until we like
tried to load up our browser which is
actually GPU accelerated I'm using
Chrome and then we go to restart the
system we go oh man what happened did
something grow up I overclocked and you
are panicking you think oh no I think I
just broke my card a big purple screen
that can't be good I think I think my
graphics card is dead
oh crap and then you start to reboot
into Windows and yeah you patiently wait
you're tapping your fingers on the key
on the on the desk and you're going oh
oh I shoulda listened to Jay that big
fat ass told me to grit overclocked my
graphics card and now it's broken I
should have never listened to him so
then we get into our desktop here we go
oh thank god everything's working well
that could have been Oh what's up and it
black screens on you complete hard lock
and you're going oh man what the hell
because guess what we're applying that
thousand megahertz on startup so now
when Windows is starting it's going
let's go ahead and just push an extra
gigahertz to our graphics card because
you weren't paying attention and now
you're thinking oh crap I broke my card
but you didn't you simply applied a
little bit too far of an overclock now
the point of this video is going to be
how to get that overclock fixed those
two ways we could do this we could
actually take and this is this is a
little bit simpler where it doesn't
involve going into startup or dealing
with any of that you can take your spare
gtx 980ti
because you all have spare 92t eyes
right you can take this turn off the
system remove the graphics card that's
being applied too far of an overclock
right now plug this guy in start up the
system and it will be fine because
there's no saved profile for this so if
we did that right now we would get to
our desktop and everything would work
fine you could then go in and you could
uninstall MSI Afterburner don't save the
profiles and reinstall it or just delete
the profile for the GTX 1080
chances are you don't know how to do
that which is why you're watching this
video or maybe you're just curious
chances are also that you don't have a
spare gtx 980ti
or even a spare graphics card if any
sort sitting around as long as you have
a different graphics card that isn't the
same chipset as the one you've got like
a 980 TI different variations of 980ti
you would still apply the overclock so
you don't want to use another same
generation or same GPU graphics card
series we're gonna do we're gonna go
ahead hit restart on the system one more
time now my system actually hangs so
much that the restart button doesn't
actually do anything I actually I have
to hold down the power button to get it
to cycle what we're hoping right now is
that it will bring up the startup
options usually Windows 10 I'm using
Windows 10 is a little different when
10 is usually pretty good about
realizing that crap we didn't load
properly so we need to bring up our our
startup menu let's hope it does that and
nope it didn't you would know because it
would say please wait down here at the
bottom if it was loading up the recovery
environment since it's not we're going
back into our desktop and we are going
to probably crash now I'm gonna try
holding the shift modifier right now
while we're booting because sometimes
that will keep it from actually loading
that particular profile nope it did it
now we got a green screen last time the
first time was a purple screen there was
a black screen now it's a green screen
so I guess now we could like do special
effects and stuff nope not really
okay so we're restarting one more time
this is the third failed start so what
we should get now is an actual recovery
environment from Windows Windows
hopefully is smart enough to realize
uh-oh we uh we're not we're not booting
properly he keeps hitting that reset
button so let's try and recover ah there
it is see it says please wait so Windows
has now detect detected they were having
a failed boot situation here that's a
good thing Windows 10 will do that
automatically if you're not on Windows
10 and this isn't happening you keep
getting this failed boot process try
holding down and mashing f8 while you're
booting and you should get into the same
menu that we're going to have right now
so if you're on Windows 8 or older then
start pushing f8 now don't do restart my
computer go to see Advanced Options go
to troubleshoot Advanced Options startup
settings and we want to enable safe mode
so we're going to start here with our
startup options which is going to give
you where we can boot in safe mode and
we can do our safe mode with networking
and all that stuff command prompt we
don't need any that we just want regular
old safe mode ok now once it restarts
you're going to be given some options
here of how to actually boot we want
number 4 safe mode we don't need
networking when a new command prompt we
just want regular old safe mode so I'm
pushing number 4 and what we're going to
be doing here is we're going to boot up
the system in safe mode and we're going
to uninstall MSI Afterburner simple
enough right
yeah pretty simple now because we're in
safe mode none of the other apps are
going to be able to open it's literally
just a bear
Bonz architecture that allows windows to
run with minimal things and activate it
so all we have to do now is go to
programs and setting or features and
then we can go into our MSI Afterburner
uninstall and change uninstall no you
want to say no you don't want to save
the profiles because if you do when you
reinstall with MSI Afterburner you're
going to apply the same problem again so
say no you don't want to save any of
these settings once this is done simple
enough
you just restart your system and you
will end up back in your regular
operating system with MSI Afterburner
uninstalled you can reinstall it and
this time pay a little bit more
attention to what you're doing now what
if you don't want to go through all that
but you actually have a spare 980ti or
I'm just I'm joking guys you don't need
a 980ti you can use any graphics card
that's not the same graphics card that
you have in there so don't use another
980ti if you have one in there don't use
another 1080 if you have a 1080 in there
use something else just use another
graphics card that's not the same as the
one that you have in there and we're
back at the desktop now and you can see
that we're not crashing because MSI
Afterburner which would be sitting right
there is no longer installed so it's not
going to apply a funky overclock that
keeps crashing your settings so now you
can redownload msi afterburner or
reinstall it pay a little bit more
attention to what you're clicking and
off you go but I want to point out we
just applied a thousand megahertz
overclock to the GPU multiple times we
didn't break it it's still here and it
still works let me go ahead and show you
how to do it now with the spare GPU
method the first thing I got to do is I
have to break it again now it might seem
a little ridiculous that I'm actually
showing you guys here the actual process
of switching out the graphics card but
that's called it's called creative
freedom murca we got freedom actually
just the Internet there are I don't know
if there are are there territorial
boundaries to the internet I don't know
I'm sure there are or else how else
could North Korea and China block it off
so anyway let's go ahead and get this
guy out of here this guy is always
little bit tricky to get out because of
that a big old button I showed you guys
in the review of this guy anyway we're
now going to take the 980ti this is the
same reboot where I turned it off we had
the failed start so I haven't done
anything other then throw in a different
graphics card plugging in our monitor
cable there we need when you power right
I mean it need some power need some need
some old space in here here we go
let's start it up once we swap the
graphics card all we gotta do is power
it on and wait now this thing doesn't
make me a complete and utter liar you'll
see that not only will we start up
everything will be working just fine
okay there's our Windows logo our little
spinning wheel we're logging in here
test bench and at you cannot you can
obviously see because now it's at a
native 4k not 1080 like I had the other
card that everything is working just
fine
so moral the story here guys is don't be
afraid play with it play the graphics
card yeah that's what we're talking
about here keep it clean guys keep it
clean now let's hold black flickering
screen you just saw it just re scaled
the desktop back to 1080 because that's
where I had it before and as you can see
everything is working just fine
so there you go after applying a
thousand megahertz overclocked multiple
times all you saw happened was a crash
nothing broke on the graphics card
nothing will break on the graphics card
because all we applied was a software
change would enforce more voltage to it
and if it can't run at the frequency all
it's going to do is it's just going to
crash nothing bad is going to happen and
I showed you it's not hard to recover
even from something that looks on the
surface like you have a bad graphics
card or it broke it really takes a lot
to break these things guys they are very
robust unless you're going in there
doing voltage mods and applying more
voltage way more voltage and even
something like MSI Afterburner will
allow then you're not going to break
your graphics cards there's free
untapped potential in there you guys
need to tap it it's going to give you
better gaming experiences higher fps and
we all know that fps is more important
than graphical quality doesn't make any
sense at all actually whatever we want
graphics quality and we want FPS if you
overclock it you can have both alright
guys time to get out of here come up
with some more excuses and I'll come up
with another video thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
