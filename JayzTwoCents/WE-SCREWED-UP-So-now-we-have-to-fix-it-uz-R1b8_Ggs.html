here's the deal this build went so well
we want to do it again know so shout out
to some very astute viewers and I think
Josh was the first guy to actually
notice it so shout out to you Josh not
this job just this guy I didn't know
anything we put the vrm on the wrong or
the BRM pad for the waterblock not on
the VRMs it was on the chokes and that's
my bad I should have caught that back
Jake Jay I'm in marketing let me we put
that in there intentionally see how
closely you guys pay attention to these
videos so congratulations on passing the
test you might have noticed that in
pre-rolls where we say we put a v10
engine sound on a v12 car again you guys
pass legitimately though I'm not sure if
I did it right on my D frame build now
so now I'm gonna have to go back and
watch the build footage to see if I did
it wrong so I think that keeps with the
theme of like this is a real build stuff
happens you know here's the other thing
too is we did not put a drain in here
like a drain port specifically because
there was no way to neatly do it with
the parts that we had and we actually
already drained this once during the
build just when we were testing stuff so
there is a drain method that I'm gonna
use so be a little bit of a how-to in
that and then we're gonna address some
of your questions from the build video
that went up last you guys haven't seen
that watch that one first so we'll ask
well answer some why did we do it this
way questions all right you know what
I'm just done with this one thing I'll
say though is a lot people complain like
when were using an HP bridge what does
it say first what I say wouldn't say so
normally I would have a drain coming off
the reservoir but on this we actually
use this fitting right here but if I
obviously just open it up like that it
is going to leak so we have to do it
this guy is Josh punch get the paper
towels you come in here and look at this
you'll see that this tube starts to get
empty so I'm just gonna crack this
fitting just a little bit because as
soon as it starts to break the seal if
there's any pressure and this system
which or shouldn't because it's been off
then I'll be alright but yeah so the
fluid will be right on the edge of that
pink boa no where's all your fluid you
got a problem sir so now we do is we
just thread in my drain so yeah we it's
adding a couple extra steps to drain the
system I think Josh agrees that this was
a cleaner way of doing it there so now
we can set it up right as long as this
is perpendicular then you know it's
blocking the flow right that's the
easiest way to remember the valve
whether open or closed perpendicular
means closed let me go ahead and run
it's like a road block across the road
there so I gotta undo this cap so that
we can let air in and then we can oh my
god it's leaking that's a feature -
nicely drained right there hold on yeah
we're good now legit have been wondering
like did I do the D frame wrong - at
least that one's a lot easier to get -
yeah
I'm blowing bacteria into the loop so
I'm just giving people ammunition to be
like see that's why I don't water cool
because this just isn't worth it it's
also not worth spending a hundred
thousand dollars on an engine to go 250
miles an hour in the Texas mild but
people still do it you know in my
thoughts - or like anybody can build a
PC it is easy it's when you have that
first problem with troubleshoot whatever
that's where I still enjoy this I mean
this is still fun for me we're going to
elevate the ceiling this party's in play
go we might have to take more of the
loop for it it's gonna be like a
complete teardown you know that it'll go
gonna mix that we are almost
disassembled so since we have the top
off we can also just slide it out this
way as it hooks on all the shoes this is
a marketing opportunity not my channel
bro believe me nobody watches your
channel to learn anything so I'm good
they want to lose the washers either way
to do the surgeon thing over there
someone's counting one two
three four bars so all of this was just
so that we could get to that because
this was supposed to go we're just off a
wee bit there there so like I said I
can't remember if I did this right on my
D frame right now oh yeah all of that
for that all of that for that we had to
redo the thermal paste so these are the
VRMs down here we had stuck them on the
choke I think the reason why I did that
out of habit was because on the GPU
blocks you do cool the chokes - but I
mean let's be honest here we could have
done all this off-camera and not show
anybody but we air my mistakes around
here we like keeping it real as it were
this is how people learn though I mean
if if the guy is always like I'm perfect
then I do everything right then no one
learns anything because they're gonna be
like how do I handle these problems when
they arise because a real person's gonna
get in here and maybe make that mistake
but if they but if they see this and
they be like well this Pro makes
mistakes too then it feels more real
it's best to splash as much coolant on
the case so that the case is just as
cool as everything inside it looks like
grimace threw up all over there
all right so obviously it's back
together and we are now doing updates
because we made the mistake of plugging
in the ethernet cable and it was like
boo internet update window saw a chance
to cock-block the rest of the bill going
forward or tweaking everything plus we
also did the BIOS update yeah we did do
a BIOS update we were on zero seven zero
two which was a very old BIOS now we're
on 1307 or 1301 whatever so we were
gonna take this opportunity to answer a
couple of questions from the why did you
this and why did you that why did you
why did you why to do and all the stupid
why did you questions I'm sorry the
obvious this fractal cell purple fans
know we don't actually these are venturi
is that on a custom painted and we're
Zanna she's off painting something else
somewhere hey Donna what paint did you
use on the fans it's a case called
Montana they're like their Blackwing
series have ever seen there you go
Montana paint if you want to replicate
something like that the other thing that
we get a lot is the height thing where
we're both just tall no seriously you're
like six six with shoes I can fit in a
Lamborghini oh that's another one
someone's almost talking treasure dude
whips in a lamb but rental oh my god
rental he's known as like the rental car
key yeah believe me if I had a Lambo I
would probably be driving that right now
you wouldn't be having me build your
computer no no exactly I'd have seen
good align it yeah yeah exactly Lambo
buddy and he can't reach the top part of
the loop anyway it's okay
same shirt yes I only have one shirt
it's not possible that I have multiple
copies is it also completely
unfathomable that you would be wearing a
fractal design shirt while doing a
fairly fractal design sponsored video
yeah I thought was a coincidence but you
know no I planned ahead and I did that
okay can I have your old build no
because he's greedy
mostly greedy and I have other plans for
it it's not the only system that I need
so there you go I didn't ask for it cuz
it's too slow I have a 4770k but it's on
display in the glass coffee table so you
just have it as art an art installation
you are stuck up um let me see here
sound like Harrison Ford han Solo I
don't get that I do that you know I
think he sound a lot like Josh Schmidt
hey that would work that's me um the
bridge what do you want to say about the
bridge we already showed it earlier in
the video it is an HP bridge just
because it doesn't have LEDs and a nifty
little cover it is still in an HP bridge
and fun fact if you guys take the solid
bridge from like old generation
motherboards before HP bridges were even
developed if you put that in with two
Pascal cards and it it will identify as
an HB bridge it has something to do with
the bandwidth capability of both headers
being used and then having the solid
connection not the flexible ribbon cable
so yeah I mean I don't know why people
thought just because it came with the
motherboard it wasn't an HP bridgette
more than is an HP bridge well more than
is more than is Oh people seem to like
content with you and I in it together
well I'm a lot of people say it seems
like we're friends and like that's
camera trick Regis Lee it is that is my
amazing acting skill yeah exactly
because so there's cut is looking pieces
like as soon as we cut right now you
were GTFO oh one last one
some guy said no one knows me is fractal
Josh okay man you got like two followers
one of them's her mom and she has you
muted suck it I've been around Jay to
lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
