and I'm gonna try and bring you a very
quick a very crude video on how to
safely and effectively overclock your
AMD or Nvidia graphics cards so don't go
away
okay guys I'm gonna try and bring you as
much information as I possibly can in a
video that's long enough to keep your
attention because I know there's all
those other videos over in the sidebar
just begging watch me watch me watch me
and you know you want to click it but
you also want to know how to overclock
your graphics card so I'm gonna bring
that information to you as quickly as
possible now what you're looking at here
is my channel so if you accidentally
come across this video or stumbled
across me for the first time check out
some of the other videos I have here you
can see I've got a lot of PC related
stuff I've got blogs I've got some Tech
Talk which is a podcast that I do I've
got all kinds of stuff in there that
meets pretty much everybody's fancy and
likes to tickle it and and all that
dirty stuff that probably is a little
bit over the top but this program is
what we're going to take a look at today
and this is msi afterburner and to get
started i'll put the link down in the
description make sure you check it out
download this program it's absolutely
free and it works with any graphics card
you have whether it be AMD or nvidia all
the way back to the 200 series and
videos I believe and the 4000 series
AMD's now to get started here I'm gonna
go ahead and just kind of give you a
quick rundown of the basic functions of
this utility there's just way too much
to cover in one video so we're gonna
show you the important stuff now it
shows me that I'm using a gtx 680
because that's when i'm using and it
shows me the driver version that i'm
music make sure you're using the most
up-to-date driver for your graphics card
it is very important to do that because
the manufacturers do take overclocking
into account and the drivers make a huge
difference when it comes to overclocking
and stability and a core voltage here is
measured in millivolts what that means
if I add 100 millivolts I'm adding point
1 volt because that's how that works
that's math people that's math milah
thousand
Boult 100 of a thousand or 0.1 there you
go math lesson we're done for today
all right core voltage 100 millivolts
you can slide that all the way to the
right on just about any card most cards
aren't going to allow you to over volt
and do damage because they're limited by
their BIOS you can't hurt them power
limit is what you see in my case because
I'm using a 680 which is a GPU boost 1.0
feature for NVIDIA it says my card wants
to run at 132 percent of its max power
target it's just the way NVIDIA calls
over clocking just slide it all the way
to the right you're not gonna hurt
anything
now core megahertz is just like core
voltage where you're gonna be adding
megahertz to the boot boost clock of
your graphics card whether it be AMD or
Nvidia so if I have a 165
megahertz overclock so whatever my boost
voltage is plus 165 you have to do the
math because it's different for every
card if you have a graphics card that
has a 180 megahertz clock and you add
165 to that your overclock is going to
be affectionate effectively twelve
hundred and forty-five megahertz or 1.25
gigs
depending on which number you like to
look at I like the bigger number so
we'll go with 1200 and 45 now memory
clock is one of those things that a lot
of people get very confused about what
you have to think about is the fact that
you are dealing with double density ramp
you're dealing with VDD r5 with just
about any graphics card made today and
what that means is DD is double density
so if I add 300 megahertz to my memory
clock I'm really adding 600 megahertz
because the double density is the RAM
multiplier of 2 so if I have in my case
a gtx 680 which has advertised 6,000
megahertz ram if i add 300 to this i'm
really adding 600 megahertz to my 6000
for a total overclock of 6 to 600 now on
the surface when you listen to that for
the first time if you're a noob and you
have no idea what any of this means you
probably went what the fuck is he
talking about he's throwing numbers at
me I don't want numbers I just won a
game and overclocking blah blah blah
what you can do to be safe guys is just
leave this number at zero and the reason
why I'm telling you to do that is
there's a video I'm gonna be doing in
the future called
how does memory clock speed really
affect your gaming performance on your
graphics card we're gonna talk about and
debunk the importance of having super
super fast Ram and what it really means
to your overall gaming performance and
frames per second or different types of
games little teaser for a future video
for now you can leave it at 0 if you
understand how the memory clock works
just go ahead and start playing with
that number you can't really hurt
anything the worst case scenario if you
overclock any of these functions too far
blue screen of death or a system lock up
or an invidious case usually just a
driver crash and then you restart can't
really hurt anything most graphics cards
today are very foolproof if you're using
an old card an old card you may end up I
don't even want to say you may end up
damaging something but because of you
know liabilities and stuff this is
definitely do at your own risk now down
here on the bottom you can see we have
different profiles apply reset settings
and save if you want to set this
overclock
hit apply there your graphics card is
now expecting to see this set up but you
notice over here on the monitoring right
here the core clock which is where my
cursor is we're still running at 1006
which is my base clock not my boost
clock my base clock well why didn't it
go up well because if you go into
settings here I have if you go over to
the right on the top bar you'll find
profiles you can set up profiles and
what that shows here is 2d and 3d so if
I have a 2d program running like a video
or a 2d game you know flat side scroller
type game you can tell it use whatever
profile I've saved to profile number one
if I want to set a 3d profile you can
see I have these different profiles that
have saved and by doing that if I just
set something hit save they start to
glow and I can say okay save it to
number two there you'll see number three
number two number one so you have these
sliders move select it hit apply and
there you go so if you go back in here
to your
Profiles I can say in 3d profile or a 3d
game like Battlefield 3 or any other new
game it doesn't have to be new just any
game that uses any sort of 3d rendering
I can say load profile number two when
you realize the card has gone into a 3d
mode and it will automatically apply the
overclock and when you turn off a 3d
game or you quit gaming it'll
automatically turn off the overclock and
down here you can see a plight
overclocking at system startup just
leave that on you'll never have to think
about it ever again it's just that easy
now what I like to use when it comes to
testing stability even though this comes
with a built-in program called combustor
if you click this kay it'll bring up
that program I don't like this program
it doesn't truly stress your graphics
card nearly enough I like to use Valley
benchmark and if you open up valley
benchmark and you hit run this is all
this is also a free program you've seen
it in some other videos the link is in
the description let this run for a solid
hour if you can get this program to run
for a solid hour and you don't get any
crashes then it's safe to say that your
overclock is stable now you may find
that some games crash even though you
have a solid overclock running in valley
benchmark and the reason for that is
because well you know every game tends
to use the graphics card in a different
way some people will put more emphasis
on shaders some people will put a lot
more emphasis on you know different
textures modeling and there's different
functionality that happens inside a
graphics card and every game utilizes it
in a different way so you may find some
games are not quite as stable so if that
happens back off your overclock just a
couple of points on the megahertz and
see what happens
now what I want to do now is show you
guys what happens and how much
performance actually increases when it
comes to your overclock so I'm gonna
turn off the overclocks here and nothing
is gonna happen when I run a 3d game
we're gonna start up 3d mark 11 and then
we are gonna take a look at the score
and we'll compare before and after on
the over
on the 3dmark score and the video
specifically the video score and we'll
see how much extra performance that we
actually pulled out of this simply by
moving a few sliders on the MSI
Afterburner
so through the magic of editing we will
be right back
okay so here we go guys here's my first
run right here with my 1 GTX 680 in my
i7 3770 even as top speeds I'm getting
92% better results than everyone else
it's kind of weird considering I guess
this whole big chunk of the graph right
here really makes up half of the people
though that doesn't statistically add up
whatever what we want to take a look at
here actually is the graphics core
physics core is gonna definitely change
based on the processors you're using
your your speed and all that but the
graphics core is completely independent
of that and I've got a 99 oh nine and if
you take a look at right here you can
see my overclock never kicked in this is
my boost clock of eleven hundred and
twenty four so let's go ahead and set my
overclock right here and now let's go
ahead and see how the score changes and
do the magic of editing we will be able
to write back
there you go guys now we have an eleven
thousand thirty three piece score and a
graphics score jumped all the way up to
eleven thousand two hundred seventy
three and I jumped up two percent on the
better than results up to the nine
better than ninety four percent of all
of the results were using this hardware
so there you go guys you don't have to
be Walter White and make meth or sling
crack cocaine or whore yourself out on
the corner just to afford the biggest
and baddest graphics card on the market
when you can just get one that fits your
budget overclock it a little bit and
pull out more performance for every
dollar that you've spent on this
graphics card so go out download these
programs are down the description
overclock these things let me know how
bad you did and or how good you did them
by bad I mean how badass you did
overclocking your graphics cards let me
know on Twitter and Facebook all that
stuff's down the description I'd love to
hear how much you were able to overclock
your graphics cards and how much better
your frames per second are so happy
tweak and have fun and by tweaking I
definitely mean computer tweaking Emma
you know some of you guys may do a
little bit of that stuff in my computer
just farted my laptop farted some of the
battery's dying okay guys I'll see you
later check out my other videos remember
in the future we're gonna talk about
graphics card RAM speed and how much
that really matters
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
