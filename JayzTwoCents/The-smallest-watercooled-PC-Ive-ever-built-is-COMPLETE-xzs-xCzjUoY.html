of crap do you want to be cooler do you
want to be more desirable you know what
guys I got new merch it's available now
have me calm /jc sense we got zip up
hoodies we got tri-blend we got a new
logo I digress
since 2012 but the rest logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys
little bit uh well kinda stuff zip up
hoodies beanies polos don't take my word
for it cuz obviously I can't do this
edie so just look in the description
below and you guys will find the link
Thanks so this will probably end up
being one of those montage you type
videos so there's couple things I want
to I guess answer from the comments
section of the previous part of this
video I showed you guys how I'm using
the cross flow ride up top because it's
also working as both a reservoir and a
fill and a drain section and will show
you how I'm gonna do that right now
because I still have all the distilled
water in here for my proof of concept
that the loop would work the pump did
not as I showed you guys just didn't
have enough power but fortunately my
good buddy is over at performance pcs
stepped in and sent me the Swift tech
apogee to our apogee drive 2 which is
basically what Swift tech did here was
they took a laying DDC pump they shoved
it on top but one of their copper blocks
and put a heatsink on top it should
clear the components I'm still worried
about these guys right here on the side
that stick out so we're gonna do best we
can hope it works jeez I hope it works
but I digress that's besides the point
it should work if my calculations are
correct which they never really are so
that doesn't mean yet this should fit in
there but unfortunately to mount this
I've got to take the whole thing apart
because I've got to drain it and I've
got to remember to peel that off also
had to take the motherboard out anyway
or at least mostly because I have to
install my m2 because remember this was
just a temporary mock-up so just like
any other reservoir to get the the loop
drained you've got to have air in vs air
out so if you've got coolant coming out
you have to have air coming in which
means we need an inlet and an outlet and
this cross-flow rad works perfectly for
that so what
right now I'm sure this looks kind of
obvious now how we're gonna do this I am
just going to have two tubes hooked up
to this and you can't just blow into the
tube and expect the coolant to come out
I had a lot of people suggest like well
you should hook up a vacuum and pull the
coolant through the problem is all
that's going to happen is it a pull
straight through the rad and back out
the other side it won't force it through
the loop for that to work this has to be
the only outlet and has to be the only
Inlet but because this is in the same
reservoir radiator technically reservoir
in this case that won't work so what I
can do though now tilt this up and
that's how we can drain it so I'll have
to do this a bit because it's going to
get trapped in all the blocks and stuff
but I'll be able to get pretty much most
of it out this way
so we learned is that the height of the
90 degrees on here made it interfere
with the side panel there
fortunately the apogee drive - allows
you to sort of rotate these fittings
about that's about 45 degrees that way I
can get a little bit of extra clearance
just further shows that even parts that
are made for small form-factor builds
like this can still sometimes be too big
because of the overall size of the case
that we're dealing with
all right so another snag in this build
as it seems to be the theme the
unfortunately the EVGA power supply that
we had the 650 GM is dead on arrival I'm
a little disappointed about that because
of the fact that it's so small it was
gonna give me all kinds of extra room
fortunately I have a 650 watt
Silverstone here dbj is rated better I
think we just got bad luck but I want to
keep going I don't wanna wait for a
replacement so I'm going to be stealing
the one out of the 1800 X build because
I'm going to be taking these 1800 X
parts out of here and probably building
something in like the H 200 or something
like that from NZXT you know all you
guys are probably wondering like well
Jay why didn't you just use this build
then for your CES because it's got 1800
X and stuff in there well that again
that's because I promised I was gonna do
a fully custom water-cooled yadda yadda
blah blah blah and I want to keep my
word also to one of the reasons why I'm
not using this is I really wanted the
silver build but when they sent me this
for review they didn't have silver yet
they only had the black and the problem
the black has scratches show up
fingerprints skin like cuz it's it's
like a bead blasted sort of a
sandblasted finish your skin cells and
stuff cuz get all gross and nasty on it
silver hides all that so there's that
but now is a better time than ever to
just sort of take this one apart put it
out to pasture and get that one up and
running
all right this is about to be
straight-up moment of truth now
everything's in all the wiring is
plugged in everything works its powers
on when we push the power button that's
a good sign looks like everything's
gonna clear the areas we were concerned
with and this is my pump wire right here
my pump power wire now we are going to
now fill and bleed the system so I clean
up this table and this should be the
last last time I have to take it apart
or do anything with it
okay it's done I promise you guys I
would do this like a year ago I finally
did it
I found what I think is a very clean way
of doing it with soft tubing you know it
I said in my last video rigid tubing
would've been possible in this but I
take that back it totally would be not
possible for me I don't think I have the
patience for that definitely hit some
snags along the way though the pump
specifically being one of them because
what you really lack in this particular
case is a significant amount of room to
have a pump and a reservoir and all that
stuff and we even have two top hats on
here we could have added more top hats
and gotten more thickness and added you
know horizontal tubular reservoir and
all that stuff but then if you're adding
all this extra volume you're kind of
taken away from the whole purpose of
this you know ultra small form-factor so
I think the way it turned out in the
compromises we made are pretty good now
it's running a ninety nine hundred K
right now that's overclocked it's
sitting at thirty-nine see it idle which
is still kind of warm but the fans are
also barely turning right now I have the
fan profile set fairly aggressive to
where it will kind of favor silence
unlike the motorcycle it's meant by that
you probably fit in here okay now you
probably heard it so it'll favor silence
in terms of the fan but one thing we're
dealing with right now is for some
reason the apogee drive - even though we
do have the PWM controller on it plugged
into the pump controller on the
motherboard no matter what I set it to
the pump still runs full speed which is
indicative of it's not seeing PWM so
I've tried it on DC just see what
happens I've tried PWM I've got in there
manually adjusted it so the pump is
pretty noisy but once the side is on and
if I dreamt the fans up a little bit
they definitely kind of drowns out the
noise of the pump because the pumps
that's sort of a high pitch irritating
here you just listen
yeah it's just kind of that it's that
tone it's not the volume it's the tone
that's just really annoying so I still
have to play with that but like I said
this is more of a mobile editing rig for
CES this year because we don't edit on
laptops we edit on overpowered machines
it's not to be confused with the
terrible overpowered machines that
Walmart's selling this is definitely not
one of those what another thing I want
to mention though is I know some people
have probably commented about the barbs
not having any zip ties or clamps on
them the barbs that I'm using are from
bits power and they are quad barbs what
I mean by that is there are four barbs
on there there's four rings that bite
into the tube when you put a hose clamp
or you put a zip tie or anything on
there that's not for sealing it if you
need something like that to seal your
tube the tube in the barb or the wrong
size they don't match what those are for
is keeping it from popping off but
because we have four barbs per fitting
on here there is no chance of that
happening and anytime I had to remove a
tube and put it back on I usually
trimmed it back a little bit so that
it's nice and tight again so that the
tubes stretched out slightly it wouldn't
pop off I do have some clamps I tried to
put on there which a little snap clamps
but they weren't the right diameter so
I'm just leaving it like this and so far
so far so good
fingers crossed but the pump though like
I said the pumper has combo it was close
we showed you guys how it initially
contacted the side panel and which by
the way we don't the side panel on just
for the sake of beauty shots but with
the side panel on there's nice
perforation that the light does escape
you can see the GPU block and stuff it
barely fits and by barely I mean the
tubing still sort of pushes against the
side there so the config that I have
right now is about the only way I could
have gotten it to work I had to use
multiple fittings on the CPU side just
so that it can make the turn back to
this part of the case which is where the
tube is going through that mid plate and
then actually going into the pump but it
all worked out it filled pretty well
especially with that kind of a crazy IV
contraption thing I sorta came up with
to feed it and there is absolutely no
air in the system because if I even
slightly crack one of the fittings on
the top of the radiator it starts to
leak fluid which means that there is no
air sitting up there which is
what we wanted so guys I'm gonna go
thanks for watching thanks for putting
up with the terrible delays on this
system but now that we finally got our
case and it's fully built in I can say
that you can comfortably with to top
hetz that to 240 millimeter radiators
with the water-cooled graphics card and
a water-cooled CPU because easily done
this probably with a single 240 and been
plenty but I wanted to see who wants to
take the challenge and accept it and I
think it turned out well alright guys
thanks for watching and as always we'll
see you in the next one Lambeau in my
garage to remind me of when I was living
homeless in the Hollywood Hills the
smell of new electronics hit like if
you're with me I've been tied to talk to
people in five days when people talk to
me at Thanksgiving I just grunted and
pointed point the pie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
