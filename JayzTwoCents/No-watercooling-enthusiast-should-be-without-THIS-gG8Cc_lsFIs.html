from aqua tuning this is a water cooling
company that you guys can get parts and
stuff out of based out of Germany it's
been a long time since they're looking
and it looked at anything from aqua
tuning but they sent a hell of a care
package I know of one item that's in
here the rest is bonus stuff but given
it's the hot summer months for most of
us if for Australia we're there just got
to be backwards down there
we are going to go ahead and talk about
some cooling stuff obviously this is
water cooling but there's one item here
in here I think a lot of you guys are
gonna be really excited about but before
we get into today's topic I'm going to
talk to you guys about Internet Security
and Nord VPN now internet security is
something you should definitely take
serious especially if you're connecting
to public Wi-Fi or you just care about
keeping your information private
especially with all the ongoing stuff
with net neutrality Norden VPN has over
4,000 servers in over 60 countries
including Africa Asia the Middle East
you name it you can connect safely and
securely with Nord VPN now my favorite
part about Nord VPN is they don't keep
any logs which means that you are truly
surfing the internet anonymously and
securely so start securing your internet
by getting 77 percent off a three year
membership by heading to Nord BPM comm /
Jayce two cents or just click the link
in the description below so this is like
Christmas in July oh I almost threw out
something important now baseball this is
the actual part I was most excited about
with this unboxing and we'll take a look
at this in a sec we've got some tube
this is an upcoming video cross-flow
radiator versus a standard flow radiator
so we've also got the Alpha cool ice
block xpx CPU this is both Intel and AMD
ready it is an LED lit water block so
it's it's lit
that meme died whoo so this is not a
nuclear football guys this is actually a
toolkit a toolkit has everything you
could possibly need or want for rigid
tube bending you know I'm gonna look at
the manual anglia gerado mid stiffen
slug the ice didn't weigh the ice tech
Tifa be psyched zine mittens difference
lag curve or didn't so at first this is
a bit overwhelming as a guy who pretty
much just does everything a hundred
percent by eyeball I've never measured
I've never used these protractors and
angled devices and bending guides and
cheese plates but I think I'm getting
I'm look into the manual here and I
think I'm getting it because pretty much
you have every possible type of Bend you
could need to do on this it's very 3d
it's not just how bends flat on the
cheese plate will do it demonstration
obviously this guy right here this is a
stylus stopper with very variable
insertion depth alright so the way that
these mount down and you've got
different radiuses here obviously so
you've got 45 a 90 a 60 and a 30 and
these are very common and then these are
the same measurements here just in a
little bit tighter radius this is just
an angle wheel right here so you can
bend this to get the proper angle you
could figure out a 180 or 90
so the way this mount sounds pretty
simple you've got your long screws
you've got your wing nuts we're not
really wing that sore thumb nuts
basically I guess numb nuts them that's
whatever and then you've got some
washers so if you wanted to mount down
say this angle wheel you pull the long
screw up through the bottom you can put
this guy down through there put a washer
on here and then a nut okay so now this
is mounted down to I don't know if this
is technically called a cheese plate but
that's what we're calling it because
that's what it's called when you mount
stuff to a camera it's a big cheese
plate and there's that now this is your
stylus stopper this is basically you
could be used either it's just a
straight guide or you can use this to
actually mark off like where the tube
should stop that would stop it from
going any farther so you could use that
as your starting point and then your
turn or you can just make it a little
bit too long on either side and cut it
down to length which is typically the
way that I do it
but then this all mounts down literally
the exact same way now you'll notice
each one of these tools actually have
two different kind of grooves in here
ones for the 12 or a 13 mil pipe and
then the bigger one is for the 16
millimeter pipe so this is basically one
tool kit for all the different sizes but
whichever side is facing down is the
current size we'll be working with so
I'm gonna be doing a 12 or 13 mil tube
and I'm gonna make sure that that's
facing down and then once we lock it
down we're good so that's the bend I'm
gonna try and recreate here technically
it's a double 90 but that's where you
have the 90 going to different
directions usually coming out of the top
radiator and going into the CPU block or
something like that those are usually
the hardest bends to do especially by
eyeball but in order to do that we have
this particular tool right here you can
see it's like a ramp so this would
actually mount down like this as you can
see now as the to me comes along it it
will ramp up word but the cool part is
the reason why you're seeing these kind
of flop all around is because these are
also adjustable angle so let's say you
didn't want to go straight up but you
wanted to go up and to the side you
could do that and you can congest or
control your angle by this angle meter
it's all it's got all the tick marks for
all the different angles right there so
this is truly a 3d piece of equipment
when it comes to being able to do all
your measurements what's cool though is
the the measurements of the gaps in this
cheese plate are perfect like this
cannot once it's tightened down this
won't be able to rotate there's no place
I'd to side so that way you're not
screwing up your angles a couple of
degrees here and there because you know
there was play in the jig got Mohicans
here I thought I did might be under the
seat okay so the heat guns are not in
the car yes we're going to Lowe's again
all right I guess we can go finish the
video all right now that we got our heat
gun it's actually pretty good one I got
this from Lowe's for 39 bucks it's got
multiple settings and multiple
temperatures like it's a temperature
dial so so obviously you need to take
your mandrel cord the one that's
designed for the right size tubing
you're using this one is the 13 mil you
might have to damp this dampen it it is
pretty tight fit I don't normally use
oil or anything like that to get it to
slide in there but I'm gonna do this
Bend right here first now you're not
gonna hold the heat gun like you're not
gonna try and bend it like this right
because they don't be melting all these
plastics you're gonna heat it on the
table and then you're going to make you
know you're gonna you're gonna push it
down on there so let me go ahead and see
if I can't get this in there a little
bit farther
the tighter the mandrel fits the less
kink you're gonna get in the tubing so
that's why it's so the ones that just
slide in there really really easily this
is going a really weird conversation but
the ones that slide in there really
really easily tend to you know give you
a little bit less than desirable kink in
YouTube yeah and maybe worn out so when
you're heating it up obviously I've done
a tutorial on this before I'll try and
link it if not just look up how to bend
hard line tubing you'll find lots of
tutorials you're just gonna go back and
forth because you don't want to heat up
one particular spot you want to heat up
a range that way it can make a nice
smooth radius we're gonna wait till
starts become a little bit my malleable
mailable mount and my malleable whatever
the word is guys and I'm trying to say I
hope see it's starting to bend a little
bit on me they're nice and hot but not
too hot we don't want to stretch we're
just going to apply it to our jig
like so and we're just gonna hold it for
a little bit so it can cool off make
sure it's in there firmly you have some
time to kind of play with it too before
it gets completely frozen in its
position you want to remove it too soon
if you do then it will relax and start
to straighten back out we don't want
that so just take your time let it cool
off smells like success
there's our 90 so now we're gonna need
to cut this tubing down because let's
say this was our stopper point right
here we know we want to go to 11 right
so we can kind of guesstimate like okay
we can cut it and say right about here
you want to leave a little bit more
length than you think you need because
obviously if you cut it too short well
that's not gonna do you any good so I'm
going to go ahead and rig up our jig
once again or our advice so that we can
use the included saw so that just
threads down almost like I just like a
regular seat clamp almost so you would
make your marks and they're rubber lined
which is nice so they're not gonna
scratch up your tubing take our included
saw this is gonna make sure we get a
nice straight cut and you're all the way
through just like that this is your D
Brewer tool so you could take this and
turn it on the outside so you can see
that got rid of any edges on the outside
and this does the same thing for the
inside and then it made still a little
bit rough but that's the nature of PT G
because it's so soft but yeah there's
that so this is the mandrel I've been
using all the way up to this point but
you can see it's a hollow cord so the
difference is when you thread this
through and then it makes that Bend and
yeah you can actually cord it or push it
through a bend like people not realize
you can do that this can actually squish
and because it can squish would give you
a little bit of a bulge on the tube but
the solid mandrel won't do that the only
problem is solved mandrel those like I
said getting it actually threaded in
there is kind of a pain in the ass we
have to get you know down to here so one
thing I like to do though if the mandrel
won't you know slide in the tube very
easily because this one definitely
doesn't want to go past that point you
can
use a little bit of soap just a tiny
little bit of soap it's easy to clean
off afterward because even if you rinse
YouTube what you should do anyway
because you know hygiene is very
important also it gets rid of any of the
possible little burrs in there from you
cutting it this should then just slide
in there now see a little bit soap and
then you can just rinse this in the sink
under let some water run through it
it'll get rid of all the soap and now as
you can see we've got our mandrel all
the way down past where we need it so
just like before we want to heat up a
range of the tubing it's goodness even
if it starts to sag and wobble and look
a little bit crooked our jig is gonna
keep everything nice and straight with
how we want it now this is the kind of
thing that for a guy like me who's done
every build you've ever see me do up to
this point completely by eyeball or I'll
use the edge of a table on the corner to
get my 9 D stuff like that this would
probably take me longer until I got used
to using it because you have to measure
obviously with this one you have to
measure it shows you in the manual like
kind of like the type of measurements
you'd want to take this will give us
completely perfect results as long as we
measure properly
not bad at all I kind of wish this would
give me a tighter radius because I can
actually get a pretty tight Bend by hand
but I mean this is still a pretty good
radius angle well well would you look at
that not bad at all dope kinking no
crimping and theoretically if we've
measured properly then this would have
lined up perfectly with where our
fittings would be so it's just a quick
example of how you could use a toolkit
like this to get perfect bends the first
time as long as you measure twice Bend
once let's talk about this kit and kind
of who it's for it's not entirely cheap
I mean this is this is a kit designed
for people who are doing this all the
time and I'm still not a hundred percent
sure if I'm gonna use it all the time
there might be some very specific vens I
might try it out on I'm just so used to
my particular way of eyeballing things
there are people out there that might
just want to eyeball it like I do and
there are people out there who
definitely don't feel comfortable
eyeballing at which a kit like this
would make sense for but again it's not
cheap it definitely has a price tag
associated with it
but this is a you buy it once and then
you can use it obviously over and over
and over your build friends builds or if
you're running a business where you're
doing hard line tubing obviously this
makes sense let's say you're doing five
builds for like a custom client or so
our custom builds for a client and you
know you're building five identical pcs
well once you get it all jigged up once
you can do five bends back to back to
back and then they're all and then
they're all good to go without having to
measure over and I can't even tell you
how many times I've done the same Bend
five times in a row because I'm just a
few millimeters off and I like it to be
as straight and square as possible so
you guys tell me what you think down
below of alpha coolest ice coffer
toolkit I think I'm pronouncing it right
I'm probably not but whatever guys tell
me what you think down below I'm curious
if you would buy a kit like this for a
one-time build or if you wouldn't why
put it down below thanks for watching
guys and as always we'll see you in the
next one baby
wait it's like a banjo
okay now you focus fill anyone laughs
you're doing laughing get to the choppa
now do we know one of the things I used
to do around here is I did another thing
all the time and then people used to be
like yeah I do the honors when he did
the live-streaming there with the last
