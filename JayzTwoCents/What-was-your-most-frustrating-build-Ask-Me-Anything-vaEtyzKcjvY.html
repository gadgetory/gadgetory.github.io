time since I've done one of these Q&amp;amp;A
videos and normally I'll go in and and
pre select the questions and I decided
today I'm gonna let Phil pre-selected
questions I have no idea what's coming
my way
so yeah sure you get DIY anything but
why do this when you could have this
available in both 120 and 140 millimeter
sizes the new Prisma fans from fractal
design features six individually
addressable hub mounted RGB LEDs that
are compatible with most motherboard

Franz's je asks pineapple on pizza
question mark duh now says I like myself
a good Hawaiian pizza
I like Hawaiian barbecue pizza I also
like people making up their own mind for
what they like and not giving a
what other people think
Nermin patel 0 0 3 4 asks describe your
YouTube journey in one word abrasive
[Laughter]
that's the first word that came in
behind nakri who or what were your
influence to do YouTube videos and when
did you actually start talking to a
camera I wanted to make movies as a kid
and I've said this a million times I
wanted to be a director of photography I
don't want to be a director director
photography I wanted to work with the
camera man oh the camera ops I wanted to
work with all that so I would take black
paper mache or construction paper and
poke different size holes in it and tape
it up it to my window to make space and
then I had models that I built like
Millennium Falcon and x-wings and stuff
and I had them on streams and I made
battle scenes and I even had green pipe
cleaners that we had that we'd throw to
make the lasers and all that sort of
stuff so my friends and I like we would
make these stupid little videos which I
wish I still had but I don't
unfortunately so talking in front of the
camera was the camera never scared me in
terms of influence to making videos I
never really had a tech influence I
didn't even know people made
you're living doing this on YouTube
until I was in my 30s already and it was
just one of those things where I think
my biggest influence in that this could
work was was Linus and what I mean by
that is just like I said at the roast
which I meant 100% is if a guy like him
with a voice like him and a face like
his could make a living doing this so
can I do you consider yourself a car guy
first or a PC guy first
I consider myself and whatever floats my
boat guy first I share an equal passion
for both but I probably have a bigger
passion for cars at the moment only
because it's not work that's why the car
channel died a slow agonizing death I
let it on purpose because it was
becoming work it was becoming like I
gotta upload something to this channel
and I didn't like that feeling so I just
said screw it
so Jays two cents is not about computers
Jays two cents was about whatever I
wanted it to be about and if you go and
you watch the early videos on this
channel the first six months was really
eclectic I ranted about Apple I ranted
about Google I ranted about Xbox I went
I'm more than a one-trick pony I don't
only care about computers I care about
all things technology and so the genre
or the audience really tried to keep me
in this genre box which I refused to
stay in but yeah I would consider myself
equal on both but I currently enjoy cars
more only because I get to spend a lot
less time with it there's that like
overused phrase that's just like do what
you love and like you'll never work a
day in your life and it's like it still
is well like it's doing well I love
what I do but man this yeah it's so work
like I think that's an important
distinction is that like it's still work
but you like working as opposed to
hating working that just that sucks
mmm what type of genre of movies do you
prefer when you're relaxing away from
computer in cars this might surprise a
lot of people but I don't watch a lot of
movies I don't really watch any sort of
mainstream TV I spend a lot of my time
watching documentaries online
the world war one world war two vietnam
a lot of like DIY type stuff I really
like watching how-to videos how to build
stuff I mean this I had to learn how to
do this on my own as I went I enjoyed
that sort of stuff I don't feel like TV
rots your brain like some people do it's
just my brain and TV are not on the same
wavelength I guess and so I just sort of
don't watch anything like obviously I've
enjoyed like the MCU I watched all of
Game of Thrones I watched all the sons
of anarchy
all of Breaking Bad these these real
heavies heavily stitched pop culture
things sometimes I get sucked in sucked
into them but fortunately those are
usually one at a time and years apart
I've also been watching a lot of goon
squad and I have an urge not to by erect
super guard I don't want to but I wanna
what was your most frustrating build
you've done post Malone I think everyone
knows that answer there this that was
the only build that I had so many
different people involved in it and
everyone kind of like the next piece
couldn't happen until the previous piece
was done it all started with the custom
case that I loved seeing Larry computers
but they quoted me four to six weeks it
took them three months actually took
more than three months but that's
besides the point by the time the system
was pretty much done and we could show
it to him he was on a world tour and he
was gone for months so so many things
lined up to where the build itself
probably only took a week and a half of
actual build time but it it took so much
more than that between all the pieces to
line up to where we could present it to
him and then I guess it's also just
frustrating because I didn't feel like a
real appreciation towards that build
like Terry Crews was so beside himself
to receive the the PC we built for him
it felt like so many strings were pulled
and so many people came together to
build something like that that you can
not recreate you cannot build this
anywhere else because of the custom work
that was done for the grill and the
guitar head and all that sort of stuff I
felt like it was just kind of like oh
yeah man that's cool bro yeah and so
that's what also made it frustrating was
I took a huge beating on the timeline
and then I took I feel like an
appreciation beating when the project
was over what made you want to become a
tech guy or how did you become a tech
guy I never wanted to become a tech guy
like why does why does the mechanic
become
mechanic or the pilot become the pilot
it's I don't think it's cuz they went
you know that guy looks like he's having
fun we'll go do that I think it's just
the way your brain is wired and you just
you just wake up one day and you go you
know that's just the things I like it's
it's you and people can't explain their
tastes they just know that that's the
way they are and that's what kind of
makes everyone unique which is kind of
neat I've been sitting on computers as
far back as I can remember I've got
pictures of my dad holding me when I was
a baby while he's on the computer so
it's just always been that way in terms
of cars though no one in my family
pretty much had that sort of passion
just me do you digress daily can I just
hate when I digress when I want to go to
the bathroom again so the reason why I
digress and this is the short condensed
version of so this before a million
times I worked for a company that we did
software development every single day we
had what's called a scrum meeting we had
this one gentleman that was in a power
struggle with a part owner of the
company a new guy that came in and then
this particular gentleman and I'll leave
his name out unfortunately he's passed
away so it's it's kind of an homage to
him he would fill a bust every scrum and
at the end of his little filibuster he
would go but I digress Paul you may have
the floor and so it just became like a
thing where every time I heard it every
day every day every day every day every
day to where it just got stuck in my
head and now every time I say it it's
kind of like a little like good to him I
think I just had a stroke it's like how
do you dab is it like this what's the
point of extreme overclocking when
you're not even gonna use it as your
workstation or gaming machine with the
point of making a comment when no one
really cares what you think no it goes
back to the thing we talked about
earlier with the passion of doing
something why do people race cars why
people with race airplanes boats it's
just a it's just a desire of taking
something beyond its limits and seeing
how far you can go with it before
there's any sort of a failure and then
you start naturally racing at it I mean
overclocking when it comes to like the
ln2 and the XOC guys its cpu drag racing
it's what it is and it's no different
than any other sport
there's no point why I take this stupid
orange ball against
those five guys and try and put it in
that hole you could say anything to
waste the time if you don't agree with
it but that good kind of circles back to
my thing I said earlier to is is the
pineapple on pizza thing how about you
just let people enjoy what they enjoy
and if you don't like it you just kind
of keep your mouth shut about it is
ripped Gian over I'd like to see more
ln2 videos time and work and life got in
the way we've had we've had parts to
compete with that for a long time
and and kudos to Steve who who took that
that series and then just ran with it I
mean he did a really good job it's
bringing in the XOC community getting
getting him with kingpin getting in with
beer did I forgot his name's real name
oh man I feel bad but anyway it's like
he did a really good job of bringing in
a lot of awareness to a group that I
feel like they don't get nearly as much
exposure or awareness as they deserve we
are gonna be doing more with Steve next
month I don't want to give away any
details we will be working actually I
believe together on something against
someone yeah without giving out too much
more information but it's it should be
interesting you should be exciting and
it will be live-streamed so stay tuned
for that what is the next car that you
want I practical wise I don't know that
I have a next car that I want I've got
my my RAM rebel and I have my 370z which
of my track car blasts drive and then I
have my stupid midlife crisis zl1 one
ally that I ripped the engine apart at
five thousand miles and increase the
output by over by almost 200 horsepower
it's kind of hard to say what I would
want next I think I think a demon or a
red-eye it would be fun my Camaro
doesn't have that same presence even as
a red-eye even though it's it's just as
fast if not faster in a straight line
than a red-eye and it could still pull
you know well over one and a half G's in
a turn it's uh it's just something about
the presence of a red-eyed I think would
be fun
in terms of impractical car I think a
Ferrari 12 would be kind of fun I'm not
an I'm not an exotic sports car kind of
guy I'll never own a Lamborghini how
I'll never own a Ferrari 812 either but
I think that's a car that would be fun
because again rear-wheel drive front
engine which if you can't tell it's kind
of a theme of mine so it's just
something about having all that
horsepower
sent to the rear wheels in trying to
keep it all in check as it's what I
think is fun if you were to replace your
Camaro what car would it be in life
uh hell why not a Tesla Roadster the new
one the new one if you like to work you
can get plenty of it like your internal
organs range is whatever you want yeah
right I mean and and the fact that it
makes no noise when it's doing it well
that's crazy but I mean if we're just
going by pure performance I mean you
can't deny the car right you just can't
what's the weirdest thing you've done
with computer hardware I heard you guys
like dark things I don't think anything
we've done yet really compares to some
things I want to do if you had a dollar
for every time someone asks you for free
PC parts would you be able to retire
today I mean realistically no but it is
a little annoying that we get those
messages daily on every single place
you've it all right a little bit more
serious from coalition gaming how do you
deal with situations of slow channel
growth and producing high effort content
that gets lackluster viewing performance
results so I've learned over the years I
guess I've been doing this now seven
years or going on almost seven years
there are multiple times a year where
the slowdowns
are consistent usually is right around
the start of summer Christmas time is
another slow down right before Christmas
usually before Thanksgiving so what I've
learned is that when I know the slow
times are coming like we're in one right
now we are we are
we're down like twenty or thirty percent
on subscriber growth converses the last
period but I mean what gets me through
it like I already said it's just the
fact that I have seen year on year on
year the slow time is always followed by
a rise right after that what is the
worst regret you have in life so my
biggest regret is that I've never
graduated anything I graduated late from
high school which was gonna surprise a
lot of people because I got senioritis
my sophomore year so I got very far
behind by the time senior rolled around
so I graduated in summer school which
means I never got to wear a cap and gown
I never got to walk and hear my name
called and people cheer or whatever so
my graduation for high school consisted
of congratulations you passed summer
school go to the window on your way out
and get your diploma and that was it
and then I'm a college dropout so I've
never like officially graduated
something with any sort of ceremony or
anything like that so I think that's
probably my biggest regret it's just at
the time I told people like my parents
were like you're gonna regret it you're
gonna regret it you need to want to
graduate on time like whatever I don't
care I don't care and I didn't care for
years and I but I think now as I'm older
and I've got kids and I see their
excitement when they had their little
promotion ceremonies and stuff moving to
the next grade I kind of look at that
and I go you know they didn't do that
promotion crap when I was a kid and then
I see I see their excitement for that
and I think well it would have been nice
maybe to wear a cap and gown at least
once so that's probably my biggest
regret little video game would you like
to see remade using new technologies
like quake 2 or TX how about Duke Nukem
that way you can just see you have the
old game but with the new lighting and
oh yeah the reason why I want to see you
even more piss off the easily pissed off
let's do it I was thinking I was
thinking Stars episode racer but that
might just be X mean vs. TIE fighter boy
yeah what has been your favorite part of
building the new sets doing it myself
honestly it's going a lot slower this
would have been done already if I'd
Contractors come in but the amount of
money that I've saved on just having
contractors build the framework have
allowed me to buy the furniture and the
tools and the tool boxes and stuff we
need for the new shop I'm really looking
forward to building the new computer
build space and that's gonna be a fun
series like I mean I'm sure most people
would dream of having a space dedicated
to just building computers and you're
not even doing it as like a business to
sell the computers to people because
that's about volume get it in get it out
the more computers you move the more
money you
make this is just about sharing that
build passion and I can't wait to start
the build set which should hopefully
start next week
all right last question is to jay-z or
RB 2602 jay-z of course I'll be 26 is
legendary but so is the to jay-z and if
you truly want to go with power and
reliability the two jay-z or the RB 26
any day and I say that as someone who
knows people who own both that are
modified Oh chocolate or vanilla
