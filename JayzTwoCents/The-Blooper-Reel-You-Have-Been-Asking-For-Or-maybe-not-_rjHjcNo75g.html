videos you just turn on the camera and

is where Thompson now this isn't just
about learning now it's not just aid not
just learning F it up now the cool thing
about the K typically in the past so if

up of three different LED it's a white
LED no oh okay yeah this we got this we

the unique things about winning unioning
okay so I'm bail DS website do it one
more time by the cod now Nvidia and to
the mammaries mammaries Vince was like
cracking sound could be a thermal place
your thermal brace breaking Phil's nut
you would think that within those seven
years I would learn how to take the
thoughts and formulate words and move my
tongue in my mouth and have it come out

 you can click the link in the
description below
ow what crack was I smoking now speaking
is it the only thing I have problems
with around here I tend to get
distracted quickly and easily making it
frustrating sometimes to get videos made
and sticking to the topic at hand I am
curious
alright I'm serious we can have fun but
you need to calm down this part come off
separate from this part Jay focus Jay
the tire is very high pitch so don't we
the one thing though is we left off to
the it's not even and you sent from fret
down silence I forgot something

South Carolina

just something about the way new
electronics smell I don't care
computers are cool they bring things in
your home to death wait to
wait where's at five seven five right
watch my videos they help me pay for the
things that I do in here so what was the
point of this video I'm gonna be honest
what's the point of any video we make we
like to have fun around here we just
thought it would be fun to show you guys
some of the fun that we've had not to
mention some of you have requested it so
yeah that's why we did it though
supposed to say something else you see
the funny thing is I've been making
videos now for going on seven years and
you would think in that what's the point
of anything we do around here honestly
we're just a couple of guys thinking is
also not something I'm very good good
