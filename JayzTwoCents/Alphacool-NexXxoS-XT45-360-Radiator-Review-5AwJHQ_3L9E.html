cool and aqua tuning whether you live in
the US Canada or Europe be sure to check
them out at aqua tuning us all your
water cooling and modding needs hey guys
you're watching Jays two cents and I've
already brought you a review of the full
Copper Nexus water block from alpha cool
and today we're going to take a look at
the Nexus XT 45 full copper radiator a
lot of radiators on the market are made
of a mixture of brass and copper and
some of them even have aluminum indent
one of the things that sets alpha cool
apart is the fact that this is a full
copper radiator tubes the tanks and the
fins on this radiator are copper copper
isn't much better heat conductor than
breast so when you can get copper in
here it's a much better conductor of
heat and it's going to move all of the
unwanted heat away from your CPU this
model I'm holding here is the Nexus X T
45 and the reason why it's called the X
T 45 it's because it is 45 millimeters
thick this is a pretty thick and pretty
heavy radiator because of its full
copper construction on the end tanks
here you can see that you have multiple
options here for mounting of Barb's
you've got two on the front two on the
bottom and two on the top so wear guard
las' is where you put this in your case
whether it's front mounted bottom
mounted top mounted or side mounted on
something like a 900 d or maybe a TJ o 7
from silverstone you're going to have
all sorts of mounting options now when
it comes to hardware they do include
full copper mounting screws for your
fans it's pretty unique the fact that
they are full copper here they also do
include four full copper plugs here for
the four holes that you end up not using
when it comes to the mounting options on
this radiator now the fin design I'm not
sure what the FBI is on this but it will
just fins per inch however you can see
right through the radiator so you know
that airflow is going to really flow
nicely through this radiator so they're
optimized for medium and low speed fans
now the mounting screws on here our
standard spacing for 120 millimeter fan
obviously this is the triple 120 or the
360 version of this radiator but what I
do like is that down underneath the
screw holes here even though these holes
line up with some of the runs or the
tubes that are in this radiator on
cheaper radiators if you screw in too
far the screw goes right into that
channel it puts a hole in your tube in
your radiator zone
however the alpha cooled radiator here
does have a plate that goes all the way
around the mounting screws that keep you
from screwing too far into your radiator
tube so that's a really nice addition
for those that are maybe not quite as
aware of how far their screws are going
down into their radiator and that's
going to save you from destroying a very
nice radiator such as this other than
that there's really nothing in the box
other than some bubble pops and so if
you like the copper things it's a hours
and hours of enjoyment and fun
so let's go ahead and get this thing
inside my machine so how well it cools
my 3770k and my GTX 680 this is my first
full copper radiator and I'm really
excited to see how it performs compared
to the brass radiators that I currently
have installed so let's get over here
and let's tear this thing apart
you
okay so let's go ahead and talk about
the system it's cooling it is an Intel
3770k overclocked to 4.7 gigahertz at
one point to six volts now we are
talking about core temperatures here so
the brass and copper radiator with three
120 fans had a twenty eight Celsius idle
average and a sixty eight Celsius max
average on the cores however on the full
copper radiator core temperature idle
was 27 degrees Celsius and max on the
cores was sixty-two degrees Celsius
that's a six degrees Celsius average
drop by simply switching to a full
copper radiator and when it comes to my
gtx 680 overclocked to 1300 six
megahertz the story is no different
we had a 32 degrees Celsius idle average
and a forty eight degrees Celsius max
average however with the full copper
radiator the changes were even more
apparent with a twenty eight degrees
Celsius idle and a forty-one degrees
Celsius maximum average on the GPU now
before anybody says but J you have a
thicker copper radiator versus a thinner
brass radiator that's just not fair
let's go ahead and keep in mind that the
full copper radiator only has ten fins
per inch versus the brass copper
radiators twenty fins per inch so as
twice as many cooling fins on the brass
so there you have it guys that's been
J's two cents regarding the nexus xt
forty five full copper radiator from
alpha cool I've been using the thing for
about five days now and it truly is
amazing what a difference a full copper
radiator can make the full copper design
and the amount of thermal conductivity
that this radiator has to allow me to
bump up my overclock just a little bit
more making my thermal threshold just
that much higher this is definitely a
radiator to consider if you're building
a full custom loop make sure to check it
out Alvah cool xt 45 the nexus full
copper radiator and once again we have
to give a very big thank you to aqua
tuning for setting me up with this
radiator allowing me to do this review
and i will see you guys in my next video
but don't forget subscribe like favorite
follow do all that fun stuff and we will
see you guys next time when we see</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
