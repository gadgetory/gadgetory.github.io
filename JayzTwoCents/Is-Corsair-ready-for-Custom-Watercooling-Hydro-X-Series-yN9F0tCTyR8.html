water cooling player in town with their
nine blade designed the ski Ronde RGB
fans for metallic gear offer a balance
of performance and aesthetics available
in both 120 and 140 millimeter sizes the
skier on fans are sure to fit any size
builds hub mounted LEDs provide a wide
spread of lighting while the daisy chain
above wiring harness and cherry tidy
wiring job every time to learn more
about the skier on RGB and D RGB fans
for metallic gear click the link in the
description below alright so we have got
a huge care package from the folks over
at Corsair they've sent over all of
their new hydro ex stuff this is
probably something you guys have already
seen this is something I have been
waiting for for a long time if we first
saw at Computex like way more than a
year ago actually farther away now two
years ago to copy Texas ago we first saw
they were showing off some of their
water cooling stuff that they were in
collaboration with I think aqua computer
at the time and orhi killer so I don't
quote me on that but they were working
with another brand and that all kind of
just disappeared and then some of the
folks at ek found their way over at
Corsair and now we've got hydro X so
being the water cooling I want say
aficionado I'm gonna say fan boy that I
am I tell you right now we are gonna be
taking a look at a whole plethora of new
stuff from Corsair specifically with our
high directs line now unfortunately I'm
still under embargo in terms of being
able to talk about temperature
performance or any of that stuff but we
can take a look at the parts up close
holy cow
all right so obviously okay so we got
some fluid here we've got some fans
which are no surprises or not these are
not water-cooled fans but they're gonna
hopefully be static pressure optimized
there are maglev 120 fans see the think
we got some radiators okay we got a lot
stuff to go through so let me let me
sort of get this presentable Corsair has
spent a lot of time helping code develop
a lot of this stuff but they had some
partners in crime in all of this so for
instance the fluids are made in
collaboration with Mayhem's we've got
the fittings which are made in
collaboration with bits power we'll be
taking a little closer look at these
I'll open up one or so we've got
compressions we've got soft tubing we've
got the commander Pro which is designed
for controlling the RGB and the speed of
the fans you can add it to any case a
lot of this comes concluded already with
a lot of the higher-end Corsair cases
fan hub right there for the RGB stuff
we're gonna start with radiator this is
made in collaboration with hardware labs
so they hardware labs is definitely
known for some high-end radiators and
this is one of the slim rads I do come
in like a small medium large in terms of
thickness as you can see out there we've
got a nice chrome Corsair sticker on
there this looks to be about a medium
thin density so it's gonna be a decent
amount of trade-off between noise
airflow and cooling obviously we'll talk
more about how these perform when we're
able to do performance testing because
like I said earlier today embargo all
right so we've got a few fittings going
on here we've got some compression
fittings this appears to be what says 10
by 13 is it's gonna be a rigid fitting
or this gonna be like a soft tube
fitting ironically they didn't send me
any soft tubing but that's okay so you
can see we've got a compression here
we've got a barb this goes over the tube
collar and then it clamps it down on to
the actual fitting itself we've got some
elbows we got some what they call XF
compressions which are these guys right
here let's take a look at the hard line
so this is
definitely very bits power you looking I
can definitely tell they've developed
this in collaboration with them but this
is a a larger diameter than some of the
12 millimeter stuff that you would get
from them but if I'm not mistaken
they're going to be available in
obviously varying sizes of tubing they
also come in four different colors at
the time of filming they're gonna come
in nickel they're gonna come in black
they're kind of kind of blue and come in
gold this is an adapter fitting here so
as you can see though it's got a rotary
fitting on here so this rotates here is
a rigid compression this appears to be a
14 millimeter interesting so I'm
assuming that's gonna be a 14 millimeter
tube right there
it's a low-rise compression so sometimes
they're they're very tall but this one
here is a low-rise you got double o-ring
so have an o-ring inside the fitting of
an o-ring that goes around the outside
of the tube and then as you screw down
this compression collar it will squish
out that o-ring and then it will make a
seal between the flat surface of the
fitting and the actual tube itself so
we've got some 90 degree elbows 45 volts
take a look at the 45 a nice very very
tight rotary very indicative of being
built in collaboration with bits power
because bits power definitely has very
tight tolerances and all of their
internal or rings now in terms of the
fluid we've got two liters of clear
right here they're super chilled series
once again Hydra X series XL 5
performance coolant it says clear it's a
thousand milliliters premix so it's got
all your inhibitors your corrosion
resistant and all additives in there so
you it's gonna be good with nickel
copper and it says on the nickel copper
and brass and then this is just a flow
valve so that you can use it for a drain
plug a fill plug your cameraman fill you
can turn them on and off by using the
style right here so we we made the turn
and there's no room to you turn so let's
take a look at the tubing right here
this is a Corsair tubing hard-line is a
10 by 14 so that means we have a four
millimeter sidewall which is that's kind
of a small complaint of mine to be
honest so by this being a 10 by 14 means
that we do have a little bit thicker
wall which is kind of nice
but at the same time it just means that
it's not gonna work
your fittings it's not going to work
with your obviously your 16 mil so it's
just another size to have to really
worry about to make sure so that you're
not putting the wrong size fittings on
there so I'm gonna assume this is the
blocks and the pump and all that sort of
stuff inside of this Pelican case you
ready that's exactly what it is all
right so we got the xd5 which is an RGB
d5 style reservoir here we've got what
looks to be the XC 7 RGB block we got
more than one block in here this is a
well a CPU water block as you might
imagine we've got the XC 9 and then we
have got the o2 blocks here the x g7 RGB
and the XG 7 RGB so this says 2080
founders edition this one says 20 atti
okay so the two different blocks
obviously the 20 80 and 20 ATT I do have
a slightly different PCV that's okay
it's going to open one up and take a
look it's been a while since I've done
any sort of an unboxing I feel really
rusty at it as if I were ever good at it
to begin with right
all right so here is the block right
there it's actually pretty weighty oh
that's nice I like that the thermal pads
are already pretty applied that's nice I
like that right there so with it comes a
backplate so as you can see it's brushed
it's got the hydro X logo on there but
it's very low profile and by low profile
I mean the X isn't like a different
color it's not yellow thank God when the
light hits it just right you've got that
nice nice look to it the rest of the
block is kind of the same way you've got
a mono block here so it's a full cover
block it's touching the power delivery
the RAM the seep or the GPU core
obviously and then I'm not sure what's
up front right here I don't think it's
more chip so it's probably more power
delivery but it's got this this isn't
plastic this is metal this is metal
right here which has got a sort of a
heatsink design kind of built into it so
you got wiring underneath this cover
which is kind of nice like the
skunkworks has a clear block and so this
is kind of visible which sort of sucks
but what I mean so you can see here that
it's terminated with their proprietary
plug so you can't plug this in directly
to your motherboard and control it
through any of that you have to use IQ
and their commander Pro or their RGB
node or some sort of RGB controller like
you see right here on the box from
Corsair to be able to control it because
of that proprietary plug so that's one
thing you need to keep in mind it has
not come included with the block so
that's gonna be an added cost that you
need to keep in mind but you can see
right here you've got these screws and
you've got a I know I don't want to take
it out right now because for the
performance testing I don't want to mess
with any of this I want to do the
performance testing and then do the
disassembly the jet plate is removable
I guess that is gonna help with
manufacturing because they can just make
mass manufacture those and then plug
them into the different blocks rather
than having to mill the whole block out
of a single piece of brass so I think
it's an interesting unique design I'm
kind of curious as to how well that
works out you have a flow indicator
built into the block as well so as the
block is turning if it's in a vertical
orientation you'll be able to see it
turning so you can make sure you've
always got water flow and if you're
curious as to how much how fast the
fluid is moving that will tell you this
is very reminiscent of like their
Dominator series ram tops if you
remember those
the Dominator Platinum's it looks very
very similar to that so if you had
Dominator Platinum's in your system this
would sort of match so there's the block
which I I like this because one of the
things that's difficult in just like
computer cases there's only so many ways
to build a rectangle there's also only
so many ways to build a water block so
this is nice to see and it's just
different let's take a look at this guy
now this is their water pump reservoir
combo this is actually like an injection
molded plastic which is different than
the typical acrylic route a lot of
people go and I'm really curious to see
how the long-term testing on this goes
because the problem I've always had is
once the acrylic gets wet and if you
drain the system and then you let the
acrylic sit out you start to form these
very tiny kind of a Mike micro cracks in
them and it just has something to do
with the dehydration at that point like
I mean it's not porous by any means but
somehow some way when the acrylic gets
wet and then it dries out it tends to
get those little tiny cracks and
sometimes those tiny cracks can turn
into much larger cracks so by them going
with this different type of plastic I'm
wondering if that's directly because of
that effect that has taken place with
the acrylic so there it is right there
it's very lightweight that's one of the
things I'll say right off the bat it's
got plastic on here protecting it it's
because its injection molded plastic and
it's not acrylic it's a lot thinner and
it's a lot lighter watch pill stick your
hand out and hold that that's yeah yeah
like yeah definitely but it is using a
d5 pump which you can see is mounted
directly to it so it is a combo
we've got multiple fitting locations
here going around we've also got two on
the top and it does of course have RGB
lighting and they already have a
pushdown tube on the inside so that if
you are returning to the reservoir from
the top it'll push the fluid down into
the fluid level so you don't have a
waterfall effect which you could
introduce air you also have this kind of
a spiderweb looking thing inside which
is going to be an anti venturi but I
guess a lot of the light weight from
this too comes from the fact that this
is also a plastic mount for the pump
whereas typically a lot of brands we use
acetal or palm material or whatever
which is a very dense plastic here's one
of the mounts that just go through here
go over the pump and then you screw it
right directly to those those rubber
standoffs which are anti-vibration pads
you even have a temperature sensor plug
that comes with the reservoir so you
could put this in the back and monitor
your actual temperature of your fluid
which is something that doesn't come
with any other reservoir on the market
short of aqua computer and I think
that's because you can buy a kit that
includes it not directly with the
reservoir so and the last thing to look
at here are the CPU blocks which
interestingly enough is two different
part numbers based on the socket that
you're using so we've got eleven fifty
six or eleven fifty X here or AMD AM for
compatible or Intel LGA 2066 which
technically is also twenty eleven that's
funny that's not listed there and AMD
tr4 but what they want to talk about
real quick since we are talking about
the size of the blocks is I forgot to
mention what the GPU block that because
they're using this Universal core that
can be swapped out for the cooling plate
it is not entirely full coverage on the
T u whatever the 2080 T is I don't think
that's gonna necessarily be an issue but
again one of those things that we're
going to talk about in temperature
testing because they have to have room
for the screws it takes up some of that
cooling area so that is one thing we'll
definitely want to compare as we take
off a twenty eighty or twenty eighty TI
and and mount it is to kind of measure
and see what the difference in size is
look at the interesting application of
that thermal paste it's like a honeycomb
okay I definitely don't wanna mess any
of that up because for testing I want to
see how well that performs but as you
can see you've got your Intel bracket
you've got your AMD bracket got your
hold downs your rubber standoff so you
don't bridge on the back here
motherboard and then of course all of
your mounting hardware so it's going to
compare the size of this guy to the
other one point is that larger really
huh but which you can see right here
though is that we do have the mounting
already applied like to the bracket
right there and then if you need to use
TR for it comes with a completely
separate mount right there for that so
there you go guys there is the unboxing
and first look obviously all of these
parts are RGB I can tell you I've had
lots of conversations with them I Oh
get worried anytime a new brand goes
work and but I know of course there's
not a new brand but they are new to
open-loop water cooling typically they
were using a Sutekh derivative a iOS and
stuff which is very simple because it's
sealed and worried about the user
end-user that we're about testing mixing
because here's the thing you might just
buy the block and then you're putting in
other parts and other coolants and
they've got to ensure compatibility as
best that they can control obviously if
you use all of the corsair eco system
their fluids their tubing their fittings
their blocks you're gonna have the best
compatibility and the best long life of
the fluid but what they did was tons of
testing to make sure that there wasn't
gonna be any sort of compatibility
issues with other products on the market
so they had a huge laboratory set up
with tons and tons of testing going on
temperature controlled environments
extremely cold extremely hot mixed
metals and my mixed metals I mean brass
copper nickel not aluminum I don't know
if they're coming out with a new
aluminum series stuff but that's a topic
for another day so I can tell you that
I'm expecting positive things out of
this because they did the right thing at
CES by delaying the launch so that they
could make sure that everything was as
ready as it could possibly be so we'll
be testing this out in June perfect
month for all this that's gonna be nice
and warm but yeah I just want to open
this all up and make a huge mess in my
new set that I now have to clean up so
that you guys could kind of get a first
look at this because as the summer
months roll around not only do more
people build computers and upgrade they
also build water-cooled systems to keep
things as cool and as overclocked as
possible
alright guys tell me what you think
about Corsairs hydro X line of water
cooling parts down in the comments below
and as always we'll see you in the next
one out of here and then
and then ah and then dominic toretto
drive no one likes the tuna here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
