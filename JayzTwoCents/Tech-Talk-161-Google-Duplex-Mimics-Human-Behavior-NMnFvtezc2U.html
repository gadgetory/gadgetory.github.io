YouTube says have bad quality I say you
have quality YouTube what is YouTube no
man seriously oh man we got a lot to
talk about
follow up based on the video processing
test we ran last week got an update on
that we're going to talk about Google
i/o and Google duplex we're gonna talk
about Nvidia GP and you had another
thing Oh recent bug like latest bugs
known with the latest Windows build yes
with the with the April update a Windows
Update and the cocaine breathalyzer is a
thing that we're gonna really enjoy
finally welcome to check chock number
161 who actually all right and then
probably trained a lot in two completely
nonsensical because that's
that's what we do enjoy the show
wait why is the intro looping all the
times I've done this I've never had the
intro okay it looked like it looped on
my end but it oh oh oh no I didn't
actually loop I'm stupid I was looking
at the actual live stream hey could
somebody cut that sound bite out where
he said I'm stupid and send it to me
thank you weary tone my ringtone not
gonna put it on my stream deck like the
stream is not that far delayed so by the
time the the intro ended on OBS it
started on the stream that's how it's
only like 12 seconds behind and so I
literally looked at one window and then
the other and I thought it looped but it
didn't so you guys got an extra black
screen there for like 12 seconds it's
okay if you like to keep them on their
toes man keep them on their toes yeah I
knew that was coming I totally knew that
was coming dumontet D Mon monetized it
words words day it's not like I've been
drinking I haven't been I'm a little bit
delirious because if you guys aren't
aware we're filming season 3 of man vs.
build in Vegas next week which means I'm
gonna be out of the office the entire
week which means I needed a week worth
of videos to have ready to go live so
this we
alone we shot two weeks worth of videos
and they're edited in the hopper
scheduled and ready to go live starting
tomorrow so yeah laughs I worked myself
really silly here my camera froze again
actually did the same thing J I shot
about 12 or 15 videos and edited them
and they're all in the can I just I just
haven't uploaded them yet yeah they're
still in this can well I mean they're
here yeah look I'm out eventually it'll
be fine guys my camera's gonna probably
freeze a bunch throughout this I don't
know why it does that it does wait wait
what's that what's what's the make and
model on it could it could you could you
tell us who made that camera um
Microsoft okay okay I was just wondering
to be fair to be fair I took the other
webcam home the better webcam because I
started my vlog series on the second
channel again and so I wanted to I
needed that there so you know where
could somebody find the second channel
if they didn't know about a Jay the main
header of my channel it's been there
since day one you know you know the top
like of your main channel where it shows
like your social media like the Twitter
button and all that stuff yeah but does
anybody actually even go to that like
pain really nobody even reads the
description wide which is why at the
bottom of this stream all the
information you need to know about this
dream and how we rarely talk about tech
but people are still gonna ask where's
the tech so oh my god Jay's vlogs Wow
so glad I discovered this channel
finally oh my god 48,000 people got lost
somewhere better and stumbled across
that channel and hit subscribe
wow it's got it's got almost as many
subscribers as I do
you mean active viewers now I'm just
getting it on 45,000 active yours I wish
so I just saw this down because I'm on
this quest of and this is before we go
serve with our tech topic so I'm on this
quest of trying to curb hunger if you
guys have watched the vlog from last
night I'm trying to curb hunger with a
little bit more healthy snacks this is
beef jerky from carnivore candy my wife
actually got me this like supply crate
thing of like men's snaps but they're
healthy right and so this was the it's a
beef jerky it's a sweet picante from
carnivore Canyon like the whole bag was
like 100
what is they 115 calories 135 calories
that's not bad I say I think it 130
something yeah well it's 45 calories per
serving those three servings so yeah I'm
way under my under caloric intake today
those specials riding the bikes it's 25
miles roundtrip riding into work so
that's okay now to the tech topics
topics we're not gonna get started with
the hook the one that's obviously in the
title and real quick we're going
backwards for a second here the way we
kind of let off with all of our topics
didn't it feel very top Girish today
drinks coffee J flexes his man flab and
Nick is nowhere to be seen
oh poor Nick actually next we doing
working here all next week as contractor
like doing stuff while I'm out of the
out for the week so a lot of people are
just like where the hills Nick Nick is
actually gonna be taking a position with
a worldwide logistics company but he's
in an interim period right now or it
hasn't started yet so he's gonna be
doing some contract stuff for me in the
meantime a lot of people think Nick and
I had this like big falling-out no I
can't fall out with Nick it's a hate
crime if I do so that's true it actually
is on on two levels actually yes double
hate crime although I hear he has quite
the career ready for customer service
yeah he's got a lot and if that fails he
can be scammer calls - so he's got it
how he said it you know it's funny isn't
it we're gonna talk about Nick were
second here we're gonna embarrass him
he's not here to defendants do it a lot
of people think he's black you know he's
not white she's half Indian and half his
dad from Panama so yeah it's like it's
just dark too dark skinned cultures and
him now I feel really really racist all
the sudden that's why everyone's always
like who's the black guy what black guys
in the black guy here actually no no
basically oh that means that nothing
we've ever said his races cuz he's not
really black there we go saved
wait a minute is the only count if the
person you're directing it to fits said
criteria yes yes like I think that's I
don't know answer I know I know I got a
I got a scam and a meet no mmm see
that's behavioral versus genetics
different
I'm so ignant
oh my god so a gay yeah guys I'm gonna
trust me I know it's freezing I'll fix
it as we go along so all right first
topic up um
Nvidia squashes the entire GPP or the
g-force Partnership Program yeah I heard
about that that was uh but they were
catching like loads of right yeah
and everything I saw on social media was
against that nobody was for and what's
funny is their blog like they put the
they put their own little blog up kind
of addressing it and they were basically
like due to massive missing miss or
inaccuracies and misinformation they
decided to squash the program because
negative publicity for them right and
it's kind of funny that they were just
basically like well we're gonna go ahead
and end this because everyone's just
sort of lying and you know but you know
what the writing was on the wall and
they'd already happened with MSI and
Asus like literally within a week of the
news breaking about GPP Nvidia stopped
our website MSI stopped showing the
gaming xyn of Nvidia or AMD cards and
there was always a gaming X Nvidia card
and gaming X AMD card and if you guys
aren't aware of what the GPP allegedly
was it was basically we're in video was
trying to stop brands from aligning
their top tier gaming line like the ROG
or Republic of gamers metrics right the
MSI gaming X and stop cross branding
them between AMD and NVIDIA products
basically they were gonna be like if you
are gonna be putting your top two your
gaming line with an Nvidia card then it
can only be on an nvidia card you can't
put that same like strict series on an
AMD card so and they were off for
preferential treatment for they were
offering preferential treatment front
line access in terms of GPU allocation
and even advertising money on launch day
for new GPUs typically yeah when Nvidia
launches a new family of graphics card
right we're all waiting for the 2080 or
1180 whatever they're gonna call it next
next family of graphics cards what's
being shield today another crappy Audi
hey that Audi was pretty awesome that
was pretty awesome Audi I liked it out
he's pretty awesome we're gonna go ahead
and ban that guy just because he opened
his mouth and he's being a little
 so we'll go ahead later bro
peace anyway so moving forward that
basically Nvidia was trying to control
what the parties could call their card
the third party's AI bees but but they
were giving preferential treatment to
GPU allocation when they were available
but when Nvidia launched a new family of
graphics card
what would ended up what end up
happening was you would only see the
Nvidia founders card because new
families Nvidia kept close to the chest
they didn't want you know they wanted
all of the the fanfare and the in the
the spotlight and then about a month or
two after you'd start to see the custom
cards trickle out and then as the family
progressed then you'd see the the custom
cards launched alongside you know the
the main and video card yeah well what
the GP was supposed to do was get you
early access to the development of the
new family of cards and then remember
this is allegedly and then gets you day
one exposure so Nvidia would not only
launch their new family of card but then
he'd be like and it's available with the
MSI gaming X and da2 Strix
right so you would get that day one kind
of you know exposure with your new card
so interesting a lot of the information
that came out came directly from behind
the scenes people with a IBS that were
in the circle of no but there was an
awful lot of hearsay because Kyle
Bennett over at Hard OCP was the one
that broke the story with a lot of
anonymous emails and a lot of anonymous
memos and stuff that were not traceable
in that it's not like you could trace it
back to Nvidia or even these people in
AI bees that were willing to talk about
it because of course if this was like
you know Nvidia is holding your family
hostage and if you talk about this you
know they're gonna they're gonna sleep
with the fishes kind of a thing like
right that's how that's how scared the
AI bees word even didn't acknowledge
that such GPP program even existed so
that being squashed now means that the
amount of backlash that the public gave
regarding this was enough to make a
company like Nvidia cave and here's the
question were they not suspecting or
expecting the truth to get out or do you
think it's literally been blown out of
proportion no I think I think that they
did not want the truth to get out
because think about it if it was nothing
like the information that was being
leaked they would have just publicly
stated the oh no no no this is they
would have thrown it all out for
everybody to see and just completely
Declassified it and said this is what
people get for being a part of the
partner program
more nothing less instead they're just
like all people aren't understanding
this word is gonna pull it all right
like that tells me that they probably
hit the mark and they were like oh
this is not being received well right so
if you put together this program that
you're proud of and you're and you're
willing to obviously roll it out and
people started giving you wrong
information about it wouldn't you be
like I'm day one like whoa whoa no no no
you guys have got this wrong right and
Vidia sat in silence the entire time
until they decided to say we're stopping
the program yeah and I still didn't see
them even try to justify it they did the
opposite in there like oh yeah people
just are misunderstanding everything so
we're just gonna make this thing go away
that we're not even confirming or
denying pretty much but you know what's
funny is like so asus had already rolled
out I believe they called it Ares like
they had Ares cards in the past which
were custom cards and they stopped
making Ares cards like remember the Mars
card it was like a double it was like
two sevens 60s on the same card or
whatever it was Nvidia won't allow
companies to get creative like that they
won't allow companies to create these
monster you know these Frankenstein
cards anymore Nvidia is very closed now
in what they will allow the partners to
do so the Ares and all that stuff was
like one of those lines that was kind of
killed off but they brought the name
back and basically it was like ROG Strix
was like the nvidia cards I think it was
ROG Ares yeah something similar to that
for the AMD card like that had been made
public so that's why people were
confirming like oh yeah the the GP P
obviously was what we expected you you
can't have the same name on an AMD card
in a video card what's funny is the
moment Nvidia like announced they're
killing the program those custom lines
dead now they're back to Strix and back
to gaming apps like they fit right back
to well because how much was additional
was it gonna cost them to have to like
make all this extra packaging and extra
names and stuff what about the stuff
that was already sitting on shelves you
know I mean right right I mean even if
they didn't want to move it and rebrand
it I mean to rebrand an existing product
would be nightmarishly I guarantee you I
know what they would do the same thing
they've done before is they'll literally
just print a sticker and send it to the
retailers and be like go slap this label
on this box and like cover up the other
part like I hadn't I'm not even kidding
they do that so you like steamin pull
the sticker off and it's still such
tricks behind it pretty much yeah I
think I think they just got caught they
got caught with their hand in the cookie
jar and they just decided to try to play
play it off like it was no big deal
like if you're in vidya you can't
possibly be ignorant enough to think
that the truth would not have outed you
know yeah you know you know what kind of
as interesting goes if you think about
it the only reason to create a program
like that where you're trying to get
people to basically snub your competitor
like theoretically right snub your
competitor would be if you were worried
about your competition and that's the
interesting thing here is NVIDIA has
always been like really dominating
everything but now you got kind of like
rise in the AMD graphics cards though
some people would argue that you know
Tier four tier they're not quite the
same performance and cost versus
performance you know there's some
there's some information there but but
even so they must feel threatened by AMD
because there's nobody else currently
that's really competing on that level I
mean even with Intel and I'm trying to
do their own GPU initiative and
everything like that that's way off in
the future yeah so it's like they must
legitimately think that AMD is gaining
some ground on them no I don't just I
just agree with that I mean really let
me tell you why okay
AMD's last mainstream launch and I'm not
counting Vegas 56 and 64 because that
was not a mainstream card that was that
was them I don't know what they were
doing to be alive to be honest but
there's nothing new really well it was
their HBM - so it was like the the
successor to the fury X which came out
back in like 2015 okay
2016 June of 2016 was when I had a
meeting with AMD here in the studio
about the new card we all thought it was
gonna be Vega they basically started the
meeting with like guys this is in beta
this is in Vega it was a 570 and 580 and
then of course the 560 and we were kind
of like interesting because we weren't
expecting to see another like higher
tier card I guess in the 480 because
that the 480 was when it AMD was like
we're not interested in trying to
compete in the high end GPU market which
obviously Vega attempted but they have
not launched another card in the last
year they have not they have not done
anything above the 580 and the 580 is is
right around the GTX 980 in terms of
speed which is now two generations old
when it comes to Nvidia so if you if you
go card for card and go ok a 580 is
about the same speed as a 980 and if you
look at where the 980 came out and like
what 2015 a long time ago that's like
okay so
what are they trying to compete with
here so I think if you're Nvidia the
point I'm trying to get to here and a
very long run about weight I think if
you're in video you're looking at this
going they've just lost momentum right
Vega was a flop Raja is out like that
just did not go well Nvidia did exactly
what I thought they would they dropped
the set they dropped prices 1070 they
inserted a 1070 TI in terms of just raw
performance and power consumption there
was no compelling reason to get a Vega
or Vegas Vega card at all unless the
compute power that Vega offered was the
one thing you needed because it did beat
Nvidia in that market they just they
closed the gap in the Nvidia side of
things and Vega Vega was too expensive
at launch because it couldn't compete at
the price point so they reduced the
price of Vega with that stupid hunter
dollar back in rebate thing which meant
there was no profit in Vega at all so
now you've got a company that's
hemorrhaging money in terms of no
profits with AI cards I think in videos
looking at this is a DoubleTap I think
they're looking at this as they were
trying to just sort of double tap out
the competition entirely like they were
already on their way out so they figured
this would be a really easy way for them
to just speed it up and snuff them okay
that's what I Academy that's what I
that's what I feel like in video was
trying to do that's probably more than
likely true like after you mention it
that does seem like like that would be
more likely what they're trying to do
because they know they're down kind of
thing they had already won the hardware
hardware race hard work hardware race
and I think they were trying to finish
it off with the marketing battle the
marketing work I wonder if there's
anything else that they were getting out
of this too I wonder did you hear
anything about like how bi-directional
the partnership was what were they
getting in return from the people that
were signing up for the partnership was
it all one way and giving to them or did
they require certain things to be met as
far as like gaining information or
statistics or anything on the sales of
those cards from those companies I'm
trying to think if there's any kind of
analytical data that they were seeking
out here by locking these people into
this partnership it really sounded like
the benefits were they were gonna get
additional marketing money directly from
Nvidia okay I think that's it the moment
you mentioned getting money I think was
like I mean but the thing was I think
that the companies that were willing to
participate in the NPP were a little bit
less concerned with getting the money
versus being concerned with being
shunned by the Nvidia video Corp in
terms of their allocation and the
availability of parts that they need to
build their cards because the allocation
I should have priority they knew was
gonna go to the DPP well they got to be
careful because if I mean AMD being
alive is actually a good thing for
NVIDIA from just the sheer point of not
being a monopoly think about what would
happen if AMD just folded tomorrow yeah
Nvidia would literally be standing alone
in a massive industry and that would
that would instantly label them as a
monopoly meaning any company that came
online to try to compete with them would
get all kinds of special disc and disc
compensation from the government and
everything like that to basically bring
them up to speed well putting huge
restrictions on NVIDIA so that they can
catch up same happened to micros I
talk about a lot of this in next
Wednesday's video okay and that's
scheduled to go live next Wednesday I
talked directly about this topic
some-some rumor / what's weird what did
I call it earlier speculate it's a
speculative piece what I think is gonna
happen and I rarely do these but I feel
like there's enough information in the
past to determine what's gonna happen in
the future you guys are curious about my
thoughts on the future of graphics cards
and the industry then I talked about
that on Wednesday so don't miss that
video and just so you guys know my video
will be out on Tuesday same topic Who am
I kidding I'm like oh you're such a dick
how can a guy was such a small one be
such a big dick I don't get it it's like
it just doesn't even add up I went up
there I went there it was a tiny dick
joke Jay I'll say that you're that
you're like aww memories ladies
all right so Nvidia really up but
do you think the PR backlash from this
is gonna hurt them long-term at all or
do you think it's just everybody's gonna
forgive him and move on you know what
here's a here's here's here's my take on
the PCM our pitchforks and torches and
all that but then behind closed doors
they're still buying all the same
they protest against very trim plus the
prices are coming down which is actually
we should segue into that the the prices
of the GP is coming down right now
well take away so I in in that piece I
just talked about I actually do some
price comparison
with peace PC / picker because they have
norsu a two year you can see it's a
trend it right yes you can see a two
year pricing trend and you can see that
the price of like the eb g a black
addition 1080 TI okay um i don't know if
it's still available right now but as of
when i shot this video a couple days ago
there were they were actually in stock
at new ache for 749 which was only about
forty dollars above MSRP Wow now that
was coming down fast yeah but that was
also a little bit of a UH it was kind of
like a one-off because it was like an
outlier or out layer outlier whatever Oh
everything else wasn't following that
same trend most of the other brands were
still like the 900s but if you look at
where we were last summer um they were
$1,500 even the ones that are 900 today
yeah so what I found is right now the 10
60s and the 10 50s and stuff I 1050 1050
Ti you can get for just about MSRP
because there's no right because those
aren't good they're not good mining
cards right but the reason why they went
up in price was because the show's
really gone off the rails so much tech
being talked about we really apologize
for all the Tech Talk tonight on Tech
Talk you can't win I'm so I've been in
work mode this week so I'm all like tech
on the brain
I forgot what that's like but what what
happened what happened was because
people couldn't buy the the really good
cards it just bought whatever they could
get their hands on in the mean time
which put which put a supply chain issue
on the 10 50s and 10 60s and all that
stuff so they went up the price a lot
yeah
the 10 60 was about 30 years percent
over launch price but it did seem to go
up more than that as you went up the
chain because again that cash rate you
know performance but it's coming down
hey well this because the you know
usually when Bitcoin crashes in a theory
I'm basically a Bitcoin chase each other
right I mean both markets are affected
by each other because a lot of people
transact the currency between the two
right i they really haven't rebound they
haven't gone down much anymore but they
haven't really rebound from the last
crash and now that we know that Asics
are coming out for for we we know this
to be fact that Asics are coming out for
aetherium I think the pressures just
gonna come off of GPUs and long term
people are gonna stop the miners
gonna slow down and stop buying them
that's gonna just bring the demand way
way down and the price is gonna come
along with it because I don't think the
gamers are gonna come in even if every
gamer in the world wants to buy a new
GPU they're not gonna compete with the
miners that are buying hundreds of
thousands of these cars for big mines
right so so I really do think that we're
gonna see the price start to slowly come
down and then just overnight it's just
gonna tank down to MSRP or maybe even
dip under it for a short period of time
if they're not moving a lot of product
well a lot of people are afraid of
what's gonna happen with next generation
and video cards because everyone knows
there's gonna be a bump in performance
across the board otherwise what's the
point of a new family of graphics card
and it's been really dramatic in the
past - right so I mean their expectation
should be it's consistently between 20
and 25% improvement I've done videos on
that that's a lot though I mean like
when you think about it i how much sheer
performance is there is but it's
artificially being controlled Nvidia
won't allow it to go farther than that
Jenson himself two years ago at the
keynote for the Tesla P 100 when it
launched their very first HP M card was
for Enterprise Solution they built that
you know the servers and and all that
stuff out of them they didn't go to
mainstream availability they and they
use envy link and all that stuff he said
in that keynote right then and there
he's like an F and you got to give him
at least credit for being this
transparent he basically was like he's
like we could have jumped five years
ahead
he's like we've gone so far with what
we've been able to squeeze out of HBM
and this is still technically their HP
m1 tech like during this this keynote he
goes we could have jumped five years
ahead but he actually talked about
investors and excuse me durable aluminum
ELMO Jensen I was kidding he he he
talked about I was talking about
investors and and you know market
research they spent like a billion
dollars developing the the HBM
technology that they're using he's like
we could have jumped five years ahead
and made this huge leap in graphics
technology but yeah he sought to appease
investors and costing and all that stuff
they chose to take the annual
incremental twenty twenty five percent
improvement in terms of like what you
can expect to see and grit and GPU
desktop GP performance and stuff yeah
but he basically was like we
have developed five years ahead he's
like but we are releasing it in bits so
they're doing CPU manufacturers do the
same thing though Intel is notorious and
it knows never actually come out and
said they did it true true but right but
I personally know that because I've
worked with there s TVs that are
developed software development vehicles
yeah two years before they were released
to the public I mean I had a 32 core 32
core CPU and one of the server one of
the one of the SDV server boxes that we
had then I was testing one like I think
the the most that they had was eight
cores on a public CPU at the time or and
yeah just eight cores was like the max
they on the public not like a 32 core
processor now you can get those like I
mean it's literally years and years
before it actually went public we were
already doing the software testing and
the confirmation on it with the kernel
so maybe they're not publicly staying it
saying it but it does make sense to only
roll out technology just to edge out the
competition just a little bit because
then you have that many more releases
that are almost free to you yeah right
if you just jumped ahead and everybody
have the superfast graphics card that
would force that would either knock your
competitor out which now you're you're
basically setting the market at that
point right you can do whatever you want
or if the competitor then decides oh
crap we got a punch which a lot of money
it doesn't catch up and they catch up
really quick and the outdo you've got
nothing to run to yeah yeah no like you
but that's kind of what happened with
Rison and coffee lake so I'm right they
up the schedule right because that came
out like right after that I remember
that I did a video in July June or July
it was after Computex X 299 launched
ahead of time X 299 was was launched at
Computex when it was supposed to be out
in like August September timeframe they
pulled it in in that video I basically
stated Coffee Lake is gonna come into I
said coffee lake is gonna pull into 2017
so many people took an opportunity to
like link me articles and link me all
these things say no Jayla coffee lake
isn't coming to a spring spring of 2018
and I basically I basically was like
guys the writing's on the wall they're
gonna pull it in they are starting to
lose they're starting to AMD starting to
regain market share I hate using the
term lose market share because Intel
definitely was losing market share but
they still were the dominant market
share holder right
so when you say lose market share it
makes it sound like you've lost the
dominant right we need to retain that
brand loyalty too if somebody moves to
the faster AMD product and they're gonna
start making some of at least a
percentage of those are gonna make the
assumption the AMD is now the better
processor moving more and it's gonna be
a uphill battle until I have a it's
important to word at AMD was gaining
back mark yeah sure
there's very big difference there in
terms of like investment speak but
anyway um so when they when we got the
emails about coffee leak like a month
before the launch of course I just
wanted to give the biggest middle finger
and you know told you so to all the
people calling me out saying I didn't
know what the I was talking about
sounds like J you know but I took the
high road let's change gears real quick
we're gonna get off tera a second here
let's do it I said an idea for a fun
little segment here so Fulbright gaming
says barnacles
he said barnacles his budget that he
says what moment you should go play at J
shop to get back and into work to know
what it's like to work Tech again Wow I
don't think my STI would make the
commute it won't but I think you might
want to go back to first grade grammar
but anyway right now I think we should
have a job interview we'll just do it so
um hello mr. Berg my name is mr. two
cents yeah oh well uh well hello mr. two
cents already you're the kind of person
that interrupts your boss okay good to
know
okay what now so why don't you tell me
sorry I care easier that's gonna go in
my head
okay composure well okay why don't you
give me an example of a very stressful
project that you've worked on and how
you overcame the stress to meet the
success of the project
alright well you may not you may not
know this because I didn't put it on my
resume out of sheer embarrassment but I
used to work for a company called
Microsoft you might have heard of it
right so they make a lot of things
really um
you know I'm not not really specific on
anything outside of the software you
know I think they make mice and
keyboards or at least real able other
people's stuff but one of my most
probably stressful projects I ever
worked on when I was there was a little
thing called Windows Windows Vista did
you ever hear
about that do you do what windows vista
is I do actually we still use it here in
the office we consider it to be the
superior OS okay all right so I can see
I'm going down a bad path here um so so
Windows Vista was actually one of the
hardest projects that I worked on
because we kept resetting things over
and over and over again and having to
retest things over and over and over
again and after all that hard work we
still shipped a product that I was not
proud of but they didn't listen to me
when I told him to hold it back they
were like no that one employee in
this hundred and twenty some 1000 people
company forgive me for interrupting you
but what what what what product is that
you were proud of this guy shipped this
this was oh no no no not proud of Vista
oh oh
Windows Vista you are Windows Vista it
was I mean it was a shitty operating
system at least at first they patched
the hell out of it and it was it was
just a resource hog after that but uh
was that was that before or after the
excellent Windows ME well actually yeah
you know a lot of people don't know this
but the Windows 9x operating systems
were the magnum opus of Microsoft like
it was purely political that they got
shut down like these should have been
the dominant operating Circuit aches
opium that's what you said right it's
the opium product you you're probably
looking at my dilated eyes oh yeah yeah
OPM is good I like opium okay pretty
decent I know we all took it at
Microsoft well we were developing the
software okay so we pride ourselves on
punctuality here like we've got a pretty
set schedule we're not we don't have the
luxury at js2 senseof of the youtubers
that just kind of come in whenever they
want and leave whenever they want and
don't have extracurricular activities
lives families we have those here at
Jay's to says so Rilla okay we start
promptly at 9:00 a.m. our art I'm sorry
what might be a little bit of a problem
that might be a little bit of a problem
because usually I'm just going to bed
around then so do you okay I think I
think I can change I think I can change
you know it just might might take a day
or two but I think I can change I'll do
it for you because I think you got a
good company here okay I can clearly see
by how
modernized your studio is and our
professional looking it is that you guys
are on a serious ship here well that's
all this green screen so we we images a
big thing here speaking of image we do
require semi business casual dress
attire but well like like like this
jamma pants with a teacher okay that's
what I do for my business it's actually
written into the contract for my
corporation that's probably gonna be a
problem but do you have any solid print
pants I do I mean do jeans count I mean
it's kind of solid let's get up really
close I got I got one pair of jeans
don't if it's me don't wash or light
colored jeans these are at least there
would be a light color you know so I
mean that screams 1990s so I'm a little
bit okay let me tell you a little about
us we okay let's hear about it so we're
the older people of YouTube what I mean
by that is a lot of YouTube channels say
are being run by young people and by
young people I mean they're under 30 and
tell your gray hair you are of advanced
years no this is this is experience not
necessarily age and indicative this is
just a spirit experience indicative
that's how you get the level of gray the
gray is actually my prestige but that's
besides the point noted we have to
remember that we are the older people
that are addressing the I don't like to
use the n-word but we're talking to
Millennials most mostly and it's like
wait what are what are what are
Millennials they're kind of the
generation that everyone's worried about
in about ten more years but I think if
we actually work really hard here we can
actually change the course of the future
so that's kind of what I'm working
towards right here because I'm okay all
right I'm not gonna live long enough to
actually see the destruction that could
come of come about but I'm a little bit
concerned of you know the next
generation so we have to remember that
we're when we're dealing with this type
of audience they're fickle they will
they will unsubscribe at the drop of a
hat you say one word they don't like and
that unsubscribe button becomes their
best friend so okay why don't you tell
me what direction you would take the
channel if you were to be maybe an
additional host or personality
here enjoy yourselves okay okay I think
I think I've got something to offer in
this department because I think that you
guys are missing a huge opportunity in
regards to where you can actually shoot
videos and utilize your space in the
studio like I didn't see a single camera
in the bathroom mr. two cents
not a single let me suffer there we have
one but it's not easy to find oh my god
oh god you just broke me right out of
character I think I think I could
actually bring a lot to your company
though because I feel like you kind of
you kind of sold out and stopped being a
fat person I mean well you're still fat
actually you don't mean that
I'm morbidly obese person now I know let
me stop you right there
Mr Blair what miss okay all right mr. G
that is an investment into my health
okay do you understand where this is
where I'm going with this like you will
out survive the skinny people hired
people get when they punch like an under
inflated or under filled punching bag
like your hand when your hand just gets
like stuck right this wasn't great
school Jay I know I got punched a lot
right there's a lot of exhausted right
when we're standing there eating a jelly
filled donut and it's dripping on your
stomach and they're just like going away
like a speed bag they get tired before
you feel the pain you the the average
density of fat and I just threw my pen
yes I was actually taking notes Jerry
the I can't tell because you're too lazy
to hook up a second camera
the sad part is it's actually I'm
actually taking notes on the back of my
payment stubs for my car
Artie gonna feel a little weird when
they get this and they flip it over and
it's like okay fat windows me know it's
windows you anyway windows you know I I
make my payments online but I digress so
the density of fat do you know how that
that could stop a bullet dude I've heard
that stops bullets I saw an episode of
cops once for this really big guy was
shot like six times and he was just like
I don't even go no hospital I'm fine
that goes like a trickle of blood I
think I'm same video like doesn't the
guy come out I like his porch and they
just like open fire on him and he just
keeps coming at him like what no no this
one was like a gang shooting oh he had
survived it he was just like I knew
hospital he had like two holes all over
his belly but anyway um the other thing
is you need to come at me with at least
a nine inch blade to hit an organ pretty
much okay so yeah I mean I've fallen on
bat-knife several times and it hasn't
done any damage beyond a band-aid so I
mean you know okay so I derailed you
with the the bathroom camera okay so you
would want to do it you'd want to turn
this into a voyeur experience I'm
assuming no no no no no I just think
that it's a good set like when you're
sitting on the you're in a
relatively good position you know and I
and I'm an expert on this I've done
quite a few videos both on Instagram and
the Twitter platforms okay from the
throne and I also find that it's good
way to relieve pressure you know so a
lot of people get really nervous you
know in front of the camera but I find
that particular Elvis massive
unless you're Elvis that's true that's
true unless you're Elvis I mean he is we
don't want to die on the toilet I'm not
I don't want to go down that direction
let's not die on the toilet that would
get massive eating some of your poop net
pictures it looks like you're you know
one squeeze away from an aneurysm well
that's actually good acting as what that
is Jay I'm not as good but I would
definitely say it's acting well you know
I try I really try and I and I feel like
I make a connection with people when I
do any kind of a review from the toilet
because they're like this guy must
really like this technology because he's
not even waiting to get off the
to share with us okay but I think that
that's a good angle now the bathrooms a
little tight to film like a full build
video in there so okay mmm okay I took
notes more camera bathroom or bathroom
cameras got it doesn't get 110 people
cameras not good enough got it yeah yeah
pinhole battery-powered yeah you got it
and then I've to go to the neighbors to
look in it's cool so yeah anyway um
moving forward what would you do in the
main set well I think on the main set
what I would do to really really enhance
the experience is take my shirt off for
at least 50% of the production okay
because I feel like we're missing out on
the entire french-canadian demographic
by me keeping my shirt on okay fair
enough the thing is the audience really
likes to throw around the oh where
a lot how do you how do you plan on
dealing with the Oh word oh the Oh word
like on a food oh wait but obese is it
obesity no I'm talking about the the Oh
word
the real the Oh word people seems to
seem to think that their version of the
Oh word is more important than anyone
elses
oh oh oh you're talking about dare
I said opinion yeah okay we're gonna say
it oh a word that Shawna time
the world oh we just got reported by at
least 40 people in chatter damn it
well what I would do about the O word
right we're gonna bring me here for one
second one second all right what's up
that's not coming to go by it says Wow
cringefest again it's like traffic Moo
Cola well how come the people that is
saltiest all have foreign names can
anyone I don't understand English so
it's weird to them they're all they see
is you know it's weird to them I just
wonder why every time someone's got the
saltiest common it's um like freakin
Bangladesh or something I don't get it
it's like yeah Admiral Ackbar FBI scam
okay I see it that asshole just scrolled
away so it's fine okay back to check
back to character all right well the way
that I would take care of the O word J
is by making sure that I use every
possible synonym of the O word to
intentionally avoid the O world we're
still establishing my dominance and
using the or here's the problem though
okay when you're o word doesn't align
with vero word they become o worded this
is this is true this is a tough one to
solve this is a slippery slope and this
is what people don't understand about
running a business like we do is that
these there are 1.5 million landmines in
front of me yes and trying to navigate
all of those so I guess I'm curious as
to whether or not this is the type of
pressure you think you could actually
handle well seeing is my past experience
of laying in bed and watching Netflix
and not making any content from a nearly
million sub YouTube channel for for
nearly a month I think more than
qualifies me for being a reliable person
that can deal with the stresses of the
internet so you're telling me you're
consistent and mentally stable very very
consistent so some might even say I'm a
genius on some levels I don't wanna I
don't want to use the G word because
apples apples gonna sue me
character in belly okay those are good
words I've used those a lot non truthful
okay yeah that's that's a liar doesn't
wear pants okay they're not well you
know what I think this has been very
enlightening and don't call us we'll
call you and we will keep your resume on
file
why well I've heard that before
was it the Dolores nobody calls anymore
right it was no nobody ever calls me
except for these damn scammers okay okay
as a matter of fact here you know what I
I got I got a beef here you know just
yesterday
mr. cringy went by again and comment
that he was from India really I had no
 clue you were from India I
didn't know okay I'm gonna be honest
here and I'm gonna try to use my honest
face okay I'm gonna be honest here I had
Jim's about riding a moped something
right now I mean no no what are they
called the rickshaw is that really what
they call it yeah I think the Rick shot
the little three-wheeled vehicles that
fit like 27 people oh yeah I think
they're called rickshaw I was like take
a take a ride in the wooden bus on the
side the Himalayas exactly look at these
calls I get after that you will be taken
under custody by the local police as
there are four serious allegations
pressed on your name at this moment I
just use all the tools with me like you
get back to us so that we can discuss
about this case before taking any legal
action against you I love to read yes
it's obviously a scam attempt I love
others no mention of your name and then
demand the English is like so broken
it did change though the message did
change the last message was you will be
taken into custody if you don't calls
back this one's like this is like your
final notice
Oh like like they did alter it slightly
to reiterate that it was a second
follow-up call and that I really need to
get off my ass to send in Walmart gift
cards okay well I'm get to get the guy's
name already who triggered this whole
like fake interview but I hope you
enjoyed that you inspired this well done
Jerry and I already know very well that
if he was local we would not
I could not be his boss ever no nowhere
no way for all the reasons that Jay and
I are friends or all the reasons why we
can never officially work together in
any kind of alpha versus beta kind of
arrangement it would not work to be fair
though I'm not I don't really I don't
really run this place like an alpha
anymore that's why we got Brian Brian
Brian handles all the the inner
communication and interpersonal
communications suite you don't just
scream bloody murder Ryan and tell him
to leave
who's Oh Brian yeah no I got Brian sorry
sorry your editor you know what Phil
is it Phil I yell at him but it's all
joking and he yells back at me and I get
said the thing is I like I like doing
like collaborations and stuff with you
but yeah we it would never work if you
were my boss cuz you'd be like I need
this now and I would just be like now I
know why you're here while you were on
that automated chopping block it is true
they were they were paying me if I you
know I can admit that you know I'm gonna
be the better man and admit that
Microsoft even though an algorithm laid
me off I did make way more money than I
should have for what I did fair enough I
will I will come out and say that
because you were paying me an insane
amount of money okay for what I did I
will also go out there and admit that
they were paying you way more money than
me I think I think I think any
professional youtuber sure if maybe
Linus Linus takes such a corporate
approach to as to his his the way he
works I think pretty much all of us are
overpaid going to the truth yeah I think
you know you know we're I mean honestly
speaking now not just around I
think we're I really went wrong was
everybody else kind of changed with the
YouTube industry like took it seriously
the professionalism of it like went
where the money was did the right things
to grow and establish themselves and I
think I just hey I just held on to the
Hobby aspect of it yeah yeah I think
that's ultimately what kind of do me and
then ultimately sent me down a path
where I started taking too
seriously cuz it's like I didn't treat
it like a job I treated it like here's a
bunch of people that I just wanna have
fun well I think it's hard to maintain
it as a hobby though because what
happens is you grow an audience and the
brand's all come at you and then they
start dangling carrots and then you're
like I'm just gonna take a nibble of
this
you're like oh yeah that's that's a fat
carrot but I mean I to be honest a
hundred percent transparent we leave so
much money on the table here because one
we don't have the bandwidth to take all
the work - there's lots of bands that
want to work with me that I'm not
willing to work with like everyone knows
I work with Nord VPN you know tunnel
Bayer hit us up and I was like nope
sorry we work with Nord and and there
was there was a there was a there was a
conversation like sort of semi taking
place of like well if you want to change
it up blah blah and it's like no no I'm
this is this is the way I'm doing it you
know so not just people want to bet you
be like yeah you make too much money
which is kind of I've got do
you know I've got two weddings and two
college education that I've got to pay
for in the next you know what seems like
fifteen years is not that long away well
you know I can teach you how my parents
raised me worthy you don't have to no no
no no no no I'm we're good we're good
we're good
I mean I mean they basically fed me you
know what obviously they fed me but you
know it's like beyond that I think it
was just like alright see ya
does thermo fair yourself this thermal
fake want to work with you they did
reach out to me several times since my
whole issue with thermal take and of
course I told them like no absolutely
not I mean yeah so I haven't done a
sponsorship and over
I think it's been close to two years
since I actively did anything with a
company other than them just sending me
something to either review or not read
here's writing though so I try to be as
transparent as possible I mean I I'm not
hiding anything from anyone I think a
lot of my diehard like my core following
knows like that I'm not I don't just
okay there's people no matter what
people are gonna accuse you of selling
out and chilling but I think my core
audience right now is that I have
standards that I that I maintain with
boundaries within it didn't have
standards you would be rich is and
you would be three times your size
that's true that's a true statement I've
had a lot of people approach me about
exclusives and stuff like we want you to
exclusively use all the product it's
like no no I don't I don't do I don't I
don't do that because yeah especially
when it comes to like heart like main
hardware and stuff and I've got my
brands and I'm really personally loyal
to like I really like sanctum and the
cable sleeping of stuff and Jo and I
have become good friends but he he's he
does more larger-scale like stuff with
like Intel and stuff like that where
I've decided to team up with cable ma to
do my cables because they have just been
so accommodating to me they can get them
done quickly and they're like anything
you need let us know you've got it
so I'm loyal to them and like yes I'm
gonna use cable MOT cables in my builds
and stuff because they have been good to
me so we created this relationship
before there was ever the like hey J we
never met you we want to throw a bunch
of money at you and have you use only
our stuff that's like that's like the
way streamers operate no no offense is
any Street are you know ferret out
ferret up um this one the reasons why
people like ninja if you know who ninja
is he's he's like the largest twitch
streamer now I believe right like yeah
and I know yes um was talking with a
brand that's working with him and here's
the thing this is the kind of guy ninja
is and this is why he's growing like he
is he was doing like a meetup thing in
Vegas or whatever like he was doing like
some eSports thing and I mean he's the
same guy that that streamed with Drake
or yeah Drake right so it's like this
guy is freaking massive basically the
brand that was there sponsoring him was
like hey can we can we have our meeting
and he's like yeah give me like 30
minutes he didn't come to the meeting
for over two hours because he refused to
leave the meet-and-greet until he had
met everyone that's awesome that tells
you a lot about a person like that you
know that's huge
and I hope his head on his shoulders
stay that stays like that because the
thing is the more you get Fame and the
more you get money and stuff people do
change I mean as much as I try and be
the same person I was in day one we've
all changed in some way sure and so I
mean I have huge respect for a guy like
that but my point is hopefully my core
audience knows that guys you are
streaming now just saying that's that's
a good point
no just sayin streamers that's talking
about the streaming platform yeah he
likes like twitch and stuff like that
like I could never do live stream as a
living that that I feel like that
requires more dedication and mindset
then making recorded content but that's
that's not my point I'm trying it's way
different it's definitely different my
core audience knows that I'm not gonna
just take whatever money comes my way
and I will you're not gonna promote
something you don't believe in because I
just know that you won't do that I wish
I could share with you guys the amount
of money we leave on the table but
obviously that's all that's all
non-disclosed corporate information
company information luckily for them I
can disclose what I left on the table I
actually got an offer just not this year
but last year from it I won't say who it
is we got a respect because they are a
good company but I've had 3d printing
companies offered me a six-figure a year
salary for exclusively using their
printers and working with them directly
on projects and stuff like that yeah I
also received another close to
six-figure request from a company that
makes a certain energy drink that I
refuse them to because one I just don't
use it into I don't believe what they're
they're advertising I don't I don't like
the way they advertise I don't like how
they engage the public and how they have
no PR so there's just certain things
that I won't cave on right that I've
told myself that like no amount of money
is gonna make me cave on this but I'd be
lying if I told you then I feel
confident in those decisions today
you know knowing that I'm merging income
and everything like that and I'm not
getting things done I'm not doing what I
want to do right so so it's it it's
absolutely something that you have to
balance with yourself and I mean we're
being very real with you guys right now
I mean this is to make a living online
you cannot just get on and say I'm gonna
do exactly what I want to do a hundred
percent of the time and treat this like
a hobby and come and go as I please
and expect it to be hugely successful
the people that it even appears that
that's what's happening that is
absolutely not what's happening yeah
even the vloggers you know I've been to
vlogger fair I know a lot of the family
bloggers and everything none of them are
let's just wake up in the morning and
turn on a camera and have a good time no
it is very very premeditated it is very
very land out because you have to show
your best side you do you have to it'd
be so boring if you just woke up and
you're like you know I'm gonna lay in
bed and eat some cereal and watch a show
for an hour and then I'll get up and go
wash the car it's like no you have to
wake up and be like what would be
exciting and and then I can edit down to
ten minutes or 20 minutes or how long
you want it's like the people that
comment on the vlogs that I do about
struggling with weight gain and and all
that and and you know depression and all
that stuff I haven't really had
depression problems the last several
years I've been pretty mentally healthy
there but a lot of people were like damn
you oh you're the man talking about this
stuff and you know it takes a lot of
guts to put that out and the thing is I
don't really feel like it does maybe
maybe I'm a sociopathic in just the
sense that I kind of have no filter and
I've always just put it out there and
it's just the way I am but so
correlation gaming common and said ninja
also got super salty and upset that he
read a donation from
fractal Josh heiping bit wit ninja
accidentally read it out loud and said
that he shouldn't have read that channel
name out loud um I can I can see both
sides of that I could lose that just cuz
he wanted to get paid more for it or was
it because he actually doesn't ever
endorse anybody or as a competing he
thinks he wants to be seen as some sort
of an exposure platform got it I know I
don't I know I don't I didn't work my
ass off to build this audience just to
have someone come in and like self
promote but in this case yeah Josh
wasn't self promoting I haven't seen the
comment but I have to assume he was
probably talking about man versus build
because that's the that's like the
collaboration between Josh and bit like
Josh wouldn't just be going around going
to I got a bit way you know he's
probably like hey you want to see some
exotic cars and PC building check out
this you know I guarantee Josh wasn't
spending money to promote Kyle I
guarantee true Josh went spinning but I
could see where ninja would get salty in
that like because the moment that name
is mentioned it's like if he's got a you
know 150,000 people watching how many of
them just went and looked up that
channel and did he just boast a
competitor see those right the other
thing is like I don't look at this
channel as a competitive being this is
not I'm not competing with Kyle I'm not
competing with Paul definitely I
competed with Linus I'm not competing
with people in the same genre I truly
subscribe to the mindset that a rising
tide raises all ships and having more
people in the space watching in it's in
a hole brings more viewers my way as
well trying to if you're highly
collaborative like nobody can argue that
you haven't collaborated with a lot of
people I love collaborate know yeah I
mean arguably a lot of those people you
collaborate collaborate with we're a lot
smaller than you are arguably yeah so so
so I'm not saying that you're you know
I'm not throwing you out there like
you're gonna go and collaborate with
brand new channels that just started and
stuff like that there has to be a mutual
benefit but I'm just saying they that I
think that your actions speak alongside
your words because if I were just a
loner you would just be a loner and you
would just suck it all up and you would
compete with everybody but you don't I
appreciate that
where that mindset of mine stems from is
when I had 14,000 subscribers I just hit
like fourteen thousand subscribers which
was not quite a year in on the channel
I remember commenting once on lionesses
when show I don't think was called when
show at the time it was something else
this is the live shows I think he called
it and I made the con I asked him once I
said hey man I've been doing this for I
don't think was like eight months now
it's like eight months and I've just hit
14,000 subscribers is there any advice
you'd give to somebody like if you could
go back and give advice to your early
self what would it be oh boy if they vie
to go back and give myself advice like
back at that level like when I was just
in my stride and a thousand subscribers
was something that was like oh my god
what happened you know jumping around
and everything the advice to get that
I'd probably give to myself is I hate to
say it but almost just like lower your
expectations yeah that's fair
is what I would give myself because once
I started really growing fast it almost
became kind of an addiction to see that
it was almost a self-serving addiction
that it's like oh man these numbers are
going was like a video game right it's
like I'm getting to the next level I'm
getting next thing people are talk other
youtubers are talking to me they didn't
want to talk to me before because I put
in the time and effort to show them that
you know I can I can role I can play in
this in this territory but at the same
time I mean there's a lot of luck
involved in this too there's a lot of
meeting the right people at the right
time there's a lot of just hitting on
the right topic like a lot of the stuff
that way viral was stuff I never thought
would go viral that did the most like
you know building of my brand in Channel
yeah out of anything so I guess what I
give myself back then is I would say
like don't get don't get so big for your
Brit you know for your britches like
even even you and I have kind of gone
back and forth a little bit as we've
grown in have been competitive to a
certain degree back in the day right
we're growing it's like we were kind of
edging each other out and I was giving
you a little and you were giving me
a little and we were going to go
and going but it's like eventually you
get to a point where you start to
realize that the bigger you get the more
exaggerated the the noise gets and the
anger and that stuff starts pulling you
in and that stuff I didn't even think
about when I was small I thought oh my
god if I get a million subscribers it's
gonna be the most awesome thing ever I'm
gonna be doing everything I want I'm
gonna be going to buy in golf streams
and flying around the world and having a
good old time and it's like yeah that's
simply not true
huh well not to mention a subscriber
without a thousand a million subscribers
today is not like five years ago when we
were first starting but true but back
when we were starting yeah it's like
it's like there was a time guys where a
million subs would make you a very
wealthy person but not more what Linus
his answer to me was and this is what I
still carry with me to this day was he
said that he would go back and do more
collaboration so he wish he had made it
a bigger effort to collaborate with
other people in the same space and so
I've always I've always I've always just
followed that I mean I I give lie I
fling line of here and there Linus
and I are actually we are very well
connected in terms we think very very
much the same the more time I got to
spend with him talking with him you know
I'm having lunch and dinner with him and
any mood yeah even just hanging out with
him and his wife we realized like we've
got a lot in common in the way we handle
ourselves so I would I'm gonna be at
Linus tech Expo in July I hope people
here watching are going to be there and
come up say hi and meet me but I
couldn't not support him he asked if I
want to come and just attend he's like I
can't pay or anything but I just love to
have you there if you want to come hang
out it wasn't like Jay can you come and
promote this it was do you want to come
hang out with us and I was like
absolutely I couldn't not support him
regardless of what your feelings on
Linus are he legit actually I like Linus
personally well he always had I don't
mean you I mean the audience oh um he
legitimately paved the way that allowed
me to give my family a quality of life
that I could not have otherwise done now
doesn't mean Linus did it for me but it
means he did at least shred you know for
me to forge a path that allowed me to
kind of sort of follow in the idea of
how this could work which then allowed
me to kind of adapt it into it my own
way and everything's been yeah
everything's been good but to kind of
grow on what you had said you can't you
can't be a really small Channel and of
course everyone's idea of really small
is gonna be different right the guy with
500 subs is gonna feel like five is
really small with a guy with 500,000
subs it's gonna feel 5,000 small whereas
the guy with five hundred things five
thousand is like oh my God my life is a
dream right
you pretty much what happened I've done
this in the past is I I've worked it
collaborated with a cup with a really
small channel a couple of different
times and it was the same every time and
what I mean by that is it was hey Jay
what do you want to do next time when
you want to do another one when you want
to turn into this whole like this
expectation if we were gonna do it all
the time and yeah because I get angry
when you didn't want to
oh yeah suddenly I'm too big for them
you know they happens I'm too popular
for them and
and I can't hang out with them anymore
and it's like that's not even what this
is literally the idea of collaborating
with a really small channel as a big
channel has it's one of two things and I
don't think it's any different than this
one you really freaking like the person
so you just wanna legitimately and
genuinely help them out and think that
they're great or - it's a charity you
are literally going to do the
collaboration to help bring them some
subs and then move on and never talk
again right you just helping them out
the problem is either way is kind of
number two is definitely a bit
disrespectful I don't think it's
respectful to just jump in on someone's
channel and do a collab - like here
here's here's some residual subs of mine
you can have them and off you go and
never talk again because then that
person is left wondering like what did I
do to piss off Jay you know I mean right
and then there's the legitimate we like
you and want to work with you kind of
like when you were working with lioness
and doing the collapse you know yeah so
I did lioness gave me a lot of good
information back it's my fault that I
didn't take it hee-hee early on you know
we deemed a lot yeah about stuff
watching my videos actively he told me
what I was doing wrong what I could
change editing stuff I mean he gave me a
lot of information and quite frankly I
you know where you took it I didn't yeah
and here we are
high voltage 12 volt or 12v says look at
some oh now she's huge thanks to your
show and unfortunately if you guys
haven't heard she does have a brain
tumor that needs to be operated on later
this month so we definitely wish her the
best of health and lend her some love
guys we she did not get her start on
this show and and let me clarify that
she was already doing something that
caught the attention of Jerry and me and
our show may have put a little bit of
wind in her sail but where she went from
there was a hundred percent her this is
why I hate this concept of you know Jay
you'd be nobody without your audience
that is a hundred percent true but it's
a two-way street I'd be nowhere without
my audience but my audience won't be
here watching if I wasn't putting in the
work to give you something worth
watching so right it's a two-way street
yes the audience allows me a means to
continue this perpetual cycle both has
needs the other to survive there are
people out there that believe that the
viewer holds all the power and that's
not true because if I was out here
making content the viewers won't
stick around it's it's a two-way back
scratch so I hope that makes sense I
hate that what does I hate that
argument of well you know Jay you are
who you are because we're here it's like
but but how did you find me in the first
place I did something you liked and
stuck around so it's it's definitely a
mutual benefit to all of this right we
had a couple of our tech topics I want
to talk about absolutely did you have
another one before I move on to mine
okay so we're gonna save the Google
thing for dead last all right we do that
yeah okay so then we've we've got 30
more minutes I need to leave dead at
6:30 because I'm cycling home and it is
getting windy as hell out there and this
is gonna suck all right well then I'll
make this really quick so those of you
guys that are that have been kind of
niggling over whether you should install
the latest windows April update for
Windows 10 just beware there are quite a
few issues that are being reported
especially on Intel platforms of a lot
of lock ups a lot of instability some
boot manager issues and the one that
seems to be universal that I get
messaged about the most is the
microphone not working the microphone
just suddenly doesn't work anymore and
it doesn't fix in the mixer you
basically have to go through one of the
configuration things like for voice
configuring voice to get it to basically
reinitialize the microphone and then
everything starts to work again so there
are quite a few issues with her right
now I don't know why Microsoft hasn't
recalled it to try to repair those
issues and read redeploy it usually
that's what they do so I'll just leave
it at that just beware if you guys are
installing that make sure that you have
restore points in place make sure that
you have a full backup if you can using
like Clonezilla or another utility and
that's clones oh I love Clonezilla man
Clonezilla is like open source imaging
software you can image the gnash you can
image to DVD media if you have a burner
that's compatible you can image two USB
thumb drives pretty much anything even
just other hard drives in the computer
or the hard drive you're imaging to
itself I mean you can do so many
different things it's not very intuitive
though so I will be doing a tutorial
video on it hopefully soon the other
thing I just wanted to just touch on
really quick before we go to the Google
topic is Apple iOS 11 point for update
coming out for those of you guys to have
an iPhone I know there's a lot of you
that are Android lovers keep in mind I
ride the line I carry both a razor phone
and an iPhone 7 plus so so I can
appreciate what they both bring to the
table they are implementing a cool new
feature it's called USB restriction mode
that's supposed to help defeat some
tools that the government's using for
recovering data and stuff off your
phones because it takes some time to get
a warrant this goes all the way this
goes all the way back to the San
Bernardino terrorists
shooting you you know it so basically
happens right that's true that's true
yeah you could hear it yeah oh my god so
basically what Apple's trying to combat
is basically the freedom of privacy
which is kind of strange when you think
about it because there's a lot of places
where they violate privacy pretty
blatantly themselves but what they're
trying to do is prevent your phone from
if it's confiscated or taken by somebody
or the government to basically limit
their options to be able to recover data
on that device without your passcode
well they've created some devices that
can break into the phones basically
using various different methods of
breaking the encryption and getting into
the device well they're replacing
they're they're putting a new feature
into the next update for the phone
that's basically gonna put it into a USB
restricted mode where it will not
communicate through USB if it's left
disconnected for seven days and the
reason that they chose seven days
arbitrarily is due to how long it takes
for a government agency to get a
warranty to attempt where instead of I'm
sorry war I don't work the government
weren't to search this place better than
Apple Care search warranty warrant so so
anyways by the time that they get a
warrant the idea what the feature being
is that by the time they get a warrant
the phone will be in complete lockdown
and they won't be able to use any of
their methods to basically brute force
cracking of it yeah so kind of a neat
feature there are a lot of like more
questions than answers around it is the
why did they pick seven days why isn't
this gonna be configurable what happens
in the situation where you're out like
camping or something like that and then
the phone gets completely locked up
after seven days what's the recovery
path there's a lot of questions but I
think it's actually a cool idea in
principle that they're trying to solve a
hardware problem like this with a simple
software change so it's it we'll see how
it works out but unfortunately I think
it's probably gonna end with a bunch of
phones getting orphaned and and and
the Genius Bar is gonna have a line five
miles long but anyways it's kind of a
cool attempt all right go ahead J what
do you got Hobbs just send chat also
federal appeals appeals court just ruled
that forensic searches of devices at the
border are unconstitutional
interesting right let's just be fair
labeling something as unconstitutional
doesn't stop it from happening
yeah not tell anybody's yeah pretty much
okay so before we move on on the Google
topic I have
more small and I want to talk about
easier I'm sure we've all seen the
breathalyzer right
it's the you have a little too much
alcohol to drink tonight I could smell
alcohol on your breath and then becomes
a speaking of search warrant that gives
some probable cause to do the
breathalyzer and you don't have to take
the breathalyzer but if you refuse the
breathalyzer in most states especially
California then they can they can detain
you arrest you bring you into the jail
and then a blood tech will come and
physically draw blood from your arm
wrecks where they will check for blood
alcohol content or BAC so they have
these breathalyzers that you blow into
on the side of the road it could detect
the level of alcohol in your system
purely by your breath they'll use them
for fun for you really you would do that
and then you get on the simulator right
yeah that's right yeah there's videos on
the internet go find him I'm not going
to tell you how
so apparently researchers in the u.s.
say they've developed a low-cost chip
that can detect cocaine in minutes the
team hopes it will be rapid development
a portable cocaine breathalyzer that
would tell of a person to view has used
the drug now there are places in the
country especially in various large
cities in the US that have cocaine
epidemics and cocaine problems probably
Florida for the most part would explain
all the crazy people in Florida but I'd
all the shirts yeah I digress you know
it's one has to wonder if Nvidia could
it may be benefited from the cocaine
breathalyzer when they came up with the
GPP idea there they were all like oh my
god man we can get him in partnership
and then they gotta do what we want but
but you have but you have a okay so you
have a physical ratio of blood to
alcohol chronic alcohol to blood content
with BAC right yeah in your lungs really
I what is the ratio of you you got four
Newtons of cocaine in your blood I mean
we've detected you got at least one
millionth of tenth of a gram do you like
how every time we come up with a
scenario where southern what does that
mean yeah III think I think we're we're
like closet racist against rednecks keep
me races against rednecks no I think I
think we are no I think we're I think
we're well I used to be red I get grew
up around I've never met a redneck that
didn't just accept it actually or just
be proud of it I remember I grew up I
was like crowded should have beer in you
man
toothless hillbilly redneck damn
straight here you gotta go to the
dentist for nothing hold on I can't hear
you over two bald eagles in the ears
screech right after that it's like oh
 we're not even in the animal
preserve what negative what should we do
that we have to do we do have a little a
little Patriot montage and the video
going up on Monday it's weird to have
all this this plugging to do I've never
had this much lead time the videos that
are ready to go live because I'm gonna
be gone all next week so trust me when I
say the next two videos tomorrow's
tomorrow morning's and Monday mornings
you don't want to miss those trust me
I just can't believe you got so many
videos cued up it's making me jealous
that I don't like don't have a studio
and an editor and somebody to operate
cameras where I can just sit there and
be like alright I mean the next thing
yeah it's definitely Phil and I
definitely worked our ass off Phil comes
in three days a week he's not full-time
and we definitely had to like leapfrog
and tag-team and and you know I shot a
video Wednesday just myself and then we
shot one today that's going live on
Monday we shot one Tuesday that's going
live Friday like the thing normally if
you see a video go up for me you know it
was like either shot like within the
last 24 hours
that that that's usually what I think
when I see it because I know what I do
my cameras like freaking out
this is gonna be like the first time
yeah there's like all kinds of wavy
lines apparently there's a search
warrant on my camera
anyway search warrant you so this is
like the first time that you're gonna
see a video go up for me and it's like
days and possibly even a week old
weird right wow that is weird out in the
camera for this really weird thing goes
oops
stupid Microsoft camera video that
there's sachet cam do your camera's
artifacting I've been talking about it
for like five minutes and you're gonna
tell me it's artifacting like I don't
free don't see it you know one thing I
want to say before we get off the topic
of you having it editor Phil Phil's
editing is so on point in that car and
here's like I was so jealous when I saw
it I was like I wish car gasm could be
like that and here's the thing I I hold
him back I don't let him spend the time
on the videos like he wants to because
we still have not got that luxury of
being far enough so here's the thing
yeah we're a whole week ahead but next
week is gonna suck up that that buffer
period and we'll be back for one when I
get back we all wanted to take him to
edit that video that the car video
the teepee estimate he did it over time
it wasn't a profit I mean to give you an
idea of that that outtie video just went
live what yesterday yeah I had that car
April 9th
so do the math right oh geez okay so so
he had some yeah he probably had some
decent time invested I'm just wondering
like is he one of those guys that could
sit down and like bang that out in two
hours
no Phil okay Phil is meticulous he's a
quick editor but he he's he's he
definitely owe CDs on a lot of the
little things and it shows its show like
all the little transitions with like the
little like lighting players and stuff I
was like whoa this looks like TV like
production quality stuff you should see
some of the stuff he's produced for the
other company who works for they work
for clients and they do stuff like major
clients like PlayStation and stuff like
that so you should see some of the work
that he's done but we'll get to that
point yeah I told him and here's more
that transparency behind-the-scenes
stuff guys I told him when he first
started here I was like you know your
resume your portfolio proof that these
are the things he worked on he could
have just showed a video and be like yep
I did it but he like he pulled it down
off you know keep it right um I told him
I said this is this is an end goal
that's an end game goal for us to work
up to I was like we can't just start
producing this super crazy like Gerry
I'll show you a sample later on of what
I mean like one of his resume videos
like we can't just suddenly start
producing that level of content because
it's too jarring for the audience to see
my usual raw rough-around-the-edges type
of edits and stuff to just suddenly be
like super polished shiny you know
amazing edits because we have oh yeah at
that point so just a touch just a touch
on that really quick that's something
that actually did happen on my channel
you remember the drone video the Volare
edited for me the one we read everybody
did like lost their in the comment
somebody's like this was in Jerry's
video somebody else was putting it in
producing this video put on this is a
commercial yeah and it literally was
shot exactly how I wanted it shot they
just did the editing on it but it was
just so over-the-top and different
there's quite a difference between
having having it in your mind we want to
look like and being able to do it
yourself right that's why I it's why I
hired a professional to do it that's
good yeah so and to be fair to in the
beginning there was a lot of people that
were commenting shaky camera fills shaky
feel shaky to be fair I gave him my
equipment that that was set up for Nick
to use and it was not like something he
was used
was not like the type of stabilizers and
stuff that we have was not something
that he likes so basically asked him he
sat down one day I said Phil what tools
do you need for me what I need to buy to
make you comfortable and he's like buy
me this this and this and I did and
since then we have not had a single
complaint about camera movement camera
shake or camera work that's all so he
knows like his craft and that's
important I know my craft to the problem
is just like you described I know in my
head where I want to look like but I
don't have the editing skills to do it
but we we've gotten enough synergy now
in the two months he's been here to be
able to spit ball an idea with him and
then he'll start to do it and they were
like yeah let's do this and we'll do
that and we'll sit there together in the
Edit and then it will evolve together
like together we will get the final the
final it's not like I just hand him a
video and be like here you go edit it ok
thanks for the file upload no I'm still
editor-in-chief obviously on everything
right otherwise it wouldn't turn out
anything like what you're expecting it's
like let him do the perfect transitions
and everything but there are places
where timing is important the order of
operations what you want to see what you
want to throw away that stuff that you
know decisions that he's not gonna make
that you're gonna just be like oh that's
perfect we he does the rough the rough
cut right and then we go back through
and do the fine bits of details and then
he sends me the final project I go
through make my changes and then we put
in life it's crazy that you can do that
much work and still get that much of a
backlog like it clearly shows you're
just barely sleeping this week
especially yeah Tuesday I rolled in at
like 8:00 in the morning and then I got
home at 9:00 at night I mean that's it's
a 13 hour day it's not my longest day
Nick and I put in we were in that the
thread Ripper video remember when that
video went live the crazy custom build
that we did the woman all the crazy
bends and the
that weird-looking symbiote case that I
built yeah so that one they're not
including the build time the actual
shoot time to do all the b-roll and the
editing on that video put it together we
were here 19 hours straight oh that's
crazy we didn't get we didn't actually
go home until like 3:00 in the morning
so yeah it was pretty ridiculous shows
an end result though it does but then we
were like never again you know even do
is you need to like go back like like do
a throwback and be like Phil rego remix
and re-edit this video like however you
want it to be and then release it is
like what do they call it when they like
Rio remaster rewind like episodes
remastered
like go find your really old content
that you did way back in the day and
then just let Phil just totally go to
town with like after-effects of and
see what it looks like like you're
really old stuff see what he comes up
with I think that would be amazing I
would watch that literally like once a
month if you just said today is
throwback from my you know World of
Warcraft funny skit video or whatever
years ago I'm gonna let Phil it know
we've got skits we're planning on we're
gonna be doing some skits we're gonna be
giving a Kyle a run for his money trust
me so we have got some ideas Dead
Specter just said Jay on VHS Jerry on
DVD because the lines going through my
camera look like tracking lines does I
remember the tracking little knob so
come on top then I want to see you Jay
do you keep all of your footage right
now we technically don't we definitely
keep the outputted file but I'm still
been just too busy to finally put
together that well the rig is together I
have to still do a raid card for four of
my drives but I still have that massive
rig that Linus is sponsored that I have
to finish putting together so we got a
10 terabyte drive on his machine
obviously and then we've got a hundred
terabytes I think 100 terabytes or 80
terabytes on the rig that were built for
storing stuff but it would come in handy
because there's things we want to go
back and reference over time right and
be like hey remember we did this video
it's nice not to have like an h.264
video dropped in a ProRes line you know
I mean no yeah so anyway perspective
says this is Tech Talk yeah that's
bullshitting it's it's hard to keep that
stuff like me I don't have probably five
percent of the original projects from my
videos that I've created yeah most of it
is the rendered video because I just
don't have the storage for even with 70
I have 70 terabytes of storage between
my two nasa's now obviously i use a lot
of that for like family photos and
storing other stuff other it's not just
strictly for the business but there the
amount of space that you need to backup
especially with you shooting raw on some
stuff yeah like you would the amount of
space that you'd need would be in the
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
terabytes to be able to keep everything
for a year are you ready for this we've
got the two adam of shogun infernos we
use them as monitors like we don't even
record to them anymore because we found
that like dealing with the raw timeline
yeah you know it just was it was extra
steps that didn't need to happen after
youtube compression so we haven't we
have the means to do you know raw and
pro res
level stuff but in our environment it
just wasn't necessary so we paid for we
actually paid for our lighting engineer
to come in here and create lots for our
cameras so now well now we shoot with
the mixed cameras or even all three
cameras over in a7s2 we have an F s5 and
an F a seven mark - always those three
different cameras three different
sensors three different looks with the
same settings so he did all of the he
create all the LUT so now if we drag
them in our timeline and drop our lutz
on them they all look matched which is
that's awesome that's gonna save a lot
of time yeah we suisse definitely cuz
then color correction is minor rather
than dealing with like this massive
color correction needs to take place
every single time so yeah okay so we got
one less topic to talk about before we
get out here we got 14 minutes left in
the show and that Giri I'm gonna let you
take it away that one being Google
duplex Google Google duplex is Google's
new technology that they just recently
demoed basically showing how an AI with
an artificial voice can actually mimic a
human being in a full-blown unscripted
conversation with another person over
the phone the idea of this technology is
the eventually manifests itself as an
application on your phone where your
personal assistants can proactively do
things with other human beings on your
behalf like for instance you want to get
a haircut you could say you know okay
Google you know schedule me a haircut
for 2:00 p.m. tomorrow but remind me to
update everyone about the YouTube read
suggestion you had for me last week Oh
will do will do so so that basically the
idea here is you you say okay Google I
want to hear a cut at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow
and the digital assistant then calls the
place that does the haircut and then has
a very natural conversation with them so
that they don't feel like they're
talking you know to a computer like
press 1 for this and press 2 for that
cuz they just hang up and it basically
emulates a human voice it's it's scary
how happy right where I feel like it was
faked
yeah and that's that's that's just it is
it may have been a scripted scenario for
the demo but the ultimate goal in the
interaction is very very fluid if you
were a person on the other end of the
phone it best you might think that the
way that they're responding is slightly
awkward but you would never suspect that
it was a computer especially it was
interval we were listening to it on
Google i/o yeah we're hearing it through
super like high fidelity call yeah not
 e-commerce bomb going to grow on
that once you put the the compression of
the phone call into play I think it
would be hard to determine the the voice
if what we were hearing wasn't just
straight-up a hoax and that's the thing
it sounded so convincing that I the word
hoax comes to mind like I just am not
convinced that what we saw was truly
being handled by AI I am not against so
so let's let's just for the benefit of
the argument let's say that their demo
is legitimate okay at least to some
degree so the idea being here is that
your phone would have this app that is
your personal assistant that would do
things on your behalf and it speaks in
such a natural way that it doesn't just
keep repeating the same things over and
over again it actually puts in little
airs and little quips into the
conversation yeah so it sounds more
fluid yeah like um you know your little
pauses and stuff literally the the the
rare content that I do script because I
do have a teleprompter it's yeah it's
rare that I script videos but sometimes
I will for ad reads and stuff there was
a while there where I was doing a
perfect example the the crazy three-way
980 water-cooled gigabyte graphics card
monstrosity thing was totally a scripted
video strip scripted video because there
was so much information I want to make
sure I got through that I did script
that video and actually spent two days
writing the script read it out loud
practiced at multiple times and I found
that anywhere anytime I had a natural
speaking um or pause or whatever I wrote
it into the script so I actually it the
script was literally as if it was a
transcript of me something I've already
said rather than me reading something I
want to say so does have to otherwise it
comes off disingenuous and nobody notice
know how you're not a single person
noticed that video is scripted I have
approximately twenty or twenty-five
videos out of my thousand and whatever
that are scripted 100 cent every word
every um every comment every cough
scripted and nobody noticed nobody I
guarantee you guys cannot go find those
videos and tell me which ones they are a
hint they're the ones where he actually
knows a bunch of the tech stuff and
nails it it's it's the ones where I
don't misspeak yeah it's one breeze like
yeah the Intel the Intel quad core
processor has like 3.2 micron water
cooled muffler bearing interface to the
main bus and six even names
even then you can't tell which ones a
high percent scripted because I will put
those props like those specs up on the
prompter just not rolling
okay so Google duplex is basically doing
the same thing it's putting quips into
the conversation to make you sound more
human and the synthetic voice that it's
using also changes in pitch and tone so
if it says yes or yes please or yeah
that sounds good or yes they keeps doing
that to the conversation it'll it'll
continuously change it so that it
doesn't sound like it's playing back a
soundboard now the the scary thing about
this is how good it is it doing its job
it's a bot that can basically dupe a
human into thinking that they're
communicating with a real person and
then ultimately use that data and act on
the data that they're getting from the
other person I'm laughing because Pistol
Pete in chat says Jay has to go soon
he's getting to the end of his tape he's
yeah we're gonna make sure you rewind it
before you go back so so think about
think about the consequences of this for
a second this is why it's kind of
scaring people as Google's like yeah
this is really cool and it'd be cool to
have a personal assistant on your phone
that could do things on your behalf in a
natural way and then even talk to you in
a natural way I think it'd be cool Siri
wasn't like completely dumb
which it is like hey Siri what's up ins
oh hey what's going on today you know
hey it incorporated things about my life
into the conversation that would be cool
what isn't cool about it is when this
bot becomes available and used by
scammers used by companies that are
trying to you know commit fraud or dupe
you into buying things or sell products
what if my big my biggest concern is
what if it's able to mimic voices
meaning it can recreate my voice or your
voice or whatever and that technology
exists Adobe it'll be already created it
and the reason it's not even main
streaming out right now is because there
are some really really serious it's
going to be used for bed yeah absolutely
so I I I said I watched it several times
I've watched several people's videos
about duplex and I'm I'm so convinced
it's fake like 100% fake like they just
took a recording in like a looker word
REI can dude we're still years away from
this being real but look what you can do
I'm sorry if it's that good you're gonna
you're gonna show it more and what it
would have sold me as a believer that
this is not being hoaxed or slashed
embellished on its accuracy is if they
showed some of the failures
cuz it could have big comical if they
were that far away if they were that far
away and anyone who follows this type of
tech is gonna be you know is interested
in the bloopers - when tech goes wrong
yeah show us some of the bloopers where
it was like I'd like to make a hair
appointment okay when were you thinking
large pizza you know like I don't know
whatever so what at the same time they
don't want to show its fallible like
even though that's a real-world scenario
you don't want a label every single
thing we know about tech is fallible in
some way sure but NVIDIA doesn't get up
there go our cpu overheat if you're
on it for more than ten minutes I mean
they don't say that even though it's
true in some situation there is 3.5 out
of 4 gigabytes yeah you don't got all
your memory they didn't they know they
did a real it was pointed out right okay
fair enough but that's because that
would that was responsive that wasn't
being proactive but guys think about
what happened if this technology
especially if it could do voice
synthesis you know of somebody else
imagine having the like East Indian
scammers for instance right now they
call and they use an obvious computer
voice most people aren't gonna fall for
it they're gonna shut it off they're
gonna think it's up and hang up
and plus they can only call as many
people when there's human interaction as
they have physical humans right if this
bot existed you could in theory
simultaneously call hundreds of
thousands of people without having to
employ a scammer and have one of those
things have a custom-tailored
conversation with that person to dupe
them into giving up something you're
right and it's very very scary like
here's another technology if you ever
looked at deep fakes before no ok so
deep fakes is a technology that's open
source that allows you to basically put
it's like face swapping but its face
swapping on a level that you almost
can't even tell that it's fake it is so
realistic like did you ever see the
video where they did the Barack Obama
say and all the up it was
like key and Kenan was at Kenan or Pele
or one of those guys did it he basically
did his impression in live imposed
Obama's face saying something that he
normally wouldn't say and it looks
almost dead-on accurate and so deep
faces this technology where they can do
that now you basically train a system
with tons of photos and pictures of the
person and it goes and graphs it and
figures out the perfect lighting figures
out the exact amount of noise to put
into it and everything so in the end you
get something that looks incredibly
natural even with a lot of movement and
a lot of
head-turning and stuff like that it's
the first time I saw it I was like no
 away like I've seen face swaps
you can tell it's a face that was how
that one guy made that parody video of
us oh absolutely no that's exactly what
I was talking about a little creeped out
cuz he put our face on his face yes and
it was very very clean now keep in mind
he trained that with very little data
the more pictures that you have and the
more video that you have to train it
with the more accurate it would be if he
had to spent like a week on that and
like took you know a hundred of your
videos and processed a hundred versions
of your face in those videos and then
use that and applied it it would have
looked dead on like you on his body like
perfectly yeah and so that technology
scares me and audio is a lot less
sophisticated to fool people than video
right I mean just from a pure sense
point of view so you bring these
technologies together we've got some
interesting coming out in the
future because you have the ability to
basically put anybody's head or face on
anybody else's body you have with
Adobe's technology you can synthetically
create their voice from text which means
it's not even modulating your voice to
another voice it's literally a text
script that it can read and convince
somebody that it's that person and you
got a technology that's AI that can
actually respond to light by really
being bright what do you end up bright
gaming is telling me they do porn with
celebs with this technology okay I'll be
honest I did go yeah got me you got me
with J already knew that long long
before this conversation went down the
Obama or that was me grasping I was like
oh yeah I was there another video other
than porn oh yeah with Obama but but
anyways the fact that these three
technologies exist once they converge
and come together you're gonna have the
ability to both you haven't you had that
you had to use that choice of words on
the porn one which one what choice words
they come together they come together so
but the point being is just imagine if
you had a Skype call that came from a
scammer
it was spoofing that they were your wife
they looked like your wife they sounded
like your wife and now they get you to
say a whole bunch of up and
then record it and then they publish
that and then the people watching the
recording you're like did he really say
that or is that just another about a
step further how about a step further
you never thought it was real you you
you've my wife and like the the people
at our my daughter's school like they
kind of know what each other's sound
like on the phone
like that yeah imagine the whole like
collie up at me like hey roar I'm
sending blah blah blah to pick up my
daughter from school today cuz because
there's like a you know if someone
unknown comes to school to pick up
they've got to be like on a release card
got to get together right yeah so
imagine that that's really and
imagine if they had enough of your
information like if there was like a
password you know that has to be said or
something like that that they could that
they could totally do that there's so
much bad technology not only makes our
life easier and more convenient it also
makes it more convenient for people to
do bad items so and like bad evidence
and stuff like think about it it's like
now we gotta wait for Jake Paul to do
something stupid but what
happens when people just start putting
everybody's faces in all kinds of videos
but they're so accurate and so
believable or even you can't tell if
it's faker or even the voice changing on
the phone cuz how many times have phone
calls and wiretap pin evidence a lot so
I mean video video is immiscible in
court it's actually like one of the
higher levels of evidence why just audio
tapes you know yeah like imagine if you
robbed a bank and your lawyer comes in
and goes yeah actually we made another
video with deep fakes that puts a Barack
Obama's face on all the people that are
robbing the bank and it looks perfectly
real so you need to dismiss that they
were literally there and cameras are
pointing out of it still but it's very
scary the future is very scary but at
the same time it's kind of exciting that
technology is reaching a point where a
is combining with both the ability to
mimic human expression and human voice
yeah pretty soon we're gonna be talking
to our phones like it's the L
card system on the enterprise I mean
we're gonna just be like computer I want
a turkey sandwich and it's gonna call
down the subway and then it's
gonna call an uber each to go pick it up
and bring it to you and then it's gonna
tell you when it's there and even answer
the door and take delivery of the
sandwich it's gonna be a very weird
future guys oh that's not scary at all
okay so what I want a sandwich when we
get we're gonna we're gonna go now but I
want to update never you guys remember
last week we were talking about the
processing time of videos and I was
complaining that was taking several
hours for videos to even process 1080p
and up to 24 hours for 4k to process and
Jerry had this suggestion
sign up for YouTube read and upload and
try so I want I want to report that when
we ended the stream last week
stay online with me and we I sign up for
YouTube red and I still see ad what the
 I just realized that anyway
what to figure that out I just realized
I still see ads play you probably like
who I push the wrong button didn't sign
up for it oh I'm Thai I read tube that's
different
not really so um so it might be new dude
I dunno my YouTube red account is active
gonna send me emails like here's what
today's you know blah blah blah from you
Duprey didn't notice any appreciable
change though nothing for me so ever but
Jerry had another theory that maybe they
are trying to bump up smaller channels
by processing priority based on
sub-county I don't know slow down the
big guys speed up the small guys yeah
the videos the video that I uploaded
last night on the vlog channel was 14 I
think was 14 minutes long process 1080p
within a minute
so there you go and I've uploaded three
videos today to YouTube and all of them
are still processing 360p and the
fundamental difference between your two
channels your vlog channel was created
much later to Hannah's and lower
subscriber count until that video went
up yet last night had not seen an upload
in over a over a year so what that tells
me I mean again there's a lot of other
factors in here that it could be but
just preliminary looking at it it looks
like YouTube is showing clear favoritism
to these smaller channels and slowing
down the bigger oh you really don't know
are you ready for this so we're so on
the vlog Channel I'm subscribed to the
main channel and on the main channel I'm
subscribed to the vlog Channel right and
I do that because I can then see what
things look like from the subscriber
perspective I'm always right cognizant
of like what does it look like as a
subscriber on the vlog Channel I cannot
I have not received a notification of
videos going live on my main channel in
I don't know how long within minutes of
me hitting publish on last night's video
my main channel got a notification same
car zj's two senses just uploaded a
video it's like it explains why the
viewership on the main channel is down
yeah and last time I upload a video same
thing happened the video got the lowest
viewership like it was a good video
solid video topic that people love that
I do it got the what some of the lowest
viewership like worst a my talking head
videos I did a month ago right and so I
went in and I looked at the analytics
like where the views are coming from and
the majority of them came from social
media and everybody said
I didn't know you released a video even
weeks later people were saying I never
showed up in their notification labs
just said what about the bitrate was it
the same no they were not the same to be
fair the vlog channel was an OBS capture
of the camera and then I just uploaded
that whereas I am uploading at 40
megabit per second YouTube preset and
Adobe I can test that I guess by
uploading a low bitrate and see what
happens so we'll do a try that because
that's that's fair that's fair like you
need to upload the same exact thing to
both channels to see what happens
because it isn't but it is possible the
codec you're using is incredible what
I'll do is I'll take a take a file
probably not today because I gotta get
my ass in this biker gets darken and
stuff but yeah I'll take a file that
took forever on the main channel
uploaded the same file in the second
channel and see what happens do it I'm
curious and I'd love to know the results
of that because YouTube's doing a lot of
weird I want to point out - we
didn't do like any car talk today so
we'll have to make up for that next week
we're not doing a Tech Talk though I'm
gonna be in my way back from Vegas doing
bags man versus build season 3 but well
we will be back May 24th so put that on
your calendars guys alright we will see
you next time guys you know where to
find Jerry probably in bed nubs game
probably bad I mean I'll be honest all
right here goes the auto roll it thanks
for watching Tech Talk 161 Google duplex
sounds like hell of a lot better than
his shitty voice modulator built into
the CM OMG 10x you mixers have a good
time guys we all love you
well most of you not patrols though
you we definitely love parts of you yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
