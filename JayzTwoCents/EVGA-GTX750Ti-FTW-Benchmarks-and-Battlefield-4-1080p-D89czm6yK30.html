bringing you another graphics card
review that seems to be a lot of those
shooting around the internet lately but
we're going to take a look at another
gtx 750ti
but this time it's the EVGA 750ti for
the win Edition so let's go ahead and
see if this thing really is a winner by
giving it the old fist in the rear I
mean Jay is two cents alright so here we
go guys we're gonna once again take a
look at another little powerhouse
graphics card coming in at well under
$200 in fact at the time of recording
this thing is 179 dollars so going to go
ahead and put that out there now but it
is the EVGA gtx 750ti for the win
edition this is a one step beyond their
super clock and this is the AC ex card
I'm gonna go ahead and unbox this thing
here it kind of it comes with some
interesting packaging it's in a bubble
wrap and it's got some plastic wrap in
there but we'll take a look at the
accessories real quick once again it
does have a 4 a 2 x 4 pin molex to 6-pin
plug that's because this does have an
axillary power a 6 pin PCI Express power
slot for an additional 25 watts of power
allowing for an even better overclock on
this card you do get your user manual
here installation guide driver disk
again I recommend tossing that and
installing one I just hit what I'm
always hitting my computer with that
stuff I take one for the team but they
also give you a poster here and I'm
gonna go ahead and unfold this I love
the fact that EVGA gives you posters
with their boutique
cards and I say boutique loosely
actually it's just their their upper end
spectrum of their cards like the for the
win I just really hate that they have to
fold them up to get them in the box
because then you're dealing with all
these creases but look at that guy the
art of the game innovation inspiration
if you know who this guy is please tell
me is I don't have a clue looks like a
Centurion of some sort really mean one
to now because they ended up getting two
fans on there with their ACX cooler they
had to extend the bed
just a little bit so that they could fit
that as you can see right there it is
all black PCB and they do they did have
some improvements on here to the vrm
power delivery and the auxilary power
and because of the cooling and how
strong the cooling is as you can see for
such a tiny card they do give you a huge
cooler on there with a dual copper heat
pipe to give you excellent cooling and
in fact when I told EVGA the card
arrived I didn't even know I was going
to get a for the win edition I thought I
was going to get an SC which was the
short one with the one fan so when this
guy showed up by email EVGA I was like
whoa hey thanks guys I can't wait to
check this thing out and their response
was go ahead and overclock the hell out
of that thing and you should get some
pretty good results so I'm pretty
excited about that now as you can see
right there the cooler does extend the
entire length of the card but what I
think is really neat is two things one
you have a black IO plate cool I like
the black I don't know if that's new for
this card or fall before the Windsor
that way but again you have a DVI you
have an HDMI and you have DisplayPort so
this thing does natively support 4k at
60 frames per second through that
DisplayPort way to go other than that
there's not a whole lot to say on this
the stock clock on this quite honestly I
have absolutely no idea
I think it's 1176 I could be wrong let's
see if it says on the box here anyway
quite honestly it's not that important
what it is right now because we are
going to find out what our max overclock
is going to be obtainable on this little
guy and let's see if this guy is a
little guy or if it's a big guy in
sheep's clothing or a wolf in sheep's
clothing or however that saying goes
whatever let's go ahead and let's go
ahead and drag the slide over and get
over to the benchmarks okay so the
performance of the card was nothing
short of well non surprising the 750ti
performs exactly where I thought it
would in fact it trades blows with the
GTX win or the GTX the wind force
Edition which I have sitting right there
on my desk from gigabyte now where does
the ACE DX pull ahead or the for the
wind pull ahead well it pulls ahead in
benchmarks and it pulls ahead in the
auto setting here on battlefield 4
giving us an average frames per second
on auto of AD
9 frames per second that is quite a bit
higher than the gigabytes average 68
frames per second on the auto settings
now when it comes to the ultra preset
before the win edition was actually one
frame per second lower on the average
which is well within the margin of error
for you know different things happening
within the system so I would put it
right on par with the gtx 750ti from
gigabyte now it does have a custom PCB
on there and more importantly it has the
custom cooler on there which is their AC
X or their their double fan solution
that is where I feel it has a fatal flaw
and here's why the stock profile for
this fan is 42 percent it can't go below
42 percent now that wouldn't be a big
deal because 42 percent of say 1500 rpm
is a lot slower than 42 percent of 5000
rpm now I have no idea what the max rpm
is on these fans I didn't really even
bother to look because the moment I
powered on the system I noticed holy

this card is way too loud I mean way too
loud it is louder than the testbench and
my gaming rig while they're both on at
the same time all I can hear is the
constant of the graphics card and I went
whoa something's not right this is not
like EVGA to have a massively loud card
like this so I went on Google and good
old trusty Google as well as the EVGA
forums and I did find over there where
Jacob had put out a BIOS update that is
supposed to alleviate some of the fan
speed or fan noise issues now I applied
the update and I didn't have any
difference whatsoever so it's possible
that my card shipped with the newest
BIOS I didn't even check I just flashed
it anyway absolutely no difference so
the 42 fans 42% fan speed on there is
way too aggressive when the card is at
idle when the card is gaming fine I'm
okay with that but at idle it is
absolutely too loud and that is where I
feel this card has a fatal flaw the ACX
cooler is a is a terrific cooler for
cards that demand more cooling than this
in fact this card never got hotter than
51 degrees Celsius the fan never even
ramped up past 42 percent even when
overclocked and even while gaming and
that's even while overclocked to
fourteen hundred and one megahertz so
it's obvious that they put too
aggressive of a fan in there I did see
an article with a nun article but a post
where they wrote about how there are
voltage requirements you know with the
card and with the exhilarate it takes
and stuff well so does the gigabyte and
it doesn't have that problem so I really
hope that they address this and maybe
somehow even in a new revision put
slower motors in these fans it's not
necessary when I'm gaming at Ultra
preset overclocked over voltage you know
put the core voltage slider as far as it
would go there's no reason to have these
fans blaring like they are at idle
because they didn't even ramp up at
overclocked while gaming so it obviously
means the cooling threshold was well
within like I said fifty-one degrees
Celsius is all that we got on this so
anyway that's its fatal flaw and I was
thinking about putting this card in my
wife's build but unfortunately it's a
deal-breaker for me because it's just
far too loud which I really hope that
ebj can dress somehow because it's an
amazing card and I love the looks of it
and it's EVGA and everything about it is
awesome except the noise what is going
on with the noise alright guys I'm gonna
get on out of here tell me what you guys
think about this card if you own it do
you suffer from the same noise problem
with the AC ex-member this is the AC AC
X not the SC with the single fan these
have two fans on there so tell me down
in the comments how you guys are feeling
about this card and if you own it and go
ahead and take the discussion to Jay's
two cents calm and hit me up on Twitter
like somebody's blowing up my phone
right now they really want my attention
so I've got to go I gotta go do some
stuff so guys as always I will see you
in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
