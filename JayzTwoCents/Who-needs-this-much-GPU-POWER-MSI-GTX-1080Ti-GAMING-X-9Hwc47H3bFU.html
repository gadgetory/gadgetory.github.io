want to give a huge congratulations to
the winner of the 1 million subscriber
ultimate PC upgrade package
Jonathan Muslims must must Blatch Mo's
pledge we'll just go with John but
anyway he did reply to the winning email
within the allotted 48 hour window so he
has claimed his prize don't be upset you
guys didn't win I've got more stuff to
giveaway coming up so don't go anywhere
sick and tired of all the RGB craze well
don't worry because the EVGA Z 270
classified K is full of all the things
that matter like Intel obtained memory
ready you to nvme SSD support 11 phase
PWM for stable overclocking and a sleek
monochromatic design that is perfect for
any bill learn more by visiting EVGA
comm yeah I know make sure it's too big
guys I'd like to be able to move freely
with all of this space and all this room
for activities and plenty sorry you are
not the stars a show how does it fail
nope the start Today Show guys is the
GTX 1080p I gave me X 11g from MSI I
swear they got the names of these get
longer and longer but I digress guys
this is the first custom PCB I've gotten
my hands on ever since the gtx 980ti
launched back in february yeah they
didn't have a whole lot of lead time to
get these cards ready so it took a
couple months for people to start
getting theirs made and this is the
first one to make its way in here
normally MSI will send me retail
packaging but it's just got a card in
there and none of the stuff that comes
with retail so I figured we'd do kind of
a little mini unboxing here because this
is actually the first one I've been sent
that has everything in it that you would
get as a retail purchaser so of course
we got some foam in here protecting our
card we've got a thank you message here
for choosing MSI I think he's always
good we got this little cardboard sleeve
right here it's got some stuff in there
we've got some stickers something about
the Lucky Dragon workshop looks like
it's some sort of a little comic book we
have got of course our quick user's
guide which is actually quite a few
pages for a quick user oh it's a poster
oh I see okay it's fun and of course
driver disk I don't even own an optical
drive ok badge we have also got in this
way guy right here a six pin to eight
pin PCI Express adapter if you don't own
a power supply that has the connections
you need to hook up this graphics card I
suggest you buy a new power supply
before trying to run the card that would
just be my little suggestion there and
then of course we have the graphics card
itself which is pretty damn sweet
Wow look how thick that is okay so let's
just make some room here and there it is
right there in all of its glory now
we're going to say that the aesthetics
of this card are pretty much the same as
they've been over the last several years
ever since they kind of redesigned their
whole dragon gaming theme and kind of
we'll talk about that a little bit in
the end of the video but it's got all
the same stuff that you would expect but
look at this they actually added a DVI
connector back to it as you guys know
what the founders edition card Nvidia
chose to remove the DVI port in lieu of
getting better airflow with an open vent
well obviously since these are not
blower style cards that isn't really a
concern so they put the DVI back on the
card you get the same twin frozer ball
bearing fans on there that we've seen
again over the last couple generations
of cards a dual eight pin PCI Express
power delivery and of course a nice
matte backplate not a whole lot to talk
about the aesthetics of the card nothing
has really changed obviously what we
care about is performance don't fall
over it doesn't want to like stand up
really like if you barely touch it so
that one's probably not going to be in
the display shelf yeah
let's go look it up
you
all right after spending several hours
playing around with the GTX 1080p I
gaming X 11g from MSI it's really no
surprise and the fact that it's faster
than a founders card that's because it's
not slowing down GPU boost is able to
keep the card running as fast as
possible because of its improved cooling
design it's quite a bit faster than a
Titan X and absolutely smashes a gtx
1088 it really is interesting to see a
card that cost the exact same price of
what a GTX 1080 costs only a month and a
half ago running almost 40% faster yeah
we were seeing anywhere between 30 and
35% speed increase from the 1080 to the
1080 Ti but the extra speed because of
the better cooling and GPU boost allowed
us to get about 40% speed improvement in
average FPS over a GTX 1080 yeah it's
the same price as what a 1080 was that's
the crazy part but as expected it is
faster than a Titan X Pascal and faster
than a 1080i sounders edition card and
they probably will end up making water
blocks for these too if you want to take
it even farther because most companies
have now started supporting over the
last couple years the custom PCBs the
gaming X that the 1080 did have a block
I have no reason to believe one wouldn't
come out for this guy now in terms of
temperatures though we talked about that
for a second here stocks and profile all
stock settings I didn't touch anything
on this card whatsoever I just put it
into the OC mode and that it ran about
nineteen hundred and thirty six
megahertz on the core until it reaches
the max temperature I saw of 72 C then
it slows down to about 1836 which is
still faster than the OC profile shows
on this so GPU boost is clearly working
and taking advantage of all the heat
pipes the massive heatsink and that ball
bearing fans and yeah that's where we
were getting the increase over the other
cards even though we're seeing about the
same speed the 1080 TI founders and
Titan X Pascal was getting because of
the improved GPU boost it's not
fluctuating all over the place it's not
speeding up the slowing down and it was
very constant usually only going up and
down a while about one tick or one step
over the course of the benchmarking
sessions now the max temperature I saw
of 72 C that was while running 4k game
gaming in wildlands which is extremely
demanding especially with the ultra
preset which I use it brings most cards
to its knees even this guy in 4k if you
take the settings down from ultra to
about high or very high then you can get
60fps and 4k no problem with a single
card in terms of build quality though it
feels very very robust it doesn't flex
they actually are using perimeter screws
around the entire back plate so it is
sandwiched together it's not just the
four main screws right here for the core
holding on the heatsink and then it
flexes all over the place which some
cards have been like that in the past
this is extremely rigid due to the
backplate design it's got a front plate
on the front touching all of the VRMs
and all of the RAM chips allowing you to
keep things nice and cool I can see
thermal pads all over the place in there
so yeah this card clearly has top-notch
build quality in mind which should for
750 bucks but let's go ahead and let's
go ahead and do this here I feel like
MSI missed an opportunity to kind of
redesign this cooler I know they really
like this design some companies with the
launch of the 1080 Ti have taken the
opportunity to sort of do a little
revamping with their cooler design in
terms of aesthetics I think to try and
reach more buyers I've said it before
and I'm going to say it again this card
with the red shroud is only going to be
appealing to people who want to buy a
red card for a red themed build and
what's even funnier is in fact yet RGB
lighting underneath red lenses you'll
call a little translucent look pieces of
plastic are red why are you putting RGB
under that this is what the card looks
like on my test bench as it sits right
now with the red shroud obviously with
my purple fluid and even with the RGB
Ram on there it's a bit of a color clash
so obviously this won't be staying on my
test bench because it just doesn't meet
the aesthetic I spent time putting into
this test rig but what if the shroud was
black this is what it would look like
then I can choose what color I want to
be based on the RGB lighting which is
exactly how it should be this would stay
on my test bench this won't so it's
going to a little experiment here to
prove to msi that i'm not crazy in the
description of this video you'll find a
link to a straw poll and the question
there is whether or not you would pass
on a particular card that you know
performs fantastic like this one here
simply because the only color available
it's a color that
just with your aesthetic theme you're
doing with your build I don't think I'm
crazy in feeling like people who would
spend $750 on graphics cards are going
to care about the overall appearance of
their system most of the time those are
the people that would not be caught dead
but ketchup the mustard cables they
might even have custom sleeve cables
they care about motherboard aesthetics
lighting all that sort of stuff and
something like this isn't going to
necessarily fit in your theme anyway
guys I don't think I'm crazy participate
down in the straw poll down there I'm
really curious as to what the majority
has to say anyway guys time to go thanks
for watching let me know what you guys
think about this card let me know what
other cards you want me to take a look
at I've got more custom PCBs coming in
here so this is a pretty exciting time
for top-tier gaming because this is
destroying games the 1080i is extremely
powerful anyway time to go guys next
week
I'm going to be delivering Terry Crews
his PC that's going to be really
exciting and yes of course I'm going to
be videoing that I've got a whole like
production happening with this and I've
got a lot to get done so I had to go
thanks for watching guys and as always
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
