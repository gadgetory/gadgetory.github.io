the debate a million times online high
refresh rate monitors don't matter you
can't see a difference and then of
course she had the other side were those
people that are like it makes a huge
difference I kind of find myself on that
side of the fence
well recently viewsonic reached out and
said hey we've got a new XG panel
specifically the XG 2 for 0-2 we'd love
you to check it out but what would you
do with it and I basically replied and I
said you know what I want to see whether
or not a 144 Hertz high refresh rate low
response time panel can make me a better
gamer so we're gonna find out today do
you want to be cooler do you want to be
more desirable you know what guys I got
new merch it's available now karma calm
/jc sense we got zip up hoodies we got
tribe blend we got a new logo I digress
since 2012 but the rest logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys
live it up we all kinda stuff
zip up hoodies beanies polos don't take
my word for it cuz obviously I can't do
this edie so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks
this also kind of brings us into another
debate that happens a lot and whether or
not you need super high end graphics
cards for 1080p panels so my answer has
always been if you're gonna be running a
high refresh rate panel like the XG here
then you definitely want more graphics
card because of the high frame rates now
this is a 144 Hertz one millisecond
panel so what that means is it can
refresh itself 144 times per second it
is a free sinc panel so of course it is
going to give you altra smooth frame
rates at if you're running an AMD
graphics card and the one millisecond
response time is the amount of time it
takes for the light to actually go Grady
gray or light up and turn off again so
that means very fast non ghosting which
is great for gaming now because it's a
1080p panel it makes it more affordable
for people to be able to check out and
get involved in high refresh rate gaming
back in the day high refresh rate panels
were extremely expensive they were a
commodity and as things have kind of
moved forward with high pixel density or
you know 4k 1440 ultra wide is kind of
been a thing lately 1080p high refresh
rate gaming panels to become more
than ever so that makes this more
relevant to people who may not even have
an AMD graphics card to take advantage
of freesync now this is a 1920 by 1080
obviously for the 1080p or Full HD it's
a 24 inch diagonal viewable which is
kind of like the sweet spot most people
enjoy a 24 inch panel and that one
millisecond response time and the 144
Hertz is just kind of like that's that's
the meat and potatoes it's it's this
it's the go-to specs for eSports and
stuff like that so that's why when you
see eSports or csgo which is the game
I'm going to be testing by the way for
this I've not really done much with csgo
in a while so the way I'm gonna kind of
do this test here today is I am going to
go into a custom csgo match with bots on
expert actually not hard but expert and
I am going to lock the framerate at
60fps and I'm gonna play around our few
rounds and we're gonna kind of just sort
of unscientifically see whether or not
you know what my baseline is then we are
going to engage the 144 Hertz freesync
option where you're going to smooth out
that framerate and get higher refresh
rate and see if my gaming experience
improves now I'm one of those people who
finds myself fairly sensitive to high
refresh rate I don't personally like 60
FPS panels as soon as I experienced high
refresh rate for the first time I was
hooked and it was something that I just
I couldn't go back 60 Hertz panels was
not an option for me now it's going take
a look at the build quality here you can
see on the back it's black and red it's
very simple I mean the the color faces
away from you so it's not gonna be in
your face but still it's got that we'll
call us a gamer racing stripes when you
see colors like that the base is plastic
but it's got a nice faux brushed finish
so this is not going to be you know
terrible with scratching the piano
finishes get fingerprints and dust and
scratching everywhere this is going to
look good on your desk it has a swivel
base it does have a vertical height
adjustment as well as a tilt it has USB
3.0 pass-through HDMI 1.4 DisplayPort it
even has
built-in so this is also a great panel
for things like land parties it is
lightweight I mean you can see how I can
carry this around with one hand no
problem lightweight and it has other
functions in there like blue light
filter it's also got anti flicker and
it's got twenty two levels of backlight
stabilization which will actually lift
the dark scenes in games to make you
more competitive so you know enemies
can't hide in the dark and then pop out
and kill you which would even happen it
happened to me if I had a floodlight on
them because I'm so bad at games like
csgo but it's got a lot of features in
there that you can adjust to make your
gaming experiencing you know a lot
better for you and give you an edge over
the competition but we're gonna see
whether or not it can give me an edge
because trust me when I say I suck all
right so it's 170 degree horizontal
viewing angle and 160 degree on the tilt
now the menus are controlled by these
buttons underneath the edge right here
you've got a bunch of different options
you have this is where you can control
the blue light filter you can also
adjust the audio in fact I want to turn
the audio all the way up let's see in
viewing mode you've got your standard
movie webtext Mac and mono that's
interesting input selects display let's
play with the color temperature a little
bit here that's set to native so you can
even do full color control if you want
in there blueish cool srgb a lot of
different functions in here so let's go
to the gaming settings because that's
obvious that we care about game settings
so in the gamer settings you've got
rampage response we've got your monitor
Hertz cap right now it's set to 144
we're gonna actually control the refresh
rate in Windows and a resolution black
stabilization now this is where you can
go in there and adjust the black levels
to bring up the dark scenes I'm gonna
put it don't leave it at 10 that's fine
advanced DCR brightness color adjusts
blue light filter view scale so you can
actually change the aspect ratio that's
kind of crazy right there
rename you can rename that setting and
then reset so if we go back over here we
want to go to AMD freesync and we're
gonna go ahead and turn that on boom
it's rebooting itself free sync is going
to be on so first impressions the sound
is actually not terrible for 2 watt
built-in speakers okay
so we've got double buffered VC going
right now it's locked at 60 Hertz as you
can see right there which is exactly
what once let's go play let's go and now
the reason why we're doing BOTS on this
is because I want any more controlled
experience if I go into you know public
matchmaking then we get a very random
experience so we are going to go ahead
and just do this the best we can with
bots so I'm gonna set these bots to
expert you can see by my rank right
there I do not play very often so
there's that god 60 Hertz just hurts to
look at ah get it does it joke there
it's all in the jukes man it's a hug the
Jukes
it's all on the Jukes baby
people are gonna argue with me but I
swear 60 FPS is I can't do it I played
battlefield I played every shooter game
as long as anything above 60 Hertz has
been available I've been playing it now
and going back to 60 to me is like
watching it through like a strobe light
like a flicker show and anyone who's
ever experienced high refresh rate
monitor knows exactly what I'm talking
about man I've liked painting him I'm
tracing around him ah pinched not bought
Kyle and pretend us do it yeah got him
okay so that was ten rounds I killed
seven assisted with four died eight we
got to see now if I could do any better
than that by upping the frame rate now
the only change made to the game is
vertical sync is disabled because we
have free sync handling it for us we
ready the exact same thing here
practice with BOTS casual expert BOTS is
still there and dust2
once again okay so 144 Hertz is enabled
in the desktop we've got free sync
enabled in the Radeon software and we
have of course got vsync disabled in the
games as you can see we are getting a
significant amount of FPS but the
smoothness right now and that's so much
smoother alright I feel so much more
comfortable now got him don't go
anywhere I'm trying to kill you and now
to be fair you can't call this a warm-up
either like I was warming up I played
before we started the video so I could
be warm already I think we're gonna try
up
eleven and five in a district first
place baby we got two more rounds the
bots are suddenly doing good so some
might say like wait a minute
you didn't use the up in the first round
but I didn't feel comfortable using the
up in the first round because I was
having some serious aiming issues we
just ended round number ten thirteen
kills two assists six death thirty score
now I know that this doesn't necessarily
prove anything
but what happened here was the high
refresh rate panel made me way more
comfortable and way more confident in my
ability and that's something I've always
tried to explain to people on what high
refresh rate panels really do even
though you may not be able to look at
the screen and count the FPS and be able
to say oh yeah that's a hundred FPS or
that's six here that's 150 or 275 in
this case what it does is allows you to
perceive an extremely smooth gaming
experience and that's why I will always
praise high refresh rate panels now the
viewsonic XG 2 for 0-2 comes in at under
$300 in fact I think I saw it advertised
around the two hundred and seventy
dollar price point on their website so
please do me a favor go down in the
description below click on the link it
will take you to the product page for
this panel and you can see all of the
specs all of the details as well as what
the MSRP pricing is on this this is
something that just a couple of years
ago would have costs significantly more
than what you're paying for this the
fact that it's got AMD freesync one
millisecond response time 144 Hertz 24
inch diagonal USB 3.0 pass-through to
HDMI 1.4 DisplayPort I mean the list
goes on and on so guys please do me a
favor go down description below learn
more about this panel and a huge thank
you to viewsonic for sponsoring today's
video and that doesn't even matter
because I already proved that I got
better with a high refresh rate so sound
off in the comments below if you can
feel the difference with high refresh
rate what games do you play and where do
you notice it most personally shooters
are where I think it definitely excels
but it works in all games obviously
thanks for watching guys and as always
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
