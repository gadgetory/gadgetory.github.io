James $0.02 here and if I sound a little
raspy er than normal
well that's because J's got bronchitis
again it's like CES all over again but
dammit I wasn't gonna let that stop me
from bringing you these videos because
I'm just that dedicated now obviously
all the buzz in the PC realm right now
is the fact that haswell-e and intel's
first eight core 16 thread processor has
been launched and I actually have it
right here
drove all the way down to Micro Center
to pick this bad boy up we did a vlog on
that hopefully you guys watched it
because uh you know coconut monkey and I
we we like to get into little
shenanigans but anyway I get a lot of
questions now people saying what are you
gonna be putting in for a motherboard
well guys I was actually so impressed
with the z97 classified from EVGA we are
going to stick with the classified
series and we're going with the
classified x99 in skunkworks now I know
some of you are already like really
really J you're upgrading to X 99 from
z97 what the hell man you just built
that I know I know I just built it but
you got to look at it from my
perspective I play very little games and
I do an awful lot of content creation to
an awful lot of rendering my computer
spends more time rendering than doing
anything else
so any time that I can save by throwing
more horsepower at it is a benefit to me
all right so we're not going to really
do a full review of this motherboard in
this video we're going to more or less
do an unboxing and see what the x99
classified looks like what it has
instead of in terms of features and
we'll do a full overclocking review of
both the eight core and then the feature
set of the x99 classified from EVGA in a
later video once the system is it's
finished being put together and whatnot
so I actually don't have a knife and
this thing is sealed up
I'm very unprepared look at that a knife
out of nowhere that's so cool
anyway well go ahead and cut this this
beast open I just cut the box instead of
the tape
uh anything you guys might get some good
lulz and fails out of this because well
I guess that I'm sick actually before we
open that up let's just it's pretty much
like very similar to the feature set of
what's on the z97 classified you got
your onboard CPU temperature monitoring
which means the trouble code readout
turns into a stem temperature gauge
while the system is actually booted to
have ebj Ely ex tuning utility this is
like they're overclocking utility now
I'm not really a fan of those and I did
like the AI tuning from Asus so we will
give this thing a shot and see how it
does just to you know I'm curious to see
how well it does if you guys hear a
barking dog my dog is actually an AMD
fan so he might be sabotaging this video
a little bit I'm sorry all the chip sets
feature passive cooling on there no fans
or anything like that would you know
they kind of ditch that a long time ago
EVGA easy voltage easy reading voltage
levels of dedicated Reed points that's
the little the little harness that plugs
in has all the pigtails on there you can
stick your voltage meters in get real
voltage readings and not trust software
you can't trust software voltage in most
cases triple BIOS support once again
there's three BIOS on this so it's very
very difficult to actually brick this
thing PCIe disable switch which is kind
of nice if you have multiple graphics
cards which we're going to be doing in
this system three GTX 780 s actually if
you wanted to individually test cards
maybe to see if a card is failing or do
individual overclocking per card you can
actually move the switches on the PCI
lanes or PCIe lanes and only activate
the card that you want active and then
when you're done you can activate them
all so that's kind of nice it's also
nice for a test bench if you want to put
three different graphics cards in there
maybe do bench testing between the three
you can switch between them you know
between Reap between reboots and then
you can much quick more quickly actually
get through those graphics cards 100%
solid state capacitors that's nice
that's kind of the norm now so it's not
really a huge selling point anymore
one hundred and fifty percent more gold
content in the CPU socket itself and a
10 phase PWM for clean power delivery
now what this thing does kind of lack
unfortunately is any real like fan
control software the z97 is the same way
EVGA doesn't hasn't really invested much
in terms of the software for fan control
or fan suite I think that's a big deal
I'd really like to see EVGA start
incorporating some sort of fan control
into their motherboards because I think
that's where there's going to start
being a bigger gap between ebj and other
menu board motherboard manufacturers is
they're the only brand that really
doesn't offer you a a fan tuning suite
and that's a big deal in my opinion and
the only header that actually gives you
full tuning control in terms of
temperature is the CPU - header where
the CPU one and and whatnot or PWM
control only so I'd like to see full DC
and PWM control on all headers which I
think would then make this compete with
a lot of the other brands that are
already on the market that's just my
opinion that's what I look for in
motherboards unfortunately this doesn't
have it but I run very slow speed fans
anyway so it's not the system's not too
noisy now it does support up to 128
gigabytes of gddr5 x99 does use G ddr4
and it's a 2667 megahertz + OC on the
RAM of the 2667 megahertz plus I don't I
guess that means this thing may not be
supporting 3000 out of the box I know
there's an updated BIOS for this thing
already which supports you know 2800 and
up I don't know where the up stops at
like Kingston HyperX already has 3000
megahertz DIMM modules out 4g ddr4 I
don't know if those are compatible with
this but EVGA over time will continue to
do memory validation obviously when
you're an early adopter on a brand new
platform you may run into some
compatibility issues which already
anticipating may happen in this build
now moving on to more of the key
features we do have you know onboard
power reset and all that stuff
EVGA Ely Dex tuning Lombardi said triple
BIOS the box on here actually says 300%
increased gold content it's actually a
hundred fifty percent that was a
misprint on there it does have two times
eight pin CPU power so if you were doing
extreme like ln2 overclocking or
whatever you have very clean power
delivery on there and then it does also
have 2m - both type 2 and type 3 sockets
on here one is located right here
actually we'll look at it on the board
but one is on the right above the sound
sound card portion of the board and then
the other one is actually in between the
graphics cards it's 8 layer PCB very
durable etc etc now this is a 2011 but
it's a 2011 b3
socket sorry that's very annoying sound
and what that means is all of your old
2011 CPUs are not going to fit on this
board the notches in the pin layout is
actually slightly different now one of
the things I really do like about the
EVGA boards is the amount of accessories
they actually give you with this I don't
really understand though why they split
out there they're manual into two books
part 1 and part 2 I maybe I should just
do one book I don't know they're both
English so I don't I don't get that but
whatever so here is your four-way SLI
bridge because this does natively
support four-way SLI
on the chipset or excuse me on the
socket PCIe lanes if you are going with
the 8 core and I believe the 59 30k also
natively supports 4 way I could be wrong
it's still really new and I'm not
entirely sure so if I'm wrong go ahead
and feel free to correct me down in the
comments we have a 3-way PCI bridge and
of course you have your normal or SLI
bridge of course you have a normal SLI
all the normal accessories like it came
with the z97 the cover for the IO IO
shield your readouts black SATA cables
and you know lots and lots of
accessories I mean look at all these
accessories to give you accessory 43.0
iOS you SLI temperature probes I mean
you've got they give you so much stuff
that's what's so cool and lots and lots
of SATA cables alright now let's go
ahead and talk about the motherboard
itself because after all this is the
beauty and the whole reason we're here
today now this is the EVGA classified
x99 in it pretty much comes with all the
classified features you'd come to expect
from EVGA 2011 socket like I mentioned
v3 it's got eight DIMM slots on here so
for a quad channel up to 128 gigabytes
of gddr5 one two three four five PCI
Express now that also gives you a true 2
x 16 X or as well a 4 x you know 8 X
through PCI 3.0 depending on your
configuration on here and you do get one
PCIe 4x right there
auxiliary 6 pin power slot on the bottom
for your PCI Express Lanes if you're
going with like 4 Way SLI high draw
cards you want to be able to keep the
power
current on their here's your MDOT to
slot right there here's another MDOT two
right here got really attractive heat
sinks on here I really like the way that
these look like the gunmetal look right
here it's got x99 it looks fantastic got
the same 90-degree 24 pin our 25 plus 4
pin right here you've got 2 4 6 8 10
SATA what I like on here is that the
SATA is actually marked you can see
which SATA is actually what on here
makes it much easier to actually figure
out you know where things should be
getting plugged in fan headers all
around the motherboard here's all your
PCI Express dip switches I mentioned
right there
turbo button I'm not sure exactly what
turbo button does we'll figure that one
out clear CMOS on the front also a clear
CMOS on the back you get 2 4 6 PCI
Express 2.0 2 for PCI Express 3.0 on the
back a dual Intel Ethernet NIC card
right here and a 7.1 surround audio on
the back all the solid caps have already
talked about
I wish the caps were black and they
weren't this kind of a blaring silver
color but anyway I digress now let's go
ahead and talk about the elephant in the
room and how many of you guys can
actually point out the elephant in the
room and please don't say Jay I mean
that's a given that to me would be this
guy right here
now the z97 classified was the most
beautiful motherboard EVGA has ever made
and do you know what made it the most
beautiful motherboard ooh they ever made
the crowd said give us an option that
doesn't include red and they did and it
was glorious and it's in skunk works and
then the x99 they said screw you were
putting red back on everything so they
put the red e right here
so what does that mean for me well it
actually adds more work for me to either
make this a gunmetal color or black or
yellow or whatever I'm going to do with
it and these are like aluminum or
aluminium or wherever you are
inserts on here that are sub matte
they're sub terrain dunno what you would
call it they're actually below the
surface of the top of the heatsink so I
came and get like a needle down in there
to try and pry them up and even if I did
I'm afraid they might Bend because one
they're aluminum and two they are
adhesive down and they're adhesive with
something that's going to be anti heat
it's gonna be anti heat resistant
because they would come to laminate
it as the heatsink heats up so I have no
idea how I'm going to get them out to
paint them or what I'm going to do but
what really upsets me is the fact that
they put on the for the win edition
motherboard a gray II the gray II would
have gone perfect on this motherboard
and I'm unfortunately going to dock EVGA
a ton of style points for this because
this I think is going to create a little
bit of a public outcry that's my opinion
on that when it comes to the PCI Express
3.0 I find it kind of interesting that
the 3.0 on the bottom here points
straight down but the 2.0 next to it
points up so you have kind of a funky
arrangement of cables there this kind of
looks like an afterthought to me like
maybe they should have made the 2.0 also
point down or make the 3.0 point up at
least make a match because that would
make it difficult to actually get clean
wiring well guys this has been just kind
of an unboxing and overview here of the
brand new EBG a x99 classified and when
I'm done with this video I'm actually
going to move right on in to doing my
swap in my system and adding my third my
third 780 that's actually right here in
all of its beautiful glory the third guy
right here with ek waterblock three of
those bad boys on there is just going to
look awesome alright well I'm going to
get off this camera now we're going to
start this build first things first I
figure out what the heck I'm gonna do
with that
after I bench test this thing to make
sure that it's not dead on a rival
because it is dead on arrival well then
my entire project at the moment will be
dead on arrival
alright guys meghanadha out here it's
jays two cents follow on twitter if you
guys would like to interact with me and
i'm very active on twitter it's kind of
where I'm at I like 140 character limit
short messages are good
but with that said guys I'm gonna go
ahead and get the heck on out of here
as always hope to see you in the next
one we got smoked sausage if you like
this folks
okay know me I like how all the same
look like stretching a tray just like a
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
