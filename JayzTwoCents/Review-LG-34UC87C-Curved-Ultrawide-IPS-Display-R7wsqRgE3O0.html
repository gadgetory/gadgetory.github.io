we took a look earlier this year at some
LG ultra wide monitors that were debuted
or are these kind of teased at CES and
we took a look at the 34 um 67 we took a
look at the 34
you see 97 which was a curved 34 inch
IPS display but there was a lot of
complaints that people had about that
particular panel the 34 40 by 1440p
curved display and uh LG actually
listened up and made some changes so
we're gonna be taking a look today at
the 34 you see 87 C which exists purely
because of consumer feedback did what
it's so oh you really think so what is
the white thing well she says it gets
the job done - ah that's mom the fractal
design node - OH - it's not about how
big it is but all about how you use it
so let's start by kind of going over
some of the features at the UC 97 had or
the 34 UC 97 had which was a great
monitor don't get me wrong
but there was a lot of things that
people didn't like about it which kind
of hurt at sales and hurt some of its
adoption rate
first things first a lot of people
didn't really care for the gold color I
don't know it was more or less Apple s
if you will it didn't a lot of people
didn't like the way it looked in their
home offices or their businesses or even
their gaming setup so a lot of people
skipped it over simply because of the
aesthetics of it another thing people
complained about was the stand it didn't
have any height adjustment on it
whatsoever it was mounted in one
position and that was it it looked
really nice it was made out of metal and
felt like a polished chromed metal
looked really really slick but it had no
adjustment and that really didn't work
out very well for a lot of people I mean
it's a 34 inch monitor you might need to
raise it or lower it depending on your
setup so they've gone ahead on this
model and kind of revamped that but
probably the most common complaint was
it was just too damn expensive at well
over a thousand
it had things that made it worth $1,000
though it was an IPS panel it was a 34
40 by 1440 p21 by 9 curved panel very
high quality IPS panel people just
didn't want some of the features that
were in there for instance the
Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt pass-through
and so they just really requested the LG
make a more affordable model now that's
exactly what we're looking at here in
the 34 you see 87 see but it maintains
its qHD 34 40 by 1440p pixel pixel
resolution and the fact that is still an
IPS panel now they also got away from
the gold color and went to a nice matte
black looks very very slick and also a
very nice gunmetal gray all metal
construction stand which is height
adjustable that is very very important
now one of the things that I don't think
a lot of people complained about because
not many people use monitor mounts but I
personally had a complaint about was
their implementation of how the VESA
mount or base amount worked on the UC 97
where you had to kind of use an adapter
thing and then an adapter plate and then
mount it on and it stuck it real far out
it was one of the reasons why I never
implemented it in my skunkworks
panel setup even though it was an IPS
panel and would have been perfect for
content creation like I do but the UC 87
actually has a 100 by 100 base amount on
the back of the panel which is perfect
so you don't have any additional
adapters or anything that you have to
stick on there so that was a really nice
implementation to see now one of the
things to that's really nice about 21 by
9 monitor aspect ratio is a lot of
developers are now implementing this
into their games where you're no longer
getting the black bars on the side for
it being kind of a weird one-off
resolution it's a much more widely
adopted resolution now which is why I'm
considering moving this panel over to
skunk works and getting rid of my 4
panel array and just going with one or
two of these guys I would get more space
lit back on my desk especially if I
stacked two of these on top of each
other and would gain IPS the only
downside is because it's IPs we still
have very low refresh rates at 60 Hertz
now I know I
that very low but when I've been running
144 Hertz panels for over a year now 60
Hertz does seem very slow and choppy at
least until you get used to it again not
to mention it will alleviate some
temperature in the room I won't have as
many power plugs or power bricks going
the monitors put off heat themselves and
this room does get very hot in the
summer I haven't decided yet
if I'm going to implement this as a
standalone monitor it's definitely going
up top for my rig to have an IPS editing
monitor because well you know IPS is the
color accuracy of IPS is as close as you
can get to real life and that's what's
important but it's also important to
realize that IPS while gaming is gonna
make your color seem a little bit more
flat not as bright and poppy pop I think
that's the right term as TN panels but
the off viewing angles are going to be
perfect the curved panel of this gives
you a nice kind of immersion where you
don't have any of the skewing that you
get with a flat panel especially
something 34 inches you know in diagonal
measurement and I think that the gaming
aspect of 21 by 9 is really starting to
become something that is widely adopted
and you can do it now without any sort
of downsides now there are quite a few
picture modes in this thing and one of
them is gaming mode which is supposed to
help with the saturation but I think the
game mode on an IPS panel looks worse
than TN it just doesn't look very good
at all so I would just leave it on photo
mode which tends to give a little bit
more set just a little bit more
saturation but still keeps a lot of IPs
color calibration in there now I did
notice that all the settings from this
panel came on custom settings so I have
a feeling this one might have been pre
calibrated before it was sent to me I
don't know if they actually come pre
calibrated or not since this is a review
sample it might have been professionally
calibrated but I can tell you that
everything looks really good on this
panel especially to open up photos and
stuff and video editing I really do
think this is gonna make its way over to
my system at least on the top panel so I
can have my preview and stuff up there
but I think 21 by 9 curved panels are
definitely something to consider both
for gaming productivity and just
all-around awesome panel
take a look at so guys this has been the
34 UC 87 C from LG definitely nice to
see this panel considering it exists
because of community feedback and we
like to see when companies make changes
that are directly related to what the
customers are saying so a good job on
that one
LG anyway guys I'm gonna get on out of
here thanks for checking out today's
video if you didn't see the original
video of the 34 UC 97 look in the
description you guys will see a link to
that video and you'll be able to kind of
compare the two side-by-side and you'll
see a little more of what I was talking
about with the changes they made here
versus the UC 97 and even though this
one's a lot cheaper at a time of filming
right now at $899 yeah it's very
expensive still but I think that this is
actually a better panel for a guy like
me than a lot of the functions on the
more expensive panel like the 97 so
anyway guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
