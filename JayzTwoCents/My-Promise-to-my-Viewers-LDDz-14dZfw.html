it's kind of wanted to end 2017 what
they've I don't know a little look back
at how this year has been because this
has been one of the biggest most pivotal
and most challenging years that I have
experienced in the last 5 years that I
had been running this channel I just
want to talk to you guys about what 2017
has been like where I want to go with
2018 because 2017 has been although one
of the biggest growth years for the
channel it's also been one of the
hardest years to get through and I just
want to sit down and talk with you guys
and end this year right and get 27 2001
to 2017 again and get 2018 started with
a with a hell of a bang and just see
where the hell we can take this thing
let's go and start with some of the
obvious things that happen in 2017 I
mean obviously we hit a million
subscribers on this channel we're now at
almost 1.3 million I never thought a
million was possible that this that was
the furthest thing from my mind I looked
at channels that had a million
subscribers and that number was just
mind-blowing a hundred thousand
subscribers was just mind-blowing it was
kind in my mind it was kind of like who
the hell would want to watch a guy like
me you know a guy in his 30s a lot of
gray hair overweight talk about computer
parts because to me I mean that just
seemed like the most really kind of a
sad thing right I mean who gets on the
internet and talks about computers for a
living I mean obviously a lot of us do
but that's what my mindset was when I
started this channel I was so ignorant
to how YouTube worked but obviously
that's all changed I mean this has
turned into a full-time career it's
turned in a full time company I have
employees now I mean it's one of those
things where it's just like I know I I
know what to say because it's it's
turning in such a weird thing so this
year obviously we moved into a new
studio which was both a positive and a
negative depending on who you ask
because I mean it was a bit of a growing
pain a lot of you guys missed the the
feel of the bedroom set the whole you
know I guess a lot of you related to
that right you've got your own little
home setups or home offices whatever
your man caves and he kind of felt more
connected to that and we moved into the
studio we were kind of lost I had never
had a studio before but I needed the
separation of home and
in order to make this much more sane for
me to be able to get through the day
because there's a lot of stress as you
can imagine building a living and a
business on the internet and the
feedback of the Internet but we were
kind of lost as to our design focus I
think we tried to be something we
weren't we weren't we weren't this this
real crispy team crispy out Jonathan
NOSSA I love those guys
I think I tried too hard to be like them
because that that's just not me that's
not my personality I'm very rough around
the edges I'm not I'm not clean-cut if
you I'm always scruffy so I think the
channel needs to be scruffy too when the
death of my father happened which was
the hardest thing I dealt with this year
a complete reset happen both mentally
physically the business the studio we
kind of changed the way everything ran
around here you know and I got tired of
of trying to be something I wasn't so
that's why we went back to this shop
field that's why this desk is a mess
right now I'm obviously working on this
build
and so that hard reset had to happen
something else that happened this year
as I brought on employees things I had
no idea I would ever do something I
never wanted to do because I didn't want
the the unstable foundation of the
Internet to be what people relied on for
their income besides myself I can handle
myself I can when things go bad I can
handle that and I can be a I have I have
agility and I can move with the moving
landscape than the ever-changing terrain
but I don't want other people to be
relying on my moves because then every
move I made I started the second-guess
and I don't think that was the right
thing to do I think I needed have more
confidence as I moved forward because
obviously what we're doing around here
is working the channel continues to grow
we bring on new viewers new subscribers
new projects that keep getting bigger
and bigger right we've got celebrity
builds we've been working on new ones
coming up and obviously indeed have more
confidence than that but we we have
three employees technically four
employees now obviously there's me and
we've you guys know Nick coconut monkeys
been working the camera and doing a lot
of behind the scenes stuff I still do
all the editing but he's been doing most
of the camera work we also have Brian a
lot of you guys haven't actually seen
Brian officially introduced Brian come
here he actually just came in here Brian
if you guys remember I did a video where
I surprised my friend who's been working
on a
there there his head's not really that
big he's closer to the camera and it
kind of looks like there you go Brian
he's been instrumental in all of this he
was the behind-the-scenes guy always
talked too long before I started the
channel trying to figure out what I
wanted to do he's sort of been like a
life coach for me but he also has a
charter school for foster youth that
he's been working on for the last like
six years and I built a computer for him
we presented it to him and you guys saw
that video one of my most liked videos
to date but I brought him on I mean made
sense he's he's a brand manager he helps
me with integrations he sorted my
firewall he talks to people trying to
get to me and vice versa to allow me to
get back to making these videos because
I was spending so much time on the
communications side of things that I
kept falling behind on the video
creation so that's why you guys have a
lot of you guys have commented the
videos had been amazing the last few
months well that's because Brian came on
board allowed me to do what it is I do
best
something else had also happened this
year is I put my mom on payroll
and after the death of my father things
got hard for her and I'm in a position
to where I'm able to actually employ her
and that has been probably I think one
of the biggest achievements of my
channel so far is that not only am I
been able to give stability for my
family I'm able to give stability for
other families and stability for a
parent so that has been this has been a
crazy year and moving forward to 2018
here's my promise to you guys I want to
do more projects reviews and stuff for
fun reviews are always going to be a
part of the channel but projects are
what I want to do these builds more
builds build builds builds you guys love
seeing builds but I'm gonna mix it up
with more beginner stuff as well because
I underestimate the amount of people
watching this channel who have never
built a computer who have not who've
never touched hardware components
they're considering coming over from
console or they're just getting into age
be interested in this stuff and they're
watching these channels to get courage
and information to be able to do that
for themselves so I just put out that
CPU video how to install CPU there's a
lot of weird comments or a lot of
pushback like why are you doing this
this is not this is this isn't your
audience Jay you're right I'm reaching a
new audience with videos like that and
that's the whole point of that and the
people who are already watching to give
them confidence on how to do that stuff
any resource to go to on how to do that
there's actually gonna be some more
celebrity builds coming in 2018 also one
of the cool things about being a
verification
Twitter user but that little check mark
as I get a new column called verified
and I can see all the interactions with
other verified people and when someone
that's verified follows me it tells me
so I know what celebrities out there are
following and lurking on this channel so
I kind of have an idea of what's gonna
be happening in 2018 there's some really
cool stuff coming and I don't want to
call any of those names out but that
trust me 2018 is gonna be awesome we've
got CES coming in January Computex
coming in May who knows what 2018 is
gonna bring 2017 has been a crazy year
but I think it's I knew it was gonna be
crazy no good incorporating the business
moving into the studio bringing on
employees I didn't expect this year to
go as well as it did which gives me good
I guess a good idea of what 2018 can
bring and what I'm realizing here is
that anything with this channel is
possible I mean we survived ad pocalypse
we didn't have any issues with that we
survived the whole D monetization thing
without a single video being be
monetized so obviously we're doing
something right but anyway guys I just
want to do this video to kind of let you
guys know what's coming where we came
from and and just I guess have an end of
your chat that's it seems like a better
time than ever to do like kind of a
reset talking with you guys I need to
get this done obviously this this needs
to get done I got some more parts I have
to come because I can't seem to get the
orders right tonight and I was waiting
on an order for some fittings that came
and realized I ordered the wrong
fittings entirely so here we are back to
square one anyway guys I'm gonna go just
wanted to talk with you hope you guys
have a great New Year's and we'll see
you in 2018
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
