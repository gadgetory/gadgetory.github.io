you saw in my last video which is gonna
pop out here somewhere
maybe we updated the test bench with a
79 80 X II a processor that admittedly I
had not been using like the whole time
I've had it because of the insane amount
of power draw and my concern about it
being lesser performing for games when
the whole point of a test bench is to
test things like graphics cards and such
but if you want to know whether or not
that claim actually held true then go
and check out that video but what we're
gonna do today is I figured since I've
not really done much with this chip and
it's been out for a long time and
motherboards have been built and bios's
have been biases biases by I by OSS I
what ever since the BIOS has been
updated now and matured I thought we'd
see how well I can actually overclock
this chip obviously a disclaimer this
was sent by Intel and it's probably a
golden sample chip so your results are
definitely going to vary but I mean I'm
still gonna push this thing up bar might
even blow up EVGA offers a full range of
components including video cards
motherboards power supplies cases and
peripherals regardless of your needs
EVGA sure to have you covered to see
what EVGA can do for your next build
head to EVGA comm and the whole reason
I'm doing this is nothing more than just
being an enthusiast thing because I like
to overclock but we're gonna be checking
things out here with Cinebench see what
kind of scores we can get there and also
3d mark because I've got my 10 atti SC 2
on here from EVGA will be overclocking
that as well 32 gigs of Dominator
platinum and we've got a 1200 watt
Platinum power supply and a power meter
hooked up so we can see exactly how much
wattage is being drawn from the wall
with this setup do be fair I am NOT
exactly putting things into my favor
because I'm also running it through a
heavy duty extension cord which can
cause issues when you're pulling that
much power and also we have other things
plugged into the socket where this is
plugged into so yeah probably not the
best way to go about this but that's
never stopped me before what we need to
do obviously here is a base test so we
are running stock frequency stock
everything and we are drawing 90.9 watts
so we'll just call it 90 watts here from
the
at all stock settings and once we load
up Cinebench that will obviously rise
now this 18 core 36 thread CPU is like
185 watt TDP at stocks
I think 2.6 gigahertz but yeah obviously
we'll be pulling more than that you can
see 201 261 262 it's about 262 Watts
pretty steady right now with everything
factory and our Cinebench score is a
3383 you can tell by this little line
right there that that's no that's no
pleb that's a Xeon X 56 50 below it
which is a 12 quart or 24 thread CPU so
you can see obviously we blew that out
of the water and that's just what the
factory turbo 3.0 Intel stuff we should
also should run I think 3d mark so that
we can see what our where scores start
at my goal is to see if I can't get
myself on the top 100 again with a
single GPU probably not going to happen
because of all the Titan Voltas floating
around out there but I think we can I
think we can get pretty high so we're
gonna go with 3d mark firestrike because
everyone's kind of moved on to time spy
and time spy extreme and I'm hoping that
most people have just forgotten about
regular old lonely firestrike down here
dx11 test and I'm hoping that I can get
myself on the top 100 because all the
Titan volts is out there definitely
taken up that top spot and most of those
guys are running 79 80 X's as well but
research has told me that most of the
retail samples are having a hard time
hitting 4.0 and higher and I know for a
fact this chip can go farther than that
because I ran 4.4 in the last video
without even trying which I didn't even
realize was a golden sample until I did
research and realized huh well I guess I
guess until threw me a bone so let's see
where we benchmark and how far how far
higher up or we can go so a single 1080
TI running at stock speeds gave us a
graphic score of 28,000 159 a physics
score or physics physics score of 23,000
865 for a total score of 23,000 640 we
are faster than 98% of all results which
is entirely unacceptable that is not
acceptable
now I am running the EVGA X 299 dark
which is built specifically for this
task and that's why I'm doing this again
look at the vrm cooling alone actual
heatsink with a heat pipe fins active
cooled fans I mean that it's not just
passive cooled like so many motherboards
are a couple things you need to do
though and to keep in mind obviously you
need to have plenty of power supply this
will draw a lot of wattage as soon as
you start overclocking it and you need
to make sure that you are running both
eight pin power connectors on the CPU
and you need to make sure that your
power supply is rated high enough so I'm
actually running a 1200 watt Platinum
power supply it's the gigabyte one I
remember I don't know who there om is
for that and so far it's been so far so
good
cooling also is something you need to
over build I'm just running my standard
360 with ebo supremacy block
water-cooled admittedly this deserves
like at least a Peltier or lnto to get
anywhere near any sort of top ten list
or something like that but you should
also delete it things these are things I
haven't done so that's why I'm hoping to
see how far we can get today without
stacking things in my favour I've got an
extension cord I'm doing water cooling
with a standard block I am not deleted
and I'm not chilling it so I want to see
how far we can get so I'm running
Cinebench r15 here just to do some my
preliminary tests there is obviously a
much bigger gambit of testing look for
pure stability prime95 all that sort of
stuff we're not doing that today we are
just seeing where we can get in
Cinebench and then in three mark I also
like to bring up the task manager to see
if there's anything running in the
background like Windows Update downloads
for steam because those will all affect
your results so we're gonna go ahead and
run it now with a 4.4 and see how much
we gained on top of our stock run which
was a 33 83 expect us to be fully stable
temperatures jumped up into the 60s and
70s on the core still very good there
this is going to be a significantly
faster result so yeah we went from a 33
83 to a 43 47 so almost a thousand point
improvement by just changing a few
things in the BIOS what I'm also going
to show you real quick by doing another
run though it's just how much more
voltage or wattage it's using
so we're idling right now at 175 watts
from the wall if I run this CPU test
watch what's gonna happen now to the
Volt or the heating voltage the wattage
545 Watts let's just call it 55555 that
works too this is why you need to have a
clean power source and you need to have
good cooling and a very good power
supply to run this GPU or this CPU
whatever it is the thing that makes the
computer process stuff so I'm gonna run
4.5 right now 561 562 560 and our
temperatures went up into the 70s and
80s on the court so we definitely saw
obviously an improvement of performance
to a 44 38 4.6 so we have 579 watts
during that run a new score of 45 16 at
4.6 and our temperatures are sitting in
the upper 70s to low 80s we're still
good because member 1:05 it's where
we're gonna tell it to chill out so all
right I'll stop talking we'll just do
the death 4.7 here we go CPU voltage
goes up to 1.2 400 good temperatures are
still sitting in the 70s and 80s I can
deal with this new score 4580
I wish they'd really up the the
sensitivity of the mouse in the Box 4.8
almost positive over to up the voltage
here CPU into 2 we're gonna take the
adaptive and bump that up to like 75 so
now we'll be going up to almost 1.3
volts
I just want to get through the test
without it melting that's all I care
about 3d mark is not going to stress the
CPU scrunches Cinebench 4.8 gigahertz
and here we go
package is at 91 92 94 cores are still
in the 90s and 80s
nothing hit 100 I think we're good four
thousand seven hundred and sixteen on
that our max temperature was 97 C on the
package
do I dare go for four point nine four
point nine there it is right there four
point eight nine nine I hate that crap
watch what happens when
push the button it's plug in a crash
hole up there goes but the amazing part
is it crashes the application
application error more information
cannot be found it's like something
happened okay we have pumped in more
voltages I don't think it's gonna work
though holy Sh hard locks we hit 99c on
the package okay so maybe we need just a
little bit more bit more 188 100 200 300
500 for its start alone but look they're
hitting 105 yeah so we're gonna have to
call it at 4.8 because I can't go any
farther so obviously we're limited now
by cooling because I can't get more
cooling in here so we're back to four
point eight all the adds extra voltages
we adjusted I moved it back to where we
were stable now I'm gonna take my memory
from the XMP 3466 now I'm gonna bump
that up to like 3800 so in firestrike
normal you can see how much wattage we
were actually pulling during the test
run to do the cpu test this CPU test is
not like Cinebench it does not let me
look
we're pulling 440 watts 447 we're
getting a hundred FPS though huh CPU
test has been insane socket temps only
at 59 C and it's not pulling nearly as
much why just Cinebench so my score was
25,000 858 graphics core again in the
same 28,000 931 but 35,000 19 we went
for a 23,000 physics core to a 35 we've
picked up 12,000 with overclocking what
I want to point out at 4.8 we're still
sitting in the 60s and 50s as our max
temps so I'm think I might try 4.9 again
on this okay so we've got to get up to
twenty seven thousand seven hundred and
sixty-five I don't think that's going to
happen I honestly don't think that's
gonna happen so here's what we settled
on a Poseidon water-cooled because we've
seen good results with this card
it's 2088 on the core not the fastest I
have in here but the easiest one to get
installed at this time plus 550 on the
memory giving us 6100
Hertz times two so twelve thousand two
hundred megahertz of memory speed and we
are running 4.9 on the CPU we dropped
the memory down from 3,800 down to 3,600
we just need to make it through three
mark that's it we see make it through
one run just one Oh see what'd I tell
you I'm not gaining 3,000 points with
this overclock I'm gonna happen nope so
23,000 640 was way too low to make it on
to the top 100 but then we ended up
getting a twenty seven thousand eight
ninety nine which was good enough to get
us into that like right around the 97
nish marketing-wise or something like
that but then we didn't stop there
twenty-eight thousand 362 but I wasn't
done there cuz then I got four point
nine to work well enough to give me
twenty eight thousand seven hundred and
thirty-one where if we compare those
results online we are definitely in the
better than 99% of all results we moved
from right around here all the way up to
there and if we look at the Hall of Fame
which is what we care about because that
should have updated by now oh geez
there I am right there number 61 the
Canadian Jays two cents cuz we still
don't know exactly how that happened
when I was here with Ken kingpin that's
okay my father was from Quebec a but
that's besides the point I was well off
the bottom of the chart I wanted to be
back on the chart and Here I am now at
number 61 it's not deleted it's through
an extension cord just a regular 360
water-cooled loop and the graphics cards
water-cooled but that was barely
overclocked at all - so yeah and I like
the fact that there are plenty of Titan
V's underneath me this video had no
purpose other than me showboating and
playing around with some hardware so
guys thanks for watching and don't
forget I am giving away a box full of
stuff that you know you're gonna want to
enter that giveaway so I'll put a link
to that in the description below and
yeah thanks for watching this completely
pointless video but we had fun making it
we'll see you guys in the next one this
is silver coming through on camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
