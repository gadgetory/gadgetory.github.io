we are you know whatever okay we're
gonna crash anyways shut up
alright okay
Jack Jack right talk to Jay about
technology I gotta catch up guard a
little a little bit if I seem low energy
today I'm just tired and I think I'm
mentally ready for for the holidays next
week cuz what we have in a short week so
I'm just like already kind of mentally
checked out you don't only slept two and
a half hours last night this is the
second day now in a week that I only
slept for two and a half hours I have a
nightmare that's so bad that I just
can't get like I physically can't get
back to sleep after it and so what ends
up happening is I take a bunch of
caffeine get myself really amped up and
like right now I'm in that weird state
you know where you have a hot and cold
flashes and your brain seems like it's
running just a little behind your mouth
mm-hmm that's what I'm experiencing
right now I'm like wide awake but I feel
like I'm leg I feel like there's a
noticeable millisecond delay between my
mouth when that happens to me ice I
sound like I'm drunk so I'm probably
gonna start a little is that reoccurring
dream that you actually made a video but
then your internet won't let you upload
it no no no shit though the real dream
was this is this is so awkward I walked
into I was in a public bathroom in a
mall and it was dark the lights were out
in the bathroom at cause it known to us
so but I walk in there cuz I gotta piss
so bad I don't think nothing of it so I
walk in there and I navigate myself to
the urinal and I'm standing in front of
the urinal and a dude comes up behind me
and puts me in a fucking arm bar my
throat and pushes me into the urinal
while I'm taking a piss so I'm like
pissing and getting choked by this dude
and I'm trying to get away from the wall
but I can't because he's like so strong
he's painting me against the goddamn
urinal and I and I and then I open my
eyes and I'm awake but I can't move my
body and I'm like I still feel like the
dudes like pinning me but from behind
and I finally can move my arm and I grab
it and it's my fucking body pillow on my
back like somehow I rolled around I got
the body pillow on my back and my brain
was like yeah let's manifest this is
jail rate I sort of feel like that's
probably caffeine induced because that's
a weird one
that was that was one of the weirder
ones for sure okay why don't you tell
everyone why you've got a rapey face
okay well guys the reason why I have
pornstache or pedostache you can go
either way realistically I tend to agree
with you I'm doing it cuz I Movember
guys I do Movember that's my seventh
year doing the Movember charity means
that you just don't shave off your
moustache for 30 days this fuckers gone
December 1st I promise I'm not keeping
it but I'm just raising money so if you
want to join me come on over to Movember
it's Barnack Lee's nerdgasm team on
Movember you go the website to search
for partner fees nerdgasm uh but yeah I
helped me save some testicles and shit
because we got him other people got him
might as well as well keeping from all
my minor in the jar and my wife's
nightstand so they're pretty safe well
to be fair so are mine too but I don't
like to tell people that J well I've
been with my wife 18 almost 18 years so
I think it's safe to assume at this
point o is is that why you have why you
have two daughters because even when
you're away she can just like pop them
out of jar whenever she needs if it
wasn't for the fact that my dog is a boy
I'd be screwed right cuz I mean he's the
only one that evens up the numbers
exactly
you should swap his balls out for years
and get it back out of the jar maybe she
wouldn't notice I don't have a whole lot
of talk to tech to talk about today I
think they're kind of slow I kind of
skimmed the news today
you know the it's just I think the
holiday is coming I think most of the
tech right now is just like ads because
of Black Friday yeah so there's a whole
lot to talk about so this is just gonna
be a hangout session because next
Thursday we won't be doing a show
because it's Thanksgiving here in the
United States and I'm taking Thursday
and Friday off next week so I'm taking a
four-day weekend we won't be doing
tick-tock but then we'll be coming back
strong after Black Friday and we'll
share all the things we bought or didn't
buy whatever that sounds awesome
well I'm gonna take Thanksgiving off but
I'll probably be working the rest of the
days just on my own shit and do a
morning coffee because I'm leaving for
three days at the end of the month to go
to Mazatlan first time ever going to
Mexico I'm just gonna sit on a beach
drink coffee beers shots without any
mustache you're gonna look just like
Milton in office space at the end
clearly there's there's salt on this
glass it's a beer can't goggles it's a
big-ass glass
that'll be fun though it's never been to
Mexico what a place I've never been so
I'm actually pretty excited have a bite
it's please yeah I was thinking about
getting the kidnapping and ransom
insurance but I figure I'm not famous
anymore so I don't need it yeah you're
probably good if anybody grabs me there
you go they're gonna do a quick youtube
search or just let me go
ah shit grab the wrong one rags already
been wrung out there they're gonna force
me to log into my analytics account and
then just like shake their heads then
let me go the prime give me like a
sandwich buy me a water or something
here's a good discussion the captain in
chat says why is it called Black Friday
well racist it's a racist holiday well
this Black Friday and isn't it white
Monday and then there's like blue like
3d printing is getting on it now there's
like blue Phillip filament Tuesday or
something some bullshit are really 3d
printing yeah well no 3d printing guys
just made it up but their eyes they're
all going along with it okay so so
basically when it comes to like
marketing and budgets and all of that
black equals a positive number and red
equals a negative negative number and
they basically a call it Black Friday
because it's the time of the year where
most of the years you know shortcomings
can be made up for in one particular
like you know like yeah what's sale I
think so
they call it like there's like a nest I
saw an estimate that like 50% of like
sales for certain categories of things
like gift like gift categories like 50%
of the entire year's purchase on that
one day it's on that one day and then
it's been extended to like entire
weekends now so you know and then cyber
monday is usually when like the online
sort of like blitz sales are but I think
it's all just kind of meshed together
now I think it's just everyone knows
like Thanksgiving you know what really
pisses me off is Black Friday right you
and this is I'm gonna go right into my
rant section regarding Black Friday okay
my wife is she loves the crowds
she loves the rush of just like fighting
your way through the people to get the
deals and she loves that whole thing
right and I'm just the guy that's like
get out of my way I'm shoving people I'm
yelling at people I'm just like I
remember I got into a yelling match with
an old lady one time but she she really
pushed me the wrong way like physically
and so she physically pushed me by the
way I didn't push her because it would
have killed her
but anyway it's just like my wife
insists on going to the stores of the
worst Kohl's Target Toys R Us and it's
like all the worst places you could
possibly go same here and and she loves
that though and it just really pisses me
off but it's like it used to be early in
the morning Friday morning like 6:00
a.m. and it was 5:00 a.m. and it was
before a.m. and then over the years it's
like midnight sales now they start it
like 3:00 p.m. Thursday like it's like
they're called Black Friday on Thursday
it just pisses me off cuz it's like come
on guys it's like the hallmark right
it's like the Hallmark Channel during
the holidays it's like give me a made-up
holiday to give me a break and of course
my wife right now I hope she's watching
because she knows I hate Hallmark with a
passion and that's all that's on the TV
now it's Hallmark and I told her I was
like you know this shit's made up right
you know you know this ain't real life
don't get your expectations too high
because I'm sorry that Prince Charming
doesn't exist
Miracle on 34th Street or whatever like
gets played like the most ever like
around Thanksgiving your Christmas I
think it is both I'm the original and
like the remake
yeah and it's actually like if you go
look at the ratings everything it's
actually a shitty movie that nobody
wants to watch it's just a total cult
thing to watch those movies on those
days but it's like a shitty movie nobody
wants to watch those movies yep Jay
you're the reason I'm gonna go shopping
on Black Friday no no I'm pretty chill
until you're not chill with me and then
my patience is gone so the way you see
me bark at people on Twitter I just do
it in person so I can't help it but I've
got the wife pretty much on board now
with Black Friday online shopping like
you know Amazon's gets really good sales
well the thing is I hate it when stores
do the thing where it's like come on in
and get a TV for 99 cents and like
literally everybody buster the front
door and just start shooting each other
it's like oh every yeah every year you
hear about the Walmart incidents right
everybody here is our doll Mart
it starts with Walmart then it starts
escalating and then eventually the rich
people even get in on it too and you got
like the targets of the world in the
fucking like but Macy's but instead of
shooting each other at Macy's they just
like bring their lawyers along they just
have their they just had their Butler's
like Duke it out yeah she obviously had
it first no you are mistaken and they
start like comparing net worths it's
like rely thanks slip it's like really
Pokemon they're just like throwing their
servants out attacking other servants
whatever rich people is like the
opposite of Black Friday everything
and price please buy it on Black Friday
so they can say they spent a lot more
not in Cali they don't have guns boom
bullshit I got guns less people have
guns Kelly don't be dumb I know I know
JJ's Jason more guns than I do but
stupid and he's in California I'm a
Washington like the gunman why she we're
not a gun capital at all like we
actually have pretty shitty gun laws
they're just not as you know for a blue
state you've got a lot of like leniency
with guns uh compared to a lot of states
yeah but they Louisiana and Kentucky and
shit and it's like yeah you can
basically have like machine guns and
mortars we have an underground drum
legally it's so it's so fucking crazy
which was it I don't think it was
Kentucky where's my friend Liv I got a
buddy lives in one of those southern
states where there was like music dude
you should come out we got a range we
can go shoot fully automatic weapons I
was like oh is it like when you let go
and rent the weapon so he's like the no
I just bring my own mp5 and she does
like when you got like an FFL no I'm
like wait are you sure you just fuck
with me no no dude seriously has like a
fully automatic m4 fully automatic mp5
yeah has silencers suppressors on
everything and he's like oh yeah they
use suppressors down there just as you
know they don't they don't want it to be
so loud at the rain it's like suppressor
heart and it's like someone said
crackling sounds coming from the mics
Nick are we crackling huh I didn't think
so no we're not crackling fix your own
speakers dude yeah your speakers are
broke buddy because Nick is monitoring
down there oh yeah by the way Nick has
been ordered no no leniency if you're
stupid you're banned that's it and he
can ban at will so yeah and I can attest
to this right before we went live Jay
actually cleared him for for full
banning capabilities yeah even he even
told him to randomly select people and
just ban them like even if they don't
participate in jackass we've got the
banner wheel and just banned that would
actually be a funny idea for like its
which stream have nightbot just do think
we're counting down that it makes the
person like you won what did you win a
ban and they just bans of reviving us so
bad niggas love Nikki's life I do not
ban will the upside down oh yeah that's
a that's a stranger sting little joke
right there it was a joke I didn't get
it banned stupid people
I haven't watched the news - I don't
watch the first episode of the new
stranger things and it's like I was kind
of confused Oh worth three episodes in
it starts to make more sense but okay
because the first episode was really
like even more bizarre the season like I
was like strangers in season two kind of
starts off with like we've got to catch
you up what took place over like the
last six months kind of thing there's no
I what's that new series that just
dropped I think it's on it's either on
Hulu and Netflix like called hi-tech man
or something like that our future mm-hmm
don't your hands never heard of that oh
oh god it looks it looks absolutely
hilarious and it's like it really adult
humor hmm but it's about some guy who
plays a video it's basically like The
Last Starfighter some guy plays a video
game and he wins and some people use it
as a recruitment thing to like basically
make him a warrior of the past present
and future like to protect the timeline
but it's pretty it's pretty funny it's
it's out there though it's like it's
really really silly toilet humor type
comedy but it's good it's like if you
like do you like the tick the tick was
cool I'm just reading the the the
upstream notes here YouTube is saying
that I'm sending a keyframe every eight
point three seconds which causes
buffering I don't know how that can be
because it's set to the normal like
default thingy YouTube says watch it no
no I don't think I can change this on
the fly let me see oh yeah no anytime I
like look away from the camera for two
seconds okay yeah okay the difference on
you're looking away and we reach with
your low desk mechanical oh I can't hold
still I gotta use my fingers on
something the wife's not around so you
know oh dude the the video I just
dropped today like somehow in my kids
school project video I dropped more
innuendos than I probably have ever in
the history of my entire Channel hmm it
is pretty much just one giant innuendo
so after the stream you guys want to
come over to my channel where I don't
upload videos I've actually uploaded
three videos in the last three days son
president this I don't think that's
happened since like 2015 all right I
just updated the keyframe to every two
so we'll see what happens here what are
you doing things on the fly I don't I
don't understand why suddenly it's just
like bad stream status when it's like
the same default I've always used which
is funny because it's like the
recommended settings sent by YouTube but
whatever YouTube changes the rules
every single day well actually twitch is
starting to do the same thing now we're
like a log in to twitch every day and
like the dashboards like new feature new
feature new feature like ever since
Amazon got all of them there's like
every day there's something like now
there's a raid command you literally
just type forward slash raid and type in
a channel that takes your entire
audience and just plunks it on their
Channel
okay well that's kind of neat I thought
it was actually cool I did it's awesome
awesome hardware on there last stream
and they went from 800 to 1200 and 50
live viewers like instantly and then
they didn't notice cuz they weren't
watching but it was still cool to watch
they noticed just not right away
no no it took him a while though I was
like sitting on the stream for like five
or ten minutes and everybody in the chat
was just blowing it up and blowing it up
and blow it up but you could tell they
weren't looking at the chat they because
they were doing the famine I've been
watching our stream numbers what are we
at twenty one hundred and seventy I mean
it's a little low but whatever yeah a
little low what do we usually get about
three thousand three thirty five hundred
it's for about a thousand alone whatever
Oh some more people come on so
yeah I like I like where you went with
that J I like were you with I know
cutter Jim stone this is the most
brain-dead stream ever so what does
everybody think about the whole
cryptocurrency crash thing and everybody
screaming and saying it was then a
Bitcoin everything I'm gonna like went
back up to like almost $8,000 what was
that crash because of what happened with
the wallet you were talking about I
think no no this wasn't because of the
wallet this was something completely
different I think adds something to do
with like the Bitcoin cash thing
basically they're forking Bitcoin and
making like a fake version a Bitcoin I
know that's not what it is but like
that's what I considered I'm not I'm not
gonna worry about it what kind of um why
oh sorry so people keep asking with
headphones these are these are this is
the HyperX revolvers and I don't like
them at all I don't like them headphones
yeah really why are you using them then
because they're all I have here right
now Oh gotcha are they this is the one
thing I don't like is I've received
actually I think I have those for review
I'm supposed to review those um the they
have a 50 millimeter drivers I don't
understand why they're not doing the 60
millimeter drivers and everything cuz
like literally that's standard like
every headphone now 60 years but I've
always heard that 40 and 50 was standard
for the longest time I have not seen a
world the nicer the nicer headphones I
have not seen a pair that had under a 60
millimeter driver and like a long time
yeah it creative sent me a pair like an
oh God I didn't even review they were
they were really bad yeah some of the
creative stuff is pretty joke yeah I was
actually surprised too because I mean
when I pulled them out they actually
look like they're pretty good everything
I put them on I cranked up the volume
and they were already like starting to
clip like they couldn't even handle like
half the power that my amp was putting
out it granted they were probably like
it I think they were like $100 price
point headphones but I was like you
could go buy sony MDR v6 s that would
just mop the floor with those for like
20 bucks cheaper yeah and then put them
on mic on it and it'd be like the
greatest headphones ever someone said
the crafts crashes because Asia
announced that they're not gonna be
doing they're gonna be closing Bitcoin
on the bank side have you heard about
that I heard that they tried to stop
Bitcoin altogether and ban it in China
but they were unsuccessful and they
brought it back to a certain extent but
maybe they're trying to regulate it in
some other kind of way you really can't
regulate cryptocurrency I mean sure they
can tell the banks that they can't do
anything with it but what's stopping
somebody from selling the Bitcoin
transacting it into currency putting at
the bank and then taking it out of the
bank ease of transacting it back into
Bitcoin
yeah like there's you can't stop it it's
a it's a decentralized currency the
golden ruble X says he wants to know if
you should buy a graphics card and black
friday or not that's a really simple
quote that's a really silly question I
think I mean you should buy everything
on Black Friday there's probably years
but I mean you know you take the risk
matter when you buy it that it could go
on sale again later for lower but I
think it's unlikely graphics card it
aren't really a component that
fluctuates a lot in price even on sales
well a lot of stuffs price fixed right
like from the corporation's like fringe
Nintendo you're not you're not gonna see
like any super Black Friday deals maybe
bundles you might see bundle shit but
you're not gonna go buy a Nintendo
switch I'm just gonna say what you might
see is like extra game codes or
something but you I don't think are
gonna see in difference in out-of-pocket
yeah cuz remember that's what they did
that's why Xbox did too cuz Xbox Sony
and Nintendo all price fix their
consoles like the base console has a
fixed price everybody has to sell it for
that price mmm-hmm I think you can sell
it for more but you can't ever sell it
for less than whatever that MSRP is that
they put on it and so what they were
doing for Black Friday but for Christmas
on the x1 the last time I saw was with
the Xbox 360 they probably do with the
xbox one too but I didn't look
oh that's box 360 was you'd go in and
they'd have these crazy bundles that'd
be like the the console plus like ten
games two controllers
you know the Kinect system everything
all together for like eight hundred
dollars which would be like two or three
hundred dollars off but it's because
they couldn't discount the console so
they just threw in tons of shit that
they could disc out yeah I mean I've
always I always cared about bundles that
have like an extra control or an extra
game or something like that you know I
mean because I mean you get a good deal
yeah that's what we did you know when we
got little Jay her Xbox and stuff but
it's like you know most of the time they
come with like when they're new right
they come with one controller and it's
like you guys been 60 70 bucks get
another decent controller or you can get
a basic one for like 30 or 40 but what
I'm getting sick of is the price of
games like triple-a titles now 60 bucks
seventy bucks like yeah like six seventy
I'm 70 bucks for I think it was Forza 7
I paid 70 bucks for and I was like are
you shitting me like and then I go look
like the EA titles and sounds like the
cheapest game you get now is like 60
bucks well I'm that dude I'm that
douchebag that bought project cars to
digital deluxe you know season pass
for like a hundred bucks or whatever but
but I got all the clothes and tricks
yeah I think it did though at 4:07 I
think I got that they call it like the
gold edition or whatever and it comes
with a season pass and all the cars
it's just I'm getting sick us so much
DRM it's like now not only do you have
car packs but then you have this thing
called like season pass where it's like
you get access to certain car packs but
only for the season then after the
season you have to pay for it again to
get access doing it it's stupid and I'm
like it's so confusing because you you
it's like you okay if I could buy a car
pack outright or I can get a season pass
for like ten dollars cheaper or whatever
but it means I eventually lose all the
cars there's no one premium is 120
dollars I mean that I paid premium for
about three and four right so if you if
you're spending 60 bucks for the game
and then 50 bucks for the season pass
right or the we got to call it premium
then you're looking at a minimum of 110
right there what if and then if you get
the deluxe edition plus the season pass
it's just I'm a kind of segues into the
whole origin thing right they got pretty
beat up over the battlefront to thing
though Jesus yeah pretty that that's
putting it lightly
I mean it's like most damn boats and
read it history well not even for like a
game just like in history last time I
looked it was at 650,000 down votes and
that was days ago what's it at now do
you ever now look I'm gonna go look
because I bet you it's still on the
front page I bet you it's still still
front page I mean the problem is there
the problem is EA right yeah and people
want to blame the developers but the
developers really are at the mercy of EA
so these death threats and stuff go into
developers that's really stupid it's
really stupid I didn't I didn't
understand that at all
buts because people we know a lot of
people aren't smart online Brian and I
were talking about this and this is just
because of people's incest that need to
be mad and mob mentality and all of that
but they're just they don't know where
to place their anger and I think that's
because a lot of people are ignorant to
the way that the actual publisher versus
developers like relation works yeah yeah
so like the the people that are that are
forced to be public relations for the
developer after what he a did it's a
really shitty situation being but uh
even after the the reduced costs and XP
and stuff that it takes to actually
unlock all the things in the game you're
still looking at like a ridiculous
amount of play time and or dollars it's
it's really ridiculous I think they
might add
the reddit post just to get rid of it I
just did a search for battlefront in the
top one right now from three days ago is
just can we please boycott Star Wars
Battlefront 2 which has 166,000 up boats
but yeah the one with all the down votes
I don't I don't see it maybe it's way
down at the bottom maybe it's at the
other end of spectrum you know it's um
it's one those things too where I've got
this series that I started about doing
minimum specs needed for various games
and stuff and I want to do battlefront 2
but I don't want to do battlefront 2 cuz
I kind of don't want to like I don't
really want to bring any more attention
to that you know I mean knowin all I can
think about is SimCity again like it's
it's just really really bad decisions
are being made and ultimately if you buy
that game and play it they're gonna do
something really fucking stupid you're
gonna be in the middle of playing a game
it's gonna log you out like your
internet hiccup for the server went down
or some shit I don't like that I get I
get so pissed off of that guys that I
paid $80 to have Vader lock to the
question mark yeah Vader's locked Luke
is locked like a bunch of the heroes are
locked which is always supposed to be
the problem is they what initially
happened is they had made the amount of
credits that you needed to unlock the
heroes it's like astronomical to where
you would want to buy the loot boxes to
try and expedite when you can unlock
them
the problem was based on the math right
and this is just numbers that are being
repeated I've not done the math myself
but based on the math it was supposed to
take something like 40 hours of gameplay
or like $400 or something like that
worth of loot boxes or loot crate's
whatever they're called based on the
like average amount of XP or credits who
would earn you know sometimes you're in
more sometimes you're in less based on
the average it was yeah it was a stupid
amount of gameplay and stuff well not
only that too but yeah it was loot crate
right I believe that they were doing the
partnership thing with I don't know if
it was loot crate loot crate's like a
shitty company man they're fucking PR is
terrible the one that I told you offered
me a hundred grand for an exclusive for
a year but I have a scared to tell
nerdblock to fuck off and like publicly
like disavow their product is shit and I
was like no well I could I don't think
it was physically lootcrate like the
company that they're just calling these
loot boxes like oh it's an EA controlled
thing okay that's a digital box that you
buy and open and it could give you
credits and various things to spend
the game it could even name he could
actually give you an advantage in the
game place to the problem and a thing
that really pissed a lot of people off
was if it was something simple like
custom aesthetics like custom skins or
things like that that have no impact on
gameplay whatsoever then feeling
whatever you know but text even wore
crafted that to didn't day like wow like
he could just buy like skins and shit
but they didn't know Warcraft doesn't do
that but you could buy him mounts and
things but it didn't change the gameplay
the problem was people were able to buy
fast-track to unlocking various things
inside the game or even giving like
extra abilities or whatever right an
advantage to a player that spent the
money so they were actually getting a
boost in game performance especially in
PvP by buying this stuff so it affected
gameplay on a very high-end level so
that was what really pissed people off
about that and so then you end up in the
backlight like your play blacklight
retribution oh yeah yeah yeah it was
like total pay2win right you could go in
there and spend bugs and be walking
around like armored mech and just
blowing everybody okay but black light
was a free game true it wasn't free game
yeah so but the difference here is that
you're paying $70 for a game and then
you have to pay way more money just to
get the full game earlier or spend I
think it was thousands of hours to
actually unlock everything in the game
that's garbage
oh yeah hold on somebody is somebody
just like me to one of the EA reddits
the title is seriously I paid $80 to
have Vader or lock it it's got twenty
nine hundred and twenty eight comments
on one hundred and forty eight eight
thousand uh post yet people are
obviously pissed ooh
oh no I found it I found it so EA
responded to this they didn't actually
do the original poet so EA actually
responded this time they came it was
like super stupid fluff about them like
constantly making changes in balance and
all that yeah you're all even read it it
said it said that eat it so this is the
EA community team and you can tell it to
them because they actually have like the
official icon next to their name on
reddit like their little bear of my icon
right and it says right and this is the
one that's got six hundred and seventy
six thousand down votes right now
it said the intent is to provide players
with a sense of pride and accomplishment
for unlocking different heroes as for
the cost we selected initial values
based upon the data from the open beta
and other adjustments made to the
milestone reward before launch
among other things we're looking at
average per player credit earn rates on
a daily basis and we'll be making
constant adjustments to ensure the
players have have challenges that are
compelling rewarding and of course
attainable via gameplay we appreciate
the candid feedback and the passion in
the community has put forth around the
current topic here on reddit our forums
and across numerous social media outlets
our team will continue to make changes I
monitor the community feedback and
update everybody as soon or as often as
we can every just shit all over them
there's like a huge message thread under
I'm just kicking them in the day well I
mean so can I be devil's advocate here I
wouldn't see their their argument
another argument but their response I
don't think was that bad he was writing
I mean it's a little bit corporate but
which is it wasn't bad yeah I say that I
think was definitely a lot of marketing
a spin doctoring yeah but I think what
people were pissed off about was this
bullshit like sense of accomplishment
you know because you know what you
basically done at that point is you just
basically kicked every casual player in
the nuts basically saying you're never
gonna get Vader you're never gonna get
Luke you're never gonna get both ever
yeah I mean because one of the top
comments has 40 hours ism pride it's
just madness to unlock so I think that's
to unlock one character if you don't buy
anything else along the way right and I
don't honestly I mean the only games
that I've ever played more than like 40
hours really would be like either the
triple-a titles on the consoles like
uncharted well not even Uncharted I
don't even think you can play Uncharted
for 40 hours like the game is over way
before that yeah uh maybe Forza or
something like that so yeah that's
that's complete bullshit like you should
be able to grind on something for for an
entire day and be able to get like the
best thing there is if that's all you do
from the morning you wake up so
basically you get a yab effort one by
the front one which was extremely like
empty there was hardly anything to it
just sub just a couple pvp maps are you
running around very little content the
single there was no campaign and the
single-player missions and challenges
were kind of a joke and then you get
battlefront 2 which is more of a
complete game but of course you're not
you're not getting all of it because
they e8 it you know the EA did the EA EA
tits other agent but they may if I have
a code
the game because I think I was supposed
to get it as a part of being at PDX land
won't be swarm we supposed to get a copy
of it
mm-hmm I didn't get the swag looter oh
you didn't do you didn't do that okay I
did I did the donation thing I'm like if
you donated a certain level you got you
got the code but I don't think they've
mailed them out yet it was gonna be like
November 18th or some Yankee a probably
reneged on that - it's like the unlock
your code just pay 20 $20 and play for
45 hours on the last game let's talk
about this for a second here Kris Casper
Casper Zach Casper Zach said bf4 and 3
were pretty huge grind I will I never I
still never unlocked all the bf4 stuff
and I play a fuck ton of that yeah but
let's be honest you can you can unlock
various things in a linear trajectory
based on what you're playing so like for
instance the battlefield 3 &amp;amp; 4 I played
engineer I played a shit ton of engineer
and just by playing the class I unlocked
everything I needed and wanted for
engineer just by playing it the
difference is like this one in in in
battle I'm out front you've got to spend
the credits you know wherever you feel
like spending them so yeah by just
playing the classes engineering bf3 I
unlocked things for engineer so it's a
bit different in that where it's all XP
based yeah here you've got to spend
credits which is which i think is
differently which is it which is a
different more of a negative thing I
know a lot of people are arguing that
that this is being blown entirely out of
proportion it probably is I'm both let's
say internet just in general oh well I
mean it is being blown out of proportion
but it's also it deals to show that
gamers are serious so yeah I mean
nothing's gonna change though EA is
still gonna try this again they're gonna
continue to do this they're gonna
continue to soak up the the developers
and then destroy them and move on to the
next one
you know yeah it's unfortunate but you
know you're absolutely right I just got
a message from Hobbes altough he said
that PDX land said that they haven't
received EA coach it was supposed to
have them by now so I almost wonder if
they like reneged on it I wouldn't be
surprised
Oh God that that would be that would be
interesting I really don't care I don't
want to play I'm not that big into like
wanted to play it I've been playing pub
G and really enjoy
so I'm not looking for any other games
right now Michael Kay asked if I've been
playing or enjoying destiny - I've been
playing it a little bit here and there
it's fun but I wouldn't like to me it
doesn't feel any different than any
other shooter game I mean the difference
is the first destiny was way too grainy
if the second one is like that I'm not
really interested like I mean bad like
not even Borderlands grindy like next
level grindy I mean it's pretty grindy
but that's that's the nature of being an
MMO I mean I guess it doesn't take long
to reach level cap but I mean I've only
played a couple of times and I'm level
eight to the max levels 20 of course
there were people who at level 20 in the
first day because they like to you know
moderation doesn't exist in their life
but no I mean I'm I don't like games
like that that forced me to have to
grind dice want to get in play the game
and enjoy it but that's where EA has
fucked up is because they took the
casual player out of battlefront too
because now you're gonna come in you're
gonna get in you're gonna get rekt by
the guy that you that has unlimited time
or a limited money or both and then it
just takes all the fun out of it for
everyone there's no level playing ground
plane yeah and that's why I was saying
that it's like even though it's not free
it's much like black light or when I
played that game the only way to really
play that game and have fun is to spend
at least 50 bucks hmm like cuz you get
on the server and it'd be like
three-quarters of the people would be
just cannon fodder right and then you'd
have the guys that obviously spent the
money that running around and like the
mechanical suits and had like the
impervious armor I mean I literally
walked up a guy first time I played the
game I walked up the guy with the the
default little pistol you start out with
and I just run up the background I'm
just like bang bang bang ping ping ping
and he's like afk away from keyboard and
I just sit there and shoot him
constantly for like 15 seconds reload
shoot him again shoot him again and then
he turns around in just one shots me and
I was like you know what what just
happened well it was just because he
just gets up and walks away cuz he
doesn't give a shit cuz he has such good
armor Crow's 'i'm violent chat just said
how about earning five hundred credits
in arcade mode and then having a 15 hour
cool down before you can earn more from
arcade mode I didn't know that was a
thing well one of the one of the
complaints was that you don't earn
anything in arcade mode right so you
can't grind out credits in arcade mode I
guess a cool-down would be a big reason
for that
Nick I need you to turn it down a little
bit I hear it in my mic
I heard Jerry's watch watch him warned
again no he's my Terenas he has the
speakers on so I'm hearing you down
there and like the delay as he has he
had the band anybody yet I had been a
couple people oh you just can't behave
something I banned one because you said
I was 42 and I'm not 42 that's just rude
actually my video games gonna be out
here in a couple of weeks we're gone the
final beta right now of the quick splat
barnacles game I'm actually excited okay
I can't wait this isn't right a thread
on that one oh god it's gonna fucking
good if you thought EA was pay2win wait
until you see quick splat barnacle it's
like every five seconds just gonna pop
up on the PayPal button every five
seconds have to watch a 10-second ad to
continue ya know we created a splat game
where basically my head appears and then
it just replace it with an ad in the
same tile right as your fingers
accelerating towards it there's your
incentive to actually get right every
time you actually accidentally splat the
wrong tile it plays an ad it's not that
bad but like after you have like three
lives and once you exhaust them to get
into their life you have to watch an ad
so it is kind of like but when you play
but when you play the ad then you get
the revenue so imagine let's imagine
what the like you know mass sourcing of
ad revenue would be at that rate
oh dude we were doing a projection it
like a three dollar CPM or something
like that if you had 10,000 people
playing the game with like our current
metrics that we have in the database I
mean it would be thousands and thousands
of dollars are they under of it could
you imagine could you imagine the
punishment though or if you if you
accidentally splat the wrong tile too
many times it takes you to one of your
videos it's like to get more points what
you can you can either get one point for
watching this ad or five points by
watching a particle ease video and
they're like let's close the game
speaking of speaking of pissed off about
ads though this this is something I
disagree with I been addicted to the
magic piano app for like three years
right like you guys don't even
understand like I've been around this
guy I've shared a hotel room with him
this it's unhealthy
unhealthy addiction this guy has with us
the hand-eye coordination that it
generates anyway there's none that
there's not a song on there I can't
master even the hardest settings but
we're
I know I've heard you on the shader
several times today most of my points
have been achieved on the toilet but
anyway sorry I have I have the the
subscription to that right I don't have
to like earn the points unlock songs I
just have the subscription which unlocks
everything that's a couple bucks a month
is $7.99 a month I've been doing it for
three years do the math for for a mobile
app that is a hefty subscription so it's
a good app afternoon well it's good to
me so that's what matters what pisses me
off though is it still plays ads it's
like I fucking have subscribed to this
and you're still feeding the ads that's
bullshit in my opinion well you know
what else does that's fucking Hulu true
yes that's when they do that shit like
it always pops up and says this chair
this this show is not a part of your
premium package so ads will be played
and I'm like it's every fucking show
yeah everything I want to watch is in
that category yeah they want you to pay
more just to not get ads it's so yeah
it's like you can pay for a subscription
but then you have to pay for a
subscription on that subscription yeah
we're like the ones where it's like you
get Hulu and it's like you can get Hulu
Plus Showtime for an extra $5.99 a month
it's like damn it like ah it's like you
pay for the privilege to get cable and
then you have to pay extra to get the
other stuff we I mean it's I've noticed
that too on Netflix to the plate and
Netflix Pacific's ads but still yeah
who's who lose a definitely a repeat
offender video wise though so talking
about videos that are coming up I've
kind of got so much going on it's it's
so much is going on so I'm gonna be
tearing apart Nick's computer where
we're testing the long-term effects of
the the primitive view which is
available now
by the way everyone's been like oh my
god one's gonna be available asking me
no Mike I don't know they just sent it
to me early like to see what I thought
about it I don't know any specifics of
it that's the fancy fluid I saw that has
the two the combined stuff yeah right
look so we were looking at it at PDX too
and all the colors yeah
I watched your video or it was like no
talking and just like the whole video
does my favorite part is when your porn
that shit into the container it's really
mesmerized it is but that's my third or
fourth build using it and yeah so we're
gonna be seeing what the long-term
effects of it are what's funny as Premo
chills actually showed us pictures where
some of the blocks that had tarnish and
stuff on them but
where they used it it actually cleaned
like the copper became shiny and cleaned
after using it so I'm really interested
to see what happens because the Titan X
Maxwell cards that are inside of Nick's
computer are the ones that I've had to
like take apart and clean multiple times
because Mayhem's was like gunking up in
there and i'm really curious to see what
happened to those over time at the same
problem with fessor one and my liquid
cooled system i think it was eating away
at the tubing a little bit mhm
and it was gunk and up everything like
the pump would just stop working and I'd
pull the pump out and it'd just be full
of shit and then I put the pump back
together and stick it back in there and
it would just get clogged immediately
again and then I had to take the watch I
had to take the CPU block apart and it
was like completely gummed up like when
I took the top but I like peeled off
like a skin yeah it was so nasty and I'm
like so it was like eating the hose then
redepositing of his goop inside of the
fins loose on the heat sink and I was
like don't they test this shit like
everybody back then was using that same
tubing yeah I know
and we'll the plasticizer leeches out of
those tubes two things I want to talk
about here in chat first one just says
it's from Ben Borman he says why are
there so many vids of AMD stuff floating
YouTube the answer to that is because
this is the first time AMD's actually
had something worth talking about okay
their cpu line had made a brew hadn't
been refreshed in this the initial FX
how much back in 2011 small
microarchitecture changes with excavator
bulldozer excavator and piledriver and
all that stuff but generally the tech
was six years old now that you've got
Ryan and thread Ripper and they've
actually caused a market share change
AMD is worth talking about and it's an
it's a it's a thing now we're a lot of
buyers I feel like in 2017 a lot of
people have because there's so many
options now I've actually not been
buying parts because I think people are
more confused than they've ever been now
on what parts to buy because before it
was like okay fine I'm on extreme budget
I'll get AMD and I can sort of get by
but now it's like now AMD and Intel are
trading blows and now you've got a stack
with second that's both sides to worry
about which one do I get and people are
confused so these videos are actually
hot topics and obviously for video
creators like us we make our living
based on views and and return on those
views and stuff and ads and revenue
share and all that so we do the topics
that are hot that's that's what you do
you don't just go oh I'm gonna go
against the green I'm gonna talk about
Athlon you know what I mean it's like I
may do an Athlon video but we talk about
what the audience and the viewers are
searching and that's being a highly
searched topic right now the other thing
is so that's what I'm doing wrong I'm
always late to the table and everything
I'll be like a risin can can you
research this slappy man says
Battlefront you just announced they are
turning off in-game purchases is that
fake news or is that real because I
don't see them I don't see them turning
them off cuz what about everyone who
just already spent real money on it in
the last several days we're gonna refund
it I'm not seeing anything in initial
search for that so oh wait hold on here
turn off rewards no I see a bunch of
people calling for it yeah but I don't I
don't see anything official from like ei
not it's not obvious anyways well I'm
sure the chat will try to chime in right
now if there was something on that but
I'd get out it I doubt it I mean even
CNN Money picked up the story take on
CNN Tech right now this is the new Star
Wars video game is under attack and it's
like one of their big articles on the
front page that's pretty interesting
yeah well when CNN starts picking up
like video game related shit that's
weird cuz and the article has to be
hilarious I'm gonna see Leadfoot to word
when ii says more 370z videos please um
we'll see we're actually going to the
track this weekend
picking up actually but after Tech Talk
I've got to drive out to a buddy's house
pick up a trailer be trailering the car
out to chuckwalla Valley Raceway Nick
zoomies tracking his Z for the first
time interesting I'll let him bend it
tell him tell him 2/3 2/3 no push past
2/3 no he'll I don't think he'll I don't
think he'll push that hard but we'll see
you well see you got does he got sticky
tires or anything is you just running
regular Street shit on there so it's ok
so what you're saying is you're not even
see him in your we're probably not gonna
be in the same run group because I'm a
higher level than him Oh gotcha like how
does that all work do they go by times
just lap times run coaching the gray so
there's there's blue it's his beginner
that was cancelled he was supposed to be
in blue they cancelled it they moved him
up to purple which is a beginner
intermediate which is a point bypassing
anywhere on track blah blah blah since
he's never had any track time the he's
got to actually go out there with an
instructor who were going out with
Daugherty
oh shit that's a hell of an instructor
doubt but he's got to basically do like
an out lap one lap and then pit in like
every other laughs he's got a pit in and
then go back out like it's supposed to
be a thing like to keep to force him to
sort of like calm down and recollect and
go back out kind of thing okay I find
that to be more dangerous than just
letting him stay out there because now
he's got to worry about pitting out and
pitting back it on track you know
pitting out on track again with traffic
coming up behind him I think that's
asking for more trouble than just
letting him stay out there perch is the
entry on the track right there on a big
high speed straight - yeah well the
entry is around it goes around the
outside of turn one and so you know
he'll be going around turn one hoo-wee
mesa Kaleem urging in turn one turn one
for me I usually enter so it's it's a
it's a straight it's not I mean trick
Wallace does have a long straight but
it's a straight followed by a quick left
- a very tight right and I normally
wouldn't jot when it works to the left
and then goes right I'm usually doing
about 105 right there and then usually
I'm trail breaking through the through
turn one down to about 55 60 so people
are gonna be coming up behind him at
about a hundred and 510 miles per hour
in that group so what's the fastest
speed you've ever done usually on one of
the straights there I don't look at the
speedometer I couldn't tell you but I
thought you date a log though I don't
date a log on the track I sent like a
kind of a laptop in there oh okay gotcha
well I was wondering if you had some
like like my little my little cobb tuner
thing that I have or whatever can
actually like track a lot of things like
you know how the cars top speed and
everything it will tell you what corner
it was on but I'll tell you what the
what the top speed is because got a
tattletale on it but I was like it our
track up here the ridge last time I went
on the straight I hit a hundred and
forty two on but it's a it's a long
street I mean it's just it's almost a
mile yeah that's for speed though I
couldn't tell you I'm definitely not
looking down at the gauges I might
glance at the temp here and there but
yeah everyone's saying look at EA star
wars Twitter I guess it was mentioned
there check okay look at here look at a
Star Wars on Twitter's whatever what's
saying okay Oh Star Wars if they're
removing it entirely than I might
actually get the game hey this is the
official oh shit holy shit EA Star Wars
15 minutes ago today we turned off
in-game purchases for Star Wars
Battlefront - the game is built on your
input and it will continue
evolve and grow read the full update are
you here we go here's the picture okay
they even did like a nice big picture of
the whole thing it says as we approach
the worldwide launch is clear that many
of you feel that there's still
challenges in the design we've heard the
concerns about potentially giving
players unfair advantages but we've
heard that this is overshadowing an
otherwise great game this was never our
intention sorry we didn't get this right
we hear you loud and clear so we're
turning off all in-game purchases we
will now spend more time listening
adjusting balancing and tuning this
means that the option to purchase
crystals in the game is now offline in
all progression will be earned through
gameplay the ability to purchase
crystals in-game will become available
at a later date only after we've made
changes to the game we'll share more
information details so as we work
through this and that's from Oscar
Gabrielsson general manager of ice okay
so they turned off the actual spinning
currency for you know getting items
in-game now my question is definitely
adjusted the amount of time you have to
play now to earn this stuff more say it
sounds that I mean that's kind of like
the undertone of it made it kind of
sound like that's what they're doing but
I mean they didn't they didn't say that
specifically yeah because I mean the the
the rumor I guess they reduced the cost
by like seventy five percent or
something but that's what I heard I saw
something along those lines yeah I don't
know I mean I might I might just don't
get it
but yeah I just I hate supporting the EA
for the EA company but I have so many EA
games as it is already it makes me a
hypocrite right yeah you know you know
what I you know what I really want is
what fuck is the next grand theft auto
gonna come out Grand Theft Auto 5 is
still my favorite game it's still the
game that I play the most in
single-player and I want a new one but I
swear to god they're never gonna make a
new one because it's still so popular
after a billion years why is everyone
freaking out saying oh my god and
dollars guys it's not a thousand dollars
that's a thousand like whatever currency
that is yeah whatever the crystals are
they're not gonna be a normal like a
donation came home it was a thank you
for the entertainment you provided me
over the years or both of us which CP
would you consider the best of all time
Jerry please do more YouTube oh by the
way this cash is for Zander well I'm
proof that he spent him on something he
wants you should have sent it to Jerry
then at that point Jay and I always did
we're just doing the split thing now so
it doesn't you can't say who you're
giving what to anymore yeah
so but it's best CPU of all time that's
a talk I would probably have to go with
like well it can't just be for top speed
right because then it'd be like a like a
CPU right now like like for all time it
has to be what what what criteria are we
going by here like the CPU it was the
most reliable or most revolutionary for
the time maybe yeah I would say market
changing and to me that would be
probably the Pentium the very first
Pentium because that started the best
started the race like the mega the speed
race in my opinion like the Pentium 60
in the Pentium 90 right and that
actually yeah worst
AMD's Athlon series - really well AMD
surpassed the Pentium but you know AMD
for the 4500 + 4800 less than all those
were really good chips it's just I was
until now that was last time AMD was
really relevant there was a lot more
competitors back then - because if I'm
not mistaken when the Pentium came out
you also had the IBM blue lightning
which fell flat on its fucking face
because it was a million billion dollars
nobody could afford it and then cyrix
had an offering - but cyrix had really
really bad compatibility problems right
it had to be like you had to actually
install special drivers and shit from
windows and the custom Hal and
everything to use it because it was like
so fucked up I think my thought oh good
if you guys say no good tell yours I
already know a - I think in terms of
overclocking though and the CPU have had
the most fun with ever in the history of
playing with computers is still gonna be
probably my Core 2 Duo East 6300 for its
overclocked ability it was a 1.8 4
gigahertz dual-core that ran 3.4 - its
entire life for years
that's insane over it was yeah I've
never got chips have never overclocked
that far since and that was just a bomb
basic water and it was a 80% overclock
for for me and probably the seller on
302 a because you could overclock up to
450 or on air or 500 on liquid and it
literally would outrun like the most
expensive server processors in existence
yeah and you could run and you could run
two of them that was back in the days
where you didn't need Xeon or you could
run two Celeron 300 days on a dual proc
motherboard yeah and I had one I had a
duel and soso I had a Giga hurt like
they were only supposed to be 300
megahertz q 6600 - popping up a lot in
the list that was a good CP I mean is
the first first true like quad-core
Intel CPU
can I date him yeah yeahs mail for dear
said Itanium oh my it's our titanium
titanium is like the biggest fucking
failure ever of intel's entire history
only reason that it even exists anymore
is because company thing I'm gonna
probably go with the sheller indeed the
dual-core self man oh my god I just
can't believe somebody actually said
said tonight a neom case
well we die Taney um's were set so
expensive and they had so many
instructions that they were only good
for like things like database operations
shit if the people optimized and built
the software for the ground up for
because cuz it wasn't an X 64
architecture right it was a stone
architecture right and so it's really
bizarre and I remember at Microsoft we
threw like most of them out in the
hallway like like hundred thousand
dollar you know eight you servers that
had multiple DS Itanium processor we
were just throwing them out in the
hallway and PC recycle haul him off cuz
that's how shitty to see 128 D said e
6300 was one point eight six gigahertz I
said that I said it was overclocked to
three point four to I owned I used it
for I don't know three four years and
then I gave it to my brother-in-law and
he used it for like another three four
years and then it died an untimely death
because he used a compressor to clean
his case and he over spun a fan and a
fan blade broke off and stabbed the
motherboard oh this here's another funny
story that just reminded me of when I
worked at mother's board computers we
found out the hard way that back in the
day motherboards didn't have diodes on
the fan headers so when you spin them on
the mother words yeah you'd spin the fan
and then the LEDs on the motherboard
would start to light up and if you over
spun the fan you could actually blow the
caps on the motherboard yeah that's not
so when we were cleaning up yeah we
clean up the systems because if you're
any of you weren't paying attention to
which motherboard it was you just start
smelling the magic smoke he's like I
don't leave this thing plugged in we
generated power we did we burned it and
then the customer to come back and we
just let my boss was like so bad about
that like customer coming be like oh man
we plugged in your computer wouldn't
turn ons we must've brought in this way
and it's like we totally fried their
shit
oh my god that's such a bad so do you
have any did you have any cool or
interesting products coming up uh as far
as cool interesting projects probably
just code gasm that we have to reshoot
because those a dumbass left system
sounds on at OBS so it's like
ding-ding-ding-ding ding-ding-ding-ding
for two hours
why do you have
I've noticed you always have system
sounds guy it's I forget to hit the
little button on my main board that
mixes and system sounds with a
microphone but how do you not hear them
oh we said to have headphones on I had
somebody over and we were both we were
shooting a standalone episode so there's
no reason to monitor and wear headphones
because we're literally like shooting a
video I just used the headphones
initially to measure the audio and I
didn't think that the system sounds were
coming through cuz I was only reporting
the microphone and OBS I can hear system
sounds and microphone through the
headset anyways I fucked it up we're
gonna reshoot that one so that's that's
the one that I probably want to fix the
most other projects are the car videos I
got the Dodge Viper video coming up but
I got to edit but unfortunately shop 9
hours of fucking video so that's gonna
be a nightmare dat it yeah 9 hours for
like a video that I want only to be 15
minutes and and then of course my Subaru
video that because I did all that I
wouldn't got it fixed and I shot the
whole thing getting the valve cover
seals all replaced and the brakes put on
it and then we took it over and got it
tuned on the dyno with the new cobb
accessport and got it up to 333
foot-pounds of torque
thank god it's fun to drive now Jay oh
my god next time you come up here I'm
just gonna give you the keys and just
let you go thrash the shit out of it
because it's it's it's fine
okay I guess it's honestly not not I'll
tell you right now though it's less
trackable than it was before because the
turbo just comes on way too aggressive
oh yeah like I would not want to take
the thing into a corner now as hard as
the turbo comes on cuz like it gets up
to about 3,000 rpm and the turbo needle
just goes wonk wonk and it's I can't
even explain it
it just feels like a turbo I've owned
this car for so long that I thought a
turbo car felt the way that my car felt
and turned out the whole time that my
car was fucking bleeding boost and it
gave it that linear power curve I was
only building top boost it like 5,000
rpm now I'm doing it at 3500 yeah so it
completely changed the way the car acts
hmmm oh I sold a shirt today
woo woo a shirt kumusta my best day so
far is like five shirts we're working up
to it speaking of shirts you guys do
fine mine on my Twitter
Jay Jay what happened actually this is
just a loaded statement so you this is
this is taking some free punches for me
right here
okay what happened man I just came to
stance that you notice I still have the
same number of followers on Twitter I
have for the last six months and roughly
the same number of followers on my
youtube channel I might gain like you
know 80 80 new subs a day or something
like that but still like I everything
just came to ace
halt it's better than a decline no it's
true I haven't had a decline yet but
it's just really weird that every time I
log into Twitter it's like the same
exact number in the thousands I'm like
well every time I turn number starts to
grow I go on a rant and then it declines
a little bit but then the people that
love my rants they like share me and
then people who like or like-minded will
follow so like I've been going I'm at
three hundred and thirty four point nine
thousand right now and it's like it'll
go up and down a hundred like this for
like days at a time up a hundred down
one hundred up one hundred down one
hundred and then it will just like shoot
up a thousand and it will do the same
thing so it's just constantly doing that
I've seen the same thing with uh with
YouTube like you know when you release a
video you usually see a decline before
you see people going it because people
just see a video and they hit outside
because it's um they're not interested
in whatever or it's a reminder that they
don't watch anymore oh yeah I should
probably unsub from that guy I don't I
don't sure I expect every time I put up
a video there's like an initial probably
there's about a fifty to a hundred
maybe over the next hour to that will
unsub
but then there's it's usually just
immediately negated by the people who
are constantly subbing throughout the
day yeah your your ship's been on fire
lately though it's yeah I keep an eye on
you it's not that high like the numbers
the daily numbers aren't like as high as
other people in them in the range that I
am in terms of like the daily growth but
it's consistent so I'm perfectly fine
with that consistency is easy to build
upon but the the celebrity build coming
up though I'm interested to see how this
one does because the guy you were
talking about right I don't know who he
is okay this is the most like tweet I've
ever had there's more hype around this
than the Terry Crews build he's got two
million followers on Twitter but his
name his name's Austin Post he goes by
post Malone he is a rapper slash R&amp;amp;B
artist out of Texas and it's got eight
thousand four hundred and fifteen likes
on Twitter and 1079 retweets and that's
that's insane anything over a thousand
retweets is like undiscovered country to
me I don't think I've ever had a
thousand he's he's like one of the most
up-and-coming artists right now so how
did this happen can you can you give us
the story of how this how this match was
made I woke up in the morning I was
taking a shit I was looking through my
youth my verified tab and I see a tweet
from this this guy's Twitter handle
that's beers and gear bongs and
Bentley's and it just says hi
I responded what's up and he's like a
really funny story I'm going to tell
this I'm gonna embarrass myself and I
think Nick knows where this conversation
is going now
so I mean he's he's white first of all
so he's very against the grain in
hip-hop and rap which i think is great
because my favorite rapper of all time
is Eminem which is already like I you
know same and so I always been very
motivational to me but I had heard a lot
of post Malone songs
I just didn't know like I'm really bad
with artist names and stuffs I couldn't
tell you artist names and album titles
and stuff but when we when I was in
Austin Circuit of the Americas the a
friend who was hosting me was like
blasting post Malone in his car and I
didn't realize it that that was post
Malone but anyway um so I get this tweet
and he was like hi and I responded with
the son and he was like I care he said
something back to me and I was like
anyone just sliding in those DMS III I
hadn't didn't realize who he was he at
the time and so he he I follow you're
like fuck off man was already following
he was already following me and I
followed him back and then DMS I was
like hey just making sure you know I'm
not jay-z because I get that a lot and
he responded with oh really cuz you guys
look alike and he was like but I fuck
with you shit boy and I was like I
looked at I was like I don't know what
this means
I is he fucking with me I don't know I
told my wife I was like uh I don't I
don't know what this means I fuck with
your shit boy and then she was like I
think he's saying he likes your stuff
and I was like but that's not where this
says and then I asked Nick I was like
what does this mean he he responds to
with me to the link to the urban
dictionary and it says I fuck with your
shit means I like your stuff and I was
like oh oh so he so he knows so he likes
my stuff and Nick's like oh my God he's
like Facebook that point you unbanned
him right so basically I was like what
how does I fuck with yo shit mean I like
your stuff I was like to me that means
I'm fucking with you and so I was I
totally white buoyed it right so anyway
now he what he was you just I guess he
found my my videos and he was like
getting into PC because he got like
hooked on pub G and so he was getting a
PC stuff he bought like
most expensive Alienware and I was like
we're gonna blow that shit out of the
water I asked it was like do you want to
do a custom PC build he was like yeah
that's not even why I was hitting yet
but sure let's do it so he was actually
supposed to be here tomorrow but we
postponed til Monday because
unfortunately a friend of his passed
away this week so we postponed til
Monday and but he'll be here in studio
which will be an interesting build
because I think this is gonna be a hard
one
my wife is more gang than me you got no
idea anyway um my wife my wife this is
gonna be a harder build let me tell you
why Terry Crews is easy to nail down in
terms of style the guys were fine he
likes high-class stuff he's just like I
don't hide the fact that I like
Chardonnay and shit you know what I mean
yeah this guy he's 21 years old three
years ago he was a nobody today he's the
most streamed artist and in the world in
terms of like YouTube music and spot of
our YouTube Spotify and Apple music he
opened for Justin Bieber he's friends
with Justin Bieber and he's like
literally everywhere right now he's like
the most up-and-coming artists there is
if you let me paint a mental picture
really quick for everybody from the
picture I'm looking at right now this is
the first picture open when I look at
his feet he's literally look in Kostka
yeah he's scary he's got a barbed wire
tattoo across his forehead like a little
like tear like teardrop kind of tattoo I
think going on I think it's a smiley
face with X eyes under his eyes yeah
that's what it is he's he's in the
middle of a Costco in this picture with
camo sweatpants on wearing wearing a
sandals he's got a t-shirt on and he's
vaping blowing a huge cloud while he's
laying in a massage chair in the middle
of a Costco and he's like full sleeve
tatted
so like this is a guy that gives zero
fucks and that's exactly what makes this
build hard is how do I figure out this
guy's style when the only thing this guy
cares about is being different right I
mean it's the only happen I think and
this the only he really cares about
being different so I feel like I could
kind of go in any direction but yeah I
mean I feel like he's so in the
conversations I've had with him already
like you know on the phone and whatnot
he's so just like yeah I'm cool with
whatever or whatever I don't really care
you know whatever you want to do it's
like shit
makes it hard because I could go any
direction with this and probably fine
but I kind of want an if I'm gonna if
this is turning into a thing where I'm
becoming like a celebrity builder I sort
of want to like be able to nail down
something that they look at and go yeah
I can't imagine that being any better
well I could give you some input from
the three pictures I look at I'm
thinking just a giant keg should be the
case and then inside of the keg should
be a computer and there should just be
vape smoke coming out of it constantly
the entire time it's but the thing is
like I don't know if he owns a Bentley
but I know you though is always tomat
Bentley's enough I'm sure he has a
Bentley right just because I'm looking
for but he's also like super into Bud
Light and most people who are into Bud
Light or known as being like a
white-trash right so it's like I don't
know we live in the age of IPAs and all
this super like snooty beer the guys
just like give me a button I'm good you
know so what you're saying is instead of
a keg you should get a double-wide
trailer and build the computer in there
I think we should get an Airstream and
Eric no ears no air seems a nice what's
the what's the one that's like no you
need the car off of a vacation oh yeah
big wood panels stationwagon that wrote
the Roadmaster or whatever it is but
it's funny that I mean there are more
likes and retweets and favorites and
hype around this build than in Terry
Crews one I think that's because I ain't
ever gonna catch you now fuck I'm so
gonna try though till the end of time
Jay until I die from my fat disease I
mean it was but this I liked how
laid-back II as though he's pretty cool
no yeah he looks he looks total shit
like his posts and shit literally look
like zero fuck like there's there's some
promotion stuff but it's mostly just him
to stand around taking pictures I'm
hanging out with friends and if you
really likes guns if you actually boys
from Texas if you read his backstory
he went from literally being like nobody
with no money to where he is today so
he's kind of like why would I change who
I am you know now right did you see the
picture of the four guns he was out
shooting mm-hmm dude a g18 see with
extended Meg and a buttstock so the
fully automatic lock those are illegal
as shit everywhere a 50 Cal BMG are
actually no no it's tough no it's front
Mouse so it's not bullpup so 50 50 Cal
volt semi-automatic rifle with a charge
handle on top of it into m4s and one
suppressed yeah that guy knows that a
party man
spent casings everywhere over the video
there's a because he's he he got a big
up-and-coming on YouTube as well right
and there's a video of him like doing an
interview and he was like yeah I'm
nineteen we all blow up a blood of a
cheap bill this time only nineteen him
only nineteen he's like drinking blood
as he's like I'm only 19 I'm only 19
he's drinking beer on camera which is
Kendall hey I mean that kind of gives
you an idea of how much fucks he gives
have you talked to him at all yet like
on on the phone or anything are you guys
just meeting up in person first time
here we'll be meeting in person for the
first time on Monday so thing yeah Davis
to see how that goes yeah this is the
other end of the spectrum man this is
like this is like extreme on the other
end of the spectrum you're like fucking
with my like aunts and uncles now
literally this guy could have been my
neighbor girl like no shit
my parents were like smoked weed with
this guy at the kitchen table will tell
me to stay in my bedroom JC's and drop
twin what's funny that was the look on
my daughter's face when I told her that
he's friends with Justin Bieber because
she's eight right so of course she was
oh oh my god and I told her I was like
I'm not gonna he's not gonna be
introducing you like teasing us she's
like I wasn't gonna say that like total
teenager response right I was gonna say
that anyway she's smart beyond her years
you're gonna have to keep an eye on that
man that's gonna be a full I was a
little boy hop I don't know what that is
but he's kind of been everywhere someone
said post Malone was on content cop I
don't know what that is well he wouldn't
know with uh with uh oh shit what's his
name he even did an episode of Ghost
Adventures
no no content competent it's a youtube
series with I can't remember the guys
name tall lanky guy he did the keemstar
of the really famous keemstar video
where he ripped he ripped on keemstar
like as a garden gnome takes him on
shoots with a shotgun oh god what's his
name yeah they'll say it in chat here in
just a second he's he's actually a
pretty famous youtuber uh oh it'll pop
up here in a second I'm sure I don't
know what the delay is on the stream
he's always on h3h3 well h3h3 he's
friends with them like personally that's
one of the reasons why you had to
postpone tomorrow too was not just
because of his friends passing but
because he had double-booked he forgot
that he was doing their podcast tomorrow
so that's why I moved it to Monday but
yeah he's like he's in tight
with Ethan oh it's idubbbz sorry that's
that so you know who I died of said okay
yeah so so let's see if he's dead he's
well idubbbz did shit with Jake Paul -
oh no he just busted him so dude this
guy goes after fucking everybody well I
can open up content cut and see if he's
in the list he did jinx no fine brothers
keemstar toy channel how to prank leafy
tech destruction no no he's not in there
he did not do a content cop on him so
whoever said was wrong but yeah he's
been on h3h3 cuz he's got tons of
pictures of Ethan on his well there is
their personal friends like outside of
the YouTube thing I mean they just do
the YouTube team together but they're
friends outside of that so yeah they
look like they probably smoke a lot of
weed together it's funny though because
when I did when I texted Nick in the
morning before I asked him to translate
the the hip-hop speak
Nick is very versatile you can call him
to like authenticates camera calls and
like talked about urban dialogue it's
awesome but anyways um I had basically I
text I was like have you ever heard of
post Malone he's like yeah I was like
he's tweeting right now and Nick's I
think the response was he's probably
high as fuck he is he probably did think
you were Jay Jay's jay-z he's like fuck
it anyway so yeah guys the video will be
out next week
grannie we got to postpone anymore but
yeah so I'm doing a thing with post
Malone which is really weird yeah just
let you guys know I'm gonna be building
the computer for the guy from Christmas
story that almost died from an OD that
nobody knows about don't wipe it systems
be building that for you to give to him
no that's true that's your Ambattur
I'm a total sellout I go pick up my
computer tomorrow actually pretty
excited in every comment on the videos
like you should have j build you a
better water-cooled computer I was like
let's listen guys water cooling is cool
and all I totally get it you're actually
one of the better builders in the water
cooling Iranian but I am lazy I like
shit that's easy to move around I like

Roach says I want to see J smoke weed

don't I don't I don't a moved once and
the only iced mochas suckers on the
track
don't smoke as my tire smoke coming in
my driver-side window after noob Donuts
um no I do remember I tried it for my
back and I don't like it I don't
understand how people like it it's weird
like if you have you ever tried it ever
one time long long time ago
way way underage did it make you just
feel really fucking like paranoid no low
D and slow no I was yeah a floaty and
slow you have enough paranoid oh god it
made me so paranoid I can see that and
made everybody sound like like TV shows
were like 9 hours long I swear we were
watching an episode of Brooklyn
nine-nine and I swear to god it felt
like it was like four hour episode I was
like as I kept looking over it my wife
and I'm like is this ever gonna end it
she's like knew it was like paranoid but
but in my in my defense though somebody
gave me the the chocolate bar that had
it in it and I thought and I was
supposed to eat a square he said he said
just eat one of these and it was
supposed to be one of the squares not
the whole bar which was eight squares so
I did he we're supposed to eat one of
the squares so I think I had a pretty
and it was bad dude I threw up like
crazy four hours later those nuts I just
known to a race a race of what on track
I was watching she just reminded me of
like I wasn't gonna get into details
about the time I tried it but she's
reminding me of the details for me it
was it was never a good experience the
CBD stuff did nothing for me that was
ultimately what I wanted was for the
back pain management was like every said
J smokes GTRs coughed TJ hunt don't have
to cough just say his name is that guy
still around I'm still out there
destroying cars lifting really yeah just
reckon I'm into shit he's he follows
pretty much the the like the ricer at
lane headlights
hood wide body wheels exhaust it did he
finally like look at a picture of
Hiroshi Gandhi
oh my god that'd be like we walk up by
and see it like Steve Ballmer and just
like you know wow yeah bang again am I
gonna give him any any any exposure he
doesn't deserve so no exposure p.m. but
you can get me some exposure guys I'm
making videos again they're not very
good but I'm making them you're getting
exposure right now you're on my channel
shit I mean you're in front of two
thousand five hundred ninety five people
a lot of people a lot of people's a lot
of people we're trying to think of what
the biggest the biggest livestream I've
ever been on was I can't honestly
remember mine no I don't know no I don't
know if it's wetland show pulls a pretty
good audience but I think was back when
I was on PK the first time back when
they were still pulling a lot of views I
want to say that they were getting
somewhere and like that wasn't a live
when you went on it it was a replay it
was recorded was the first one I went on
a replay mm-hmm okay so they were
they're already doing it on replays yeah
okay
so so it's got to be it's got to be the
weigh-in show I can't think of anything
else I've been on that's bigger than
that yeah so and they'd only pull like
what like eight thousand ten thousand
something like that I say only way is
kind of like fairly just dropped off on
relevance meter so I don't know I mean
he doesn't need to do it I mean what
he's pretty much set for life I mean he
just does it just for shits and giggles
I mean the dude literally spends his
days like flying around on the fucking
like what are those things called the
that para wing parasail that's what it
is he's flying around all day in a
parasail cuz he literally has a big huge
piece of land he just goes out and has
like a runway he puts his backpack on
with a fan and like put some fucking
parachute up in there and just flies up
like 10,000 feet and like flies around
the state pretty sure he doesn't fly up
to 10,000 feet that's controlled there
sure he does he actually has hold on
here has got a video that she's like I
went to 10,000 feet but that's
controlled airspace well you can still
like call in and get it get it cleared
if he's got the license for it right
yeah so my wife says oh god yeah edibles
are super strong you're supposed to only
have a little bite she's referring to
yeah I done fucker that up you're like
chocolate let's see there one I can hear
sounds and colors dude it was weird it
was so weird I
Smith uh I'm trying I'm trying to see
which which one it was he has a whole
series on it's like landing parachute
smells like 100 power 100 power in the
air hold on
there was one that was like up at ten
thousand three or something like that
imposing burn did there's one where he
almost killed himself he's coming down
and doing like someone who is like
spinning in a circle to lose altitude
really really fast he almost didn't get
it back in time that would that would
kill them Oh controllers pay starts at
18 K not 10 whatever okay but but I mean
it still could you imagine being that
wait wait that came from Hobbs what
would he know about aviation programs
just go for fsx dude we love you did you
go over and see what he was playing like
well we were at a EDS Liam he was he
like I don't think he was actually
playing when I was looking at this
computer but okay well I walked over
there and he had his joystick and
everything else on my cables fucking I'm
still doing it I don't hear it am i and
you don't it's like no as long as you
guys don't hear it I don't care I don't
know anyways he's playing a flight
simulator but it was like the full-on
hardcore have to do everything real
people liked our taxiing him out to the
runway that on FS x2 on private servers
and stuff we're yet to actually like
flight test in you're gonna take a test
before they even let you have the
password to the server didn't take it on
there for him try that out sometime
it's pretty fun I'd be kind of a fun
server to troll on you know they'd ban
you instantly but it'd be like alright
alpha Foxtrot Niner go ahead and tax
yeah what's wrong over the grass what's
great about those servers is the people
who get in but then they forget to
change their spawn point like you're
supposed to change your spawn point to a
to a gate right but if the default like
in fsx is the is the active runway so
you'll be sitting there and you're in
the real-world scenario else and it's
like being the 747 7 on the runway pops
in there and of course everyone starts
losing their shit this is like sitting
on top yeah well or like there's planes
on approach or planes to get ready taxi
to take off and suddenly just like a
big-ass jumbo just blank on the on the
runway and it's like the most
embarrassing terrible thing
do what's and it's like you need I think
you should just basically at that point
log out start over but no then they'll
just try and take off without clearance
it just really flex everything up I'd
imagine on those servers that's pretty
easy to get banned for life - oh yeah if
you fuck up once these servers are
typically being run by real pilots and
ATC personnel like they're not like
doing just enthusiasts like a lot of
them are real pilots yeah what's the
what's the other good one other than
flight so it's like as a X plane next
plane yeah so so I was over a Graham's
house and he I was like the whole ho
test setup from the thrust master and so
I'm sitting out it's all metal and
everything I'm sitting down he puts up X
plane and we're just sitting there just
kind of fucking around with so we bring
up the x5 you know the like the the one
of the jet that broke like Mach five or
whatever base got to be launched like a
missile from a plane okay and he's like
he's like if you can get this off the
ground you're like magical because you
can't really take off it's not designed
to take off just aside the land after it
runs out of fuel right so I just kept
punching it over and over and over again
it took me like 12 tries but I finally
got it up off the ground and once off
the ground it was basically just like a
projectile traveling at Mach 5 that was
completely uncontrollable and then came
down like a lawn dart but I got that
sumbitch off the ground those little big
nificent thing you'd never seen it was
like going down in the grass sideways
looked like one fin in the ground but it
wasn't catching anything enough to blow
the aircraft over to rip anything apart
and then they just hit a bump and it was
just enough to get the nose up and then
it just took off like a rocket yes
pretty epic only true are there any car
racing games like that I erase things
probably the most realistic not the most
graphically pretty but it's the most
realistic and then there's project cars
project cars to the said of course so I
heard spark owes getting into the
simulator game spark oh this should be
interesting the guys that make the seats
they make more than just seats but yeah
they because what else did it make they
also it make a lot of equipment they
make the seats to make the gear they
make you know the gloves shoes they make
the communications I think they also
make steering wheels ok so yeah they're
they're getting into the are seat of the
simulator scene should be interesting I
think I think it'd be kind of cool to
see a simulator built by a company that
literally has like a in real world
racing
I mean I'd imagine like I racing and
shit consults you know consults a lot of
people to do that
be a little different if the company
started out having that heritage to
begin with and like everybody at the
company was knowledgeable and racers
yeah I know a lot of people that swear I
racing though is a very realistic
simulator like even all the dirt fish
guys train on it listen you can hear the
the piano instructor next door playing
hold on oh did you stop here
I'll do coconut monkey just uh just
neutered you js2 nuts
he got neutered brand james campbell you
just want a ban no just kidding said
he's into rally and dirt rallies cool i
guess i like dirt rally dirt
what is it dirt for is pretty good too i
I kind of like dirt for the only problem
with those games though is that the
rally stages are too real isn't it major
Jerry really doesn't know what's Parker
doesn't but calls himself a car guy
serious I am Marco doesn't build cars
they build supporting stuff for racers
I'm kind of surprised though you didn't
know his Park Louis
well I knew they made like racing suits
that's about all I doll I really need to
ask i reveai racing would be cool yeah
it's called i racing you can get in a
new oval a new road you can do dirt now
I believe it as well so it's like
anything what NASCAR actually it's fun
to be in you know the new gen threes are
the gen fours whatever they are right
doing 200 miles per hour around Daytona
when you've got 20 people around you in
VR it's pretty white-knuckle it's kind
of and you've you've done this before
right anyone that says oh just through
looks so boring turning left in a pack
at 200 miles per hour is not the easiest
thing to do no you actually gave me a
pretty good wake-up call when we played
around with NASA actually make a video
on that a long time no you know I made a
video about doing the GT for it Lime
Rock the or sudsy the z4 gt3 yeah yeah I
remember you were like show me or show
me how you can literally like draft
behind a car to unsettle it and stuff
like that and there's all the strategies
and team driving and stuff like that and
I was like it you know to the to the
untrained eye and literally looks like a
bunch of guys just going really fast in
a circle but no it's pretty surprising
like it's like it's like a little game
of chess going on you have to plan kind
of everything in advance with like work
with what you have
yeah and even when you're in the back
sometimes you want to be in the back you
don't want to be in the French then you
can like upset the guy and cause drag on
his car and drain his fuel and shit I
mean it's it's weird cuz that's the
stuff you don't see right you don't
realize it's happening unless somebody
like physically points it out while
they're doing I've also called plenty of
times to like when when you watch me and
I racing where I'll sit there and after
three or four laps trying to pass a guy
continue to make the same move that he
seblak right only to suddenly be like
okay Jerry no watch this I'm gonna bait
him up here and I'm gonna dart down blah
blah and you've seen me do it like
totally baked someone into moving their
vehicle in position allow me to get by
so I remember it everything you said you
were gonna do you actually did like you
you even said like you got I remember
you got up on one of the guys quarter
panels and you just hung there and
you're like watch he'll get it he'll get
unsettled in the corner and sure enough
he backed off because his ass end was
starting to come out right and it was
cuz you're just hanging out next to when
I was like oh shit knows what my car was
taking just enough air off of his
spoiler to where yeah yeah and I never
realized that I never real that like
that I I mean I understand aerodynamics
with cars and downforce and stuff like
that but I didn't realize that upsetting
the airflow off of one of the edges of
the car is enough to really upset it but
at those speeds it's like little things
fuck with it bad mm-hmm makes time and
and it was kind of cool to see you do
that because it's like you can actually
strategize about that and be like oh
okay
if I can't get the guy here on the
street then I'll just I'll bide my time
until I can get into that position and
upset them and then once you do that you
screw or when you have a car that's
that's slightly slower in the street but
it's a little bit better in the corners
yep then you can actually allow them to
start to go by you on the outside on the
street but then they can't they can't
hold their the the line on the turn so
they losing all that distance again in
the in the turn so it becomes it's a lot
of fun it's a lot of strategy involved
and I think people just don't give it
like the amount of respect that NASCAR
actually deserves and though in those
cars are never settled - that's the
other thing is when you're running right
at the ragged edge and you're drafting
somebody it's like you go into a corner
it's like the cars just doing this the
whole time mm-hmm like it never it never
seems cuz I was playing it wasn't I
racing it was another game on xbox I
think I was called like NASCAR thunder
or something like that and it was a
while ago and I was playing it and I
remembered that it had a training mode
on it and like the next thing it's like
oh when you're drafting at this or
whatever you can gain speed and then you
could like basically come out in the
corner and as you come out you basically
slow them down and then you can pass
them yeah go into the straightaway and
it's like as soon as you do that
maneuver the car just starts doing this
and then once you get up to you know a
higher speed then you could achieve
before the car the whole time down the
straightaway is just doing this well but
not only that - depending on the track
you can have a car that's loose and
turning one and two and tighten three
and four how just different different
variations of the turn it might be
slightly different Bank degree you know
stuff like that so
weird yeah I've never really seen the
suspension geometry under a NASCAR
dominant Speedway is a perfect example
of like a track that can be tight and
turn in one one and two or loosen one
and two and tighten three and four it's
just it's fun I think it's fun
a lot of people relatively boring so
youyou told me too that you're the one
that I think asked the question when I
was playing for is that does NASCAR
actually run on tracks they have left
and right-handed turns and you said you
have it it's a completely different car
right well it looks the same but the
setup is completely different god brakes
have been actually usable going out of
zone right and it's like you know
Duralast max the official break of
nascar and it's like yeah the circuit
where they we rarely ever touch them I
was watching a Netflix show on racing or
whatever and like Dale Earnhardt jr. is
staying there he's like it's like so
what kind of breaks do these cars having
these like breaks the only time we ever
touch the brakes coming to the pit you
got to ride that sumbitch all the way I
can't break I can for who the driver was
it was actually a road a road course
driver and it was like old school but
basically he came in and then one of the
interviewers was like so how'd the
breaks and he's like I don't know never
touched him there's like just enough
break in the car basically like just
enough to scrub the speed as you're
coming into the pit and that's it but
yeah it's like you don't you don't touch
the brakes in a NASCAR on an oval track
yeah I mean coming in coming into pit
road and then like stopping in your pit
box that's kind of the only time you use
your brakes you don't touch them in the
turns you I mean like even Bristol like
super tight tracks
it's engine braking and just drag you
know I mean yeah yeah funny thing is
those cars they don't look very
aerodynamic either I mean they may very
well be but just looking at them they
don't look they're dynamic they're
really not they just have brute brutal
amount of horsepower yeah it's like why
eight eight or nine hundred horsepower
naturally aspirated
they are the most they're like the most
basic builds I mean it's it's yeah
they're carbureted right isn't that like
a requirement yeah they're carbureted
they had the three make the three
essentials air fuel and spark and it's
like there's no computer-controlled
anything in those cars
like even gauges are like well no the
newer gauges are like
now we're four years they were
mechanical gauges you know so it's like
it's about as basic as you can get but
the car still like a quarter million
dollars it don't they put like the
ignition coils like in the dashboard so
that the driver can actually reach up
and basically unplug it if he needs to
like if there's an electrical fire I
don't know if that's why it's there I
know like the MSD ignition coils and
stuff we're usually in the cab I think
yeah you can see I think it was a
classical just to get it away from heat
better more but like you would also see
like the the brake fluid reservoir and
the clutch reservoir and all this stuff
also in the cab and I think that's what
they could get I on them but I just have
because it's not like you got a lot of
gauges or anything you like a
speedometer and like a shitty they even
have a speedometer they just attack a
governor Jesus yeah all that sends like
a tachometer oil temp oil pressure water
temp voltage I think I don't even know
voltages in there but so we got know
what happened nine more minutes we need
we need to have we this has been far too
late this has been normal which car
talkin too much car talk dude we got to
talk about like tack and news they're
fuel-injected now Wow
well I know that they I know part of the
problem with NASCAR is the fact they've
been getting too fast I mean there was a
restrictor plate racing right the way to
slow down the cars were to put a
restrictor plate underneath the in taken
on top of the carburetor you know so
it's like a fuel in there yeah they were
they would just literally limit the my
bear that could get in there so so when
are we going back to dirt fish Jay when
you tell me we're going we gotta we
gotta go do that again I gotta I gotta
get that worked out is that was fun
last time but we you know it this time
we got to do the STI is though I would
totally lost you did you did the
rear-wheel drive now you got to see what
it actually in the dirt like most cars
do on the pavement like yeah it's it's a
whole different world like I could not
believe what we got in those cars
how anemic the BRS these are and how how
slippery they are at low speeds like the
STI does not want to turn it all unless
you commit a lot of speed yeah like
you'll just turn in the corner it's like
they did the BRZ just wants to the a
sane just comes out of like 10 miles an
hour it's like an STI only you'll turn
the wheels nothing will happen
I see you've quite a few people saying
that it's to protect it from heat soak
moving the ignition boxes inside that
was my guess is that it was to get it
away from the heat because I mean those
tracks get stupid hot well not only that
but imagine this
when you're on a Super Speedway like
tattle-tell adiga or Daytona or whatever
right yep these guys are sitting like
near redline constantly they're just
pinned the entire time
sure so I mean they're very rarely even
having to lift in any of the turn so
it's just like sitting like eight nine
thousand rpm non-stop forever so it's
like I don't even know what kind of heat
buildup would be in there and then of
course they want to go as fast as they
can so they run as much tape as they can
on the front which means very little
airflow through the hood so plus if
you're drafting another car you're
basically robbing airflow from the
engine compartment right yeah which is
what's just the thing like you can go
faster when you draft but you're gonna
run hotter and you could potentially
kill your shit so you've got it like
strategically pop out and get fresh air
hey over-talking NASCAR again I must
stop my redneck out it's reenact I love
now let's talk about gonna lay out my
cables doing it on a book put down
through four pointers wisest
you get you seriously can't hear that
that loud hum I heard like a little bit
of like clicking when you were moving
the cable but no hum oh god I heard ow
headphone rip headphone users what I'm
wiggling happily at the car table
because I was wiggling my leg let's see
I'm just looking at seeing it to see if
anything pops out at me that's crazy I'm
not I'm not seeing anything fantastic
beast to like ended the first one was
even done tighten left turn addition you
want to know how you make a NASCAR race
interesting Wow I think at the halfway
point they have to flip around and go
right their car so they're also there
all of their camber and stuff is
adjusted for those concept because it's
like the right side will be heavily
negative camber and the left side of the
car be heavily positive camber on a
NASCAR when they're turning left to get
all that bite imagine suddenly they're
turning the direction that the wheels
are leaning that'd be weird and
massively dangerous I think it'd be
great
hey you uh you're familiar with like the
LG o LED screens right I've got a couple
myself yes do they make those an 84-inch
or bigger I don't think so I think 70 or
something like six I think 75 is the
biggest right beside my projector is
just on its
last leg about to die drive like 75
bucks and get one them sony 4k
projectors no no I don't want another
projector I'm projected out after seeing
the contrast on these o LED screens and
shit it's just it's not even obtainable
with a billion dollar it's like nah boss
it sucks at times because there's times
where you think your TV's off but it's
not it's just showing a black screen and
the blacks are so black you think it's
off like I've dealt with us many times
but I don't care I don't even care I
just I want something that the bulb
doesn't burn out on every 3,000 hours I
want something that doesn't get
progressively dimmer the more you use it
you know like so you're saying is that
the rate you will enjoy TV it burns out
every three weeks yes
I much burned through a bulb about every
eight months what about did you ever
have a DLP screen uh-oh don't I did
actually yeah I had a BenQ back in the
day they cut with the color wheel in it
oh geez those are those were ones that
like constantly had were a problem with
burning out bulbs or spider webs and you
know they did this thing called a
rainbow effect and it like if you watch
certain scenes where it was really
bright white and you moved your head it
would like you'd see this really
psychedelic like rainbow yeah outline on
everything those really bizarre only
apparently only some people can see it
but I'm susceptible to it so bugs have
an inch I was close I said 75 is the
biggest is 77 is the biggest well how
much how much does 77 a check of I bro
downsize that I can price right with
that see your LG 77 is Samsung makes an
LED that's 84 inches but that's not an
OLED but there's isn't a no LED so it
doesn't have that crazy-ass black level
right yeah they do make an LG OLED 86
okay hold on I'm looking 7,500 a
projector couldn't do it if we were one
of those AMD guys would be having a
flash you know I said the same thing
Excalibur until I saw it in person and
the contrast ratio of this 4k projected
the Sony projector even with ambient
light I was impressed but still suddenly
the thing was like that projector you
could take it up to like a hundred and
something like hundred and forty inches
or something ridiculous
what was the lid you're over the lumen
output was don't recall okay but it was
a Sony it was a Sony and it was like
dead silent see Sony 4k projector
I'm gonna see her they on sale an hour
was like a
yes thing there was a price reduction
they were ten thousand when they came
out and then like when we were at Best
Buy looking at them they were like the
price was reduced 7,500 so I don't know
the 2017 model the VP l VW khd our home
theater projector is $5,000
I came down even more and it's agent
yeah if this is the one and only one
left in style think about what it
requires for projector to be HDR
standard right and to meet the HD HDR 10
standard and a projector that's pretty
impressive it's got a six thousand hour
battery life so that's double the bet
our sorry no battery lamp life that's
double the lamp life of most of them but
think about it how do you how do you get
HDR out of a light emitting source right
right when you can't control black yeah
that's a maybe maybe that's got to be
like if you're in a pitch-black room it
can control the completely shut off the
light to the screen at that pits all
right um okay so this one does 83 inches
up to 167 inch at a 12 foot throw to a
16 foot throw that's actually not bad at
all that means that I could project
easily 83 in my space but it's 1500
lumens which honestly isn't isn't that
bright yeah like I think maybe this is
the one you were talking about though
there's probably a more expense I don't
know anything about projector tech I
mean honest oh never mind there's like a
ton of them this one's wait this one's
1500 lumens
we're just going through some curious
cuz I don't want another projector
though but I do have a really nice
projector screen that's the other thing
that's eaten me is I feel I have a
$3,000 SI black diamond 1.4 game screen
which is like an amazing gray screen
yeah I think I feel you Doug I feel yeah
yeah I just got if I could get because
the the big TV uh how heavy are they by
the way like are they pretty light the
like the thin I don't know geo LEDs oh
no they're not like light so if I got
one of these seven inches Israeli Sun
200 pounds or something no no no both of
mine are 6.5 inches I want to say that
they're like 50 pounds well that's not
bad 350 pounds I mean it's way heavier
than like an LED LCD right but yeah
they're not that they're not incredibly
light but they're not as heavy as plasma
was for sure yeah what's the what's the
Samsung equivalent Oh LED are like close
it's not like you LED or something like
that I can't recall
I know it's it's pretty impressive those
looking at it I'm liking this led race
because the price is shooting down
because of it yeah they were nuts let's
see yeah because I know Samsung makes a
really really really big one I was
looking at the other night it was it was
80 is either 82 or 84 inches let me see
if I can here Samsung 84 no wonder 80
forks this is this is what I want yeah
this is gonna be my Christmas present if
I can find a store that's closed up at
night does that big bars on the on the
windows oh let's see here just let's see
your Samsung Q LED damnit where is it
yeah the Q LEDs don't look like they go
up that big either 70 inches on up let
me see if I can find on here oh here we
go
alright I'm into the was 75 inches only
$4,000 actually I mean compared to the
projectors that's not bad at all I guess
uh let's see what's the four thousands
oh shit
88 inch Q LED smart TV guess what the
prices on it
twenty thousand dollars no think of the
2017 model its eighty eight inch 4k
Ultra HD let's see what it says here get
more than a billion colors with quantum
dot Q LED technology
let's see absolutely stunning black
levels designed for no it's a no bezel
screen this is a the Samsung Samsung LED
let's see Hugh LED invisible oh it's got
the invisible connection thing that goes
through the wall
yeah from going from 77 inches to 88
it's it's it's quadruple the price but I
think that's because you're looking at a
traditional TV on the 77 and more of a
wallpaper TV for the 84 or 86 wherever
it is which is a whole different tack so
you got that ribbing
hold on I think I found the LG one that
dude was talking about it's an LG 86
inch 4k all but it's not LED it's just
it's just regular but in it but it's a
2017 model so they're still making them
this big I guess they just can't do it
no LED jam it but it's not it's not bad
I mean I think gals know I think like
I'm seeing it's just the
cost-effectiveness of OLED at that size
yes and then that's got the fake-ass 120
Hertz refresh rate yeah I wish it was
real god I'd buy it in a second if I
could connected a computer get 120 Hertz
anything is the panels can do it
obviously so what the fuck's the hold up
like the electronics inside right just
they decode it like it which cost what
like 20 more bucks on a $6,000 TV come
on no like I would know I don't know I
just turn on the TV it looks cool and
I'm happy
wait this supports HDR though are there
non cue LED screens that support HDR
okay so LG's early OLED stuff didn't
have hdmi 2.0 so it was able to do the
so called HDR over streaming like
netflix and stuff but if you plugged in
a 4k blu-ray player the benefit of 4k
blu-ray players not just the scale with
HDR over the over your optical and hdmi
but you didn't get that even get the
advantage of it over HDMI cuz it wasn't
it was 1.6 it wasn't 2.0 I got so the
newer one that I have the b6p
it's it's the HDMI 2.0 so that's why
that ones downstairs and the other ones
upstairs so my 4k blu-ray player can
actually send a HDR signal to the TV
gotcha
that makes sense hi this is tempting oh
my god it's $2,000 off right now
well oh man 86 inch but it's a night
it's an IPS panel though so it probably
have a really wide viewing you gonna
have to go look at it in person and see
what they look like it's like who the
fuck carries an eighth-note nobody has
like an 86 inch in stock that you can
look at video yeah by with a magnolia
center it will oh you actually do so you
think Best Buy would have something that
big yeah absolutely
if the Best Buy has one of the Magnolia
home centers they will have that stuff
on display like ok that's the whole
point of the Magnolia home center do
this thing has like no bezel on it and
if you look at the back it's like
completely flat like there's no
protrusion on the back so you can hang
it on those Wesley wrote said oh my god
that's a whole Russian bride want a TV I
think it's time to wrap it up I gotta go
get a trailer so you go and you're meet
with a guy that lives on the trailer
talking about NASCAR no good good
trailer yeah just getting all boned up
for your new meat all right dude alright
guys thanks for watching remember no
tech talk next Thursday
because of the holiday so you gotta
consume mass quantities and actually I
think the week after two we might be
hosed unless we do it early or on when
day because I'm gonna be on a plane
Thursday dude I don't see any rule that
doesn't say that we can't have an
occasional out-of-band show that's on a
different day like we're gonna have just
got I don't want to get into the old
like you know we missed two weeks in a
row kind of thing so I just pick a day
we'll figure it out we'll find a time
we'll make it happen at least once a
week and if we got like moot and Aguila
it's fine
all right guys well thanks for watching
and I'm gonna rule the no true role that
outro Barclays wants a big TV bug you
would think I would make a new outro or
intro at some point considering this one
we've grown together in five minutes one
time never should you never should ever
never ever change that's trademark</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
