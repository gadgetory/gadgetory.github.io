we're gonna take a look at the new
flagship case from fractal design this
kind of came is the last minute we
weren't really expecting to see this in
2017 yet here it is the define r6 it's
not really a successor to the r5 at
least none in my opinion because there's
enough design changes enough complete
redesign of the entire case in the way
it works though I don't feel like it's
actually I don't you can tell it has
heritage from the r4 in the r5 but it
definitely takes it all of that and
makes its own new chassis fixing a lot
of things a lot of us have complained
about with the past and adding some new
features that we didn't even know we
wanted until we saw it the all-new
mastered liquid 120 and 240 l RGB
coolers provide an easy and reliable way
to keep your processor nice and cool
they're all new dual chamber pump and
low resistance radiator offer a higher
transfer of heat for both Intel and AMD
CPUs while six preset lighting effects
in RGB ensure that the 120 and 240 ll
seamlessly match your color design
choice make it yours by following the
link in the description below so the
very first thing you should be able to
see that's different obviously is we
have a full tempered glass side panel it
runs the entire length its frameless if
you will there's no frame around it like
some have there's no screw holes
there's no brackets holding it on it's
it's the cleanest side panel on the
market at least as far as I'm concerned
I keep this rag handy now because any
time I move the case I'm touching the
glass but it actually has thumb screws
on the back that it are pre-installed
when it's shipped because they don't
want to pop out but it is a completely
tool this side panel because it has as
you can see these little nubbins if you
are at there we'll call them nubbins and
they just pop right in right there and
then you've got the front which looks
like kind of like a standard side panel
right with this little rail right here
but then when you want to put it on you
just line it up on the front
and then pop it down and that's it and
that is not going our wipe off my
fingerprints again that's the only
downside about tempered glass obviously
it's just like you want to keep it clean
because it looks terrible fingerprints
now fractal told me they were they were
comfortable with me doing this because
they do it themselves to show how tight
it is ladies it's not going anywhere
that's not popping off so as long as
you're not running around through a case
glass side down hitting bumps or going
off-roading
I don't think there's gonna be a problem
let's go and pop this off though because
yeah we're gonna do a teardown in this
thing now the back is actually the same
so the stump screws that ship in the
back once you pop them out it's the
exact same retention mechanism in fact I
wonder could you order another glass
side panel and show off the back if you
did not I know if you would really care
oh my god you can hmm
so if you had a really clean wiring job
if you had custom link cables that were
made and it looks super pretty like some
of those cases you see you could
actually show it off this way that'd be
neat have them on both sides I don't
even think about that tool right now
before we talk about the inside of the
case there's something I want to fix on
here real quick for whatever reason the
r-series case is always shipped with the
door opening right to left like this
which doesn't make sense to me because
with the panel being on this side and
this orientation tells you the case is
gonna be on your right so opening the
door like this never made that much
sense to me so you've got these hinges
right here to unscrew this and then you
just apply it to the other side and
screw it on to the hinge over here and
then put it back on in the exact reverse
order of how you took it off and then
you switch the side so now let's say I
think that that's that's the way it
should ship I don't know why they do it
this way but whatever so now this opens
the way that it's supposed to giving you
access to your front side air filter
exposing our two pre-installed 140
millimeter front intake fans and also
this case retains something that I feel
like it's kind of rare these days which
is a five and a quarter Bay Drive you
could use this for a five and a quarter
reservoir five and a quarter bay drive
fan controller whatever a lot of cases
these days has just been a mini
entirely where they're not including any
of that because we're going for the
super clean all fan front-end at least
practical gives you the option to retain
at least one of those devices
if you want it speaking of the front
filter it's got sort of a screen type
material like that you can find on a
Windows screen it's not super super fine
but it's still going to stop your dust
and your debris from getting inside your
case but it's not going to hinder the
airflow too much so that's a nice thing
to see and then of course for air intake
the design has been proven to work
plenty of times plenty of ventilation
right here on the side of the case
because as you can see the fans are
recessed back what you can see that the
fans are actually behind the vents
instead of being even with the vents
which some cases have unfortunately made
the mistake of doing so plenty of air
intake for the front speaking of fan
filters we do have a filter that runs
the entire length of the bottom of the
case so if you have rear bottom intake
fans like Puget systems likes to use at
least one pin on the bottom bringing air
in you also have your power supply on
the back the same exact screen material
as on the front gives you protection for
both the bottom intake fans that might
be there as well as your power supply
but it's accessible from the front
that's a good move some people tend to
put them access in the back which is a
terrible idea especially if this is
against a wall or something now as you
can see the top of the case is a solid
panel that's because the way ships from
the factory is a very cross flow design
now this is their new mod you vent
design in the past to get the vents out
you had to open up the case put your
hand in and kind of pop out the
individual panels there were three
panels pop them out to get access to the
fans or to install fans or whatever now
we've got this push button design right
here with the push of one button you get
access flips to the mod you've any
single piece as you can also see that we
do have our filter right here in our
vent very similar to this guy so that
when you remove the mod you bent cover
you can put the the filter and the vent
back on exposing airflow for your rear
or your top exhaust fans your radiators
whatever it might be now speaking of the
top vents they've redesigned this a
little bit where the 120 millimeter fans
used to be offset to give you more
clearance
radiators but the 140s were still
centered which the problem was if you
wanted to do 140 radiators it might
impact on some motherboards when it
hangs down buy them off sensing the hole
offsetting the whole thing now we have
tons of clearance for motherboards that
have high vrm heat sinks and such but
look at this we also have an included
fill port hole so you can take a fill
port if you're doing a custom loop mount
it to this and give yourself easy access
to top off your loop if you need to
without even having to go inside the
case because of the button right here
and the quick release mod you vent or
top vent so we've got right here is a
fairly aesthetically pleasing wall that
I would say as a modder this would be a
good canvas to etch something or paint
something or make a lighted lip panel in
some way these have got these thumb
screws all they reveal is the backside
of the harddrive cages and where they
mount they put this on there to make it
pretty
unfortunately if you're going to be
using all the harddrive cages you've got
to leave this wall in there however if
you don't want all the harddrive cages
which I'm about to show you on the
backside these do have screws which are
standard screws are not riveted in there
so this whole wall comes out exposing
this as to a giant open chassis we also
have this PSU shroud right here that's
become like the norm in 2016 and 2017
PSU shrouds hide your power supply
pretend they're not there why show off
all the cables where they're bunched up
at the bottom so this has become the
standard and obviously this is the first
time we've seen this with a define R
series case we saw this and things like
the Mesha Phi and whatnot but we didn't
see this in the r5 because it kind of
became the norm
after the r5 was already launched as you
can see it's fully vented so we have the
plenty of airflow going down to the
power supply if you have the fan facing
up or if you have it face down remember
we have that full length ventilation on
the bottom and the filter allowing us to
be able to make sure that everything's
clean but you have plenty of airflow to
your power supply I mean after all
there's a fan in there it needs airflow
got a nice thick grommet right here
thick rubber that doesn't feel like it's
gonna tear easily like some cases in the
past we've also got plenty of grommet
passages right here along the
motherboard tray and on the top right
here for things like fan
CPU EPS power cables and all that but
the biggest change which some of you
have probably already noticed is the
fact that it supports ei TX motherboards
finally that was one of the things that
kept me from using fractal cases because
a lot of my builds have a ATX
motherboards and this now supports it I
don't know why that was so hard in the
past but I digress here it is EA TX
support in an RFI are assuming oh let's
call an RFID and then our six we'd like
to see that now make its way over to the
s-series chassis x' but anyway moving on
to the back now you can see a completely
redesigned way of installing the hard
drives
you have the sleds but it said them
being a squeeze sled that slide in and
out it's got one captive thumb screw and
it's got this little bracket right here
that mounts onto that wall that I showed
you you can fit on here obviously your
three and a half inch mug up in
motherboards three and half inch hard
drives two and a half inch SSD is a two
and a half inch drives it simply pushes
in like this one screw to mount it now
in terms of how many of these you can
fit in here if you bought extra sleds
because there are options available for
this case you can fit a pretty
substantial amount of hard drives in
here so if we're talking three and a
half inch drives right standard three
and half inches thick hard drives you
could fit one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven because down
have they get closer together for SSDs
so you have two space one in between
down here so 11 3/2 1/2 inch hard drives
will fit right here making it perfect
for things like home servers Plex
servers workstations with tons of hard
drive space needed eleven plus room for
two two and a half inch SSDs right here
plus whatever n dot two drives you might
have available on your motherboard or if
you have something like an asus with dim
dot 2 plus the motherboards you could
fit a ridiculous amount of storage on
here now because of the notch right here
on the back of these sleds you have
plenty of room to route your cables up
and down to all of these they're not
going to be squished against the panel
the back panel but you also have them
offset this way so you have plenty of
room for a 30 millimeter radiator
attached to the fans right here so 30
mil thickness would fit no problem
remove the sled you can go as thick as
you want as we're about to show you but
that's a pretty neat design so you can
retain both
hard drives and your radiators on the
front something else it's nice to see
here is we have an included fan hub that
has a PWM supply right here as well as
they say two power supply so you can
have three PWM control devices or more
than likely just fans and you can also
have an additional six plugged in that
are still controlled off PWM that don't
have to be PWM fans so three PWM fans as
well as six a six-way hub right here for
regular fans making a single point of
connection for your all of your fans
with your water cooling this it's it's
literally like they actually listened to
people that's pretty awesome if you ask
me alright moving forward let's go ahead
and remove this cage on this wall so you
can see just how open the chassis can be
so you got two screws on the top right
here two screws on the bottom and then
it looks like there are gonna be some
right here behind the front panel so
once you take this guy off and this guy
off so once that's out you can see
you've got this pretty widely open
chassis that gives you all the room for
massive radiator and reservoir up front
radiator on top technically radiator on
the back if you want with lots of of
radiator support but you lose all of the
hard drive support with the exception of
the two and a half inch available right
here on the back there's actually some
optional upgrades to this case that are
available as well if we take a look at
the center connectivity on the front
you've got your power button you've got
your reset button mic and headphones two
USB 2.0 s into USB 3.0 s however if you
wanted to update that you can actually
upgrade it basically with the same exact
connector here but it includes a USB
type-c 3.1 gen 3 gen 2 whatever it is
but that is an optional add-on but of
course it wouldn't be 2017 if we didn't
have a vertical GPU mount option so of
course we've got our riser card right
here plugs into your motherboard and
then we've got screw kit that comes with
it this is an optional piece so this is
something that you'll have to consider
if you want this either at the time of
purchase or add it on later
it's got additional standoffs that screw
into the shroud all right so you just
mount the riser card down to the
standoffs that you just installed so
when it comes to length I decided to
kind of pull out all the stops and
hold out my 1080 hall-of-fame because
this is a very long card as you can see
it's actually a little bit bigger than a
two slot it's like a two and a half slot
which is gonna push it somewhat close to
the to the glass panel so that's
something to keep in mind the amount of
space you're gonna have right here could
choke off the intakes on the fan but if
you're running a 2 slot card obvious
here and have plenty of room where a
water water-cooled graphics card of
course you have plenty of room but if we
take a look now at this we should still
have plenty of room for our wall right
there yes yes we do so as you can see
barely it barely fits look at that right
there Nick that barely fits but as you
can see that's actually pretty Mielec
fills out that space pretty nice there's
anything the white card looks awesome
but the black contrast so I think the r6
is one of the most versatile cases on
the market today especially with how
much they've achieved in a mid-tower
case because like I said full water
cooling support with the retention of
hard drive brackets if you're gonna be
running slim rads or 30 mil rads on the
front you can fit rads on the top while
retaining the front radiator and the
hard drive cages and a vertical mount
and the PSU shroud toolless removal of
the side panels probably the cleanest
looking side panel yet in my opinion
when it comes to tempered glass without
brackets or screws it's really hard to
see how it could possibly get any better
now it does actually come in two other
options our other colors as well we've
got black which is this one with the
white hardware we got blackout which is
black with the black hardware
you've got gunmetal which is actually
the one I had requested but they sent me
black but whatever I digress I'm not
salty about that and there's also white
white with black hardware which I think
would look phenomenal I think I'm gonna
get a white one I think I want to do a
build in a white one but yeah I imagine
this imagine this graphics card in a
white case Nick with like all the white
parts we can get like the white tough
series for Macy's and all that that
would look I've never done a white build
and I kind of want to do that but anyway
you guys know what to do if you've got
comments put them down below tell me
what you think about this case what
would you change if there was something
you think that's really standing out to
you that this case should have had that
it doesn't like integrated lighting I
think that's something I always
mentioned but I know cost is hard on
that put it down in the comments below
I'd like to hear your opinions but I
have a hard time seeing how this one can
really get much better anyway I'm gonna
go guys
thanks for watching as always we'll see
you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
