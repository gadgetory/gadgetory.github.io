said to do the power of Starbucks and
monster and cocaine and well no not
cocaine that is illegal and entirely
immoral we've been able to make some
headway here upon returning from my trip
to Chicago where I had a famous Chicago
deep-dish pizza which I might add was
actually scrumptious but we are quite a
bit off-topic already now I've been able
to actually make some Headroom here on
project red mist as you can see behind
me hopefully you can see if you can't
see I'll be sure to upload the Braille
version well you know guys
project red mist is kind of a love-hate
relationship I love working with this
kind of hardware I hate the fact that it
takes up so much room here in my office
and parts storage in the other room and
when I start working on this just the
massive mess it makes in this place so
it gets a little bit frustrating so that
means it's time to get this project up
in the hell on out of here because I
have some other stuff I need to work on
like for instance getting rid of my 900
D and hopefully getting a nice case to
put my stuff in but anyway how I just
kick the table yeah so here it is as you
can see from the last update which you
guys kind of dubbed Project redness part
2.5 which I guess is pretty much fair I
mean it only had the acrylic tubing here
put in really which wasn't much of an
update but I wanted to give you guys
something before I left to Chicago so
here we are part 4 and what I've got
actually quite a bit done here but we
still have a lot to go as you can see
we've got the 560 rad down here on the
bottom and I want to address this first
because I've been fielding a lot of
questions on Twitter and Facebook and
comments and everything asking why did I
go with AF 140 fans why didn't I go with
SP 140 fans well guys I challenge you to
link me to an SP 140 fan from Corsair
they do not make a static pressure 140
millimeter fan but that brings me to the
point of the static pressure versus
airflow
and if you didn't know AF is airflow SP
is static pressure these radiators that
I'm using these alpha cool Nexus
radiators are eight fins per inch eight
fpi does not a lot of resistance in
there whatsoever so the AF fans are
going to have no problem pushing air
through this radiator whatsoever up here
on the top though in the four eighty I
do have SP 120 simply because it's
available why not but the point is we're
not going to be losing any sort of
cooling capacity down here whatsoever by
going with the AF fan so I just wanted
to go ahead and put that out there now
if you guys ask me any more questions
about why did you go with AF and not SP
I'm not going to add I'm going to answer
it I'm going to acknowledge that
question because quite honestly I'm sick
of that question there are other fans on
the market sure there are better 140
millimeter fans out there that I could
have chosen but I like the aesthetics of
the Corsair fans I think they meet the
build perfectly with the little bit of
accent color I do like the fact that
they have multiple rings on there we
could have gone with white or something
if the red was too much I just like the
fans so use whatever fan you guys like
obviously if you don't like these fans
tough shit quite honestly it's not your
computer now there's some other stuff
that's been going on here I've got the
front fans mounted as you can see these
are AF 120s sp1 40s on the 480 up top I
just want to point out do you see the
difference in size between the 560 and
the 480 it is absolutely massive and
gargantuan this radiator down here is
only going to be cooling the to 780ti s
which are going to be overclocked but as
you can see here I do have the
reservoirs mounted now I mentioned in a
previous video that I was going to be
doing something different with the
reservoirs that I hadn't really seen
done before and what I did was I did an
acrylic stand acrylic mounting plate
here if you will and then they've got
about an inch and a half
nylon spacers in the back that it's
mounted off of the back wall and you
guys can see that through some of the
glamour shots here and why did I do that
well I'm going to be putting LED
lighting behind that that is going to
eliminate illuminate behind this panel
which is going to give it the effect of
kind of floating so I thought that
that's going to look really cool the
buyer really likes it you know I got the
acrylic made myself which also brings us
to the point of the acrylic floor on
here
because the case does have fan cutouts
in there I've come up with a false floor
that I had cut and then I had to sand it
and mold it and file it to make it fit
perfectly in here to look like it was
100% part of the case which is going to
kind of serve two purposes one with the
acrylic because one it's going to give
us more reflectance in here because it's
a polished piece of plastic and it just
looks really smooth I really like the
way that this looks in fact I'll be
doing the same thing with my build when
I do mine so we are going to have white
LED strip along the bottom white LED
strip along the top and we're going to
have some white and red LEDs placed in
here that are going to give nice accents
where we want to focus on the red I
didn't want to go to red I didn't want
to do red LED fans I don't want red
bling everywhere because too much
lighting is actually worse looking than
not enough if you want my opinion on the
matter so that will come together a
little bit better the reservoirs as
we've talked about they are going to
come down in through the acrylic down
into the bottom with some adapters or me
going right here same thing with the the
graphics cards these are called video
cards that kind of I kind of forgot for
a second there every now and then I
forget my name and stuff so what was
that
I got the power supply mounted in the
back I've got the hard drives mounted in
the back and the front fans that you've
already mentioned now what is kind of
interesting here and I'm going to kind
of show you this do glamour shots as
I've gone ahead and installed the lower
just power distribution block for the
fans so the lower fans and the front
fans are running off the same eight port
power distribution block actually it's a
ten port I think power distribution
block so I have one power going into
they're going to be using voltage
reducers on these to slow down the speed
of the fans that way we don't need to
worry about the extra clutter of a fan
control or anything like that
slow speed is going to be more than
enough to keep these beasts cool and it
keeps things nice and tidy and as you
can see there's very very little wiring
showing whatsoever the fact that these
fans already wired up and you see
nothing either behind the tray or in the
front here just goes to show how clean
this build is going to be I've got the
drain port installed on the bottom and
it's got a t block on there which is
where the rest of the coolant is going
to go through and pretty much that's all
we've got done so far here I mean I
would have liked to have gotten more
done but I just got the other parts I
needed to get the rest of the tubing
done like I said we're going to PE T G
tubing rather than acrylic so I had to
get that in before I could really go any
farther all the LED strips are in now
the extra fittings I need it in now the
pumps need to be installed on the bottom
and then we're going to start buttoning
this thing up and getting it the hell
out of my office because as much as I
love it
I'm ready for this thing to go so I hope
you guys can kind of see now the way
it's coming together my idea for this
build I see it all in my head I hear
voices in there too usually they're not
much of a problem until they start
seeing things saying things like you
know kill kill kill ma ma mom stuff like
that and every now they'd have arguments
with myself
therapist says it is getting better it's
getting better but I haven't been taking
my meds lately so shut up things I have
left to do install the pumps get all the
plumbing down on the bottom going on
gotta bend a lot of acrylic tubing it's
going to probably take me as long as it
is that to get to this point it's gonna
take me just as long to bend just a
couple of tubes in here that I've got to
do to get this together but it's all
going to look good especially with the
two color loop going on the way the
lighting is you guys are just going to
have to wait to see my vision like I
said I stare at this case for hours at
times oh no I don't get anything done no
absolutely serious guys Miss J is walked
by plenty of times and seen me just
sitting here with my feet up on the desk
just staring at this imagining what it's
going to look like and planning it all
out in my head it's kind of like the
lego movie when they're building all the
Legos in their head in that little in
that scene when they're in dude's head
it's kind of like that for me I don't
draw it out I don't blueprint it I just
see it and then I build it so yeah
anyway I think the floating reservoir is
is going to be a neat point and it's
gonna be unique
I've not seen anybody else do that
especially with the backlighting on
there that's gonna make it look like
it's floating so you guys will get to
see that in part 5 because that's going
to be one of the next steps getting all
the wiring and the lighting put in there
and then the tubing and all that is
going to be absolutely last so guys I'm
gonna get on out of here hope you guys
have enjoyed part 4 tell me what you
guys think
hopefully you guys see it the way I do
and you can kind of imagine the way it's
gonna look when it's done especially
with the white and red loop independent
of each other yet crossing each other
it's going to look really good yeah it's
still gonna be minimalistic some people
had an issue like no no no don't do too
much tubing because too much tubing is
bad and this and that you you just have
to see it when it's done you'll see it's
gonna be exposed tubing but it's gonna
be clean and straight and it's just
gonna look really really slick when it's
all done and that's it's not like a
liquid cooling slick joke we're not
talking about slick from Linus tech tips
we're just saying slick isn't it's
really cool yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
