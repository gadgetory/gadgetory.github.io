make a video tonight but this is some
breaking news that really deserves a
video to get as many people aware of
this as possible and obviously if you've
seen the title of this video you would
know that frozen CPU seems to have shut
down their doors now we don't have any
specifics there's been no official
statement from frozen CPU this is all
coming secondhand from a former employee
of frozen CPU who was saying that the
owner basically was battling an
addiction I don't know that's alleged
but he's saying that that led to
something that happened at the warehouse
which apparently has caused damage that
the company cannot recover from and the
owner has fired everybody in the company
now that's quite a crazy story and in
fact I read that earlier today and I
just basically I didn't even make a
tweet about it because I was like I want
to know more about this this is a crazy
story before I start spreading things
and I'm not gonna go all keemstar so
basically what is looking like has
happened now because there's over 30
pages on this thread on overclock dotnet
which is down in the description if you
guys want to read it all for yourself
people have been trying to call the
company no one's answering somebody even
got the neighboring business next door
in Rochester New York to go over to the
business to see if anyone was there
there were no cars mail was in the
mailbox doesn't appear like anyone has
been there doors are locked and this was
in the middle of the day now frozen CPU
has operated like clockwork and has
never been shut down other than regular
holidays there's also another person
that's been posting that they're
tracking on their package that they sent
back for RMA keeps having a tracking
update that business is closed business
is closed
and so there's hasn't been anyone there
for days now apparently so the whole
reason I'm making this video is not just
to say hey guys frozen CPUs under some
sort of drama right now it's the fact
that the website is still up in fact
apparently all this went down in such a
manner that even the website has no
notice on there that they are currently
not filling orders and the problem is
people are still placing orders unaware
that there's no one there to fill their
orders
so my recommendation right now is if
you've made an order I would contact
your credit card company or your bake
institution and find out how you can go
about getting your money back because
apparently there's nobody there
fulfilling your orders lots of people in
this threat have also said that they
have not received their orders their
orders are still sitting under being
processed for days and overnight orders
weren't even filled let alone shipped
and that's very unusual for frozen CPU
extremely unusual if you guys haven't
placed your order together you have a
cart sitting in there just wait don't
order anything because you might end up
having a fight to get your money back
now the other thing that people are
mentioning in this thread is like oh
great I guess that means performance pcs
is gonna hike their prices up now
because they're really the only other
major option here in the United States
for water cooling part to me now there's
Micro Center in Sidewinder PC and stuff
but they just don't have the same
selection and pricing that performance
PCs and frozen CPU had I personally
talked to the owner of performance pcs
his name is Hank he has assured me he's
not going to capitalize on this he's not
going to raise prices he's not gonna
form a monopoly he is also under you
know strict guidelines of what he's
allowed to charge for these parts from
the manufacturers for themselves then
there's MSRP s he's not gonna go above
MSRP ever he's not changing his pricing
at all he's leaving it exactly as it is
it's just one retailer that apparently
is having some sort of issues here and
we need to get more information on that
so don't place an order if you've placed
an order I would start whatever process
you need to do to try and get your money
back nobody is that frozen CPU to refund
it for you right now and this is all
really terrible news because PC modding
and PC building is is a tight-knit group
and when the huge supplier like frozen
CPU goes under then it affects all of us
and especially guys like me who are
really into water cooling because that's
always been their specialty so there you
go guys share this video with people who
you think could benefit from this anyone
you think might have been shopping from
there or in any forums or communities
just share this video out so that people
know performance PC's is not going to
raise their price frozen CPU apparently
has gone under if you've made an order
you gonna have to fight for your money
if you're gonna make an order I would
wait until we hear from something the
last thing I wanted to mention was
a lot of people in this thread were like
well why has nobody from an official
representative from frozen CPU come out
and made a you know statement guys I've
been to frozen CPU in person they're in
Rochester New York they're near an
office of mine my New York office is
actually near there and I went and
visited them one day it was a small
mom-and-pop type of place less than 10
employees sole proprietorship not a
corporation not a skyrise doesn't have
you know on-site PR marketing and all
that sort of stuff guys it was being run
almost like out of a big house but just
a steel warehouse building by a private
sole proprietor ownership that's why
you're not seeing you know official
statements like this is the you know
freaking giant corporation like Nvidia
or something so that's why we haven't
seen anything come out of that so there
you go it's unfortunate news I hope it
turns out not to be true but I wanted to
make this video just to warn you guys
just in case
hold off on ordering anything from them
until we learn more if anything comes of
this between now and tech talk we'll
bring it up if anything comes of this at
all in the future we'll make sure to
make updates on Tech Talk which is on
Thursdays just make sure you guys follow
that and as always guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
