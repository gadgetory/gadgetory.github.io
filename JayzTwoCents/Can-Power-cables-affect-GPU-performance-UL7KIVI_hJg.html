often ask the audience what videos you
want me to make that way I know and kind
of gauge on the more popular questions I
mean you asked over and over kind of
which direction to make my videos now
this one I've asked quite often and I
didn't know the answer and I found
myself actually using a config that a
lot of people are wondering whether or
not it's good or bad I figure we're
going to talk about it and that being
are you actually causing yourself any
performance loss by using a single PCI
Express power connector for your GPU
that has a pigtail like this or should
you be running independent power cables
per plug harm to GPU this one's going to
probably be a little bit interesting
because I'm not a lesser electrical
Mathemagician today's video is sponsored
by LastPass and let's face it it's no
fun getting locked out of your online
accounts because you can't remember your
password that is really irritating just
ask Nick that's okay though because with
LastPass you don't have to remember your
passwords your mother's maiden name your
security questions because it keeps
everything easily accessible at your
fingertips synced across all of your
devices using multi-factor
authentication keeping everything as
secure as possible and the best part is
you want to have a single password for
everything because we keep forgetting
them LastPass will make sure that
everything is unique keeping your
accounts even more secure it even has a
digital safe allowing you to keep all of
your VIP documents easily accessible
like driver's license birth certificate
passport and whatever else you could
possibly think of so stop all of the
insanity of forgetting all of your
passwords and get LastPass for free by
following the link down below so we're
going to do we are going to go ahead and
overclock this because I'm going to just
skip the base stock test there's no
point in doing stuff we want to see if
there's a limitation to how much power
we can pull through those cables GP
voltage is that 100% power curve so it's
going to go 100% sooner in the in the
well curve of where the frequency is
memory clock we added 400 fan speed I'm
at 90% because fans will also draw
voltage and power delivery will affect
fans as well and since we have three
fans on this I want to make sure that's
not gonna be negatively affected and
then we've got a power target target
maxed out here at 120 so on do right now
is run valley benchmark ultra settings
with 8x msaa and everything is maxed out
at 1080p so we're letting the graphics
card just render as many frames as it
possibly can right now getting 100
fifty-five of them in that part of the
screen absolutely ridiculous
so we'll do the test three times and
then we'll a verge those numbers and see
what we get
silence pour here was a six thousand
thirty two when we averaged to three
scores that we got the sixty 2860 41 and
fifty 32 we've got a six thousand and
thirty three point six average score so
let's go change the cables out and see
if anything improved so we've got two
independent power plugs in there and
we've got all the settings that are
still identical to what they were and I
saved my profile the fans are also still
running at the speed of sound basically
or yeah I guess that was kind of a bad
analogy for whatever there's allowed
that's all the matters so we run the
same three tests and see if we get any
improvement fun fact though when we did
our test the first time around three
times in a row with this overclock and
these fans at ninety percent we actually
didn't get any hotter than 50 C that was
pretty amazing actually
not bad for air cooling go baby go
okay so first test we've already seen an
improvement in score not a lot but still
60 106 when we were averaging in our
last test the highest score was a 60 41
so Wow okay well you know the routine
we've got to go ahead and go through all
three to get our average and I quite
honestly wasn't really expecting that
for another truth CH 6103 on the second
test that's much closer in the previous
test which are fluctuating upwards of
what's the eight nine points that's
fluctuated three okay
one more test if our last test here was
a sixty 93 if we average the three
scores out we got a sixty 100 so that
was actually an improvement just by
changing the cables we didn't change any
of the settings as one other test I want
to do here real quick now granted this
is just valley benchmark it would have
been probably prudent to go through the
entire testing suite but I just kind of
wanted to see on the surface if there
was any improvement to any of this now
what I want to see is if we can actually
get any better overclocking out of this
the max I could get out of this before
was a twenty eighty eight when I did the
review so let's see if we can get
anything extra out of this right
now we can plan around the overclocking
for a little bit here and this was a
little bit of an unexpected result I
could actually get the card to run 21:26
for probably about five minutes before
it actually crashed which is way better
than any card I've had come in here so
far I was able to do including the
Poseidon but then again we'll talk about
that with at the ending here but we're
running 2113 megahertz right here pretty
stable 48 degrees C on the card yeah I
Wow so who would have thought there was
actually some improvements to be had
right here I mean seriously I didn't I
quite honestly didn't expect there to be
any difference you can see there's
numbers right there 21 14 actually
during that test huh I'll be honest
going to this video I didn't expect
there to really be any sort of
difference I've done a lot of testing
with just using the pigtail cables with
a single PCI Express power plug coming
off the PSU on high-end cards like this
and never saw any sort of negative
results I mean we did gain a little bit
more score when it came to valley
benchmark and we gained one extra clock
tick we'll call it once when I passed my
by simply using two dedicated power
cables and as a lot of factors that can
actually factor into that power supply
you're using how many rails it is I was
kind of going by some of the research
that I did prior to this video and what
to expect and I didn't expect anything
because of a specific comment made here
in a seven-year-old Tom's Hardware
thread about the difference between why
there's only one extra 12-volt lead in
an 8-pin power supply plug or PCI
Express plug versus a six pin and how it
can be double the rating from 75 watt to
150 watts with one extra 12 volt but
then someone did a really good
explanation of what the pin outs are and
which one is sense wires and all that
sort of stuff but then I said this they
said that a proper 8 pin PCIe can supply
a 12 volts at 11 amps with three lines
or three twelve volt lines in there
equaling 396 watts of power to a
graphics card so that's why you can
pigtail them this card is not pulling
anywhere near 396 Watts but obviously we
saw that it has some sort of effect
maybe it's the cleanliness of the power
delivery I have no idea but it did allow
us to overclock a little bit farther and
as we
all we gained a little bit of additional
score now would you have noticed any of
those two things that one additional
clock tick or the 70 or so extra points
we saw in side of valley benchmark while
gaming no probably not but it was a neat
little cure meant to do so if you know
more about this and why this is then let
me know down in the comments below
because I still am a little bit
flabbergasted as to why even though one
pin can supply the amount of volts and
amps and watts that we need in a card
like this why we saw any sort of
difference whatsoever temps were the
same clocks were the same but we saw an
improvement with the two power cables
even though the clocks were the same I
couldn't I couldn't really understand
that one anyway time to go guys thanks
for watching if you got any more
comments or any more questions you guys
want me to tackle or any video topics
you think would be neat for the channel
you know what to do this video is
derivative directly from the inbox so
stemming your suggestions and as always
guys I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
