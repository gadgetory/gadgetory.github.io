going to tell us about the brand new
Intel powered smartphones and some of
their brand new mobile chips Michael one
of the questions we have is what's the
power consumption like on this and what
is battery life and TPU look like on
these chips so all of our phones have
slightly different size batteries so it
would obviously depend on the phone but
don't don't let us me go to third party
sources you know the verge did a very
very good article benchmarking our power
performance versus some of the our arm
brace competitors so our motorola razr
iphone has very very competitive power
efficiencies and battery life so is this
chip you guys are aiming at competing
directly with arm and Samsung so we
actually we are all of our smartphones
are based out of the intel atom chip
sets and we've launched them seven
phones in 2012 there are available
around the world we it is a different
micro architecture and different
solution than our basis solutions out
there so this is our first year into the
mobile market and we've made some really
good progress so far okay what about
hardware platforms what companies do you
anticipate starting to carry this entail
brand of your mobile chip so like I said
we we do have seven partners that we're
working with we have seven phones out
there in the market in 2012 two from
motorola one from ZTE that you see out
there one from lenovo one from lava
which is a telecom company i'll in india
the phone i'm holding a hand we're
running that demo off of is orange which
is a telecom operator in france and the
UK so we come up with smartphone
reference designs we give it to our
third-party OEMs they take those they
manufacture the phones
we work very closely with our partners
to bring these solutions to market and
something that you I'm going to kind of
throw at you here you may not be able to
answer this Intel looking at building
any sort of a mobile operating system in
the future has there been any roadmap
regarding that so are a primary I guess
a focus right now is on android android
is the predominant mobile OS around the
world and whereas exclusively focusing
on android we all of our mobile phones
are running on either android 4.0 or
earlier variants of android so right now
we're just sticking with android on the
smartphone side of course if you take a
look at our tablet solutions also
running the intel atom processor there
are windows 8 tablets a fully windows 8
capable so on the smart phones we have
android on the tablet side we have a
mixture of android tablets and also
windows 8 and tablets as well and then
what everyone wants to know now is
availability so all of these phones are
available out in the market all of the
seven phones that we're showing you can
buy them around the world ZTE phone is
available in europe the Lenovo phone is
being sold in China the lava phone is
available in India the orange phone is
available in France in the UK the
motorola phone we have out front again
china latin america and europe so we
have a variety of smartphones out there
that we've hit the marketplace with and
we're very pleased with the progress
we've made in 2012 and you have
anticipated us lunch date we don't have
anticipated US launch so far but many of
these phones you can go ahead and buy
them unlocked and have them shipped to
you plop in the sim card and they should
be were able to work on the US for all
of us carrying the motorola razr iphone
ourselves and we use that that's the
phone that's available in latin america
and and also the u of europe as well so
we just pop in the sim and we use it
with the AT&amp;amp;T carrier great that's been
Michael with Intel this is JC sense and
you have your scoop now on the Intel
smartphone
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
