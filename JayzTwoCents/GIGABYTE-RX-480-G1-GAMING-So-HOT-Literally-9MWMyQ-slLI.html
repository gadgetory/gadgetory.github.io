we've got gigabytes new g1 gaming RX 488
gigabyte graphics card you guys have
been wanting to see some custom 480
stuff here on the channel actually got
this couple weeks ago but you haven't
seen the video yet because this review
has not quite gone as smoothly as I had
hoped
now on a high level here we're just talk
about some of the basics this is a fully
custom PCB from gigabyte the g1 gaming
board is a custom it is not a reference
in any way custom cooler in fact the
only thing
AMD about it really is the Polaris GPU
inside of it now this is a 8 gigabyte
card I don't know if it has a 4 gigabyte
model to be honest with you but this one
is an 8 gigabyte card now it's got a
modest bump um boost clock over the
reference design references 1266 and
this one is twelve hundred and ninety so
that's only 24 megahertz of boost it is
not going to even be noticeable while
you're gaming a difference of 24
megahertz so that's already kind of
disappointing
right off the bat a custom card a custom
BCB a custom cooler 8 pin power
connector on there giving you more
Headroom when it comes to power draw and
power limit and only 24 megahertz of
boost and the memory is running at the
exact same reference speed so there's no
bump in memory speed whatsoever ok so at
the risk of just talking for an hour and
making this an unbearable video to watch
more so than it already is because my
face is on your monitor and I apologize
that your pixels are being momentarily
inconvenienced with that task I want to
go ahead and show you the benchmarks and
talk about a couple of things now as you
watch these benchmarks I want you to
keep a couple of things in mind one the
1060 is in there only because I know
people are going to ask me how does it
compare to the 1060 it's the exact same
1060 results I ran in the past it is the
SC model from EVGA which is a reference
PCB it is not a custom board is not a
custom card it is only a single fan
cooler on there and a slight bump to the
boost clock there is no overclocking
applied to the 1060 that was GPU boost
taking care of everything the reference
480 however is running a custom fan
curve on there to keep the card from
slowing down at all as the reference
cooler gets warm and because the factory
temperature target is 80 that cooler
hits 80 and then once it does that it
will start to slow itself down so I ran
a custom fan curve
because I didn't want the thing to
throttle and I wanted to see how it
compared at 1266 versus 1290 so I went
ahead and did that so I want you guys
keep that in mind a reference card out
of the box with the fan profile will be
slower than the results if you see now
now
now for those of you that we're paying
attention and saw the temperature slides
you probably kind of went whoa whoa whoa
pump the brakes hear what the actual
fuck is happening with the temperatures
let's talk about that because that's the
part that I've been having some problems
with here the reference card was running
unaggressive fan curve as I said so we
were kept from hitting the temperature
limit which meant that the card wasn't
throttling and that's the whole reason
why I did that because I wanted to kind
of simulate what I thought the
aftermarket PCB and aftermarket cooler
situation would be like on a reference
card and that's why I used those numbers
again now with this card here
unfortunately the fan profile is
extremely conservative because it airs
on the side of noise so it doesn't want
to get too loud and in-your-face so
unfortunately what it does is it allows
the card to get all the way up to 80
once again on a custom PCB with a custom
cooler I started wondering if what else
is going on here so when I overclocked
it and ran the fans at 90% we still hit
88 see in a few benchmarks like Metro
last light and when I do those charts I
always show what the max temperature was
in any of my tests which happened to be
88 C and it was still climbing when the
test ended so it could have potentially
hit the new limit of 90 which is set
during overclocking that in my opinion
is way too hot for this cooler I don't
know why it's doing that I want to go
ahead live on camera take the cooler off
but the the PCB and I want to see if
there's something going on with the
thermal compound so it's going to do
this is go ahead and take the cooler off
and see what we find
it's kind of hard to tell but it does
seem to me like there is a little bit
under applied thermal paste
I guess you I guess you could say so
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go
ahead and put on the same thermal paste
I using my water block so this is just
the ek Tim the Eco therm they sell and
send with all of their water blocks so
I'm gonna clean this off I'm gonna apply
new thermal paste looks like it's making
good contact with the heat pipes right
there as you can see we've got our VRAM
heat pads on here I mean everything's
making good contact our vrm pads right
there so yeah I'm going to do I'm going
to go ahead and I am just going to
reapply the thermal paste run the test
again and see if the temperatures
improve
you can see we're still hitting 78 see
right now with all the stock settings so
this is the second run actually just
I've had Metro looping this is now the
start of the second loop and were
already at 78 I wouldn't be surprised if
this is back at 80 by the end of the
loop so it doesn't I'm not hopeful that
this did anything for the overclocking
results whatsoever I mean a couple nope
there's 79 it's gonna hit 80 all right
conclusion time replacing the thermal
paste made no difference whatsoever now
what's kind of neat about the AMD stuff
is you can actually see how many watts
it's pulling as you saw it went from
about 120 527 watch at stock all the way
up to almost 200 watts when overclocked
but what this is telling me is for some
reason this cooler is not able to
actually dissipate 200 watts of heat now
what I find kind of interesting too and
the reason why I thought it might have
been thermal paste is the air that's
coming off the card when you put your
hands around the card and you feel the
air it's not that warm which made me
think that heat wasn't making it out of
the core and into the heat pipes and out
into the atmosphere and touching the
back plate on the card was like burn you
levels of hot it was really hot so I
started thinking maybe the thermal paste
is just bad but as you can see that
wasn't the case now if you're the kind
of person that wants to buy a graphics
card you don't want to overclock you
just want to put it in and off you go
you're still not going to be hands-off
with this card you still need to go in
and do a custom fan profile speed up the
fan so that you're not hitting a decease
you get the full benefit of the card as
you saw there it's not running at 1290
megahertz out of the box it is capable
of hitting 1290 bits always
slowing down which is really really
unfortunate because the advertised boost
clock is not what you're actually
getting but once you go in and play with
the fan profile a little bit and up the
power limit a little bit then it will
actually give you those numbers but I
did the very same thing with my
reference card so really I don't feel
like and my reference card is also able
to overclock to the levels of this card
no problem which with the exception of
acoustics didn't feel like there was a
whole lot of benefit to this so this is
where I need you guys to chime in this
card has been available on the market
for a few weeks now I need to know if
you bought this card if you were seeing
similar results or if it looks like
something might be up with this card I'm
genuinely disappointed I expected and
hoped for more out of a custom RX 480 I
really did but that is what it is and I
showed you guys the numbers live there's
no there's no shenanigans happening it's
I mean I'm I'm really disappointed right
now I truly am so I'm gonna go drown my
sorrows in a I don't know coffee or
something
I'm gonna go alright see you guys on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
