here and I have built myself a test
bench be honest were the most
challenging builds I've ever done with
its improved radiator support and
legendary noise optimization the new
define r54 fractal design is a PC
builders dream come true
click the link in the description to
learn more now probably the first thing
you realize when taking a look at this
guy is this is not a conventional
looking test bed
now case labs likes to take a unique
approach to things and that's exactly
what they've done here really they took
an existing chassis and turned it into a
test bed this is their mercury s8
typically it's a little bit taller it's
got a top panel side panels and it looks
like a complete rectangle a cube if you
will well I guess cubes are equal lakes
on the other side making it a square
okay it's a rectangle whatever certainly
not a sphere right so what they've done
is they've shortened it a bit put no
side panels no tops on it added these
handles and called it a test bed and I
think it actually works very very well
because it allows me to fit a lot of
things on here without making it super
cluttered I have a radiator that's fully
mounted without just hanging it off the
side like you have to do with some or
zip tying it to it which I think looks
kind of silly you've also got over here
another mount where I've got three fans
on here these are the phobia noise
blocker phobia nbe loops and B stands
for a noise blocker they're a rebrand of
that three 1000 rpm fans that are
spinning about 500 rpms at all time
keeping the motherboard nice and cool
and the VRMs blowing air across the
entire top of the whole enclosure here
you've got a basement compartment down
here where you can have your power
supply and extra fans or hard drives or
whatever you want in the bottom and then
you've also got on the other side
typically where the motherboard or the
hard drives would go I've opted to turn
this into a radiator station so it's
pulling air in going through the bottom
and then on the on the inside of the
bottom I actually have a fan that's in
there exhausting air out of that
compartment so it doesn't get all heats
out but it's actually a very very
flexible test test bed
if you will and this is actually one of
their more affordable cases believe it
or not before loading this thing out
with the radiator mounts it's two
hundred and fifty nine or two hundred
and forty nine dollars and after I added
the two radiator mounts which is really
all I did it was three hundred dollars
now I know that sounds like a whole
bunch but compared to how much know the
case labs SMA eight was coming in at
seven hundred and forty nine dollars and
compared to some other test beds which
are already 250 or 300 dollars on the
market it was a very very awesome
solution to go with it gave me a ton of
flexibility I could have even put a
radiator in the front if I wanted but
since I'm using a Bay res I ended up not
being able to do that I could have put a
240 there as well but I could have done
a 360 a 360 into 240 and if I wanted I
could have even put another red on the
other side to hung it off a top section
had radiators going everywhere in this
thing I mean the amount of room on this
is just insane now let's go and talk
about the hardware that is in this guy
for a motherboard I'm running the Asus
x99 deluxe that is obviously in x99 I
have coupled it with an Intel 5820k hex
core 12 thread processor now that was
specifically because of requests from
you guys asking that I do more of the
Intel x99 stuff but you want to see some
more affordable options like the 5820k
and see how that stacks up so stay tuned
for a review on that that is definitely
going to be coming the RAM on this is
the Kingston HyperX predator 2800 dims
I've got 16 gigabytes of that and then
the graphics card on here is the
visiontek r9 290 cryo venom that's a
pre-installed EK water block and I
actually had the version that came with
a 360 fully custom water loop from ek
water block so all the water cooling you
see here is as provided by visiontek
which is not even the water cooling
company came with the card the only
thing I had to add to turn it into a
complete loop was my CPU block which
we'll be doing a review of as well
that's the supremacy Evo full nickel
water block it's actually a step up from
what's in skunkworks right now I think
it looks fantastic but all the fittings
and everything with the exception of the
90s that you see here were actually
provided with the graphics card so
that's pretty freakin awesome now when
it comes to the hard drives and stuff
I've got one terabyte Western Digital
black in here and I've also got a 256
gigabyte a data SSD in here
our power supply and running the EVGA
supernova g2 1000 this is a 1000 watt
gold rated power supply and I'm running
their red cable kit from EVGA so pretty
much everything you see on here with the
exception of the Intel CPU was provided
for review so we've got a lot of
individual reviews that we can be doing
on this test bed and we will will be
taking a look at the graphics card we
take a look at the water loop the water
block the CPU performance I mean all of
it we're going to take a little of
course the RAM we're going to look at
every bit of that I want to go ahead and
address some questions that people have
been asking me on Instagram and Twitter
where I've been putting up photos of
this build as it was happening so make
sure you guys are following on that
social media if you don't want to miss
out any behind the scenes stuff it tends
to go on when I do these builds the most
common question I was asked was Jay if
it's a test bed why the hell are you
putting a water-cooled graphics card in
there and not using quick disconnects
well guys it's actually a very valid
question and glad you guys asked one of
the cool things about this motherboard
is it has multiple PCI Express 16x lanes
so I can leave this graphics card
plugged in i can grab another another
graphics card plug it into the 16x slot
right here and actually do full
benchmarking on it without ever touching
the water-cooled graphics card I don't
even have to take it out I can just
simply plug in the other card plug the
power into it and the first graphics
card will be ignored if there's no
display hooked up to it so I don't have
to worry about that now let's say I
wanted to do a crossfire or SLI
configuration test I can take this
graphics card out the flexible tubing
will allow me to kind of bend it out of
the way stick it up top or support it
with something and then put my other
graphics cards in plug in power do my
test when I'm done plug this back in I'm
a big fan of this card in the way it
looks in fact I was even doing some 4k
gaming last night on this card it's
going to be a fun review it's actually
very very capable card and even though
it's nothing new it's still worthwhile
talking about especially with how cheap
they are now in fact at the time of
making this video vision Tech was
selling this exact r9 290 with the pre
install block for 299 dollars as part of
the Black Friday sale now I know that
that's going to be a little late for
some people watching this video in the
future but it was at least worth
mentioning today because 299 dollars you
get this graphics card and the block
installed that's an insane deal I mean
those guys are just in
and now I have to say that this was one
of the most challenging builds I have
ever done and the reason for that is all
three sides are exposed now I've built
test benches before and in the past
especially at work I just don't care
about the way the wiring looks because
it's not going on display but since I do
videos in here I don't want some
spaghetti monster in the background
terrifying everybody in my videos I
wanted something clean and presentable
and that deserved as much as a tent as
much attention as skunk works got
because I'm a huge fan of the case labs
cases so what I've ended up doing here
was spending a ton of time finding how I
was going to route my wires now the
wires in this thing are already not the
most flexible thus leaving that EVG is
using on their individually sleeved
cable kits is very very rigid and stiff
that makes it actually very difficult to
route and get bends without it wanting
to twist and kind of kink and do its own
thing but as you can see looking in the
bottom here the only wires that are
visible are the wires coming off the
very back of the power supply and I have
them all stuffed and tucked away where
you can't really see them and I've got
the water tubes running through here as
well so it's actually very very open and
not very cluttered I also have an
exhaust fan in here for the radiator
cubby pulling all the hot air out of the
radiator space so everything on this
just flows and works together very well
it took quite a bit of time to figure
out the best method of doing that now
the other thing that's really cool about
the way that this power supply is set up
is that I can reach all of the modular
plugs that having to remove any panels
or any covers or anything so if I need
to hook up more power for testing of you
know maybe a graphics card that has to
eight pins or three eight pins or
something like that or plug in another
SSD that I'm going to do a test on I can
just plug in the wires do what I needed
to do when I'm done unplug those stick
those away and I don't have them hanging
off anywhere once again making it look
like a spaghetti monster but even these
three fans right here and getting the
wires tucked away back here and plugged
into the PWM splitter it was a pain in
the ass this was the hardest build I've
ever done but I want extremely anal on
this I mean I even received the power
power or the pump power cables because
they were just a jumble of colors there
was green yellow white red and it was
just very very ugly so I went ahead and
recently those so it matched the build
and here we are today with what I'm
calling
project bloodshed really that comes down
to the fact that it just looks like
blood circulating through the entire
loop I know I've talked about red being
a difficult color to remove but I don't
really see myself doing a whole lot of
removal on this anyway this is probably
gonna stay together for a while so guys
this has been project bloodshed tell me
what you guys think what you guys think
about this case and the way it's loaded
out what would you have changed if this
were your build because it's phased it
that's one of the fun things about PC
building is there is just an infinite
amount of ways we can customize things
and call them our own this is my own I'm
calling it project bloodshed what would
you do what would you build and if
you've built out a test bench what are
the specs on yours put it down the
comments I do like reading all about
your guys's computers send me pics to
Facebook or Instagram J's $0.02 and as
always guys I'm gonna go ahead and get
on out of here I hope to see you guys in
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
