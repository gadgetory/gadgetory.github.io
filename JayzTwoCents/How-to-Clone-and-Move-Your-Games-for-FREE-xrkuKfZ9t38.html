going to be doing some r-tx testing here
really soon and one of the things that
we've done to kind of make testing
easier for us is we keep all of our game
library while these most of the big
games on an external drive that we can
move from system to system we keep this
updated which means any system we plug
it into will have an updated game
library the problem is it's only a 250
gig and we quickly exceeded that so
we're gonna be updating our storage to a
500 gig which should be big enough for
all the main titles we test when new
graphics card launches so I thought why
not make a tutorial to help you guys see
how to actually set up an external drive
for your game library how to clone the
drive and how to initialize a new drive
on your system something that all goes
hand-in-hand all three of this has to be
done today and something I asked quite
often from people as I plugged in a new
Drive Windows doesn't see it what's
going on so we can kind of kill three
birds with well three different stones
but whatever I digress we're making one
video showing you guys inclusive
inclusively
how did this intro went down hill quick
let's just get to it do you want to be
cooler do you want to be more desirable
well you're in luck because right now
you can own your very own JS to send
swag and immediately be the cool kid on
the block max out your sex appeal by
following the link down below
so we're gonna use matte cream reflect
for our cloning and this is not a
sponsored video by them this is a brand
I've used for a while because it's free
which is the best part especially if you
only want to do this once or twice why
pay for a license especially a monthly
so matte cream reflect you need to
download that I'll put a link to it in
the description below also too we're
going to be using USB 3.0 sleds for our
drives because like I said we move it
from system to system so this will work
though with any Drive installed in any
system where it's do a regular SATA
cable or some sort of USB like this USB
three nvme you know external drive
enclosures doesn't matter as long as the
system sees it as a drive so we'll
reflect so we're gonna go ahead and take
our USB and plug it into our USB 3.0 hub
here which we have just so lovely
hanging off the front of our system very
pretty and OCD
well triggering to be honest but that's
besides the point and we're gonna plug
in this guy right here as well now if we
go to our file explorer right here you
can see that our external SSD 256 only
has 17 gigabytes left but you might
notice that the 500 gigabyte I mentioned
is not showing up the 237 gigabyte
system drive that's on here is our main
Windows Drive which has the windows logo
and then our 1.8 or our 2 terabyte
technically Western Digital black drive
is kind of our main storage drive and
you can see the 500 gig that we have in
this enclosure is not showing up so if
that's the case for you and you have a
drive that shows up in the BIOS but
doesn't show up in Windows it's pretty
simple go to your Start menu type disk
and you'll have create and format hard
disk partitions pop up now here we
should actually see our drive but it's
not so here it is right here it's
unallocated what that means is the
windows can see the drive but it doesn't
have any allocation set to it there's no
drive path there's no letter none of
that it's pretty simple right click new
simple volume click Next you can tell it
how you can actually set a volume size
to so you can partition this if you want
obviously we want it one partition click
Next and then you can give it a drive
letter in this case it automatically
assigned F because that's the next
sequential order in our current Drive
lettering and we're just gonna go with
that leave everything as default you can
name it here if you want so we'll call
it external
games just like it says on the letter on
the label there perform a quick format
finish that's now blue it now shows up
down here in the bottom right hand
corner and we are good to go
so next thing we're gonna go ahead and
do here and you can see right here in
our File Explorer we're gonna open up
Mac real reflect so the drive that's red
here is the one that's nearly full we're
gonna click the check box right here and
then we're gonna click on here clone
this disc now this is our source as you
can see right there now you can actually
do this with a Windows 10 drive as well
we know the windows partition the
windows exact copy of the drive can
actually move to another one that's
another video I'm gonna doing another
date because the Windows 10 is actually
kind of picky in the way that that works
some software handles it very easily
some other software you have to set some
perimeters and if you don't set that
right then it will copy but then windows
won't actually boot you'll continue to
get a blue screen so we will if you guys
want to see me do that video make sure
you comment down below to please show
you guys how to do the windows 10 clone
but now we need to set a destination so
select the disk and we want the one that
says right there external games and that
is it so pretty much now we're just
gonna click finish we can name it if you
want to name this the backup definition
and what macron will actually do will
save these perimeters this setting into
its own file that you can then pull in
and run the task again this is useful
for you to do things like backups or
regular scheduled backups on a system so
if you had multiple drives in your
system you could just tell it run this
every night and every night it will have
a revolving backup again a free piece of
software that does that pretty amazing
we're gonna go ahead and just call this
again we're gonna click OK and now it is
going ahead it says fault warning this
Drive will be overwritten of course
that's what we want and now it is just
going to go through and do the cloning
process obviously this is going to
depend on how big your drive is how fast
your connection is how fast your source
is and how fast your deaths are you said
your destination so think about it this
way we're running through a USB 3.0 a
decent amount of bandwidth but obviously
not as fast as if we were cloning like
say a and m dot 2 to an m dot 2 that
would be much much faster if we were
writing to a spinning disk
a backup then your max right speed is
going to be the max or the max copy
speed is the max right speed of the
destination does that make sense so if
you have a faster Drive writing to a
slower Drive your max transfer rate is
going to be the maximum write speed of
your train of your destination so in
this case because we're running two SATA
500 megabyte per second drive through
USB 3.0 it should actually transfer
pretty quickly but it could take up to a
half an hour or an hour or more so we'll
go ahead and spare you guys that will
come back when it's done a few moments
later so that took 25 minutes and 13
seconds to complete you hit okay I had
verified selected which is why it took a
little bit longer because I have it
verify all the information and now we
can close that now if we close reflects
and we open up our File Explorer here
check this out you can see wait a minute
all I did was copy over the same 230
eight gigabytes with only 17.7 left
that's because math Korean basically
does a bit for bit clone of the drive
and the partition that it sees so even
if I had a two terabyte SSD sitting
right here it would still show two
hundred and thirty eight gigabytes with
that unallocated partition left over so
we're gonna go ahead and unplug our
source drive we can actually format that
once we confirm everything's working
here and then put that back into
rotation but if we go back to the disk
management tool which I showed you
earlier you'll be able to see that the
rest of that partition of that Drive is
sitting there unallocated so we can
basically extend the initial partition
that's sitting over here so basically
just right-click on the blue section not
the black one if you create a new simple
volume now you've created a new
partition we want to extend the one that
it's currently existing to the rest of
the drive so right click click extend
volume click Next and then we can just
go ahead and say finish because we
didn't give it an amount it just said
basically use the rest of the drive
there it is now we've got the full 465
gigabytes so as you can see right there
245 gigabytes free of our 465 gigs so we
basically doubled the drive as you would
expect right click and we're gonna
rename this back to our external den
soups I put an s in there games
there we go so if you look at my
external driver here you can see it's
already got the Steam library there with
the steam apps and the common folder
which is where all of your games are
installed because we did a clone however
you if you were installing a fresh
external drive that you want to start
moving your games to or install on then
what you're gonna see is we're about to
show you right now is exactly going to
pertain to you so we're gonna do is go
over to steam click the steam button and
as you can see none of my games are
installed none of them are white they're
all grayed out because basically steam
is saying here's the games you own but
none of them are installed we're gonna
click on the steam button click on
settings go to the downloads and then
click on steam library folders number
the fault you're gonna see a steam
library installed on your C Drive or
whatever your main drive is where your
operating system resides and that's by
default you can't get rid of it you
can't delete it it forces to be at least
one install location otherwise the
program like Steam wouldn't know what to
do with anything so that's a default but
if you followed my advice on budget
builds and you've got a small SSD
chances are that Drive is gonna be full
or you're trying to avoid filling it up
which is why you're installing to either
a second drive or in our case an
external that we want to take with us
wherever we go so if you click on add
library folder if you click the drop
down you can see all the drives that
exist on your system are listed right
here so the D Drive which is where
things were before that spinning optical
or that spinning hard drive and then the
G Drive which is where our external
drive is right here and that is where we
already have games installed so all I
need to do right now is just highlight
where it says Steam library so basically
you can see it made a path here G Steam
library and basically now we're telling
it to install games there but what's
gonna happen with steam it's gonna see
that games are already installed there
and it's gonna automatically populate
them inside of our gaming list so far
cry 5 is their hit man's their Metro
last light rise of the Tomb Raider and
everything is updated because we I
actually keep this drive updated on a
pretty regular basis but it's pretty
simple I mean the same thing as
basically happens with origin although
ordinate origins got one additional step
when you actually give it the new save
location where the game files are
located you've got to go and tell it to
download and install that title so if we
have battlefield 4 sitting on our drive
origins not going to automatically say
hey battlefield 4
is there when you point to the drive
it's when you tell it to download and it
starts moving file as it goes wait a
minute these files are here it will
validate the files and then just
populate the game in your folder but
that's pretty much it that now means
that this Drive has our game library on
it and we can take this with us and as
long as we keep it updated any system we
plug this into and point to this drive
our game library will be ready to go so
this is very useful if you are traveling
you have a laptop that maybe doesn't
have a lot of storage on it but you can
get yourself a one or two terabyte SSD
at a well you know one terabyte SSD
would hold my entire game library that
I've got which would be plenty big and
it has the speed of USB 3.0 or 3.1 if
you want to do an nvme SSD through USB
3.1 type C many laptops have USB type-c
and so do desktops now so that's an even
faster communication but I find that
just a standard USB 3.0 is more than
enough when it comes to gaming so anyway
that was just a quick tutorial I wanted
to make because I've seen people ask me
how we move game libraries around you
have to reinstall your games and since
we're getting ready to have to move it
between three systems for RTX launch I
want to have my game library in one
place rather than dealing with updates
on three systems which really kind of
sucks so that's that you have any more
tutorials you'd like me to cover make
sure you sound off in the comments below
or hit me up on Twitter at JS to sense
I'm extremely active on Twitter probably
more active than I should be Twitter is
kind of dangerous
the Internet's dangerous for mice for my
morale anyway at times so let me know
what other tutorials you want me to
cover or video topics as we prepare for
this holiday season it's a good one for
PC builders and q4 of 2018 it's exciting
get excited cuz I am
so excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
