I think we're live I don't even know
oh shit wrong button well do the thing
know or live I just I hit the wrong I
hit the wrong button woman yeah we're
live whatever uh what what do we
normally say when we start this show I
don't know no yeah that's how the day
goes
we had two weeks off so obviously josh
is in studio with those Nick's right arm
is back there over Josh's left shoulder
and then Anna's back there somewhere and
like we have a foot or something we'll
see your foot there there goes all right
so ants
what was that how could I share this one
camera with Skype and OBS and I'm going
to run the intro
Oh everyone's saying they can't hear you
now I don't know hold on I guess I'm
gonna do live tech support like you
normally do
I tried muting it for like an hour so
now I don't get it I don't get it like
just try meeting him for an hour what
happens there yeah it's setup no I think
I know what it is hold on
see if I do this yeah the desktop audio
you know OBS is like desktop audio thing
will like freak out and not yeah it's
doing that hold on I can't go home now I
think we definitely did tech off I mean
we did I mean it's people are talking
and chat like they can't hear me so we
have confirmation Tech Talk did happen
you're good now we hear you
all right what I don't get is why could
you guys here be perfectly fine but
everybody else is all fucked up did you
have like a level in OBS wrong or no OBS
was set to the right like you know sound
mixer but then I'd always like set it to
something else and set it back and then
hit save and it works alright there we
go there we go Orlando said just do sign
language I would if I knew ASL but I
don't I don't even know what it was what
were you talking about
oh you're talking girls and camp sit ups
and stuff I see yeah yeah I was saying
if you want to split a camera one camera
between two programs you have to use
like one of those cam splitter programs
like many cams or there's another one
that does it that I don't know if
there's a free one that doesn't work for
shit I just like how you went straight
to cam girl was the idea of you know the
practical use well that's that's where I
learned it from
so like that'd be practical right are
you can i meanwe my current testosterone
levels I certainly qualify for 100 you
don't have low testosterone you just
have a high estrogen is that what it is
my man Tate he's just coming from a high
estrogen so guys we got Josh here he's
still in town as you guys know we
finished his build yesterday we may or
may not have like screwed something up
and had to take it all back apart today
I mean another
Josh drill holes to the board again no
need he drills to the board this time
that wasn't the problem we just wanted
to see how many of our mistakes the
audience could pick up on kind of like
those you know compare these two images
and point out the differences yes oh god
yeah where's waldo technology addition i
got you yeah it's not you know what's
what's different with this one like this
whale has you know three eyelids or eye
eyelashes where they have a picture
that's too kind of a thing real subtle
things yeah you know really just get it
you know looking at the audience
retention and how deeply they view the
video how much they pay attention as
opposed to have a known second monitor
you're not watching it yeah we got we
got the metrics back everything's good
well I I can't argue with that logic
sounds like one of my most popular
videos I ever did is call it Diablo
Diablo that like every comment on the
video all 10,000 Devin was like you know
that it Brad's a goddamn game as long as
I've known you you pronounce things
wrong though I do it's like hey hey
that's my don't make fun of my accent or
speech impediment depends on how much I
want you to feel sorry for me it's like
it's like is there a Northwest accent
not that I'm aware of because I wouldn't
know it like I would I've never heard
anybody
oh yeah don't you know that's what's
gone all things business consulate
planes I don't know I mean whenever
you're from a place you don't think
there's an accent to go somewhere old
man you got an accent I'm like you got a
radio voice what the hell does that mean
you got a face for radio
New York's a lot like that too you go to
New York and you hear people talk you're
like wow that is the thickest accent I
like the Brooklyn actor that's like the
thickest accent I've ever heard and then
they look at you like you're talking
funny I'm like William Nicholson chat
says it's topless Taco Tuesday
it's Thursday my friend she had you talk
tapas like gone Tuesday somewhere no
it's not actually
oh my god Oh JJ what's uh what's this
whatever shit about like are we
literally just talking about whatever we
always do but you apparently had some
topics you want to talk about that had
to do
Microsoft I guess well you know that's
about the only thing I'm known for these
days if anyone has like vid IQ or
whatever going you guys should look at
the video tags
did you Mangalam know for those of you
they cannot see the tags I can't see
them bitch js2 says barnacle he's
followed by Microsoft and some shit as a
phrase and yes he used to work at
Microsoft as a phrase oh there goes
Jerry again it's gonna take a minute we
out we did it
goddamn it I'm right here I came to type
on my phone hi from Germany - my way oh
my god I hear you Jerry thank you
at least somebody does you cut out for a
while there though
that was weird cuz I could hear you guys
like perfectly fine talking shit Craig
so I'm sick I just went to the doctor
today I'm sick man I'll go to the doctor
and you know because I have a cold mix
another finger up my butt is that normal
oh yeah see that that's been my
experience that's good you go to that
freelance proctologist though guys got
that band oh yeah never never pick a
urologist based on his height there's a
free clinic on the border whoa guys whoa
guys just the border on Elway Josh my
proctologist makes you look like a
midget and trust me that does translate
to finger length I know firsthand these
all checking your tonsils see your buddy
hey guys pretty much yeah yeah van
Appledore what's pushing on the back of
my teeth don't worry about it mr. berg
we can go ahead and cancel dinner plans
for the night um yeah I'm good yeah go
get some fudge yeah exactly
how about you place like shit don't
worry about it shit take this shit Jay
check your donations I can't see the
donation is a no-show for sorry yeah
there's no donations join me that's
amazing psych no seriously the super
check donation things guys we don't we
don't really like promote that we don't
really I don't even encourage donations
so the problem is in the past we used to
be like if you donate well guaranteed to
read your comment then it turned into an
hour
for reading donation comments so we just
kind of don't do that anymore but L had
Jerry froze again like that you're that
Aires holding really serious so freaking
Zen right now it's impressive price no
tears though the Team America thing to
keep it alive so you can hear it when
you give us a sign when you're when
you're uplink to us fails you you can
still hear us yeah and it's not even
degraded audio quality sound flawless oh
god damn it Gary I have no fucking clue
you know what I'm gonna go to old speed
test and see if I'm dropping packets or
something oh here just repeat test why
he's connected to it yeah hey really
crappy there for a second I don't know
why dude okay 9 MS and 250 megabytes oh
yeah no it's not my it's not my problem
hmm I do think it's a blame Skype and
and when I tell you what happened with
Microsoft who knows maybe don't make
more said and go what's your Microsoft
story alright so today mr. Sachin Adele
you all know him as the CEO of Microsoft
you're beside and sent up hi he's your
bestie right he's my bestie like get me
me and sad should go away back I've
cupped his balls gently before on
command so anyways he decided today he's
gonna send out a huge mail to all the
employees company-wide saying that
they're gonna basically restructure and
shift around bunch of divisions inside
of Microsoft well the one that really
caught my eye was they are officially
moving Windows which used to be the top
tier like like highest earner inside a
Microsoft like the biggest business like
they they came to the table they ruled
Microsoft they have officially been
moved under Azure as of today where's
that the cloud services you know you
know like Microsoft if they call as
yours you're depending on who's
pronouncing it I'll pronounce it seven
different ways before the show's over
but I assure is basically their
non-relational and relational database
technology that's basically like
competition to Amazon's AWS and whatever
the fuck Google's call this is some sort
of precursor as to what they're going to
be doing with Windows yes absolutely
absolutely because the only reason that
you would move Windows not not as a
partner but actually as a subordinate
under a big data division is because you
plan
to restructure the product to work into
Big Data well there's always been rumors
that Windows is going to turn into a
strictly subscription basis OS yes
that's actually been rumors have been
flying on that since about 2008 I think
was the company meeting that I was at or
Bill Gates back back when he's still
like gave a fuck about the company he
stood up in front of everybody at Safeco
Field at the time and said hey guess
what everybody we are gonna move to a
service-based Windows and they figured
out that they couldn't do it for
whatever reason there was just huge huge
hurdles that they couldn't get over
well apparently now with Azure the the
abundance of Internet bandwidth on all
these things it looks like this is
becoming a possibility so we may see in
the next three to five years a Windows
version come out that is that is
completely a dumb terminal kind of like
Chromebook is but in the window space
that's really really fucking bad
okay I guess okay I'm biased right cuz
mic yourself like kicked me to the curb
and you know I like kicking them in the
nuts it's just fun for me but you know a
couple years ago wearing a sombrero so
so what this means though in this this
is this is where things get a little
scary it's in the same letter and it's
it's an open letter he basically
published it himself so it's not like a
leak or anything it's on news Microsoft
comm the letter to everybody said that
they're actually looking into cloud
based services and artificial
intelligence and analysis of data for
the purpose of helping people you know
more easily user technology and move
seamlessly between their phones or their
Xboxes their windows and all that shit
right well in a nutshell if you read
between the lines that means that they
want to be able to immobilize as much
data as they can or they basically
conglomerated it all together and use it
to make your life easier but that also
means that they're gonna be taking a lot
more data as we move forward you're
gonna see windows undoubtedly start
collecting more and more data however
they do numerous times throughout the
email say that their priority is
responsibility with personal data and
responsibility to
the customers privacy and
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah well achieving
their goal of basically dominating the
world with AI and data so it's ask you
this sure what does that mean for
always-on I mean does that mean you're
gonna have to have an internet
connection to be connected to your OS no
no not not at all the way that they
mitigated that a long time ago because
we all know that that was fucked when
SimCity came out and like you can only
play it when your internet was working
then like your internet would crap out
in the game would just be like sorry you
can't play anymore the way they mitigate
it now is anytime that your computer
isn't connect to the internet or doesn't
have an available internet connection
it's basically caching and collecting
data locally and then once it does have
an internet connection in a one fell
swoop it can basically transact that
data the AI and business intelligence
can run against it and then it can cache
the response back to the machine so if
it loses internet again at least ask
something to key off of so the idea
being is yeah cuz they're always on
things kind of bullshit right we all
know anybody that has a Comcast internet
connection has enough time of about 3%
most days and a lot of it turns to run a
live show know that I'm also thinking
about you know we do live in a world
where there are lots of territories that
still have data caps right right but
what this undoubtedly will mean is that
you will need an internet connection of
some kind shape or form within a period
of time which means whether they need to
connect every month to verify your
subscription or verify your activation
or for some reason they're probably
gonna pressure you to get some kind of
an internet connection or they're gonna
have some really convoluted manual
workaround we're gonna have to call a
number and basically transact a fucking
private key that's like eight thousand
digits over the phone to get your
registration to work that's the only way
I could see them doing this and
especially if they're trying to combat
piracy which everybody knows stealing
Windows is like the easiest fucking
thing to do on planet Earth because
Microsoft put the mechanism in place
that allow you to do it which is called
manual activation that still works to
this day even on Windows 10 you could
activate the same copy of Windows 10 on
five hundred million machines if you're
willing to just keep making that phone
call over and over yet oh yeah you just
need to make the phone call anymore you
can just use your smart phone because oh
really yeah now when you call it goes if
you're calling from a smart phone we can
blow it send a message to your phone you
got any idea and then you're like okay
and then it will like is this are you
calling from your smart phone now and
then you say yes it's like okay
hang-up and then you hang up and then
text comes in and he just key in the the
install key and then it asks you that
question period via text how many
computers have been installed with this
copy of Windows you say one and then
it's like here's your new teeth I can't
believe they made it even easier because
before you had to listen to the operator
be like enter your private key with
touch-tone phone and then you'd enter
like the 97 digits that were on your
screen and then it would read them back
with the new coders but then they made a
voice-activated so you just see the code
and now they made so you just take a
picture of it you can just take a
picture of it with your phone like I'm
not even kidding you can take a picture
with your phone and then it was doing
like an MS pain but then the thing is
because you know that install key is is
unique to that computer it even tells
you like take a screenshot of this and
save it for later so when you reinstall
it again you can just get that key again
so like why would they even bother with
a big sophisticated back-end
verification system when you could
literally just take a picture of a
barcode off a carton of milk and it
works we know as well as I do it's
because it costs them more money to try
and fight the the piracy turn up piracy
but the reinstallation of it then the
money they're losing by just allowing
people to keep using Windows because at
the end was right eating all that
telemetry that they're selling back to
everyone anyway exactly you know the
you're the customer you're more the
customer using Windows 10 actually
Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 were the
first generations of heavy telemetry
operating systems but make no mistake
Windows 7 and I would say I would even
argue all the way back to like XP sp2
not the original release of XP but XP
sp2 was when telemetry started being
collected so this isn't a new thing it's
just that keep stacking more and more
shit it's not it's not a new thing but
no this is now their business model the
OS is nothing more than the platform
which to grab data and sell it to
customer or to to third-party
advertisers so so what makes this really
scary though is that they can Terry
Meyer do you know who Terry Myerson us
know so he's basically was the president
of Windows for a long time Terry Meyer
said he was basically like honestly he
was Steve Ballmer jr. to be honest I
think it was the right call to basically
send him packing which is what they did
sachin ounce of the mail the hill no
longer be the president because windows
doesn't need a president anymore because
now they're under as you're in those
your president will be basically you
know holding order over all that his
windows right so Terry Myerson
I think that's actually a good call
because I think that he was way more
about business and bottom line number
than he was the customer I hate to say
this as much as I hate what Sacha's done
in the past but actually he's made what
are the key decisions right now in a
face-to-face structure
uh-huh you froze for a second but it was
in a very derpy face I always have a
very dirty face so so anyways I mean my
take on this is I think sach is making
the right call as far as stepping down
Terry Myerson however putting it under
Azure is a really scary thing especially
with all the press that Microsoft's
getting about data privacy issues and to
basically say that Windows now belongs
to an organization that is completely
based on big data conglomerating data
aggregating data and trying to make the
world work through business intelligence
and smart queries and all that shit
that's that's a little bit scary because
that mean that's the right thing yeah
is it the entire back end was a shirt
for the windows telemetry collection
real quick high everybody's saying hard
to me yeah you think you love me okay
oh shit is it doing that did that now
your sucked right before taking a drink
your cup what well anyways I I apologize
for the robotic speaking do it again for
a little bit there yeah god damn it so I
can't said nobody even heard anything I
said we got the we got that we got the
gist that you're happy that either you
mean Terry sit down yeah and then you
have but I'm but I'm not happy that it's
under is your because this means for the
first time in microsoft's history the
windows product which is the original
product microsoft was founded on is now
a second-class citizen to Microsoft and
that's scary yes actually the other
thing is and this is uh this is complete
theory I have to say that but apparently
Microsoft edge is getting their ass
handed to them they're the the chief
executive of the project was asked to
fuck off kindly I'm not gonna use his
name though just cuz I don't want to I
don't want to so anyways
Microsoft edge basically had a certain
period of time to basically get their
shit together Sacchi decided nope they
didn't get their shit together so they
fucking punted the the president that
put a new guy into play and now edge has
two years and an unlimited budget to
basically turn the project around and
become the best web browser in the world
and fully integrated itself into the
Microsoft product and Azure platform and
bring everything together so they got
another two years
please do I think I don't think it will
either I think I think everyone just
automatically writes off edge slash the
old explorers stuff simply because it's
the baked you know yeah it could be the
best that's ever gained at the benefit
the devil is gonna get enough time to
try it and find out right right it's I
mean you got holy your paint your keep
you keep freezing but I'm gonna if
you're talking with Toby for a sec here
everyone knows that explore an edge only
see enough internet to download Chrome
or Firefox or whatever you use and
that's it someone use your laptop to buy
a new computer try to take your car to
go car shopping you know it's like you
use explorer edge to download Chrome or
exactly never I never ever ever use edge
for anything ever ever ever yeah well it
sounds to me though like they're trying
to make it a big part of their game plan
like that like edge plays under this
whole as you remove this like lateral
move or actually not even ladder or sub
lateral move of taking windows and
putting it under a sure now they want
edge to kind of become its own entity
not so much a part of the operating
system but across all platforms that
includes the iOS app the Android app
yeah you can get fucking edge on
everything now so they really want to
streamline it make it like the best that
it can be and they pretty much you know
allocated unlimited resources to that
and then the last little piece of news
that I have is and I would even call
this news let's just call this a
prediction is there is gonna be another
round of layoffs coming at Microsoft
undoubtedly because any time
historically when Microsoft has merged
two divisions together
there has been overlap there's always
redundancy always save that I mean
that's why I'm out of a job right they
merged
Xbox they Windows Phone and Windows all
under the same division and they're like
well we don't need three fucking test
teams anymore so they basically just
picked the test team that the current
management was most familiar with which
was the Windows Phone test team which
still makes no fucking sense to me that
they pick the guy on the project that
failed to basically run the test effort
for the products that succeeded makes no
sense to me but anyways
that's what they decided to do so expect
if you know anybody that's working at
Microsoft especially in the test or
development disciplines that anywhere
where there's overlap between as you're
in the operating system where things
were being duplicated they're gonna
slowly start phasing that out and either
move those people out of those positions
or just fucking put a gun to their head
well hey real quick someone's like hey
Josh I thought fractals from Sweden it
is so I didn't know that is that up for
he don't sound very Swedish I know I
don't wait wait wait crack those from
suite what the fuck I didn't know this
I'm serious
yeah I'm dead serious I didn't know
fractals based like out of Sweden era
based in sweida okay wow I didn't know
the Swedes made anything but like IKEA
friend I can't believe you minimalism I
believe every box has always said
engineer three computers they come to me
out of the box Jesus I didn't know that
city that do your cases come flat pack
then do they come in like little little
like envelopes and you pull out all the
sheets and like bend up and weld them
together yeah they come with this office
they come with a little stick figure
instructions on how to put it together
do this do that with a lap you can't my
house off you guys or at least the case
that was like like give it the name like
like the gerber he and Sheehan yeah the
gauge to get galaktion speaking oh my
god people think that I was the CEO of
fractals like I'm not I am the vice
president marketing for North America
and this I've never tried to say it was
the CEO of a big deal though I mean
you've always called yourself the vice
president marketing in North America
it's the second what you are anyone
who's ever said or thought you were the
CEO just assumed it and never actually
picked up that information from anywhere
a just like they just pulled it out of
the thin air I mean let's be honest here
muffin stuffer says that they love me so
that's an accomplishment for they love
to stuff your muscles and yeah it turns
like really into baking or something
like that like I just make the IKEA case
you speak Swedish no well I say I could
say a few things but I can't say I'm
here oh you picked up a business meeting
shit oh yeah England is actually
producing most of the furniture
don't really care really can I was like
saying everything we're using from China
anyway so see what he talks about Volvo
you know like when they're talking about
Sweden like Saab I'm like I'm or like
it's like shit it's like Chevy right
designed in America and assembled in
Mexico yeah Saab's been thrown around
like crazy no I didn't I hear they got
bought again probably I think Saab but
like they don't officially have a car
out right now but I heard that because
they had to close down after they were
like acquired three times back in like
the early 2000s and then I heard that
they got bought by somebody else
again so you may actually see Saab cars
again at some point well the pieces of
shit though don't buy them they're
fucking terrible cars well the thing is
I mean it's like you look at any you
know my major auto manufacturer you look
at like you know Ferrari Lamborghini
many times those have been bought so let
me Chrysler only out for a while right
well Chrysler own Saab - I remember
watching the top of your episode where
they said they bought him and they tried
to change everything and and they were
spending too much money so they ditched
him yeah I mean and that's the thing I
like when people look at - you know the
quality of like automotive electronics
or things like that you see something -
spoke like a Lambo or Ferrari or
connects yeah or anything like that like
oh that was so high it's like honestly
the best in-car entertainment stuff that
I've seen is always like Ford and GM
because they make I don't know five
million of them a year as opposed like
Lambo who's either taken howdy leftovers
and trying to force them into the - yeah
yeah a lot of people don't realize - the
most of the electronics that are in all
the cars now all come from one or two
major distributors because of all the
safety bullshit like all the airbags are
manufactured by like one of two
companies all the electronics are
usually Denso or this other company that
each of their German or Japanese because
it just makes them easier for them to
certify their cars for sale cuz like in
the United States you have to be able to
how many do you get a crash test you got
a crash test I think five cars or
something to be able to sell in the US
market genetics I think like the the CCX
generation or whatever technically not
road-legal because they wouldn't submit
them they do like spice and testing but
they wouldn't submit physical samples
because hey yeah here's 12 million
dollars by the time yeah exactly just
blow up just fucking priceless cars and
they're only gonna make one of like a
hundred years of hidden traps like five
of them fuck that no apparently thinking
that guy that day I work like oh man I
really
wanna hit this with a side slid but here
we go I have thawed yeah I haven't
calendar if this is true or not
crypt crypt on ice says I hit a tree
going 74 my Volvo and still drove built
like brick shithouse as though because
they all weigh a fucking ton like I
don't know of a single Volvo that's
under like 4000 pounds which we do a
header into it or junk sideswipe it you
know yeah it's like did you did you
knock a mirror off and the car under and
it still ran coffee oh and I really
splashed that someone asked what Nick is
playing in the background right now he's
huh yeah he was playing for titanfall -
and now it looks like he's just playing
Spotify and moderator oh oh I actually
take actually take back what I said
about Saab somebody made a good point
the Saab 9000 was actually a really good
car I'm talking I'm talking with Saab
was its own company they made good cars
when Chrysler acquired him and
everything they started making shit cars
because they were just rebranding
American market cars as Saab and fucking
with interiors a little bit I love it
when of questions have like the most
important thing missing is the decent
model block for the GTX 280 you can
suggest them I think it's is there a
decent model I know but the Z that's the
letter that's missing J a decent mono
block for G they're not called mana
blocks they called full cover blocks
when they're for graphics cards first of
all I'm on a walk flick would like
motherboard like I have on that
we're like amplifiers monoblock is what
I think of amps when I think of mono
block or mono price that's because
you're dumb Jerry's a monorail I am a
little bit uh yeah go get a block from a
company that makes blocks for your card
I mean what else to say hey Lackey
Macintosh asking how I like my mouse I
love it this is the logitech g502 and
I've been using this thing for about
five years and I still haven't replaced
its longest I've ever owned a mouse
without destroying it I'm here I've
still been using my cool Master Reaper
Mouse actually see him storm Reaper
Mouse for just as long and I love this
mouse I think is that much bigger place
mine I wanted to get like a new Mouse
I'm running like a SteelSeries right now
and it's like I can use it but the fit
is not right and for me it's like I
don't care about the DPI blah blah blah
blah blah see if it doesn't feel right
it just sucks yeah have you seen the new
Logitech that's got the wireless
charging through the mat and zero lag RF
system do you have I mean they and a lot
of other companies have been doing that
now so it's not even really like a new
thing Oh gotcha
well there's the only one I tried when I
was when I was down at twitchcon I was
like fucking around with it there booth
and I was like I can always notice the
lag on a wireless mouse I don't care how
good it is I've always noticed it's the
first Mouse that I didn't see any
appreciable lag flippin Adams incognito
tabs yep I don't use incognito tabs I
don't I'm not embarrassed of my search
history no I still acting on my phone
that like casts it to the whatever
closest TV is on and I've gotten lucky
so far the xander hasn't been there that
take some explaining so my little one
you know she's three and she's got Maya
Oh actually she's she's got my wife's
old iPhone six that it has no connection
or like service or anything turned on to
it but she uses yeah YouTube kids and
little kids games and stuff she'll get
mad like my video is not playing but
she'll keep she'll keep err plotting it
up to or err playing it up to the
theater room upstairs and then I'll hear
the theater just start blasting like
kids videos dude would it be funny if
you're in the bedroom having a little a
little alone time with Miss jst sense
and it's like you're watching something
on the TV it's all hot and then I'll sit
and just pops on it's like the fucking
poggle's or whatever it is Barney shows
up because you can control the volume of
like the airplay through the phone yeah
she'll think that it's just turned down
so she'll crank the audio through the
phone and not you you haven't heard the
upstairs theater like my dev tech 9000
set up up there it will shit the whole
damn house and it's terrifying and
usually you know Little J my older
daughter will be up there playing her
computer because it's in the same loft
yeah and then she'll just you'll just
hear her scream because she gets scared
cuz the TV suddenly turns on just like
instant 10 and yeah it's kind of funny
but annoying I need to turn off airplay
on that receiver there's no reason for
me to even have it on yeah Sandra would
freak if it was like full wall he would
just like run out of the room he's
pretty sensitive to really loud noise
water-cooling question why don't people
use flu attempt to control fan speed
because usually your fluid tempo only
range like about 5c difference between
its coldest and its hottest
again these are we actually got a huge
care package from EKF stuff that I
requested so I could do these you saw
that right so I could do these videos
showing people how one loop order does
not matter to how you can oversize your
system and get no benefits out of it and
three to show I'd actually have
temperature probes and like a
pass-through temperature fitting so
it'll show a readout of how much
temperature does not change between max
load and idle the water temp itself does
not change but maybe five see from its
hottest to its coldest now I've got all
the temperature probes and stuff to show
in different parts of the loop like look
here's what the temp isn't so so that
all these videos planned out but they're
they're being more or less time for the
beginning of summer because that's when
these videos are much more relevant get
water Cooling's for poor people man so I
got a couple things here real quick
first of all the guy that's asked about
the replacement side panel like anywhere
just contact our tech support department
they can help you out and I was gonna
ask you guys it seems like a logical
place to start right yeah I mean that's
what I do that's the thing like were we
get those questions on like social media
we're not trying to be dicks but it's
like if you wants to troubleshoot
something in 280 characters it's kind of
difficult where I was gonna direct you
back to the tech support they'll help
you out and then like whenever I show up
in videos I get this lot he sounds like
or he looks like like who do you get do
you ever get like Oh Jay looks like so
until Jay sounds like so-and-so or no
I'm pretty unique other than drunk on
the goonies yet now secondly I heard
from you know in all seriousness I think
when people spot me out in public it's
because I'm a very unique looking
individual like there's no one that
sounds like the most politically correct
way to describe you I thought I was
unique inside with the Goshen Indiana I
met two people that could literally be
my fucking clones there right well you
know boobs still be you know through now
someone asked if I'm driving a red 911
because they saw me on the 60 nope
Jay King confirmed black Corvette this
time black Corvette god dammit you drive
fucking nice rent I broke and I broke
Jays windshield you know we went on a
candy run today and he kicked up a rock
about the size of a marble and put the
car kicked up her and I ran like booted
one at his car no you threw at my hand
that's like that's out the window slow
him down so yeah he put out he put her
chip and cracking my windshield does
that thing have a fancy window and it
were cost more because it's like lighter
weight or something no it's the exact
same one it's like the baseball's good
no no I mean that's a good thing so I
had a friend who had this a acoustically
modified glass windshield came in his
car or something he's like oh yeah it
makes it really quiet inside but the
replacement cost $900 because it has the
PDR it might have a different windshield
so I don't know well you better hope it
doesn't does it have like a little
fucking wires running through it or
anything for heaters or defroster I have
an insurance on it so doesn't really
matter
no but insurance that sometimes will
only cover up to a certain amount like
the only this is through the dealership
for this specific car Oh gotcha
okay nevermind well and the thing is
like you know I mean there are cars that
have that where it's basically like like
the double sealed glass and go on your
car yeah I feel that when you feel like
the edge of the side window it's got
kind of denominated pieces going
together like the a eight now to eight
eight eight had that and then like
obviously I Drive a lot of different
rental cars it's like it's becoming much
more common even like lower spec cars to
have like the double walled or whatever
you want to call that sealed bonded
whatever yeah we like the lexan rear
windows that's kind of becoming a thing
to shave weight now or you have like the
back window that's flexible we're
discussing that the other day like all
the bullshit the carbon adventures come
up with on a performance car associated
way like Oh your gt3 RS no door handles
we're gonna put straps oh thanks for the
seven ounces you say one of the things
they did on my car to save weight was to
remove the daylight running lamps which
they said was seven pounds I could see
this hanging out on the end too so still
those seven pounds four lights like I
don't even know how you get to that
weight unless you're fucking like drip
and let on it or something like wiring
harness unfortunately where the crack is
on my windshield I have to get a repair
door it's gonna spread obviously but
it's like down at the bottom just above
the windshield wiper where it's still
like the black border around the
windshield so it's not like an oil or
anything it's down low so so is it still
like quarter size though or it can be
like injected and fixed it's smaller
than that it can be injected the thing
is also you can still see the crack and
that's gonna bug me
oh no have you seen that they used to I
watched a guy do it like not six months
ago and I could not tell cuz they do
this grinding thing now for the grind
apologize cuz remember how before it
looked like the glass had a ripple like
a little circular ripple in it
that doesn't happen anyway I guess you
have to have this one method but yeah
they have a method now where they
injected and then once it sets up they
use like this fucking die grinder thing
it grinds it down to the surface of the
glass and then they polish it out and it
literally looks absolutely flawless well
I mean there's there's obviously the
impact mark and then there's yeah Strait
cracks that come out from that so okay
so so maybe that wouldn't that wouldn't
work out so well what they had basically
said was they will what they'll do is
like they'll try and repair it and if
they can then they will then they'll
repair it if they can't then they will
repair the or replace the whole
windshield okay is it the dealership
that's gonna do the windshield swap or
the repair the dealership will do it the
see I love that dealership has a guy on
on site that doesn't that's awesome
because every time I get a window put
because my STI eats about a windshield a
year because you know it's the most uh
narrow dynamic fucking car ever made
it kicks up its own rocks and breaks
this window if you can believe that so
so there were every time they replace
the windshield they always use this
generic fucking trim around the
windshield that does not match anything
and it drives me nuts you know you know
what I'm talking about that fake like a
little plastic it almost just like goes
over the lip of the glass before they
glue it in just to form a seal and it's
not like the trim that goes over the
bodywork so it leaves a gap and it
drives me absolutely bonkers and they
always do it okay so one question I get
the question for Josh you're on the
clock screen real estate space I have
Josh follow this with your head wait
there you go and then it helps that I'm
like you know what 14 2016 Chester Road
don't even flex on me I've got ten and a
half feet wide of display this is the
one side this is the other side sorry
about your PA
so anyone not the question basically
don't we make case with interchangeable
parts we don't I guess intentionally do
that already does it yeah there's always
gonna be some stuff that's reused like
if you check out our tech support
department for example like the defined
excel on the arc excel those side panels
were interchangeable drive trade certain
parts are but I mean it just kind of
things because like we're not really
trying to design cases to like hey how
many uses can we get out of the same
basic design it's largely do not say
let's go method of making cases yeah
it's it sergeant like what do you want
to do with it I mean like a defined see
is different than you know define Nano
or define ask but like a define see and
a mesh if I see are largely the same
interior chassis with ones airflow
whirring there once silence oriented so
I have a question for you yes how do you
feel about the Coolermaster mystify see
so anyway looking at the use 15 honestly
I haven't seen a ton of it if it's that
similar then hey I'll just say that you
know I am I'm flattered
it is the it is the highest form of
flattery
to be fair everything visible if you
have a die grinder at a spot welder
Friday just say and you make
military-style case handles like the old
coarser yeah we could we could do pretty
much anything the biggest thing like
what you've seen with the new metruff I
see white the mesh if I see mini the the
black out series all those came because
you know our fans went to our website
went to the contact us section and said
hey product suggestions we want to see
this it's supply and demand you guys
tell us what you want to see there's
enough demand we want to supply it so
I'm gonna talk about I just want to
troll you with like a thousand accounts
now that just sent a random requests for
the same thing I'm gonna talk about this
one here a quick Cody Sanders asks J how
do y'all feel about the new Corvettes I
said I saw that earlier do you want to
interrupt you we're talking I love the
Corvette love it okay so the 2019
Corvette zr1 is like what the zo6 kind
of should have been see the zo6 came out
and it was an under performed in terms
of cooling it was a overheated it cooked
the oil and it's the same engine that's
in my car the OLT for supercharged and
they put it in the Camaro zl1 and then
just it completely dominated the zo6
so of course Corvettes firing back with
the 2019 zr1 which is I think it's
awesome first of all I mean why would I
get mad that a Corvette is faster than
my car it's alright have to look it up
it's about $129,000 and hundred twenty
thousand to start yeah fucking Corvette
Jesus yeah it was his base for zero to
16 2.8 it is zero that's high does zero
to 106 flat it's the top is like 212
something like that and it's ten five
and a quarter now to put into
perspective my car is zero to 60 in 3.5
and I don't know what zero 200 is it's a
and it's 11 five
I think it's eleven point five at 1:23
in the quarter so it's no slouch by any
means but but but Jerry you don't even
know this yet I've already started the
process with Cunningham motorsports to
do the stage two 900 horsepower package
on my car dude what the fuck's wrong
with you seriously you're gonna die more
power I mean they're good driver but
you're not 900 horsepower on a track
good driver you're not you're not
fucking Mario Andretti you don't know
shit about my dress you're gonna die
dude and I'm probably be in the
passenger seat when it happens to all
end up playing another date get it back
from them no you're not you're not gonna
be in the bathroom seat of my car why
this suspension can handle it ma you
upgraded make it down here no I'm gonna
come down I told you just tell me when
okay I'll tell you what that was one
weekend you and sapphire had mud
wrestling that weekend herself I brought
a job I can come down tomorrow if you
want I'm just sick why did you touch you
track events last year and won this year
so far and all three were like can't
okay well this one I could this one I
couldn't come back those physically out
of town that's a difference like
know-it-alls gone where I was working
you left after I got back to go to your
way did I yes you didn't even get the
weekend right when you were like nope
not I'm not around you're so I left on
the 20 when I leave 23rd yeah I see my
track day was 18th which is what I told
you on the on the stream so I totally
could have made that now Ryan okay I'm a
dick I'm a dick hey I'm looking at the
zr1 though it does look an awful lot
like the Ferrari five nine what is it
they're alive no 9x yes because they
opened up the front to give it more
cooling like it needs to so it has a
very similar like grille design now god
it's a cool looking car though I have to
say that is pretty pretty badass for me
like I would I would drive that all day
long I was gonna happen real quick
anybody that ever asked just fractile
make a bla please check our website
that's where we keep everything that we
make I'm not trying to be snotty but I
mean it's like legit if you're making it
we make if we make a mini ITX case of
five and quarter Bay yeah we do core 500
but generally start there and if you
don't see your answer there then hit us
up I just want a fleshlight holder for
the front of the case can you make that
happen
Josh Josh I would like to know if the
4770k with the 387 this was running
running g.skill ddr3 will allow me to
run a 360 mill a 30 mil read with these
needs to be like some read that was made
for like six months by some company
you've never heard of and yeah what I
love is how people think you test every
single possible iteration of hardware
ever and they're gonna get granular down
to I want to know if it's gonna fit this
exact configure well okay in here's part
of it right we get I saw a question
earlier about is it hard to make cases
if at 280 millimeter abs are basically
140 millimeter base treads that still
fit I have RAM clearance like a 140 rad
like like the 420 140 yeah built and
anything for that is like you always
gotta draw the line somewhere because
for the guy that's over there like God
if you made it an inch taller what if it
this would fit this with that there's
five other people saying why is it that
tall if you made it an inch shorter yeah
so much closer to what I want and that's
where you kind of have to draw the line
of this has the best compromise of
fitting multiple different radiator so
for example I mean the r6 can fit a 420
on the topic there 360 in the topic you
feel like you know two 40s all that
stuff but I mean can I do every single
thing at the same time know what's the
max it can do at any one time regardless
of hardware orientation on before 20 280
280 but you probably would never want to
do that could be a basement mount of 280
which would be a bitch to plumb but it
could technically do it and then I think
probably this is something that you know
you should do a video on sometime or you
might already have planned but it's like
there is a law of diminishing returns
yeah it's like if you put a 5-4 80 60
whatever the hell in there it all
depends on your ambient temperature it
depends on what you're trying to cool if
you're just cooling your CPU you're
gonna hit that where it's like I got a
really big radiator and my temps aren't
really changing there's no more I've
never not even touching the thermal
Headroom so we kind of have to make this
product where it fits a bunch of
different scenarios and that's where
it's not always gonna be tweaked and you
know we're happy to let you guys mod it
yourself there's a lot of people do some
crazy stuff with their cases that's
always really cool to see but now ek has
a configurator em online that they
requested a lot of support from their
Kohn customers to let them know like hey
this rad fits in this case yeah you know
in this config and and they've been
building that database but it's a
hundred percent dependent on the
customer feedback and because their
feedback being correct
yeah well it's cuz it's not like they
can go out and and seriously buy like
every single every single iteration of
hardware you mean and even if they could
when do they test fit how long would it
take to put all those different you know
factors in there so what we try to do is
we try to put stuff on our website of
like support CPU coolers up to this
height and like we'll get questions like
I know it says it sports up 262 this
one's 160 300 let's support that
technically no that's why we had to say
162 now maybe you could stuff it in
there but we have to draw the line where
we say this is officially what it is and
you know and we even rely on other
vendors because it's like well I think
they measure from the heat plate and not
from you know the extended leg mounts
it's like I don't know how say cryo rig
or whoever measures it all we're saying
is this is how much room you have from
the motherboard plate or from the
motherboard to the side of the case and
we do the best we can but anything
whether it's cars like hey can I go
aftermarket and cream out twin-turbo
setup it should fit in the car and then
you get to doing it and dust or like
well we're doing it's like you're the
best laid plans but you're never really
gonna know until you get right in there
yeah alright so let's talk about your
build that we just finished sure so ok
obviously you go and put so much in a
video how do you like is there anything
you're not happy with about how it
turned out there's anything you would
change right now if you could go back
and do something get him Josh I don't
eat him I was just gonna call I should
build a plan his own build the only
thing I would change honestly no I mean
it's you know so far it boots that so
it's great yeah that's a good works is
gonna be up there and a lot of the time
I did plan out ahead of time there's
there's times where it's a pain in the
ass to get stuff you know put together
like we were talking about it's a game
of millimeters right if it's off a
little bit left off a little bit right
yeah we do what we can
to make it fit I didn't really have a
loop in mind when I looked at as far as
like how I wanted the tubing runs to go
or how I wanted it to look honestly I'm
surprised how good it looked when it
turned cuz I got we got a lot of
comments I'm people like hey I don't
like purple but that actually pretty
badass
so I mean okay so many people go with
the staple colors right blue red mostly
red right wax White has kind of been a
thing lately like my white fluid and
something that I mean but purple is one
of those like it's not the easiest to
pull off but I think you did really well
with the the cables really tied it
together and there's more RGB in your
bill than anything I've ever done where
did I see this thing I want to see what
you guys are talking about here it's on
the YouTube yeah there's a place online
where people put videos it's car I'm
gonna go on the only youtubes okay is
its last video you uploaded probably
just find it and if you go to Josh's
Twitter he's my sure he's put it yeah
that's all I see is I see it
yeah actually purple looks really good
in that build well thank you and that's
the thing I went to first fired up did
they like the rainbow cute thing and as
I said from the beginning my thing with
the RGB is not to have it go spectrum
it's like I just want to use it so I can
color match it I'm so nervous I'm gonna
dress this one skill Drock Josh why did
you choose i9 as if Red River for the
build the same reason why if he chose
thread Ripper they'd be like Josh why
did you choose Red River and not I 9
yeah I'm so I'm so tired of the why did
you why did you or why didn't you why
did it you actions to be fair you know
you get both sides of anything you do
online like when I'll be streams you
like well you have a 4770k where the
fuck you run to that like you can still
see me right you're still watching me
streams so it works that's why I'm
running that then you have created
something like this look over proved
okay so let me tell you let me tell you
what's annoying about Red River is the
CCX do you know the CCX is its I've no
idea okay so thread Ripper no joke is
too 1800 X is basically on a single die
that's why Intel was was making this the
comment of legumes two CPUs glued
together
yeah well the CC X is the glue and it's
a it's it's basically like sort of like
how the Infinity fabric works yeah and
it communicate has a crosstalk and cross
communicate on the actual die you can
find a lot of diagrams about how this
works
and there's what is
like what they call their content
creator mode mm-hmm and then there's
like gamer mode or like professional
mode game remote yeah and you know
neither of them perform best at
everything in either mode so for
instance jack of all trades master of
none right so if you want to if you
wanted to go into content creator mode
and run all your memory at max speed and
get all your performance of all your
cores and stuff then that works fine for
things like Cinebench and your your
video editing color grading uh stuff in
like DaVinci and all that stuff but if
you go into gaming they have found
there's actually a decrease in
performance in games because of the
latency that takes place between the CPU
alternating and crosstalking over
through the through the affinity fabric
so what happens is you go into game mode
it shuts off half the course it turns it
from a sixteen core to an eight core
okay yeah so then they found most games
that perform better that way there are
some games that are very hyper thread or
hyper threaded they're very multi
threaded that perform better in content
greater mode or creative mode so you're
constantly having to like switch these
modes and figure out which is best
unless you just want to leave it in
creator mode and take the hidden gaming
you don't know what that ni9 yeah on and
then that's kind of the thing you know
it's like there's there's a lot of it
you know as far as the ecosystem you
know I haven't really liked a CS for the
rampage six you know yeah it happens to
be the fact like I could have gone with
a thread where it's like I know people
at AMD that I could work with and it's
like it's not really so much Allegiance
it's like hey it kind of worked out for
what I wanted to do and honestly the end
of the day I didn't sweat it because
you're gonna get props and you're gonna
get shit from people no matter what side
of the fence that you're on you know so
yep so I said yeah it worked for me I'm
really happy it's not a one size fits
all though like no matter what like
there is no scenario where you can say
this is absolutely gonna be faster at
everything well and when we were doing
we were gonna come up with a bill nice
talking to Jim Joe guy says you can code
around CCX but he's not a coder he's an
end user that makes no people that make
his software probably aren't doing that
also that's the other thing you got to
take into consideration well and that's
one of the things I'd like I talked
about in the video was like you know
this is largely it's a work rig and also
gaming or it's gonna be kind of a
catch-all but the big thing is like yeah
I worked on average 16 hours a day you
know so if I'm down for four hours that
really kind of screws me so it's like
I'm also not gonna overclock the crap
out of it yeah
so if J singing DEA's subpar did I say
that did I say a MDS subpar he said well
he doesn't like about CCS right what I
said C's reacts
CCX for a dual purpose machine like this
is kind of annoying if you if you spent
that kind of and you bought your
processor that was not a sponsored part
yeah if you are spending the money on
that and you are doing it for a dual
purpose like you want to yep then you
want to get the most out of what you
spent no yeah it's also gonna fail
because we didn't deal it it the temps
are doing pretty damn good by the way
yeah how much was that CPU what'd you
pay for it nothing is like what 12 okay
so yeah it's a it was about $300 more
than you could have gotten a 1950 x4 and
the 1950 X does indeed have more cores
and stuff but I think but for what
you're using it for you'd probably
notice very little difference between
the two but it's about preference and
it's about having options because you
know what if we lived in this world
where AMD still didn't compete then we
would it would suck to have everything
be super one-sided like it's been for a
while unfortunately GPUs and stuff and
GPU performance but you have choice so
what I hate and what I what I hate about
the PC master-race and the whole PC
crowd is this divide of like know you've
got using envy or you've got to use
Intel or whatever or you suck or your
system sucks and that is if stupidest
mentality that shit I am ashamed of the
people who think that way in this
community because they make a whole
community look bad by doing that what
bothers me is you know I hear a lot of
the PC master-race in person I don't
consider myself a part of the PC
master-race or whatever I'm not crapping
on the people that do you know in my
mind what really bothers me is when
someone tries to join a community right
like yeah so what makes the leap and
it's gonna build their first system they
go into a forum and then people shit all
over them for like what they chose yeah
and it's like you think that really
makes people want to be a part of
something like hey I picked this and
this is what I could afford and maybe
I'm gonna upgrade this in you know six
months but I got them on the video
karthik and he's right now and it's oh
you should've done this you shoot it on
that because i like this it's like
that's an opinion man and that's fine
but don't crap on someone for using that
yeah and then again you get people like
you wonder why i just want to go contort
or what they'd only want to dick with
yeah building a PC they just want to buy
one they buy one oh god
you know PC yeah most people who go to
forums right where the be Tom's Hardware
hard o CP OC overclock net whatever the
poor Jam no Jerry the the people who are
like who have the hard core you know
that that's usually what they see I
think a lot of the comments a lot of the
viewers on YouTube don't go to the
comments actually comments section is
not a very good place for discussion
obviously and so I think most people are
just accustomed to seeing the comments
on the various build build got or build
logs and stuff they'll see yeah they
don't get to see the comments from the
perspective of like lioness or myself or
Paul or Kyle and I'm telling you right
now that's it's it's the saddest thing
to try and preach like my channel is
literally about just giving people
information entertaining people and
letting them make their own choices I
want to help people make a choice or arm
them with information to make their
choice I'm never going to tell someone
go buy this go buy that but it's sad and
it really it really at times makes me
feel ashamed of like that debt mentality
of like people that will shit on someone
else's build because they use parts that
that person wouldn't have picked and I
think that I think the thing is like
when you're looking at the comments
section or forums or whatever you know
basically opinions and knowledge or the
the currency of that location it's like
yeah I can one-up you and say that I
know more about this or I could have
picked a better video card that was on
sale that particular day for 10 bucks
off the local Micro Center with 10
coupons and you know a hug in the
backroom sort of thing it's like fine
yeah you can prove someone wrong and
then you've trumped them and then you're
a better online person than they are the
thing is at the end of the day they're
winning a race yeah it's like don't be
an asshole
I mean it's like if you really want to
join this well well your dickhole
it's like if you really well even have
to be a part of this community if you
want people to be able to mod their
cases build their own pcs or whatever if
they don't build the same way you do
that that's fine you know what like
maybe your mom's cookies or shit you
love them but I think they're shit and
I'm gonna tell you they're shit that
doesn't mean they're shit that's means I
don't like them if you like and bless
you do what works for you what's it you
you have people constantly saying that
that what they think is the best should
be the best for everybody else when
there's so many different scenarios like
Jay how much how often do you get it
where somebody actually uses you in the
defense of their argue
by completely erroneously like ogee
would never use that or J thinks that's
a piece of shit or something like what
for you J would believe you that all the
time of me
I don't know and they had somebody do
that with 3d printers before they're
like oh yeah you know Jerry only uses
Ultimaker cuz they're like the best
printer ever no I only use all teamaker
because they fuckin sent me my first
printer and I have like nine of their
printers so just by default I use ur
shit it doesn't mean that it's bad but
it doesn't mean I'm saying it's the only
good thing on planet earth you know not
by a long shot boring it would be if
every hobby you had had no choice like
if you want to race the car everyone
races the same car now okay yes yes and
leagues to keep things fair but yeah
everyone be like that movie equilibrium
like where everybody just take a
medication and all agrees on the same
thing and the same doctrine you just
wake up and go through the same moves
and try the same cars and do the same
jobs you know I'm totally gonna gonna
devil's advocate my own statement though
know how good gaming would be though if
we all had the same CPU and all the same
GPUs and stuff cuz they never change so
you mean like a console okay gaming
isn't fair now like everybody's got like
that now Xbox one versus Xbox one X how
the fuck is that fair one's got like
double the framerate better graphics 4k
vs. 1080p Alex and while you're Cubs is
hotter than the other one like that
doesn't even matter easy one of them
clearly is hotter than the other one I'm
just gonna go on record and say that
Fred yeah so okay someone keeps asking
is there gonna be a new define s I'll go
and answer all those questions for you
right now and fortunately not talking
about products there may or may not be
in development so if it's is this new
thing gonna come out I don't know if I
didn't know I couldn't tell you until it
came out but if you want to see
something go to our website contact us
product suggestions let us I on the
other hand could talk all I want so no
video for that no one's gonna listen I
have 1.4 million year 10 subscribers and
gray hair it's 1.4 - I think oh hey why
are you growing so slow again man you
were growing all like super fast think I
slowed down again what fuck I'm sorry
that I'm only doing a thousand or so a
day Jerry that's like poor people we
used to do that like way back in the day
get on that next-level shit I want to
see like 5000 a day man come on Jay
likes the undulator
you know you gotta hold back a little
bit well yeah I got I try not to
completely you know bring all the steam
out here
your engines I'm trying to get down to
single digits let me see if I've done it
yet you're almost there you don't worry
you know it's funny is Jay used to
actually watch my watch my socialblade
stats Morton I did like he'd say
something to be like oh shit like I
didn't know is that bad oh my god having
to say about the case though is they
define s so that was the first like case
of its of its type right like the open
open yeah kind of like saying josh is
there gonna be a define R 7 that's it's
probably there's been a 3 or 4 out of 5
it's certain things you can look at
where I mean it's like okay so like when
you look at the define see that's
basically compact it's like we don't put
five a quarter bay drives in it so it's
shorter front to back then you have like
to define a switch like that open
interior define ours are always gonna be
you know I guess like what they are now
like a nice amount of storage fairly
flexible and also silence focused define
is our silent series so yeah it's like
the define s if it's doing really well
there's generally gonna be an update to
it um you know so honestly probably
they'll probably be an hour seven but I
can't tell you for sure and the reason a
lot of people thing is like oh you wanna
be secretive it's like no it's part of
its because it's that like I have no
idea when they're gonna come out you can
have planned dates for stuff to come out
there can be a production delay there
could be a logistics delay yeah and it
gets blown out like obviously we're
having a lot of issues right now ar6
selling out so damn fast that they keep
going out of stock on Newegg and then
people get upset with us and I totally
get it but at the end of the day it's
one of those things where it's like hey
we don't make any money if we don't sell
them either you know we are trying to
get them to you as quick as pop you mean
gonna get the Harrison Ford thing I
don't get that you mean I just saw that
- I was like I kind of now I got that
stuck in my head
you do kind of a giant team doesn't just
sit around now like done like they're
just done peace out you guys could
probably move a lot faster if you
adopted thermal takes model and just you
know stole the designs and just you know
copied copied all the shit and sent it
over your design department and China no
comment on that one but you know what I
can't say is like things are always
evolutional it's not necessarily okay
the r6 comes out now let's are working
on the r7 like a lot of that stuff runs
in parallel because maybe there's
features that you want to put on a
version of a case or any product phone
whatever and you have to make that cut
time okay we need to launch this or it's
gonna be in it's gonna be an RD forever
you know so it's like you make the
decision like this is what this is gonna
be we couldn't get that feature in on
this one so we're gonna move to the next
model year or to the next version or
maybe a different product in the lineup
so you know it's like the r6 was
probably still being developed while the
r5 was being finalized and the air for
was going to end of life and so on so
you could tell he's way behind like on
the chat it says yo Barney edge is built
into Windows Explorer whoa
must be watching like the recording he's
watching via fax machine I like all my
fractal cases I've got to I've got two
of them sitting one on my desk and one
underneath it
yeah but then I find out you Excel when
you are two would you have chosen those
cases or you just use them because
that's what that's what puget uses oh
that's a good question actually if I
could choose them and money was no
object the case labs I just um their
cases just or just over the top but I
wouldn't want him if I had to drag the
shit that land party I'll tell you that
I don't even think that offends Josh
because I mean that's not even a
competing product that's no no they're
over there expensive I mean it's like
yeah it's like tipped and the tiffany's
of case design and obviously it's like
you know like something like the size of
skunkworks right that's what they asked
him away yeah basically was like I'm
never taking that to another land part
and that's kind of the thing where it's
like you know a case that costs four to
five times as much as our flagship case
and is you how much bigger it should
have a lot more flexibility yeah yeah no
salt it's like I whenever i stream
whenever I'm on a lot of shows like this
you get a lot of the you know okay what
do you think about that you know I don't
want your case want to get the Corsair
blah blah blah good get what you want
I'm not gonna talk you into our cases if
you don't like em it might be an
aesthetic thing or might be a feature
thing it's like yeah there it does me no
good to force you into our case have you
hate it and then go bitch to all your
friends or not be happy with it right so
I want you to get whatever we're close
being considered I do love the cases I
mean they're they're lightweight which
is something that is really important to
me especially since then my back is just
all fucked up and they drag these things
around with me John laid out well to
Josh's Jay's ginger son right you're
older than me yeah I am I'm older than J
what does this say about me but we have
a DeLorean somewhere I love all the
comments about my gray hair like like
it's something new it is it's soft round
of how many comments there on an old
video
whirring - yes well gray hair is like
coarser than like non gray hair mine
isn't though that's what's weird mine
mine is he going that direction yeah
well no I'm pretty I'm pretty grey now
man I'm like I I cut it down so it
doesn't look that bad oh my god
everybody I've run into you said oh my
god where all the gray come from
noticed your gray right now because it's
do you sell enough of your dark brown
hair to actually notice the gray see
it's a contract I see a brown hair I'm
like whoa how'd you how are you still
here then they say your hair's a little
dark enjoy you need to wash your hair
nasty man yeah that's funny but my
doctor tried to give me the upsides of
having low testosterone I'll go on the
plus side you aged a lot slower and you
never lose your hair I was like was Jay
a ginger no my natural hair color was
very like medium brown like kind of
golden brown
I get this a lot what's my favorite non
fractal case well you know I work in
marketing for fractal but you know let
me go ahead and just punt off that one I
like a lot of the pace laps stuff I mean
honestly you know it's like but at the
same point in time you know if it comes
down to me if I yeah everyone thinks I'm
made out of money and stuff it's like I
rent these cars you know what one of my
favorite cases is cases is justices well
it's based off Silverstone but the
murder box okay yeah you have like the
MD whatever yeah because it's a total
it's a total custom like they take it
they take a being where they grew the
shroud from the fans of the fan hub is
just sitting on the top yeah but it's a
the whole case that they sell is a case
mod so they start with the silver cell
with it that's also a $1,500 $2,000 it's
like 1250 yeah it's really expensive I
like simple cases I don't like the cases
that are all mega blinged up and shit
right out of the box
jury look at murder bots it's done like
really sleaze okay if I type murder
boxing with no filter am I gonna see
like headless porn videos look at murder
box case then there we go actual rock
okay no no I like that that's actually
really clear I like the rounded edges -
yeah okay that's a cool case I've never
seen it before kind of base like that
it's over some tjo stuff it is it is 80
jo7 that's what starts as aa that's a
really cool website be translated each
other when languages like German it
should already be should go to our
website check the top there should be
like the
I can pick on four like Chinese and
Japanese and other languages I think
German should be there
hey guys which cryptocurrency do you
think will explode next does that mean
explode is in fail or explode is in
blow-up Oh Jerry I usually go up Jerry
maybe you could talk about this I heard
rumors that there is apparently an ASIC
being developed for aetherium have you
heard this I have I have I don't I don't
know how far along they are on it but
that would be a huge boon for the GPO
market going back to gamers but that's
not a theorem was specifically
programmed to not work with an ASIC no
so here here's it would have to be a
hybrid ASIC it wouldn't be a true ASIC
the ASIC would just be responsible for
the actual mathematical calculation the
it would still need a shitload of ddr4
ddr5 memory in that that's where it gets
tricky because it you need the memory
the etherium is all about looking shit
up very very quickly so so memory is is
the is kind of the stopping point memory
happens to be one of the most expensive
components of the GPU manufacturing
right now so once they can build the
ecig that'll be the cheap part basic
that just does the mathematical
calculation is gonna be think of it like
you know normally you'd have the GPU
running the code to figure out the math
well the ISA cos just think of it like a
hardwired one purpose only instantaneous
mathematical calculator that just runs
one algorithm that's all I would do
now the reason they'd be hybrid is
because the other side of that ASIC
would be a huge Bank of memory and a
controller and a smaller computer that
would be responsible for looking the
shit up and putting it into the right
registers for the ASIC to basically run
through and do the math so it's gonna be
a lot more expensive because of the
amount of memory and the speed and
memory that you're needing cuz it's not
just it's not just the speed of the
memory it's the quantity that's why the
1066 get six gigabyte card just
decimates the four gigabyte version so
so it's I think there's still a couple
things that need to happen before that
becomes mainstream plus the other thing
you have to factor in is even if they do
build this ASIC they're gonna be selling
it for whatever the current
profitability of the currency is to the
to the mainstream market and then
everybody in China that's running to big
minds is basically gonna get them
wholesale so they can corner the market
same thing happened with Bitcoin when
when Asics came on the market so rou so
it'll be a while so Rubin and super
chess says how can we don't see more
cases come with USB type-c ports cost
yeah the cost of the actual module
itself is not cheap but here's here's my
take on this other than USB type-c like
storage devices and stuff peripherals
are not going to USB type-c because of
ghent cost and then to you limit your
customer base to only those people who
have USB type-c on their case so I feel
like both are kind of waiting on the
other to sort of mainstream it yeah it's
a bit of a standoff the other thing to
look at too is you know anybody right
now that has USB see count the number of
us PC devices you have versus the number
of regular USB devices you have and you
know do the math on how many ports of
which one you need and I understand that
people have those PC like I have it
right now like obviously on my phone and
I have it on my my Ultrabook and that's
it and for me it's not that big of a
deal
not that I make that final decision but
a lot of the Kate like a lot of new
motherboards if they support it they
have back panel you can get like a hub
if you wanted to they up until recently
a lot of motherboards didn't even have
front panel USB C connectors so where I
go with that is everybody that said that
we should have had lightning in front
panel IO you know it's like where we'd
be now if we just ramped up a bunch of
those so it's not an ever thing we are
offering it obviously it's an upgrade
kit for the r6 that is coming but the
thing is it when you look at it when we
do the market research the number of
people that want it versus the number of
people that have it or more importantly
would pay the additional cost for it
it's there's a big Delta there so it
tends to be one of those vocal minority
things like I was people I haven't want
to make use of it I want to plug my
phone into my case or whatever charge it
from a case you know it just boils down
to the market is still 80% we still get
crap because some of our cases are USB
3.0 only we've had 2.0 and 3.0 some
people we bitched it it's not just all
3.0 and USB see other people like how
come I have to have two USB 3.0 ports
and they can't just all be backwards
compatible USB 2.0 motherboards old yeah
yeah and there are some serious
compatibility issues between USB 3.0 and
3.1 and 2.0 like not every device out
there made followed the specification
close enough without any hacks or
anything like that so where you just
plug it in and it works I've had webcams
before the fucking flip out when you
plug them in the USB 3.0 I've had audio
devices my mixer board shit like that
doesn't like being plugged into USB 3
now again it probably is more dependent
on the controller that I'm using but
it's still like a real issue
I think that having both options
available is still critically important
if you have a bunch of USB devices
well Knox is our thing if you look at
but you know the link in the chain so to
speak it's they plugged it in the case
it doesn't work it's the cases USB port
that's screwed up it's not the control
you know they don't there's a lot of
times people don't go that far down the
line and then right catch the flack for
you getting our May issue on something
that's still perfectly who's this guy he
works for fractal yeah it's J ste since
he same shit happen to Microsoft all the
time do they'd call and be like oh shit
Windows keeps popping up this error
message you must be a problem with
Windows no it's problem the fucking
device it's problem the harder it's
probably the driver nobody thinks about
that they're just like oh it's not
working in Windows was showing you the
dialog so let's call Microsoft we know
we try to intercept that as much as
possible in all of our shipment we have
like two hey if there's an issue with
your case call us and you know it has
the phone number for a tech support
email and that sort of thing it's like
if you get a case and there's a foot
broken off of it or something like that
yeah I understand that's part of your
build you want to get your build done
you don't want to wait to ship it back
and get a new one or run back to
crosstown or whatever a lot of times we
can ship you that part but the thing is
you have to contact us and a lot of
times unfortunately happens is people
like oh it's broke screw it fire back to
Newegg or whatever it might've been
something they're still fully
functioning or they could have done
their bill we could have got a part out
to them but again it's you don't always
get that chance to talk to everybody to
try to drive that as much as we can no
yeah sorry oh sorry there's a huge
different scene USB is there a huge
difference in USB 3.0 3.1 yeah about
double the speed yeah and I saw a
comment the one by earlier that said why
is Diaz piece the USB C type or type C
so expensive
yeah it's available I mean if you look
at the way like production works the
more you make of something the cheaper
it is because their tooling costs that
are required for you know obviously
we're not in there making our own actual
USB C port supports
there's a supplier that supplies those
because that's what they do they do it
very well and they can do it at an
economical price because that's what
they're geared up to do so the more you
make of it the lower the overall cost
yeah that's why McDonald's burgers are a
lot cheaper than going to a sit-down
restaurant so it's either pepparkakor ID
10 t yeah yeah plus the bandwidth the
bandwidth you get over USB 3.1 is insane
it's ten gig right about that though
being pet cat right prom exists between
keyboard and chair and then Oh ever
heard that in a long time then the ID 10
T error and it's like what's that write
it down yeah what a maybe so that
basically the thing
supply and demand anything brand-new is
gonna cost more so yeah you know it's
it's one of those things where obviously
there's still a huge market for USB 3.0
for the reasons that I explained it's
like if you count the numbers you know
USB 3.0 2.0 those are backwards
compatible but you know to pay on your
internal header but if you look at that
physical port the number of devices
there's in the marker created right now
to use that versus how many are USB CEOs
PCs pregnant one percent yeah plus
there's other perks there too cuz USB I
I think it's USB 3.0 it's not just 3.1
but I believe the it's a bi-directional
power if I'm not mistaken to where you
can actually pull power from a device
like a cell phone not just send power to
it it's not one direction I honestly
don't know I'm not bad up to speed on it
because I know on my on my new razor
phone that I got in and somebody
confirmed this happens on just about all
the new USBC type Android phones is you
can basically when you connect the USB
device to it say I connect the USBC
cable between the phone and another
device I can literally select whether I
want it to be a power source for the
other device or whether I want it to be
a data connection between the first
device like an ultrabook you have the
Ultrabook charge the phone or the phone
charge the Ultrabook exactly exactly so
I mean it's got some really really cool
features that don't exist in the
previous generations of USB plus does
anybody have to pay licensing or is it
an open technology honestly I probably a
question for product developers I don't
know okay because I know Thunderbolt if
you use Thunderbolt which is essentially
USB 3.0 just a different protocol
Thunderbolt you have to pay a licensing
fee I believe to Intel don't you that's
why most people don't have like
Thunderbolt ports on the side of shit
because they have to pay a bunch of
money for it Jack that could be I mean
cuz I mean well like Apple did Apple and
firewire is fire your largest one they
prefer firewire was Apple's version of
the 1394 protocol yeah yeah so it's kind
of like that was their marketing brand
version of it so I think it's the same
thing like 1394 porting me fireworks
yeah except for in their case it was the
exact same protocol they literally just
locked down the name so nobody else
could use it just like century no it's
like a certain controller Wi-Fi I saw
someone asked about they want to get
into like the hardware market it's
really like any market I mean this is
gonna sound like a dick thing to say but
it's like go to school get your degree
and just start applying in places in the
industry I mean there as far as I know
there's not really a trick
getting into tech I mean getting it's
not like J like you kind of got into
tech in the sense that you already
working in tech your YouTube channels of
tech because that's what you focused on
so it's kind of the same sort of thing
it's you know apply places I guess if
you're looking for from the currency it
looked like you're based in the UK but
I'm not sure but like if you're in the
u.s. it's like get comfortable with
wanting to live in California if you're
in hardware basically the the Silicon
Valley for the hardware side of things
for most of us is right around LA
you know City of Industry places like
that that's where a lot of the vendors
are at also up around they're not down
here they're in the Bay Area Fremont
yeah exactly so it's not like that you
got to be flexible there the other thing
is it it really just depends on what you
want to do you know maybe go to events
we get to know somebody but I mean some
of these companies are so large that you
know hey I know a guy I didn't tell well
there's you know how tens of thousands
to choose from that sound actually gonna
be an end but it's not like anything
else how do you get into HR in an
industry it's you start applying in the
industry yeah hardware Hardware requires
a lot more startup capital though to
mobilize something because you basically
have to design something tool it up put
it through iterations I mean you guys
probably do the same thing but you
probably do a lot of it in-house now but
uh it's a lot more money than the
service take a lot people to understand
to its current hardware is based
entirely off licensing somebody else's
product for instance all you know EVGA
MSI gigabyte ZOTAC every single GPU
manufacturer out there is based their
entire business off Nvidia is their or
AMD if they do both and I'm gonna sign
up for GBP it or whatever but you know
it's so it's one of those things where
it's like okay now you have you're
having to pay a royalty and or you know
cost of units you have to buy from the
video to even run your business the
yield on that or the markup on that is
extremely narrow so the only you can
make any money is to sell like thousands
and thousands of them to make any way
make differentiated models like you know
your your upgraded cards your new
coolers your stuff like that so much
higher margin items most of these
companies that do GPUs and set they they
make most of their money around the
mid-range to low it there's I think the
number I had heard back when like the
ten 80s first came out before the 1080i
ever the 1080 was that they were making
to 15 to 20 dollars per card that was
what they were making of course they're
like we got a pair of employees our
insurances are overhead or cost of
operation and stuff but the thing is
they make somewhere like the same 20 to
25 bucks on that hundred and watt the
time hundred and sixty dollar card
versus making twenty bucks on the 500
dollar card and there's more people
buying $160 cards so it seemed with
motherboards you're entirely dependent
on the business of Intel or AMD or
whoever CPU you know you're basing it on
and you've got to pay again those
companies the the rights to even create
product for those other brands so and
the chipsets and the standards around it
and maybe where you support anything
it's all standards and the irony is they
Intel and stuff can't exist without the
motherboard manufacturers right I mean
they had their Intel branded motherboard
but unless you're doing like massive
enterprise solutions there's an upside
to that like when you are you know and
Adam board partners what you call like
an EVGA anyone not Nvidia or AMD yeah
yeah the benefits you have is like in
theory you know you got Nvidia doing all
the work all the research creating the
GPUs for you but you know the same point
time you've still got to find a way if
you want to eke out more performance to
create your own version of that that
you've got to work with so it's like
they're shouldering a lot of the cost
but then again that yeah they also
shoulder a lot of the profit and you're
kind of left with what you can make and
then I can only imagine how difficult it
be to be in you know the motherboard
field or the graphics card field work
yeah the pace is so fast and it's like
oh the you know for example the 2080
is gonna be out whenever if that's
actually gonna come out that's what it's
gonna be call it's like they're working
on that and then the next thing and it's
like they gotta get that out and then
just boom right on to the next version
and heaven forbid you don't have a
recall cuz like unless you are a huge
business like Samsung or something like
that there's no way you're gonna absorb
it it'll just kill you instantly
well I'm like motherboards right like so
say you're a CEO you're working on the
Intel version and the AMD version at the
same time and you're gonna work on your
different okay we want to have our you
know our rampage six all the way down to
our baseline so we can have a product
portfolio that can address multiple
customers like you said when you're
looking at like the 1080 Ti versus the
1050 you know to iterate on that many
products support for that many products
you know the logistics of just shipping
and creating that many products
it's mind-boggling yeah yeah somebody
somebody actually made a good point over
here was a Christian he said no there's
currently high margins on all GPS right
now well the thing you got to realize
those those margin increases are going
to to retailers not to the manufacturers
so manufacturers did increase cost a
little bit but like 5% we righted the
math when we were when we were we've
been doing more pre-built systems lately
because it they make more sense to buy
the course if you're looking for a whole
new system from the ground up it makes
more sense to buy a prebuilt because you
can get it cheaper than building it by
yourself now because the cost of GPUs
and memory and all that stuff alone and
fortunately these these these builders
like NZXT and and exotic PC and
CyberPower and I buy power and all of
them they get they get to basically keep
the same fairly close to the same price
they always got them for because they
get special deals from the manufacturers
they're also not buying one at a time
but sure well we were try pressing out
to see if we could do it I was like what
the heck that they said that the GPUs
were like NZXT specifically that there
was a 1080i in that build and I think I
said the 1080i was like seven hundred
and twenty nine dollars something or
seven hundred and eighty 89 something
like that I came the number and I was
like what the hell they said these were
suppose to be MSRP and then I go and I
look at EVGA and there was indeed a
price increase at the level of EVGA as
well but it was very small I was like
five percent versus some of these other
manufacturers that are upwards of a
hundred percent price increase well in
basic business is a balancing act you
don't want to have a surplus and you
don't want to have a shortage you know
ideally you're selling 10 video cards a
day you want to have 10 sitting in your
warehouse so you're always just stream
light because I mean that stuff's like
lettuce it sits on the shelf too long it
spoils it loses about I can guarantee
you right now the Fry's Electronics
Newegg best best buy I have she's been
keeping things pretty close to MSRP but
that's why their shelves are empty Micro
Center these inflated nasty costs your
prices you're seeing is straight-up
retail the retail supply and demand and
yeah and that's one of those things
that's like maybe is a dick move yeah
and they're and they're pocketing the
money and of course you know an Nvidia
and AMD and EVGA and gigabyte and all of
them are taking the rap for it but you
know well the thing is like one of this
more video cards asleep okay but there's
a certain amount of ramped up time
there's cost issues but that's like
saying like if you're dead why isn't the
u.s. just print more money memory that's
how it's gonna say we are we have been
in a world wide memory shortage for two
years two years we are we're and and
that's why it ramped prices are high
that's why the the that's why they can't
even ramp up to make more graphics cards
if they wanted because they can't they
don't even that there is a shortage of
memory chips to put on the damn PC so
you build a house but we have no windows
so right a memory has an incredibly high
failure like more so than CPU dies we
have no roof yeah it's like I'd be
willing to bet there like one out of
five chips and manufacturing actually
makes it meets the specifications it
doesn't get crunched up or cycled and
push through the system again no would
you say that like you know the current
GPU price is it is part of like a
perfect storm as far as like you know
the RAM shortage is plus the spike with
mining but now it's not just a single
factor but I think it's multiple factors
but I think if mining is primary that's
coming from somebody who mines himself I
mean it's it's pretty clear that the GPU
the GPU but yeah I'm the devil devil
they're they're in lockstep
whenever you see a theory of our Bitcoin
start the spike you see the cost of GPUs
go up when it when this price starts to
come down you start to see a drop it's a
slower drop but you definitely see it in
lockstep with the market that pretty
much tells you that people are buying
the GPUs at profitability because the
way is a minor what you do is you look
at and say okay if I had to pay $1200
for a 1080 unlike a game or you're like
fuck that why is the card cost twice as
much I'm not buying that the miners
looking at it and saying can i recoup
the total cost of that card at current
market value and difficulty within six
months and if the answer is yes they
don't care if they're paying five
hundred million dollars for that
graphics card and they're planning the
card pays for itself and becomes free
and just starts printing money the
reality after that part is a money
making tool it is and that cost money
but here I want to comment on this
Blackhawk 1703 I think he was just being
facetious he said black hawk Michael
hunt is 1703 says make more memory duh
I'm pretty sure he's being sarcastic
that opens up a whole nother discussion
because there's a lot of speculation
that these memory manufacturers like
hynek's and and Samsung and all of them
making these chips they are
intentionally not ramping up we don't
know whether or not they can or if they
are the ones just straight-up profiting
by keeping the supply and demand where
it's at
so it's like do you incur more costs to
ramp up production open up more
factories whatever more raw materials or
do you just raise the cost of the
current production and that's just
straight profit yeah so there's a lot of
speculation of whether or not the the
actual ground like ground zero for all
of this is Samsung and Hynix well you
know it's like work hard for money or
not work hard for real quick are six-gun
LTG it's released now if you're in the
US you like Adam as of yesterday you
know I think it means one this week yeah
I think the other thing is that is that
you know there's a ripple effect in the
industry right if people are building
less computers you know buying less GPS
a butterfly flapped its wings too hard
into Union native if you can't get the
GPU you're not gonna buy the rest of the
system right so the screws everybody
yeah yeah so I mean like I wouldn't say
like oh god we're hurting as bad as
everybody else but it's like you do see
this but here we go again James Reeves
if this is true says Hennis can't wrap
up due to capacitor shortage so then way
the capacitor shortage can't wrap up
because there's not enough sand or
something they can't ramp up because the
machines they need to make this shit is
not enough RAM to go around to build the
machines to make the shit it's like
perpetuating cycle is shortened yeah
there's no there's always a problem
somewhere in the supply right I mean
there's always gonna be but but they
also had that what was it a couple years
ago like a year or two ago the the main
chip manufacturer like burned down like
their entire complex like burned to the
ground I'm sure they built it by now I
know but that but that was NAND I
thought that was NAND that caused that
problem oh is that just the knee okay
GPU but I thought that was an ant
factory I could be wrong though
can I come work for you Josh you like
working for free god you really want to
do that I have a co work here unpaid
internship yeah and I unpaid internships
are all the rage at Microsoft jump on
the most places don't even want to do
those because of the liability like the
insurer yeah at least someone's hanging
out you know your office like hey don't
worry about paying me and then they trip
and fall where the claims
unpaid internships aren't legal in
California you have to pay really yeah
in California returns have to be a
lawyer so then it's like what so the
intern isn't even like really a thing
you know I mean it's just a paid trainee
like intern technically it's just
trainee now in California well that's
kind of thing I was like I will I would
be down to have people to work with to
bounce ideas off of because I mean you
know for all intents and purposes
pretty much John and I are all of North
American marketing for fractal design so
it's like you realize like how much
we're working so Abe Lincoln in the chat
for scores seven years ago
uh he had like I was dead he asks are
they investigating Ram price-fixing
who's they
first of all this stuff is all in Asia
right so what is the United States you
know well that's the wild wild west you
guys okay in China that's the wild wild
west they don't even follow copyright
laws or anything and they steal all the
product designs of shit and it's totally
fine with their government so yeah
that's that's wild wild west over there
nobody's nobody's making anybody do
anything over there yeah so I mean the
shortages can all be pinpointed to
various things but it's the increase in
smart technology that's in everything
now cars obviously the mining smart
phones shit your TVs your DVD players
everything is is smart now it has micro
processors and memory and stuff in it
and and this is this is what one of
manufacturers was telling me and it's
just the tech things using tech now
mm-hmm and and smart tech like they're
intelligent tech a smart refrigerator
smarter or smarter yeah but that's I
mean that's true right Samsung has it
has a TV or LG as a TV fridge Samsung
has a TV for any of these new markets
that are gobbling up supply that you
never foresaw exactly and that's the
word smart on it it's consuming stuff
yeah and that's the thing is is now it's
just we have to see with how the
manufacturing side of it and then you go
to the argument of and I'm gonna take an
aside on this but it's like obviously
everybody's gonna be outraged that they
don't get whatever they need for their
sector but it's like okay what's more
important or a refrigerator somebody
playing video games well they're both
important to a certain degree but it's
like the refrigerator doesn't have to be
smart to work true you also don't need a
1080 Ti to play
videogame right and I've got tell them I
said I don't need that level right like
you might be in a dick if I complain
nethack dude but you know I feel like
the vast majority of you of you viewer
viewers consuming these videos and stuff
they don't really broaden their the
their journal eyes you know they don't
really look at this through a lens of
the big picture they're very granular to
like well I want my GPU so I can play my
fortnight you know they don't think
about the big picture happening in the
world so of course they're angry because
they're very like one degree narrow but
that's a very natural thing right
everyone's like you're gonna internalize
what's happening to you you know and
it's like and it's not to say that one
is more important than the other but
it's like when you look at the mining
thing it's like okay you're using yours
to play video games I'm actually gonna
make money and help support my family
with mine mine's more important because
now I could get even if you want to take
those arguments to the extreme so it's
like there's and there's no right answer
to that it's a it's an opinion you know
what's more important let me give you an
example the tech that's that's cool but
it's causing this problem as a whole my
wife the other day was telling me about
this fridge that will actually tell you
everything that's in the fridge don't
you have a smart microwave you don't
even have a mic well I have a microwave
but we have a smart oven mm I don't yeah
okay so anyway the fridge will actually
tell you what's in there when it's going
to expire and can like auto order it
through like Amazon yeah and can like
auto order and stuff I mean that's the
kind of stuff that's neat tech but the
industry was not able is not able to
meet the demands of this type of stuff
well then you look at the envy
nothing's altruistic but it's like hey
that's gonna reduce food shortages or
food spoilage or whatever right yeah but
I mean it's you don't want yeah well
it's just like you go back to the border
like eligibility thank you I don't think
the audience understands like how the
level of like strings that had to be
pulled just to get these three GPUs from
Asus I mean that for the Jeep for the
GPU giveaway that we're doing it guys
don't know go back and look a few videos
back in my channel I'm giving away three
graphics cards a 1080 1072 1060 but the
thing is my initial email about like hey
guys want to do it when to a
collaborative giveaway just to give
someone
chance to have a GPU shit I used to get
people asking me every day for free GPUs
yeah now I'm getting asked just if they
can bother like can I just buy one for
MSRP please so the very you know what
the very first email response I got was
and it was actually Brian that reached
out right Brian who does all the brand
brand management
Brian reached out and the initial
response was we're fairly certain Jay
has more GPUs than us right now one to
1712 yeah but you know I stopped asking
for GPUs for builds and stuff too though
like we just use it I kept literally
sell the GPUs out of my mining rig and
pay for the mining rig that's like how
much they're worth now yeah except that
was sponsored to you won't do that no I
can't do that but that's the thing
that's where you know you can also have
to go back and rethink what you're gonna
do right I mean yeah when prices go
higher it's like you get much more
critical when you're gonna do it's like
hey do I really need to video card easy
a get away link question mark if you
want it you'll go find it yourself
Josh yeah I can do all the legwork for
you too so Josh one of the interesting
things though is even if I you know I
just have I could sell the graphics card
and pay for the machine well the other
point with mining on a machine when
you're not using it for other things
just basically that machine is already
paid for all eight of the GPUs and half
the price of the additional components
just mining yeah yeah so it's so it's
like a lot of people you know when they
talk about oh my god you're mining you
know if you mind on your computer at all
yeah it's a part of the problem it's
like Nobu you don't realize is every
moment that I'm not gaming on the
computer it's basically working itself
into giving me that graphics card for
free or the entire computer overtime
provided things go according to Crofts
and a lot of people don't look at it a
little off-center exactly exactly yeah
yeah and I think that's kind of the
thing like you know the money has the
stigma right now and I'm not gonna say
I'm in support of it or I'm not or
whatever I say don't give crap you like
I understand fucka you're less yeah but
I mean for most people honestly if you
had an opportunity like hey you can
probably get some money by doing
absolutely nothing you know like it
won't impact you when you're you know
you don't sit there and you know type on
your keyboard you want to crunch you
want to stop gaming but hey while you're
off at work would you like to earn an
extra 10 30 40 bucks whatever it turns
out my complaint about the mining never
ever included the people who have their
rigs and stuff at home turning them on
and making money on that gray area right
right now it's a polarizing your gamer
or you're a minor like what if you're
right and and it's probably devil's
advocate for me to say that's fine but
not the guys buying fifteen hundred GPUs
what I have said very publicly and I
have to keep clarifying it because
people want to want to apply their own
opinions on an opinion right is that the
guys that are out there buying direct
from manufacturers hundreds at a time
are indeed causing the problem at the
retail level
yeah and that's and and that's my
opinion on that that's never gonna
change
I mean I'm sorry you you grabbed up
inventory before it ever makes it to the
consider retail consumer or to the
retail shelf you have indeed created the
supply and demand problem and you're
like nope nos and like mining isn't
itself isn't the devil it's people
buying ours of cars at time and that
goes for anything you know it's like
anybody who you know monopolizes a
certain resource you're gonna have that
issue yes I understand it sounds like
I'm talking out of both sides of my
mouth when I say you know Joe Blow with
his five GPUs can make some money but
this guy shouldn't buy fifty nine what's
the threshold for being it I understand
exactly how hypocritical that sounds but
my my statement about like the tweet I
put up the other night the other like
last weekend about this you know look
look at all these boxes this is the
problem you know that's that's the
problem with the supply and demand is
exactly what I'm stating and the thing
is at the end of the day it all still
comes down to opinions right like who
thinks what's wrong because they're not
you know right neither side is doing
anything intrinsically wrong they're
doing what's in their best interest or
in their prime interest and and they're
doing it exactly you know we know that
they go direct to the manufacturers to
buy this stuff
we know they have backdoor deals going
on with gigabyte and MSI and all them
because MSI and Giga Byte don't have to
share that they don't have that
middleman it down with the retail and
take less money so they if they could
sell it direct and you get to keep all
of that markup then they win so it's
their job to move inventory that's like
literally their only job and purpose on
earth is to make the numbers go up and
make the shareholders happy yeah they
don't care how they just really have
like a highly competitive market that's
generally very low bar
yeah well I think they start wrapping
this up we've got an hour and a half I
got to get home to the kids and stuff so
um guys like I said I do have that
giveaway that's cool that's going well
it's live it's going until April 1st I
know it's terrible day to announce a
winner but I swear to god it's not April
Fool's prank
I know terribly I thought about that
later but so go watch our last video if
you want to see Josh's build stay tuned
tomorrow we'll be putting up a video a
follow-up to that where mistakes were
made and something might happen
clickbait and then tomorrow I am
actually filming finally Little J
building her computer upgrade so that
her last build she built when she was 5
she's turning nine it's lasted almost
four years and it is severely dated
given the games that she's trying to
play now so she's finally I I gave her
an ultimatum I said I'm not building
your computer and I've been teasing
y'all she told her to move out yeah I
was like still got like two Titan X Peas
128 gig ram just to troll people no no
of course I was debating today I
actually said publicly I was gonna put a
Titan X in her machine but I'm not doing
it I'm not oh yeah it will clash with
the color theme it is very color themed
but I'll probably end up putting the
1080 like Galax card in there because
it's white and it's a white and pink
build but so parenting 101 I told her
that I will not build her a new computer
until she brings me home a straight-a
report card because she was she was
always awesome not screwing around in
class but she was not applying herself
like I knew she could and yellow
Chaillot attitude and smart mouth and
stuff I was like hey as long as you're
acting like this regularly a little brat
to your parents and your sister and
you're not and you're not bringing me
home straight a report card there's no
reason for me to build you a new
computer so she earned it she brought
home straight a report card two
trimesters in a row and well done kiddo
yeah hey J speaking of speaking of kiddo
that's the parenting we need now
internet it is it is and that's and
luckily I got it literally doesn't ever
talk back to me
speaking of which you might have dander
comes comes up and says goodbye to
everybody cuz this is Bert it's his
birthday today yeah and he loves the
Internet so you're okay no it's today
today I must have read and I must have
read an old tweet then yeah we're not
having his party until next week cuz all
of his friends couldn't get together
today and everything and plus I'm sick
but uh but yeah we let him open some
presents stuff he's he's
super duper happy let me let me see
being run up here really quick hold on
yeah also I see that Cape I stopped in
so keep going fashion hello the body
paint yeah there's a crazy stuff ooh
have her paint us can you imagine how
horrible they'd be for everybody you
know what you would suck right at stare
at a picture no it's paint she would
mean well just for me we're all here
nobody should have to stare at a picture
of us get the big picture now hold on
don't say nothing yet cuz they're
talking put on the headset um here I
will sit right here yeah Kenya also make
me has silly voices he wants silly
voices no let's use your voice here just
say it just say hi to everybody and tell
me how old you okay
hi everybody my name is Xander and today
is my birthday and I have in today's
March 29 I don't look it and you having
a good birthday
yep I'm having a good birthday and I had
dirt cups at school today those are
delicious all right tell everybody that
you're really happy at your birthday and
you gotta go cuz we're gonna play some
fourth day I'm really happy but I gotta
go and tell Jerry to give you a silly
voice what do you say yeah I'm dad Gary
silly voices you want silly voices okay
hold on okay there you go
okay everybody bye-bye because we're
gonna wrap up the street with you a
little bit okay
that's his favorite game that's what
we're gonna play it on his birthday all
right squeeze around squeeze around oh
thank you
did you just say you save some dick cups
you're undercover cops hikers dirt I
heard dirt you the best hide I heard
dick cup so I was like I would either be
honest thanks for watching so let's week
or week after week loser
at least he took a stance like no stance
as a stance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
