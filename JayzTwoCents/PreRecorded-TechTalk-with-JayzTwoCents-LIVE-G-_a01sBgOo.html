do a live stream you guys think I'm
giving away something is out this is i'm
watching the comments here and I'm
thinking to myself I guess that's
probably true every time I do a live
stream i guess i am somewhat giving away
something or in today but not this time
guys already give away something and i
believe that the guy who won the item
from our giveaway is in here maybe if so
i would say hi gamers 818 i believe what
do you mean he's on time i'm always on
time see i'm on my time and when i start
I'm on time because it's my time if it
was your time then I'd be late always
but I appreciate you guys that are
watching however many there right here
probably only a couple so much to talk
about but not sure where to start ok
still getting over that damn cold which
is gonna be like the beginning I think
of the walking dead in real life it all
starts as a cold yeah but you know i
wanna i want to i want to answer your
guys's questions but at the same time
there's some things I want to talk about
like the fact that I'm just not I don't
care about games anymore and it
disappoints me because I've got this
I've got this this awesome gaming
computer but yet there's not hasn't been
a game that has excited me and I hear
people talking about no BioShock
Infinite and far cry 3 and all that
stuff but I just there I don't know what
it is it just hasn't been anything
that's really made me excited lately and
I I'm the steam sale there was a steam
sale for dirt 3 to the day about that
because it was eight bucks and even when
it was all the way down to 25 bucks I
just wasn't that interested in it so i
don't know i bought it cuz some friends
did have you been playing the xbox much
lately I just been totally slacking on
the old gamer side of things but
ah it is what it is let's uh go ahead
and tweet out the stream shall we and if
you guys are also on the Twitter and the
facebook ER and the any of those other
stalker sites do me a favor let's go
ahead and tweet out the stream let's
many people we get in here the other day
I had like 70 people in here and I
wasn't even doing a giveaway which was
pretty awesome right now it shows
there's 22 of you in here I don't know
if that's accurate or not or the 17 I
guess in here it's for last-minute you
know hey I'm gonna do a stream you know
I guess it's not too bad but whatever so
let's go ahead and pop on over to the
Booker face I boogie says that if I
shouldn't say that he says the bookface
you guys might hear some kids in the
background squealing and screaming my
daughter's got a little friend over and
they're playing and having a good old
time and I might keep it down I'm
streaming here but they don't listen
that nobody listens to me are you
kidding me hey guys I'm life come say hi
right now BAM let's copy that I probably
should have this already ready to go but
I was like showering up until like just
a minute before the stream so it's
amazing that I even started on time and
remember guys down in the description
there you have got all the ways to
contact me the Facebook and the Twitter
and that's pretty much it because I
don't really do the Google+ name google+
I just haven't quite gotten too few for
it i guess i did a tweet earlier in the
week talking about the fact that a
company i got to know and talk with a
bit out in CES called tilt sent me a box
with some stuff on it with some stuff in
it some stuff on the box yeah it's
perfect
and the interesting thing about tilt is
one thing I didn't know is I knew that
they were a newer company but I didn't
know that a lot of what they have right
now is all based on Kickstarter so I'm
really impressed because in January when
I met them they were only three months
old at the time and they were acquired
by a bigger company but they let that
they've kept their own kind of a
separate entity as tilt products I don't
remember the name of the company that
bought them in fact they've been
emailing me so I should know that but I
don't they one of the things i sent me
here and and i'm excited about this from
a little disappointed I don't to get too
much detail because at the end of the
stream I'm going to probably do the
review on this product one of the things
i sent me is this right here and i know
you guys can't see what phone it's for
really i guess you sort of can tell it's
the energy it's an energy battery case
it's a this one here specifically for
the galaxy s3 they're going to be
sending me one later for the iphone 5
they had some they have some delays with
the iphone 5 lightning connector simply
because of the fact that i guess Apple
was being pricks and really delayed you
know how far or how when they were able
to start making it because the whole
patent deal or whatever but I'm going to
be doing a review on this battery case
right now if they only have it for the
galaxy s3 and the iphone 5 but like i
said a lot of this company was based on
stick kickstarter money once they start
getting once i start getting regular
revenue flow coming in they'll be doing
more products they sent me a couple of
other products that are sitting right
over there you can't really see then
purposely hid them because i want there
to be some surprises for the channel I
just a comment just caught my eyes about
the latter price tech maybe i'll talk
about them maybe i won't i don't know
but anyway yeah so there's some there
are some reviews coming and we're really
really close to another review that i
cannot wait to do for you guys and I'm
getting really close to 10,000
subscribers and I wanted to do something
special for 10,000
unfortunately it looks like it's gonna
happen sooner then I'm going to really
be able to then I'm going to really be
able to do something for it because it's
it was immediately projected I was
immediately projected why are people
saying that the stream is broken she
wasn't broken anyway I was projected to
hit 10,000 subscribers back towards
july-august dish and now it's as soon as
like April 26th baseline projections and
how fast I've been growing so I may not
be prepared to do anything super
exciting for the day I hit 10,000 but
some time there abouts will be doing
something special for you guys because
after all if it wasn't for you guys
coming over here and watching me all the
time then god this channel would be
pretty boring and desolate more so than
it already is but anyway i'm gonna start
i'm gonna go ahead and go right here to
the youtube comments first because i
tend to kind of neglect the youtube
comments a little bit make sure you any
questions that you guys have put it up
on the facebook or the twitter twitter
is easier than facebook because facebook
is like weird the way that the fan pages
thing works likes to hide your comments
and i don't see them so don't blame me
too much if I don't immediately respond
to you guys okay so we go we're going to
start with some of the YouTube comments
here a little it a super blank dude tube
says he became completely jaded even
though he just built a computer hate
super blank tube it's not really a
surprise stream i put it up on the
channel earlier today and i tweeted out
what time i was going to be doing it and
so if you guys a check on my page you'll
see when it tells you that I'm planning
a live stream so it won't be entirely to
a surprise for you guys okay Jay would
you would Jay you should get another
guest for next live stream I plan on
doing guests it was kind of a
last-minute thing for me to do the idea
of having guests on here and so some of
the people i want to get on here are
going to take more time to coordinate so
but i do plan on doing that and what
would be really awesome is if i was a
able to somehow coordinate a weekly
podcast of a collective of people kind
of like ptfo or PKA not obviously not to
that size but to get a group of regular
people in here and then one guest each
week to talk about technology and gaming
and just to shoot the and have a
good time doesn't necessarily have to be
purely technology because I'll even
though I'm a tech guru myself I get
really bored with technology sometimes I
just like to veg out on something stupid
like I spent a lot of time today like my
lunch break and stuff at youtube
watching retarded things like I watched
like an hour of Mike Tyson's greatest
knockouts but that isn't just random I
don't know what is holy crap ok it's
looked through some other comments super
blank tube the battlefield 4 gameplay
was intense too bad the store he's only
gonna be four hours long yeah I watched
the 17 minutes of it and granted they
look like they've made some improvements
to the graphics and some of the controls
and they changed the HUD a little bit it
still just screams battlefield 3 to me
battlefield 3 was definitely a visual
improvement over battlefield two bad
company or bad company 2 but i don't
know i'm not super excited about it I
think I still just have a bad taste in
my mouth over the fact that they
announced battlefield 4 beta so much
sooner than I think they should have
especially since when they when they
announced it at the prior to the Medal
of Honor the medal of honor warfighter
it just really made us feel like we were
forgotten about already in three
expansions that even come out yet and if
you guys are noticing any syncing issues
between the audio and the and the voice
I don't know what's going on I've been
trying to troubleshoot that I did a
google plus with booking last week and
it was perfect i stream to twitch no
problems whatsoever but whenever i go on
youtube it just has something something
is wrong I don't know what it is it's
like the audio is off slightly and I'm
not listening to it I just know the last
couple of weeks it's been that way so
hopefully it's not hopefully it's not
you know too bad um sistex sipo ex parse
it looks par quick question you're
running an msi gtx
a 650 TI and your maxing out and
everything you also have an i5 3570k I
think you mean 3570k it's an entry-level
graphics card and none of my friends
believing that you're maxing out 650 Ti
yeah you can max out games on that it
depends on the resolution 1080p isn't an
incredible resolution anymore 1600 p and
4000 of 4000 p hearing things 4000 p
monitors are going to be definitely
around the corner josephs legacy says
how'd you get 10 grand so fast till
about 10,000 subscribers i'm not there
yet my friend i might like 7250 or
something like that I'm not sure Jasmine
mezack says queer if you're talking
about me my wife would disagree and so
with my daughter but hey thanks for your
comment um doing guests you're in yeah i
wanna i definitely want to coordinate
the guests and i want to have their via
a good synergy and collaboration so i'm
not going to just invite anybody so i
don't want to sound like a prick but i'm
not going to just invite anybody to the
stream um you guys are talking about pcs
j where did you get your microphone boom
desk standing how much was it this here
and i wanted to do a I just hit my
monitor I wanted to do a review on this
mike standards haven't gotten around to
it yet this is the ILP l2t as you can
see right there it is a desk mount it's
a clamp you can also buy a flange for
that you could bolt to the desk a wall
mount and riser so you can make it
higher if you want it was kind of pricey
though was 120 dollars and you can get
them cheaper uh not necessarily this
model cheaper but you can get good desk
booms for cheaper on ebay and in other
places i got this one at guitar center
they had to order it for me the reason
why i went with such an expensive one is
i'm using a meti with the pop filter and
such on it and i will eventually be
getting the shock mount for it which
this is a very heavy microphone a lot of
the booms are only good to like two two
and a half pounds and that's how much
the mic ways without anything else this
one's rated up to i believe over four
and a half pounds so that's why i went
with something so expensive like this
yeah and so someone just said watch a
video talks about where I got it I've
got I've got almost 100 videos it's hard
for people to start finding stuff and so
I'm not really getting upset or biting
anyone's head off if they ask me a
question they've already answered a
million times because when there's 100
videos up there and you know I've
there's like 10,000 comments or
something like that it's hard for people
to find any of that doesn't bet
information so Anthony punch patre
hey Jay what specs should you get for a
thousand dollars you're playing wow and
you ultra high settings 30 plant 30 plus
frames per second and 25 man Cutler
raids latina hey you can do that with
almost anything honestly world of
warcraft even though they've done lots
of graphics improvements a lot of shadow
and G directx11 upgrades and stuff for
it Warcraft is still more CPU intensive
than is graphics intensive let me tell
you this though even with my gtx 680
overclocked and stuff when I was playing
warcraft and i was going into cities
like you know agra mar or stormwind or
whatever when you have you know
depending if you're on a high pop server
if you've got 500 people in the city and
they're all casting spells and just
doing stupid stuff you're going to get
lag no matter what no matter what you do
it's going to lag so but if you're
talking about raids and things and all
that casting going on you could for a
thousand dollars yeah it's easy I mean
you could go with AMD or intel get any
600 series GPU or any 7000 series GPU
and you'll be just fine the game is not
incredibly intensive what brand you
recommend for gtx 680 stick with any of
the any other brands that carry at least
a three or warranty some have lifetime
warranty lifetime warranty is gone now
used to be EVGA msi gigabyte asus eee
BGA those are kind of like your main go
tues you've also got PNY galaxies really
made a name for itself over the last few
years so you should be fine the GTX
series like Nvidia doesn't really seem
to have too many major off brands kind
of like you find with the AMD cards
where you you've got sapphire and
diamond and and XFX and those brands but
then you get some of the really weird
ones like power color or something like
that and it's like
you've never really heard of them I
always stick to the major brands even if
you have to pay 20 30 bucks more for the
card spoonerism jr. says do you think
that the 8350 is a future-proof cpu with
the newer games using more course if you
want to be serious about computers you
need to reach yourself of the term
future proofing there's no such thing as
future proofing everything you have will
become obsolete at some point so what
you're what you're really implying to is
longevity and even though the AMD's have
twice the physical cores of the i7s and
the i5s when it comes to the FX 8007
switch use a very advanced algorithm of
like hyper threading it does a very good
job of tricking things into believing
there's extra cores AMD has the physical
cores however they share they share the
cash whereas Intel still has full
availability of the cash to each
individual core so you've got AMD with
the same amount of say the same amount
the same architecture of cash for eight
courses that does for four cores and
it's sharing so that's kind of why the
core four core performance on Intel is
better than AMD I I think you'll get
your money's worth out of AMD compared
to Intel for sure because of the fact
AMD is so cheap i mean i got my 8354 200
bucks its overclocked to 4.9 right now
you know it's like I still don't think
that you can be AMD for bang for buck so
people who are on extremely tight builds
I always recommend AMD a stark steak
cake says what do you think pc gaming is
going to go in the next five years it's
funny i was trying to get boogie into
the stream tonight unfortunately he
couldn't tonight and we'll get him in
here in the future I want to talk to I
want to have him and I discuss with you
guys the future of gaming and not just
pc but console as well um I feel that
the future of gaming is not being
destroyed by the game developers
themselves I think it's being it's
starting to be destroyed by companies
like EA that or and what are some of the
other publishers and I'm on I want to
make it clear here that I'm calling out
the publishers especially EA because
what they are doing is just like a
publishing company for a book somebody
else writes the book somebody else comes
up with the idea but they don't have the
means of pushing it out to the public
and getting it mass produced and hosted
and whatnot so that's where companies
like EA come in so they agree to take a
cut of the price of the prophet and they
market it and brand it under their name
it's no different than how movies work
too that's why you'll see a universal
pictures you know a blah blah blah
production s 0 and so film you've got
the producer and then you've got right
the producer rights I take that back
you've got the you've got the writer
right then he gets a producer the
producer is one that takes on the main
like executive role of getting the movie
created who hires the director and hires
the production company and then the
production company gives the product
back to the producer who then gets
backing through publishers like
Universal Pictures Sony whatever so the
same thing is the true with games if you
get companies like EA that we're doing
like what they were doing what I always
on DRM and you know only being able to
download or play games when logged in to
their there's their system then that is
going to destroy games because I used to
travel back and forth to the east coast
a lot for work and I don't I don't do it
so much anymore but I know people who
still travel a lot I used to bring my
laptop on the plane and I would play
games offline but the thing is
publishers don't want to be able do that
anymore because publishers really want
to squash the used game market they want
to stop me from being able to say I'm
done with this game give a disc to get
the discs to the friend and then then
play it they don't want you to do that
so that's the idea behind always on DRM
that is just that is stupid and it's the
same thing that you know movie companies
are trying to start doing with
with dvds and stuff where they want to
have drm content on the disk and have it
brand to your player or an account or
whatever just like Sony was talking
about doing with the PlayStation and you
know use games and drm on the games
these companies are realizing that
there's this huge third-party market and
they want to cut of that money that
thing that I don't agree with on that
including with pc gaming is that if I'm
done with a game and I want to give it
to a friend so what why should the
company care because they still got
their money on that disk so what they've
done in the past is if you notice how if
you buy a game now almost every single
game has some sort of a download code
sorry where if you got the new black ops
2 you if you wanted to get nuketown you
had to install the code Forza 4 if you
want to get the test track and the whole
track pack and a whole like whole extra
pack of cars you had to have the
download code battlefield 4 or
battlefield 3 if you wanted the 1911 45
millimeter handgun it was a download
code all that stuff so what they're
doing now is they're saying okay fine if
you're going to somehow get the game
used you're going to miss out on some of
this this content so and I'm okay with
that that's fine but don't completely
block me from deciding i want to give a
game to my brother-in-law or my friend
or whatever that's killing gaming in my
opinion and it's kind of them I think
honestly what's kept me from buying
games because i'm just so turned off by
the publishing companies i don't want to
support anybody but whatever okay i'll
go back to your comments i'm gonna pop
on over here and twitter real quick
because I've got some Twitter questions
that I've Seward have been ignoring a
little bit here sorry guys sorry uh
Joseph see he was talking about me doing
a podcast I says he says he would be on
edge about me doing a podcast yeah you
know what so many other people do them
but how many people were doing
technology podcast not really so I would
still give it a shot if you don't try it
how do you know if it would or wouldn't
work um mud that mud dad's says you are
my only hope J how much difference
between 560ti to 660 ti you have the 660
but you may have to go but it may have
to go back
a 660 or 660ti believe it or not the 660
Ti is is very close in specs and
performance to the 580 the gtx 580 which
was the previous flagship model not
counting the 590 the 660 Ti is an
amazing card so if you have the 660 ti I
would hang on to it if you could but the
560 TI is definitely nowhere near the
660 quan mein kaam mein says hey Jay did
you think about doing joining the early
adopters of google glass and paying the
1500 for the beta versions nope not
interested in Google glass to be honest
I've never been that much into augmented
reality i understand it it's a cool
concept and i think it's definitely the
future and i think it has a future in
gaming as well i'm just not i don't know
i'm not it hasn't seemed interesting to
me so I haven't really considered doing
that let's check over here on the
bookface and see I don't really see
anything on facebook if you guys are
saying something on facebook i'm not
seeing it so yeah I'm not see anything
on facebook so i don't know if you guys
are not we're gonna go back over here
check out to YouTube's uh where did I
leave off poopsicle Oh poopsicle that's
a cool a poopsicle you still love that
you got the 2500 k for under a hundred
bucks at microcenter yeah the 2500 k
guys if you can get your hands on one
forget the 3570k because it was a Ivy
Bridge was only about a ten percent
improvement over the sandy bridge and
but it runs hotter in many cases so I
still tell people if you can get a 2500
Cade then do it but this year they're
being phased out in fact they've already
stopped making league as the retail
version you can only get the OEM now
it's not going to come with a cooler I'm
sure there's still a lot of places with
stock but it's going to take time for
that to run out he is the apple of game
developers well said I kaaris the fat
heard I'm like brutalizing your guys's
name
okay how well do you think you will run
games at bf 3 or BioShock Infinite with
nvidia GT 640 3 gigabytes the GT 640 is
not a gaming card they may say games and
game performance and blah blah blah all
over the box the GT series is a is a 2d
performance card it's pretending to be
playback videos 2d gaming it's not very
powerful at all for 3d gaming
battlefield 3 would probably battlefield
3 and bioshock infinite would probably
give it a hell of a hard time and you
would be playing at the lowest settings
um let's see here chin chi Chi master
345 do you really know chi you practice
chi Chi master 345 wants to know my
opinion on the 2600 k i7 ten percent
less performance then like the 3750 ki
believe it is the one step down from the
3770k great it's a great processor I
would still even consider moving to a
sandy bridge myself but it doesn't make
sense right now based on the performance
to cost it would take for me to do that
so if you can get a 220 500k 2,600 2,700
k do it seriously do it AMD is making
seem you're older now yeah AMD has a
roadmap third quarter of this year is
when they're expecting to possibly be
bringing out steamroller we're not
entirely sure yet if it's going to be on
the am3+ socket rumor is said that the
pile driver was going to be the last + 3
+ socket I don't know it depends on
where AMD goes in the future on whether
or not I am going to be going with an
intel or sticking AMD because if I have
to buy a new motherboard I'm just going
to go into I'll seriously just there
won't be any point to stay on AMD
anymore at that point for me tactical
banana wants to know can you explain
what's better about the next gen intel
processors and if it's worth waiting to
upgrade just for these those new
processors I'll be honest with you I
have not done a whole lot of I have not
done a whole lot of research about as
well it sounds like it's going to be
really good one of the things that the
next generation process
is toting from intel though is that it's
going to be back on the 2011 socket so
that makes a lot of you x79 board owners
happy because of the fact that you have
enough grade path to go down x79 we're
probably going to be seeing a lot more
mainstream and affordable six core
processors from Intel and you may even
start seeing some eight core from them
based on you know what was being talked
about at CES and stuff so if has well
turns out to be that good and the
pricing is competitive then I think as
well would be worth waiting for if
you're looking at building now but don't
need a computer right now then you might
want to just at least wait and see what
happens because the very least once it's
announced sent it sandy bridge and Ivy
Bridge toughest I'm just going to get
even cheaper let's see here how much fps
can you get from a 7870 gamers that
depends entirely on what you're playing
with what resolution you're playing at
what settings you're playing at what
games you're going to play what
processor there's a lot of things
involved it's really open-ended question
there let's see am I looking forward to
the next gen consoles probably not
mostly because I don't do a lot of
console gaming I just get on there and
screw around some friends in fact I
haven't even bought a new game for my
xbox in like four months five months so
I'm not like super excited about it I
guess when did i buy Mike my xbox about
it november and i had owned one for a
few years prior to that so let's see
somebody commented hear about the GT 640
being in the razor's edge yeah I don't
that writ that itch tablet I got to see
it play with it in person it's not the
smoothest experience I mean yeah it's
moving it's very strong for a tablet has
an i5 or an i7 in it it's not playing in
a native 1080p so that's why they can
get away with a smaller graphics card
like that besides they they have to go
with some that doesn't generate a ton of
heat in a tablet like that because it
does have fans on it and it does have
vents it's just it's not very
I mean the airflow is minimal it's less
air flow than a laptop so they have to
be careful about that um let's see here
vendetta 133 7x says do you know what's
up with some of the newer ddr3 RAM
having cast latency of like 9-10 927 I
always thought the lower was better
there and people have been asking me and
you might even been one of the ones that
we're asking me to do a video about
memory timing tighter timings do not
always mean better performance in fact
if you have your timing set too narrow
and your processor if it's not in tune
with your processor then you can
actually see degrade in performance and
I know what you're referring to your if
you're referring to seeing timings like
there used to be like nine nine nine
eleven or nine 9 915 and this 9 10 9 27
that's common my timing right now in
fact let me look it up let's see what my
timings are at with my overclocked they
are very wide because when you overclock
the timings believe it or not get wider
rather than narrow and when you're
dealing with the XMP profile and whatnot
so let's see my timings right now at ten
twelve eleven thirty yeah so there you
go but my computer right now performs
flawlessly so and that's at nineteen
hundred and thirty-three megahertz right
now I believe that the piledriver some
people have gotten it to run all up to
2100 but again there becomes a point
where there's diminishing returns so I
just tend to this later where it's at
okay checking Twitter here um Ben Linden
wants to know what kind of performance
you can get from an i5 3570k two gtx 680
I 600 what okay you fixed your 660ti
like I said the 660 ti is very
comparable to the five gtx 580 series
great card you'll be able to max out
nearly every game at 1080p
a dark figure wants to know what's the
difference between ddr3 and five why
have you never heard of ddr4 ram I'm not
an expert on memory I do know that ddr
for whatever reason is always an odd
number you're never going to hear of an
even number ddr I know that but I I
don't even want to like comment on the
fact that and graphics card also doesn't
use ddr eases vdd r which is different
so you need to keep that in mind boogie
came in here and said hey that he just
got his new video card shipped off
thanks for helping with msi to cross it
hey you know um let me know how that new
card works and let me know if that sound
on your power supply unit stops have a
feeling of that it's not going to but
yeah so anyway let's see gamers 818 8120
at 1080p yeah you'll be fine you're the
performance on that will be a very very
good graphics card which i could i'm
sorry dark figure I wish I could answer
that question better but I'm not an
expert on ram / on the differences
between ddr3 and ddr2 answer that but I
personally cannot bend london UK wants
to know what my opinions of the 650 TI
boost and that nvidia announced let me
look at here I've been Vidya announced
you know I saw i watch linus tech
Linus's video on it i watched the
announcement I'm not ready to really
form an opinion on it yet I just simply
watch the videos haven't done any
research I have some forms and I have
some resources that I go to to get some
of that information so I don't like to
talk about things like that and give out
any sort of wrong information so I'm
simply not going to comment about the
card because I don't know a whole lot
about it yet Brendan holder says g DD g
DD 5 is going to be in the new consoles
and video card memory yeah welcome to
2003
teen their video game consoles how about
the fact that pcs of running gddr5 since
like 2008 whatever whatever cool Luke
slightly better specs expect s3 or
better screen somebody must ask about
the s4 oh yes super blank tube says damn
they should have put eight cores in
there and tried to improve the battery
other than that what's the use of
getting the s4 well I can tell you what
Samsung plans on doing because of my
little trip to CES in January they do
have an eight-core processor believe it
or not it's called the wait for it wait
for it Aquarius octa yeah such such my
even my wife who's not like all that
techie even looked at me and during that
that keynote was like really octa yeah
because what was the aqua of the aqueous
it was the quad the fork so they came
out with the Aqua are the octa yeah so
what it is is it's got for larger cores
and for smaller cores in and the for
larger cores are full speed they've got
the they're like AP use they've got all
the graphics processors built into them
then the four smaller cores are good for
2d and video watching and whatnot and
what's going to happen is you're going
to have these four cores right on on the
new Samsung processor for this is for
phones by the way if you're just tuning
in I'm talking about samsung's new
technology for their mobile phones that
have not been released yet what's going
to happen with us focusing on my fingers
crazy okay so you're going to have 48
course if you're just streaming around
on the net these are all going to turn
off and you're going to have this one
core doing its thing so you get amazing
battery life now if you're watching a
video or something that you know it
doesn't have crazy playback you know
it's it's you're not watching a high def
video you just watching some sort of a
stream you get this one core doing its
thing but if you start playing games
you're going to get the four big cores
that are going to turn on and the small
core is going to turn off now if you've
got other things going on in the
background like Google Maps or you've
got music playing or whatever you're
going to have your gaming happening over
here and you
have the smaller course turned on and
off based on what's needed on the
background so what they're what they're
doing by doing that is instead of
utilizing you know the potential of the
larger cores to do a smaller mundane
task like reading email or whatnot it's
going to be smart fluctuating cores that
turn on and off as they're needed so
they're expecting an amazing quality and
battery improvement on the newer stuff
coming out for samsung later this year
and they had teamed up with arm to come
up with the algorithms and the
architecture of the smart cores and that
thing and I said it before that may be
what it finally takes to get me to move
back to to move back to Android because
I was playing with my galaxy a bit this
morning and it was doing some things
that were really pissing me off like
Netflix kept freezing and whatnot but
I'm really considering and I know I said
it in my last live stream but I'm really
considering doing that 30 day challenge
of putting away my iphone forwarding all
my calls and texts and things to my
samsung and just using the galaxy so I
guess I'll see what happens gamers 818
the American version of the s3 is a dual
core the european version is a quad core
in fact i think every other country has
a quad core so that's why i went ahead
my s3 vs. iPhone 5 video people were
getting pissed because of the fact that
you know they said that it was biased
that I was using the dual core one and
not the quad core blah blah blah but
first of all the iPhone 5 is a dual core
and why I'm going to test it in the
country I live in and that's the fact
that the only thing we have available to
us is a dual core well then eat me
because that's what it is David's when
he says he's debating on whether or not
to build a pc wait for ps4 to come out
you've heard that pc hardware might be
less expensive afterthe released I can
tell you right now that gaming console
platforms have never influenced the
prices of pc parts so let me just put
that out there right now I've been doing
console gaming computer gaming since the
first nes came out and not one time has
any console ever change the pricing a PC
part
I just wanted to repeat that and make it
very very clear what I can tell you is
right now you are on the verge of an
entirely new generation of pc parts to
come out within the next four months
I'll say we've got Haswell for AMD
you've got piledriver I'm sorry
steamroller Haswell for intel
steamroller for AMD the 700 series from
nvidia is going to be coming out quarter
3 right around this year and then you've
got the AMD 8000 series which is
probably right around the corner now in
fact some of that stuff has already been
leaked so there's a potential for
anything that you buy or build right now
is going to end up being obsoleted
somewhat quickly so you know just saying
okay get your questions in here guys we
got 20 more minutes here it's checking
Twitter rockwell raquel says your sony
vaio is not capable of playing resident
evil 6 and the hubby was suggesting he
would probably get you an acer what
would you suggest as long as it has some
sort of a discrete graphics card in
there you should be fine is aunt it's a
600 series I would say if it's got the
64 deg t-mobile the discrete you should
be fine with the laptop 660 I think
would be the minimum i would recommend
but then you're starting to get up there
in a thousand dollar plus price tag for
a laptop so i don't know what your
budget is you i would also consider
possibly an msi laptop or even a sager
sager the company did the review for in
the very beginning of this whole YouTube
channel great company great product and
it's usually cheaper and amazing
technical technical support if you need
it cool new co luc 123 says you thought
the 8,000 period series got pushed back
it did it did a little bit and and i
want to tell you guys a story
and I'm going to give you a little bit
of background about the what happened
that led up to my Titan rage video and
this is absolutely brilliant on amd's
part here's what happened in 2012 in
January of 2012 AMD launched the first
28 nanometer a GPU for graphics cards
and if you're not aware with that what
28-nanometer means it's just the size of
the die that's used inside the processor
or the graphics processing unit in this
case and the smaller it is the more
efficient it is the more powerful it is
because there's less there's less let's
just put this in layman's term here it's
a shorter road to travel to get the
information from one point to another ok
so AMD beat Nvidia to the punch on the
28 nanometer process and everybody knew
that Nvidia was already working on the
Kepler was codenamed Kepler for their 28
nanometer process so AMD launched
there's in January with the 7970 first
now a in intel nvidia did not come out
with the 600 series or the gtx 680 until
march 22nd of 2012 so there was nearly
four months of AMD being top dog their
cards were smashing the gtx 580 fact the
gtx 590 was only barely beating the
single GPU card of AMD's which was the
7970 now Nvidia came out with a gtx 680
they beat the 7970 and then AMD later on
last year came out with the gigahertz
edition which started beating the 680
and then there was a driver war and
they're constantly going back and forth
on whose top top right then you've got
the custom cards like Asus can over the
Ares which is this like a 7990 sort of
thing with two graphics cards with two
GPUs on one card you got the gtx 690 and
NVIDIA was afraid that because you
wouldn't you wouldn't believe what
happened to Nvidia stock in the three
months that AMD was on top it was
falling big time because their investors
were pissed that Nvidia did not beat
AMD to the punch on the 28 nanometer
process so people really started getting
pissed investors started getting pissed
so Nvidia was afraid that that was going
to happen again so what did AMD do late
last year December ish they leaked
photos themselves they leaked photos of
the so-called 8000 series and they
showed the backside of the PCB and one
of them had two GPUs on the back and so
people started saying oh wow AMD is
going to be launching with the 8000
series a dual GPU card because remember
AMD's always been last on the official
dual GPU cards they've never been affect
a lot of the AMD dual GPU cards were
custom after market and buy asus and so
this time they showed what was it they
labeled as a leak of the 8790 in the 89
90 and so what happens here uh nvidia
freaks out and we believe at least in
the guru tech world especially on some
of the forms i go to that are
specifically graphics card driven
believed that nvidia was in the middle
of working on the gtx six of side the
780 now that's what people believe is
the titan so when AMD leaked those
photos it's believed that the nvidia
pushed the projects pushed it in or
pulled it in to get it released as soon
as possible so they announced the fact
that they are holding a press conference
to release a card well what is AMD do
they put out their own press release
saying that they're pushing back the
8000 series too late 2013 well at that
point nvidia is already talked about the
fact that they're having a press release
for a new card and they've already given
hints to the fact that it's going to be
gk110 which is the the processor label
of the process or the type of processor
it is so at that point in video kind of
goes oh what we're going to do now
because now and AMD effectively told
them to get them to put out there to
amd's trolled Nvidia to show their cards
ahead of time so the titan comes out
Amdi says um
okay so that's what GK gk110 is capable
of well we're going to go ahead and push
back our stuff now AMD knows exactly
what they're up against because Nvidia
showed their top dog and everyone the
rest is history and Vidya said they were
only going to make a thousand of them
because of the fact that AMD trolled
them and the and which raised the price
to a thousand dollars now why am I
boycotting why am I boycotting the Titan
here's why because a lot of people ask
me this and I meant to put out a follow
up video I just haven't done it the
reason why I'm boycotting the Titan when
I bought my gtx 680 way had been
promised by nvidia that gk104 was going
to be the gtx 660 and lower and that the
gk110 was going to be the 680 and that
GK 114 was going to be the 700 series
because when companies announced what
they're going to do they put out a
roadmap they want people to know what's
coming down the line so we buy our gtx
680 s and when they're when they were
given review samples away what's the
first thing guys like linus tech tips or
guru3d or any of those guys do they take
it apart so when they take it apart and
they go and they they look at the the
graphics card what's the first thing
they see on top of the the branded on
top of the GTU GPU GT egg or gk104 and
everyone's going well wait a minute here
the gtx 680 was supposed to be a 110 so
people start digging deeper and they
unlock the BIOS and they start reverse
engineering but they start detecting the
BIOS and going through the code and what
do they find embedded in the BIOS code
gtx 660ti that was shipped out with the
review units of the gtx 680 so what do
you have now you have a card labeled gtx
680 but when you look at the guts and
you look at the software that goes along
with it you see 660 ti and gk104 so what
does this mean because nvidia has three
month window to take a look at what AMD
was doing they said hey check this out
our gtx 660ti is beating the 7970 which
is AMD's flagship so
let's be smart about this let's rebrand
the gtx 660 the gtx 680 and let's just
go ahead and put gk110 on the shelf and
wait because why why spend the money why
lose money on the gk110 when the gk104
is already beating AMD's best card so
they lied to us shipped us the 660 TI's
branded as a gtx 680 so when they unveil
the gk110 is the titan for a thousand
dollars guys like me are pissed because
that's what we were supposed again
anyway that was the story about gtx 680
gtx titan AMD 7970 and what's happening
this year that is the root cause of my
rage for the gtx titan video and right
there snoot XXX says he thought his g
his 680 with gk110 when you bought it
yeah well guess what we all did but we
got hustled by nvidia so AMD flipped the
table got them to show what they were
working on sooner and now AMD is
planning on coming out with their cards
after nvidia since now they already know
what nvidia has i think it's a really
cool story especially from an underdog
like AMD where people weren't people
don't know that story so the fact that
AMD now is an underdog and is able to
troll and i'm calling a troll that's
exactly what they did they completely
trolled nvidia alright so that was a
long story now and go back to some of
your comments here when i rather get
another 684 my system when the 680
doesn't meet your preferences or into my
Selma succeeding get a newer card it
really depends on what the newer card is
doing when I did that four thousand
dollar bill I put 26 80s in because 26
80s is beating the performance of a
single Titan so but I personally have
never run an SLI set up I usually only
game on one monitor at 1080p so I
haven't needed it it really depends on
how much i could get a 684 the same
could be said from when i had my 580 i
could have just bought another 580 and
put it in there I didn't because the 580
was such a power hog plus I had sold my
macbook pro and just decided to take
some of the money and buy the graphics
card and then I sold my 580 which made
my 680 cost me like she's only a hundred
bucks in the end
uh Gary greaser greaser grazer says aim
days the and video graphics cards
break too much Buckland hey I've owned
I've got an 8800 ultra sitting on the
wall right there wish my daughter was
stopped screaming got an 8800 ultra
sitting on the wall right there I've
owned a gtx 580 I've got my 680 I've
never had a single problem with them so
that that comment doesn't really apply
to me but I do know a lot of people have
had problems with in in video cards Jake
gaming MC says OJ's I have an i7 3820
sandy bridge it is at Sauk 3.6 gigahertz
and you're running now overclocked a
four-point-oh you never change the
voltage just frequency and your stress
tests for 30 minutes any ideas OC wise
I'm not sure I follow it sounds like you
have a pretty you have a foreigner mega
her OC going at stock voltage 30 minutes
table sounds good to me let's see here
and you Newton all these numbers I just
want a good graphics card oh yeah well
then get something with a high number
Neil good to go state kick says you need
an ad block that's up to you man but
those ads help pay the bills okay how do
you know of a site or anything that can
tell you your parts has a game says do
you know of a site or anything they can
tell you your parts are compatible with
others linking about video cards not
sure who have work and handle this stuff
in the last six months I don't myself I
don't know of a resource like that i
really don't i just kind of like know
everything like I know already
compatibilities in my head so cool Oh
Luke says any pci three-point Oh card
can fit into a 16 X 2 point 0 slot work
perfectly with the same bandwidth you
bleep yeah you're not going to see pci
express 16x three-point oh really like
fully utilized until like the another
generation of stuff easily sent on
nissan it's pretty epic can you please
say a few tips on price prize dropping
i'm not sure i'm sorry i'm not quite
sure I follow let's say stay
easy clan says Jays be thick-skinned
Jays two cents can Oh fx-8350 or i5 2500
please reply 8350 man the 2500 the 8350
gaming wise is compactly the same
performance wise as a 35 70 but it has
the rendering capability of a 3770 it's
a it's better than the 2500 k let's see
here don't need advice king of honey
badgers says do you have any advice for
those wishing to buy gaming laptops yeah
stay away from alienware that's for sure
I would stay away from i buy power cyber
pc stick with companies like msi a sous
Sager and that's sa ger Sager stay with
main companies like that because a lot
of companies like I bet power will brand
gaming laptops but I've only spent one
person who's ever had a good computer
from I'd buy power usually everything
they get his complete garbage Andrew
Newton says a bit off-topic but if I
played the new slender is it out I might
try it if it's out but that game I've
had a badge bearing it just put it that
way that bad experiences on my channel
you can go find it Jake riot one do you
know of a heatsink around forty to sixty
dollars that do a decent job of cooling
yeah in fact I know of us cooler that's
less than 30 bucks that doesn't awesome
job cooling it's the cooler master hyper
212 and then there's a couple variants
of the 212 amazing cooler for the price
if you want something that's a little
more stylish to look at you can look at
like the Corsair I'm sorry the cooler
master v6 if you're sticking with air
cooling good really good cooler or the
third will take frio as an amazing
cooler I used to when I did air
overclocking I used the free 0 and it
was an amazing cooler it's a push-pull
configuration 120-millimeter fans
awesome cooler I think that's right
around 50 bucks
vendetta says for air cooling do you
know what temps you should look for
while under load non overclocking as
well if you're not overclocking your
temperature should be fine regardless of
what you're running but it depends on
what processor you're using AMD
processors should never see more than 62
degrees Celsius encore and deep intel
processors should never I believe they
can go as high as like 80 or 90 I'm not
sure though on the Intel you're gonna
have to look that one up play Platt
Teague on planning on 64 says you called
it what did you call neither Mick twig
7970 50 or 7970 i'm not sure what are
you talking about ok Jake says use of
free oh let's see Dylan Cooper says
boogie set you hear well I'm glad he did
he throw you did he did he wave a piece
of meat I don't know I book is a good
friend of mine some people for whatever
reason don't seem to believe that he and
I are friends outside of YouTube but
yeah he's a really good guy and I feel
bad for him he's had so much problems
with this new computer he's built and
it's like wow here some people just have
really bad luck of the draw and for me
that was that's been made with my RC car
I had so many problems with the with it
they're all ironed out now but some
people just have really bad luck with
buying new stuff and it seems like his
computer for him has just been like holy
cow and do everything I can to help the
guy but some like he's got us send his
video card back to msi and it's only a
few months old it's like what the hell
man I've been overclocking every video
card I've ever owned since the day I've
ever owned them and I've never had a
problem period okay Funky's gamertag
says what would I guess the minimum
requirements for bf4 probably going to
be a lot like crisis for or Crysis 3
they recommend a gtx 680 if you want
ultra performance i'm going to say
you're probably going to need at least a
gtx 660ti to get reasonable frame rates
at reasonable graphics I don't like when
people I know this might ruffle some
feathers but I don't like when people
say well I only want to play a game at
medium or low settings and it's like God
part of a part of the lure of pc gaming
is the fact that it's so beautiful
and the graphics and everything are so
much more intense than console and I
don't understand why some people want a
game at console settings on PC that's my
personal like take on that so you know
hbu if you don't agree with that that's
fine i don't i'm not going to judge at
all I just don't understand why people
want to do that that really really sucks
um Brandon holder says crap I've an
invidious 650 you'll be fine with the
650 but remember I guys I'm a graphics
whore I'm a graphic snob I've got to
have max graphics on everything
everything I play I've got to be able
two sliders all the way up if I can't
I'm not happy and I know that that's not
a luxury that a lot of people can do or
afford because if you want to have the
slider all the way up you definitely
have to pay for it and you know medium
settings a lot of the times is it you
can't really tell the difference in fact
I remember when battlefield 3 first came
out I remember switching between medium
high and ultra medium-high ultra like
going back and forth on the presets and
the differences were so minimal what
makes a bigger difference on graphics
for computer gaming is the anti-aliasing
because that's what takes the jagged
edges away from from radiuses and curves
in and polygons and so because remember
you've got square pixels and you got to
make something round at the square
pixels are going to be jagged edges and
anti-aliasing is a software function
that takes that curve and makes it nice
and smooth the anti-aliasing is what
puts a hurt on your graphics card so
usually you can run like a game like
battlefield 3 at Ultra settings with no
MSAA and be just fine it's the moment
you turn that turn on the anti-aliasing
that things just kind of fall apart for
the card if it can't handle it alright
checking out Twitter here looks like we
just got some retweets and stuff like
that Metro Hornet wants to know what is
the best video card manufacturer I can
tell you right now that the companies
that I think you can never go wrong with
I don't have a best company like for
instance my last graphics card was an
EVGA and I'm currently running an msi I
think if you stick with the major brands
asus and these are and these are with
the exception of VG
these are all companies that make AMD
and NVIDIA EVGA msi a sous gigabyte and
galaxy if you can stick with any of
those cards I think you'll be fine every
single time there's also PNY I don't
really usually promote a recommend PMI
for the simple fact that our PMP my for
the simple fact that for whatever reason
they seem to think their don't
stink and they want to charge you more
money for base model cards so I never
recommend P&amp;amp;Y just for that fact 163 973
says why is it so hard to find a high
refresh rate in high res monitors what
do you mean a time I like 120 Hertz
monitors and like 1200 PE 1440 and 1601
because there's still a luxury item to
they're so expensive a lot of people
don't stock a lot of them in stock that
four thousand dollar bill died did the
owner but a 30 inch dell ultrasharp 1600
p monitor that thing was backordered
like twice in the time that he ordered
it they kept pushing back the shipping
date and that's from dell themself it's
just they're not as they're just not as
prevalent as 1080p because 1080p is
still amazing resolution I don't know
why people talk bad about 1080p but
whatever i'm going to go ahead and
extend the stream like another 15
minutes or so since the fact that
there's now 84 of you in here and a lot
of your coming in late some of you guys
are probably following boogie listening
to me talk about boring stuff like
computers and games and technologies and
stuff drinking my tea and listen in to
twitch I got the twits coming but the
point of this stream the reason why I
call it Tech Talk it's because I want to
answer your questions about now I hear a
crying kid I want to answer your
questions about technology let's see one
more question using your current laptop
your CPU is reached
I think I have a kid screaming at the
door hey guys might be witnessing a
murder okay one more question using your
current laptop my cpu is reach 80
degrees celsius playing crysis 2 I
haven't noticed any performance loss is
that normal it's an i7 2630 qm mobile
it's possible depending on the brand a
lot of laptop manufacturers have been
known to really be stingy with the
thermal paste gateway does that dell
does that and i hate to say it because
there's no proof but a lot of people
believe that the reason why they do that
is it causes premature death of the
laptop leading you to have to buy a new
laptop so what I've cured I don't know
how many laptops of overheating problems
by simply taking off the heat sinks
putting on better thermal paste and then
you know getting the temperatures to
really start you know the temperatures
would really come down because they just
put on crap thermal paste or they don't
put it on properly or it cracks and gets
old and a snood yes this is iced tea
okay Jake gaming MC says computer stuff
isn't boring us I already have a piece
of a pc and these streams are like crack
to you yeah they like crack to me to do
it stayin here alright gamers 818 so 62
TI or 680 well duh if you can get the
680 get the 680 i mean i think you just
want to decide a comment there i'm just
gonna be honest with you brandon holder
if you taken off i will see a later bro
see ya thanks for coming here let's go
back to some of the older comments i
think i may have missed here ok sinton
nissan says i'm from spain sorry for my
english how long would it take for the
gtx 680 662 cost 150 euros instead of
two thousand i am not in a comic
strategist my friend Oh idea I really
another year at least one of my download
upload speeds I've got 50 megabit down
five megabit up yeah time warner really
sucks with the upload state cake wants
to know that any news about half
three you know I was just talking about
that the other day I haven't seen any
news on half life 3 I love the half-life
series and that's one that i would
definitely buy in a heartbeat talk about
what i thought about the bf4 campaign oh
oh no now kiss sama oh no oh no now
kasama but is that Japanese anyway um
what I think about the bat for
Battlefield 4 campaign it to me honestly
felt like a continuation of battlefield
3 it just simply did not feel like it
was a new game it really didn't I mean
it sounded like they were trying to kind
of bring it back to like the battlefield
two days with China and Russia the PLM
or the PLA whatever was called and I
mean yeah the graphics were a little
nicer the HUD was a little sleeker the
sounds were a little better and the end
that the animations were a little bit
more realistic I wasn't excited about it
I want to see I want to see multiplayer
first before I make a true opinion about
it because most people only play the
campaign once so to tease us what the
campaign is kind of like you know
whatever I thought it looks like a good
game but I still just imagine a de bout
it because of EA in the way that they
dangled battlefield 4 beta in our faces
six months ago so whatever Dylan Cooper
says I don't look old enough to have
kids and a wife Dylan Cooper how old do
you think I am my friend I would like to
know and with a voice like this and the
fact that i'm not in radio is probably
pretty amazing whatever how old do you
think i am i'd like to know let's see
here what is going on out there Sabby
sauce TV says looking for crossfire to
7870 soon what why does power supply
would i recommend uh 750 watt would be
pretty safe and I think you'd have a lot
of headroom I could
I could SLI 26 80s in my system with a
750 watt and be just fine is Li to
overclock 6 80's with an overclocked I 7
3770k and water cooled with a pump and
multiple fans and such with an ax 850
corsair so 750 why you'd be just fine
okay David the droid says you're looking
at an FX 8350 but you have a formula for
I'm assuming that's a crosshair formula
for and you know it's compatible but I
think I'll run into any issues with it
not being an e + 3 + board yes you won't
get the full you won't get full
capability of them of the GPU or the
processor you just simply won't 990fx is
definitely what you want I don't believe
the crosshair for formula is a 990fx I
believe it's in 890 am i right when I
think about the new devil may cry and
metal gear I don't know any I haven't
seen any of the details on the both of
those games my don't gear though I
didn't know they were making a new one
if they are that's something that
definitely want to look into and I'm
still let's see Dylan Cooper says you
look very young not sure how old maybe
mid to late 20s you're guessing your own
there yeah I'm 30 turning 32 my friend
so yeah I am been married seven years
going to be eight years here and I have
been with the same woman for 13 years
and my daughter is turning 4 so yeah
let's see Jake gaming MC hey jay r
chipset coolers and RAM cool is really
worth buying are you talking about for
water cooling or are we talking about
air cooling I think my daughter's main
murdered this is this is nice Jays two
cents is doing tech guru live stream as
children are being skinned alive in the
background come watch everybody can
watch hey I got a question c CS swag see
swag says hey I got a question I was
wondering what graphics card would do
you good on a 720p display maxed out
just about any card could handle 720
just fine have I still got my 8350 rig
absolutely having been playing games so
there's no reason
grade and it still renders all my videos
very fast I don't think even my longest
like 15 20 minute videos uh it usually I
usually render it usually renders in
real time so if it's a 20 minute video
it takes 20 minutes to render if it's a
half hour video even though I've never
done one it takes about a half hour five
minute videos render in like three
minutes so yeah it's very fast computer
that's not a laughable topic hahaha yeah
well you know yeah hey what what happens
in America uh let's see Dave the formula
for supports only the 8150 at most yeah
I didn't think the 8350 would work but I
didn't I'm not sure so can you
spoonerism jr. says can i please be your
son you wouldn't want me as a dad my
friend I am strict I am like boy Shh do
your homework no my daughter doesn't do
homework yet but I did I could pick up
your toys I'm gonna throw that in
the trash yeah you don't want to be my
kid trust me you didn't mention SAS
sapphire what are my thoughts on their
GPUs sapphire has definitely been one of
the go-to brands for AMD sapphire
diamond XFX they're all been pretty
major AMD players I had gotten a
sapphire 7970 for my brother's pc build
but i don't know if there was something
wrong the graphics card or what but that
thing was garbage it was like half the
frames per second of my 680 and I had
played with drivers I had I I did all
the tricks I knew trying to figure out
what the hell was going on including
overclocking and the card was garbage so
we returned it and ended up putting an
asus 680 in his computer and he's never
been happier yeah I will you know and
somebody asked me earlier was my
favorite video card manufacturer the
company that I loved the most back in
the day is no longer around anymore but
it was bfg I love to be FG because it
literally stood for big gun
that's
that's what it stood for it and so I
loved that company but yeah there's
sadly they're out of business super
blank tube this loves procrastinate on
your work watching your streams hey get
to work man what is this now you is it
work is it school work hun but you want
to get a higher edumacation come on be
better than me do your work let's see
denso killa says don't say that you just
ordered a sapphire 7970 gigahertz listen
first of all it wasn't a gigahertz
version because there was no gigahertz
cards yet at the time I built that this
that was before I even started YouTube
like a month or two before i started the
youtube channel so gigahertz version is
perfectly fine i still think there was
just something wrong with that card
because i had done a lot of research and
other people running the 7970 sapphire
had no problems whatsoever so don't get
upset about that at all because i just i
honestly think it was just that card
dilma cooper ooh what would win a fight
between a 20 horse sighs ducks or one
duck sized horse boogie2988 would win
just saying let's say was my favorite
black ops one or two I still have my
black ops one poster up there on the
wall i sold my black ops 2 to my friend
because i hated the game hated the game
i'm so done with call of duty i call it
call of duty for a reason coolio luke
says well 3970 x and a dual 69 or quad
titan for cuda um well first of all the
692 690 is two thousand dollars and for
Titans is four thousand dollars if you
really want to do CUDA you need to get
yourself a quadro card you need to go
with a true rendering card a card
designed for rendering if that's what
you want it for the titan even though
maybe like the flagship best gaming card
blah blah blah it is like entry-level
bottom of the barrel CUDA card when it
comes to truly rendering and using cuda
technology go and look up in videos
quadro quadra
series and then you'll start to see what
you really should be putting that four
thousand dollars into if you really want
to cuda okay let's see here umm Jedi
Mind Tricks Jedi Mind I Rick's says
you've probably been asked this already
but how long until they released
mainstream 1440p monitors at twenty 120
Hertz I don't know I don't know if they
will they I think they may honestly
start skipping straight to 4000 I really
do based on what I saw at CES and then
all the 4000 panels that were around
including small form factors like 20
inches like 20 inch panasonic 4k tablet
the thing was amazing it was so freaking
sharp you put your face right on it and
you can't see a pixel so I think they
may end up jumping to that but what's
the pricing gonna be like who knows
alright guys three more minutes in this
stream and then I'm going to be shutting
it down so get your questions in right
now okay twitter is nice and clear not
seeing anything new on facebook alright
so we'll keep it right here on YouTube
ah recon BFH says do i watch pootie pie
no I don't um I got nothing against
pootie pie I really don't I mean shoot
the guy isn't like number seven most
subscribed to person on YouTube for you
know without a reason but his maturity
level isn't where I like to watch and he
definitely caters towards that 13 to 17
year old demographic I feel Dumber when
I watch booty pie I can't do it sorry
let's see denso killa says your current
GF graphics card is an msi is 6850 it's
been a great card but need more
horsepower for your new 8350 machine the
6850 could probably still handle a lot
of games just fine I wouldn't say you
need to upgrade for your processor I
would say that you need to upgrade for
the games you get to play depending on
what you play cool Luke says nerve you
disappeared all of a sudden nerve said
for gaming and rendering videos j/o for
gaming and rendering videos okay yeah I
guess for titans is ridiculous waste of
ridiculous plate on a plate plate Egon
64 says answer you please ashford me
it'll make my day okay what would be a
good GPU to crossfire 278 70s with an
Andy you mean cpu and AMD 60 in 9650
Black Edition 278 70s will bottleneck in
the 965 just saying you would have to go
with something like an 1100 tea or 1090t
which is six cores and that's still on
the phenom processor or the Phenom
platform so and they're still fairly
cheap if you can find them so I would
stay away from the 965 with a 270 and
70s i'm pretty sure to bottleneck one
more minute guys here windows 8 never
windows 7 64 bit here well he said it
the best and I just ran with it okay I'm
gonna play ARMA to have fun do I really
do i watch raywilliamjohnson no my issue
with ray william johnson is he's famous
because of everyone else's videos all he
does is highlight all the other viral
videos and he makes money on it that
bothers me do i watch Smosh but you guys
just asking me if i watch okay i will
tell you who i watch in the top 10 right
now and based on today's top ten that
would be freddie wong and that's it I
don't watch jenna Marbles oh my god
please don't get me started on that I
don't watch Smosh I don't watch pootie
pie I don't watch worry william johnson
cuz i just i don't understand how they
got to the top yes I do because they
completely catered towards that 13 year
old mentality and I am sorry I'm to
professional what I do in life and what
I do on my channel to watch that I just
want to kill somebody after I watched
those videos do I like half-life yes I
love half-life that was one of the beta
testers back in the late 90s why not
jenna Marbles I just don't like her I
think she's one of those people that i'm
not i'm not showing this but I think
she's one of the people that just got to
where she is because she's a pretty face
and I've watched him or her stuff and
it's like it just felt
like there was no substance to it so I
don't know have I played slender yes i
have in fact up a video be playing
slender and getting the crap scared out
of me by my wife yeah favorite game when
i was a teen probably quake I loved
quake alright last question here by pro
Excalibur one upgraded pc needed by
seven a dollar budget planning to get
z77 i 7 3770k is it worth it z77
motherboard and a 3770k is not going to
leave you enough money to buy the rest
of your computer just saying you might
want to consider dumbing it down to like
a 3570k or even an AMD built seven
hundred dollars is not a lot of money
alright guys I'm gonna get on out of
here I appreciate you guys coming to
