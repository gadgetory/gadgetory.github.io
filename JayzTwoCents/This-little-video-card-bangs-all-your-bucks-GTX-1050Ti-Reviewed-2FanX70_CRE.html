today because I told you and I promised
you that things like skunkworks were
obviously one offs and most people can't
afford systems like that but most people
are looking for the most bang for their
buck especially when they don't have a
lot of bucks to bang I think you know
what I mean so today we are taking a
look at in videos new entry-level GPU
the GTX 1050 Ti there's also a 1050 but
today we're looking at the 1050 Ti this
thing promises to bring gaming to the
masses those don't have a lot of money
to spend but still want good settings at
1080p so obviously we're going to test
that today with its unique freeform
modular system the new master casemaker
5 from cooler master allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description if you're an entry-level
gamer or first-time gamer you don't care
about things like CUDA cores and memory
bus width and all that sort of stuff
that's that's the kind of things that
guys like me tend to nerd out over if
you're an entry-level gamer you care
about really two things how much memory
does it have and even then sometimes
that doesn't matter as much as other
things and how much fps are you going to
get well guys we're going to do we're
going to start off by showing you the
benchmarks first and then we're gonna
talk about this here and where it fits
and all that stuff because it really is
sort of a game changer and I'll tell you
why in just a second
now obviously those benchmarks were at
high or extreme or ultra settings
depending on the games and the reason
why I do that because it's not really
fair to take a card like a 1050 TI or in
this case an RX 460 because it's
similarly priced it's not fair to take
these cards and put them through the
ringer of things like MSA turned on you
know ultra settings motion blur and all
that sort of stuff the reason why I do
that
as I want to show you what the worst
case scenario is going to be on the
lower end cards of course on the high
tier cards like the 10 80s and such it
shows you how strong they are to be able
to just crank out those FPS settings
with all of those or the FPS with all
those settings max but what happens if
you take a card like the GTX 1050 Ti and
you start playing it on more reasonable
settings things like medium well you get
some pretty damn good numbers I mean
we're talking numbers easily into the
60s 70s and even 80s depending on the
game so even games like what's your win
during my benchmark testing took the
1050 Ti down to its knees when you
reduce the settings down to something
like medium you get a very very
enjoyable and smooth gaming experience
at 60fps no problem and then of course
games that don't have an extremely
demanding engine or a huge world to have
to render you can get some amazing FPS
like up into the 80s on games like
battlefront battlefield and whatever so
that's where the 1050 Ti comes in it's
only 139 bucks MSRP and because there's
no founders Edition I don't think the
pricing is going to get all jacked up so
we can expect to see cards launching
around this range now something else
that makes the 1050 and 1050 Ti is so
nice is the fact that the reference
models don't require any supplemental
power from your power supply whatsoever
so that means you don't have to go out
there and spend a ton of money on a
power supply it runs off the motherboard
only and I didn't even overclock this at
all it didn't want to overclock this in
fact there's no voltage control and
there's no additional power limit
available to it that's for safety you
want to blow up your motherboard we
don't want to have an R X 480 situation
here we're going to have problems with
too much power being drawn through the
PCIe slot although it's been corrected
we don't even want to start to go that
out and allowing too much overclocking
in a card that doesn't have supplemental
power but if that's your thing for a few
extra bucks there are brands are going
to be offering custom cards that have
additional power that I also have
unlocked overclocking now the 1050 Ti
features four gigabytes of gddr5 buffer
which is going to be good for triple-a
titles and it's way more than enough for
no indie titles but I like the four
gigabytes because it gives you a little
bit longer lifespan like I say future
proofing it's not future proofed by any
means but it gives you a little bit
longer lifespan as title start to demand
more memory unfortunately the 10:59 Ti
only has a two gigabyte buffer now the
TI version does have more CUDA cores 768
CUDA cores versus 640 CUDA cores of the
standard version and of course the extra
memory on there so that makes the extra
30 bucks at this costs over the 1050
definitely worth it and when you compare
it to the similarly priced rx 460 from
AMD this thing just smashes it it
actually gets it actually is placed
somewhere between the 460 and 470 the
470 is faster but then again the 470 is
like $60 more than this guy so it better
be faster so anyway guys there you go
just a quick video showing you some raw
performance here of the GTX 1050 Ti I do
expect to see some custom cards coming
in here soon things that have additional
power that way we can do some
overclocking and see how far these cards
can really go but the amount of
performance you're getting now at the
$109 and $139 price point is phenomenal
and that's amazing because it allows
more people the opportunity to start
playing better games and get better
settings and just get more excited about
PC gaming because after all PC gaming
it's just so beautiful if you know have
a graphics card that can't show you the
beauty then what's the point
but now you can with guys like this
anyway guys time to get out of here if
you guys if you've got a specific model
you think I should check out let me know
and I'll reach out and see if they'll
send one over otherwise we'll just do
whichever ones I end up getting my hands
on thanks for watching guys and as
always I will see you in the next video
I'm sorry about my voice literally I'm
losing it I'm sick but this came in I
was like I gotta do this video I oh I
keep slamming it down I'm sorry I'm
sorry but I owe it to you guys I really
do I owe it to you to do these videos
even if I'm on my deathbed literally I
can have an IV hooked up to me and have
a heart rate monitor and they'd be like
flatlining I'll be like alright guys
I'll see you in the next one and then I
die that's probably how I'm gonna die
anyway I'm gonna die doing a graphics
card of you yeah
could be worse</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
