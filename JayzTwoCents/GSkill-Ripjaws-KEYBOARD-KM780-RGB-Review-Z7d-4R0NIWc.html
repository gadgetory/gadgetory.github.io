and I'd be lying if I said that this was
the first time a memory company has
decided to make peripherals but today
we're going to be talking about G's
skills brand new Ripjaws gaming keyboard
specifically the km 780 which features
Cherry MX
RGB switches authentic Cherry MX not the
cheap Chinese kale knockoffs like a lot
of other brands have used so today we're
going to go ahead and see whether or not
G scale made the right move by stepping
into a new very oversaturated arena and
then we'll see whether or not this guy
actually deserves a spot on your desk
the new z170 classified motherboard from
EVGA features eight phase-- PWM 4 Way
SLI support along with top notch
components to offer gamers and
enthusiasts more of what they want a
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more now
since I know that everybody is going to
constantly ask which is better this or
the Corsair k70 RGB and I just wanted to
say this is not going to be a comparison
video but I will say that this has
features that the Corsair does not which
in my mind makes this thing feel a
little bit superior specifically the non
RGB version of the K 70 had USB
pass-through which was great I liked
using that I could plug in my USB drives
have quick easy access to USB but when
they did the RGB I don't know if they
did it to make it a price cut but they
remove that from the keyboard entirely
well fortunately the g.skill ripjaws
mechanical keyboard here brings that
back where we have not only USB
pass-through but also an analog
microphone and headphone jack
pass-through as well right here on the
back of the keyboard this guy right here
there you go you also have your BIOS
polling switch on there just like the
k70 does so that your keyboard is
guaranteed to work in your BIOS and
things like that now it has all the
standard features you would expect now
things that I'm just going to gloss over
because every mechanical keyboard on the
market pretty much features this now
which is you know anti-ghosting full and
key rollover that sort of thing but I'm
still very excited over the fact that
this uses authentic German Cherry MX RGB
switches in there now the construction
of this thing is very very beefy the
whole top and wrapped around the front
is protected by a brushed a low
top plate on this thing so obviously
it's weighty it's very very sturdy it's
not gonna bend or I'm trying to bend it
right now look it's very very little
flex in this thing
the Ripjaws keyboard also features a lot
of additional things going on here
you've got your G switches over here
you've got your macro switches multiple
profiles of course your gamer lock your
brightness button full media center
controls and a volume top or slider on
here which is like a rolling switch and
with the actual visual indicator telling
you what your volume level currently is
which is nice because I don't want to
have to you know click out of the game
and congest my volume in the control
panel and I sure as heck don't want to
have to lean forward and turn the knob
on my speakers man I'm way too fat and
lazy for that but anyway you've got
indicator right there of exactly what
your volume level is and of course a
mute switch now the wrist rest on this
thing is rubberized so that if you're a
sweaty gamer or you're in a gaming in a
hot room like I do your hands and your
palms are going to be slipping all over
the place and obviously it's removable I
personally don't like using wrist rests
so I'm going to go ahead and set that
aside but it does also include a
complete set of gamer keys for the qwe
RC asdf in G keys which are very common
keys used amongst FPS games but the
textures on these keys are a little
different they're angled also to make it
a little bit easier so that your fingers
don't slip like if you've ever slipped
off of W and accidentally hit E or Q
which you usually interact buttons you
can sometimes mess up because you bump
the wrong key it's very very annoying
that's good gonna keep you from slipping
your finger off of W which is very very
nice but you've got a key cap puller
located inside here as well and this
thing can snap on to the back of your
keyboard so you don't lose the damn
thing it's really annoying when you
switch out the keys and then maybe later
you want to go back to more of a
comfortable typing setup and you can't
find the keys that you removed from your
keyboard I'm guilty of that I have no
idea where my case 70 extra keys are
I've even looked in the box they're not
in there but something else that's
featured on here that I am very excited
to see is this little guy that flips up
right here from under the keyboard and
this is a little wire
a retaining mechanism here so that you
can snap your mouse wire into that and
now you have slack control on the amount
of cable slack on your mouse and it's
always going to follow your keyboard so
if you move your keyboard around a lot
in your desk like I do you're always
going to have the same amount of slack
on your mouse I think it's really
annoying when the mouse wires kind of
off doing its own thing this stupid
little function right here this little
piece of plastic is making me so excited
about this keyboard it's not even funny
all right let's go ahead and do a quick
demo of the software because obviously
you can control the lighting on this
thing and let's do a typing test and
then that's end with some final thoughts
okay so I finally figured out how to use
the software after messing around this
for a while and I don't feel this is as
e is as easy to use as it could be so I
feel like G skill needs to get their
developers to really rework this app
because it's not as easy to use as they
advertise it to be and that's important
because this is half of the user
experience it's setting up the damn
thing alright so you've got here your
macro section that's all pretty simple
lighting profiles we'll talk about that
in a second but you've got these three
menus over here customized for the
different key presses and macros setting
for like n key rollover polling rate
alert mode repeat delay sleep mode all
that sort of stuff repeat rate
acceleration all self-explanatory stuff
but the lighting the lighting is the
part that most people are going to be
interested in simply because of the fact
that this is the selling point of the
keyboard as far as I'm concerned anyway
when you have RGB Cherry MX switches in
here so if you go to lighting you click
the background tab right here this shows
you the background base colors for the
lighting which obviously is set to you
know rainbow because they're
demonstrating all the different colors
available if you click this whatever
color you have selected here you can
change the color of those key switches
you know as you can see I'm changing all
of these to blue now I could even grab
like a you know section of the keyboard
and be like bin will change over to blue
or BAM will change those to yellow
self-explanatory easy enough right
okay well what if you wanted to do the
effects you've now changed this it saves
it immediately
on the keyboard it's not like are you
sure you want to save this and apply it
doesn't give you a chance to to really
apply it you've got a it does it right
away so if I didn't necessarily want
pink and I did pink now I've lost my
ripple effect right so if I go to effect
lighting over here you've got a drop
down here for wave Ripple reactive and
breathing now if I select breathing you
can see right here there's nothing in
here there's nothing to select and I
can't hit okay or anything cuz there's
nothing there because before you can
apply anything on this window you've got
to go in the lighting profiles and set
them up here and what's really
interesting about this is there are no
profiles for any of these things until
you create them I would think that the
base you know features of breathing
Ripple reactive and wave would already
be in here but they're not so as you can
see I made a ripple with white and green
right here there is no reactive so you
have to hit plus call it reactive and
then you can set what the reactive color
would be so let's set it to you I don't
know yellow and let's make it a duration
of one second so nothing happened
nothing applied it created this saved it
but it didn't tell you it saved it so
you're sitting here going what what the
heck just happened nothing changed on
the keyboard the colors didn't change
I'm typing nothing's happening it's not
reacting well that's because you've got
to go over here to lighting
now select lighting effect ah there's
the reactive that we made so now we get
hit okay now look
now the reactive works so I don't think
that's very intuitive whatsoever at all
I think there should be a save and apply
rather than clicking one thing wrong and
then undoing everything you've worked on
so that's not something I'm very
interested in I don't like the way that
this is working at all
now obviously you can't set any of these
colors because it's in reactive and it's
reacting to the colors that we set over
here on the profiles now to modify that
instead of doing it over here in
lighting tab where it seems like it
would make the most sense you then have
to go back over here to the lighting
profiles and then you can change your
reactive maybe I want a purple reactive
nothing happened right well we've got to
go over here and do background color
effect lighting then go back to reactive
and there
our purple see we had to like reselect
the same profile we already have
selected to make it take effect that's a
terrible terrible programming design so
this software although it works you
really do have to like get kind of
finicky with it
I mean it's neat but the software needs
a lot of work
everyone always complains that they want
a typing test well you know it's all I
got a sound as loud as my lavell ear mic
can pick this thing up but anyway
they're Cherry MX brown switches are
going to sound just like every other
Cherry MX brown and we'll just do a
little typing test now so I typed this
is doing a typing test with these Cherry
MX browns they sound just the same as
any other Cherry MX brown on the market
so this really is a pointless thirty
seconds but hey I aim to please well
there you have it guys the K M 780
Ripjaws keyboard from G school I think
overall the build quality of the
keyboard is fantastic it's got all the
features I like switches that I like
it's got all the macro keys on there
that you could want multimedia Keys
volume keys USB pass-through audio pass
through headphones pass through Michael
all that stuff but I really feel that
the software is what really needs to be
revamped and re looked at with this
keyboard it honestly feels like the
keyboards physical aspects got all the
attention and the software was kind of
an afterthought is sort of just thrown
together I don't feel it's very
intuitive there's no on-screen help yeah
there is a technically a link to the
manual with inside the software but I
think guiding people through the process
is what really makes the user experience
nice I mean I've dealt with most of the
keyboards on the market and it took me a
good 20 minutes to figure out how to use
this software I can figure out why
things weren't saving why weren't the
profiles taking effect
where were the freaking profiles why did
I have to make profiles for the default
lighting profiles that were already
existing like it's
breathing it says ripple it says
reactive why did I have to make a
profile for them when they're already
there anyway I think if they can get the
software up-to-date and make the
software a bit more user friendly then
the keyboard to me is damn near perfect
at the end of the day though I'm still
going to use this keyboard probably
probably primarily on skunk works for
the simple fact of the USB pass-through
and then the fact that it also has
microphone and headphone pass-through
makes it easier for me to do testing too
with analog stuff so on to keep reaching
behind the computer on the test bench I
can start using skunk works easier for
some headphone reviews and stuff like
that but anyway we are going to be
reviewing the complete line of the
Ripjaws peripherals including the mouse
and the headsets they have a 7.1 a true
7.1 gaming headset as well as a simulus
7.1 more of a Dolby headset will be
checking both of those out and doing
complete tests on those but anyway guys
time to get the heck on out of here I
hope you've enjoyed today's video hope
it's helped you in some way it's always
the point of these videos and as always
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
