wasn't planning on really doing this
video but a lot of you guys asked me if
I would talk about this now I'm going to
preface this with saying I have no
insider information that's the only
reason I'm even doing this video if I
did I wouldn't be able to do this video
but we're gonna talk about a few things
we got AMD and Intel now which
definitely seem to be in a cores race
which which brink put out CPUs with the
most cores for high-end desktop so
that's we're gonna talk about today well
should you buy
what should you buy and is all of this
even matter to the mainstream consumer
ok it's the best part right here watch
it watch it guys this new selfie
Assessor you stick some faculty design
yeah so but do you know what it does
yeah makes things cool yeah
cooler hey guys this is Austin and today
I am super excited to be doing a video
with the one it only makes you sense yo
I am excited here so what are we doing
today we're going to review the Celsius
s 36 I get that a lot today what's up
sure I could give you some workout tips
how's tomorrow sound awesome later
you
the new Celsius as 36 can make almost
anything cooler almost I'm so cool so
it's going to start off with the
official news and II obviously has
debuted or talked about their thread
Ripper CPU I don't know I think that's
that's a really bad name first of all I
mean this is my new it doesn't really
matter what the name is but thread
Ripper I mean you guys see guardians of
the galaxy it's like Jayde's or various
like what's the stupidest name we could
come up with but anyway I digress that's
I just was like a thread Ripper come on
alright so they talked about their 16
core 32 thread Boheme it basically it
sounds like they took the architecture
of two 1800 X's and just shove them
together like that just like babies are
made I'm using my notes here but it
looks like we've got two 16 core 32
thread thread rippers the 1998 x that's
a good year that was my senior year in
high school anyway
the agitated myself and of course we got
the 1998 which is a non x2 both 16 core
32 thread 3.5 gigahertz base clock shows
a 3.9 gigahertz boost clock on the X
model with a 3.6 gigahertz
I mean on X model we don't have any
information yet as to l3 cache or how
many PCIe lanes on any of these CPUs 155
watt TDP on that so obviously it's a
it's going to be power-hungry what do
you expect from 16 cores 32 thread but
anyway moving down the line we get this
1977 X in 1977 that's a 14 core 28
thread so basically guys that's pretty
we got 10 core 20 thread 12 or 24 thread
14 and 16 core obviously with double the
threads looks like they all are boosting
to write about 3.7 to 4.1 the highest
boosting when we got here is the 1977
which is a 14 by 28 so the timing of
this is really interesting Intel is
expected to be launching their new X 299
platform in June or Computex or around
there which is pretty traditional
usually can't be Texas where a lot of
this stuff is debuted so it's no
surprise to me that AMD is trying to
kind of head off some of the Intel
marketing and saying look at what we've
done and they've also promised summer
availability on this and the Intel side
of things seems to be a lot less excited
so that I'm citing anatec form here
because they are the ones that are
showing this so that's the information
I'm going off of here we've got I 979
20x skylake X it's a 12 core 24 thread
we don't have any information yet on
base clock or boost clock it's got
sixteen point five Meg's of l3 cache and
it has got 44 PCIe lanes 140 watt TDP so
it looks like AMD if 155 watt TDP on the
16 core 32 thread thread Ripper is
accurate then it looks like that they
have actually pulled out so magic with
their efficiency at least where they can
have four additional physical threads
for only additional 15 watts to TDP
that's actually not bad we've also got
the seventy nine hundred X which is a
ten core twenty thread very similar to
the sixty nine fifty X but obviously on
skylake X now moving down the stack we
got the seventy eight twenty X now
that's an eight core sixteen thread CPU
so very similar to the sixty nine
hundred K and the 59 60 X both of which
I have and have been using but here's
where things start to get interesting
both of the 60 100 K and 59 60 X have 40
PCIe lanes however on this they've
shaved it down to 28 so very similar to
what they did with the 5820k and trying
to as these differentiate the stack in
terms of cost and and where they were
they line up in terms of their hierarchy
the 28 lanes of PCI Express Lanes was
actually a problem for people who are
trying to do multi graphics cards or
3-way SLI which was supported at the
time wouldn't work very well at all on a
CPU that only had 28 lanes in fact a lot
of motherboards had to have two sets of
manuals where it was like if you're
using a 28 Lane CPU use these Lots if
you're using a 40 Lane use they slot so
I find it interesting that the previous
like top tier is now like they're
shaving PCIe lanes and they're doing an
intentional obviously which I think
really sucks because PCIe lanes are
important when you're running multiple
graphics cards and especially now with
PCIe nvme SSDs a lot of people are using
the PCIe bus because it's direct to the
CPU the very high throughput and now
you're going to be limited on that so I
feel that that if that's true and
accurate but that's a bit shady so we
got the 7800 K or the 1700 X below that
which is a 6 core 12 thread surprise are
still offering 6 thread options and then
we got the 77 40 K which is where the
ice
seven lineup stars that's just a slight
bump of improvement to the 7700 K but
it's KB Lake X 4 cores 8 threads 8
megabytes of cache like 16 PCIe lanes
and then the 76 40k 4 cores for thread
very similar to the 7600 kit so slight
increments there now let's talk about
this what we have here guys that AMD is
finally on the map they're on the map
not only in core count but performance
we saw that with Ryan there's no
surprise there the arguments are going
to continue and they always will
continue just like Chevy and Ford you
know and it's just always going to be
there so all of that aside let's talk
about who these CPUs really talk to and
who would need them because I feel like
a lot of the audience especially on my
channel tends to only look at things
through like a monocle or a single lens
where they're like all I care about is
gaming and for gaming these don't make
much sense at all there's very few games
out there that would utilize those very
few games out there they're usually
utilizing the 16 threads available or
the 20 threads available on Intel today
about 32 threads on AMD that's insane
but what if what if you are a software
developer what if you're dealing with a
lot of virtual machines and you have to
start slicing up that CPU and allocating
it to different virtual machines so that
it looks like multiple CPUs well then
the more threads you have the better
what if you're a live stream or what if
you want to have lots of threads
available to be able to sit you could
the cool thing about this you can do
this now but the more threads available
the more benefit there is to this you
could set the affinity in programs to
where you can have certain programs have
allocated certain cores so that they're
kind of independently handling tasks as
like separate little carved up CPUs sort
of similar to a VM machine but they're
not going to start crossing over tasks
see right now when you're doing
something that's multi-threaded the load
is constantly moving around and being
spread through all the cores but you
divide those cores up you can have your
live stream software using only this
portion of a CPU the game using only
this and then have the rest left over
for other resources that the system
needs with having a lot more seamless
integration of these programs by having
more course so if you're a live streamer
or project development product developer
or software developer especially if
you're doing things like vm machines
then you could certainly take advantage
of that but this is not something that
meant towards mainstream this is not
mainstream the prices on that are going
to have to be expensive now if if
pricing model tells us anything the 69
50 X which is 10 cores and 20 threads
from Intel cost $1,700 is ridiculous
1700 bucks if they're adding two cores
and four threads are they going to just
bump up the price from 1700 or are they
going to be forced to finally
acknowledge that AMD has arrived again
and they have to start to compete for a
little bit of that market share because
I think Reisman shows a lot of people
were willing to go with a platform
that's brand new and deal with some of
the growing pains along with that for
the value because you were getting 69
hundred K performance for half the price
so what's the price of thread Ripper
going to be what's the 1998 X going to
be is it going to be twice the price of
a 1800 X if so that's only $1000 that's
still $700 cheaper that's just
hypothetical I have no pricing
information but that's only 700 OS
cheaper than the current 10 core
offering on Intel the best thing to do
right now is just wait sit on your money
right now is a terrible time to buy
enthusiast hardware because we have new
platform coming out guys for both Intel
and AMD the reason even making this
video though is because a lot of people
wanted my take on this and here's the
problem as I'm still only getting the
same second and third-hand information
that you guys are based through either
leaks when it comes to Intel or and
again the credibility of leaks that's
always the bigger concern then of course
the very high level information we've
received from AMD's live streams so I
don't know I'm telling you right now
guys I think May is the worst month to
buy hardware for CPU architecture
Computex is the world stage for PC
components and that's where companies
like AMD and Intel truly come out with
the best they have to offer for that
year in that generation so don't buy
anything right now unless you're looking
at buying more lower end mainstream like
7600 K I mean 7600 K versus that 76 40 K
I don't think you're going to see much
difference it's gonna be like the
Haswell vs. Devil's Canyon thing again
where there's probably not much reason
to wait around there like a 7700 K
versus a 77 40
gay or whatever it was unless they fix
maybe some of the thermal issues with
the bad Tim application again like has
well all over again then just wait
because at the very least you have to
hope the pricing is going to change I
don't know the balls and entails court
now as far as I'm concerned because
pricing is everything market share is as
much about pricing as it is about
performance so just wait that's my two
cents on this guy's boom I nailed I
always wanted to say that's my two cents
and actually you know I've never really
said that before have I neck
yeah I've never really said that's my
two cents also as you can see we made
some changes here to the studio it's
finally coming together and it's feeling
like a studio so tell me to think about
the look and feel but that said I'm
going to get out of here guys thanks for
listening to my two cents today I did it
again and I'm going to Cameron do me a
favor in the comments try and keep it
civil but I'm concerned I'm only one I'm
only one perspective I'm only one person
with one opinion you guys are the masses
you guys are the ones that make the
difference in this whole genre so in the
comments section below
very civilly I know it's hard say what
you would buy and why let's
hypothetically say that the pricing
comparison stays like it is right now
we're Intel's twice as expensive as the
offering from AMD are you willing to
jump on a new platform again by AMD and
take the risk at less cost or do you
want to stick with what's been tested
and then ingrained and just has a good
foothold in the in the market that is
currently Intel sound off in the
comments you guys are the majority so
you guys are the ones that determine
what happened in the future see you
later guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
