addiction it is episode well oh my god
I've been doing this for 12 weeks now
the time just goes by so fast we've got
some crazy things to cover this week I
we got crazy things every single week to
cover when it comes to the world of
technology but you know it gets a little
bit serious when old women are getting
tasered by the police for buying too
many items so I talked about it a couple
of other tech addiction episodes where
patent infringement lawsuits was just
running rampant in the country and so a
law professor of the University of Santa
Clara and California took it upon
himself to do some research about how
many patent infringement lawsuits
actually involved companies that
developed the technology that the patent
is being covered under for instance I've
already said that a lot of companies do
nothing more than go out and find
technologies that haven't been properly
patented get the patent on and then sue
the company to actually develop the
technology or another company that's
using the technology without ever
actually developing anything themselves
so this law professor decided he wants
to know what the figures look like for
this companies that are going out and
doing nothing but getting patents and he
found that 61 percent of the technology
infringing patent lawsuits happening in
2012 being initiated by companies and
individuals that had never actually
developed anything then sells whatsoever
they have absolutely no track record of
developing anything creating anything or
having any sort of intellectual property
whatsoever all they did was realize that
something wasn't patented one-out
patented it and are now suing these
larger companies now this number 61
percent in 2012 is up from forty five
percent in 2011 and up 23% back in 2010
so you can see a serious trend here
where the trolls are really catching on
and they're going after legitimate
companies they've never developed
anything themselves what so ever oh and
by the way I heard back from the USPTO
the united states patent and trademark
office use of toilet paper now belongs
to me so you know i told you that i was
going to get the patent on using paper
for wiping your butt guess what every
time you wipe a but now chi-ching OJ's
to subsequent thinking of lawsuits
Reuters did a story about a company by
the name of wide land that's now suing
red
or research in motion for apparently
infringing on some Bluetooth technology
now this isn't Bluetooth technology that
only rim is apparently infringing on its
every single cell manufacturer in the
world is apparently infringing on this
particular patent but right now they've
set their sights on Grimm which is
really interesting considering rim
doesn't have any money in fact a lot of
you probably going what the hell is rim
nerd rim really intense midgets rim
stats for research in motion and that is
the developer of the blackberry I'm
sorry if you own a blackberry I don't
mean to offend you but I just can't seem
to get that word out all the time you
know without you know losing my dinner
this same company has apparently
launched an entire string of patent
infringement lawsuits against various
companies like LG Apple HTC Samsung rim
obviously I just talked about rim so a
few weeks back I brought you a story
about a man in New Zealand who by
sixteen hundred dollars worth of Apple
peripherals off of Apple's website for a
mere $35 and how Apple made a mistake
and they accidentally severely under
charge for these accessories and the man
bought it up well then Apple wet and you
know fetched the package back from UPS
in the sent the man a statement saying
sorry you know we made a mistake in that
we're taking the stuff back it's a good
thing that that story went public
because you see best buy best buy made a
mistake where a woman ordered an ipad
she gets her box and there's five iPads
in there she's expecting one and fiber
in the box to being the Good Samaritan
an honest person that she is she called
up bestbuy corporate and let them know
about the situation when they had made a
mistake and they accidentally sent her
two thousand dollars in extra iPads that
she didn't legitimately purchase and she
didn't feel right about keeping the best
buy corporate wanted a little time and
think about it and they went ahead and
emailed her back and said in the spirit
of the holidays we ask that you go ahead
and keep the extra iPads on us as our
mistake and keep them give them out to
friends give them to some charity donate
them to a school do whatever you want to
do with them but please and Christmas
spirit keep them this is a really neat
story where it goes to show how you know
you're a big company you make a mistake
and you have an opportunity to look
really good in the press so you look at
that as just a cheap $2,000 publicity
maybe not on purpose but had the
opportunity of turning it into a great
story and now here they are looking like
great you know best buy oh you should go
to the best buy now because they give
away free stuff and how many ipads do
you think people ordered now hoping that
maybe i'll get an extra one chances are
you're not gonna just really goes to
show how you've got a super company like
Apple that can look like douchebags when
it comes to peripherals and you got
another huge company like Best Buy who
is willing to eat their mistake and let
the customer benefit from their mistake
good one best buy this is the way PR
should be done so I use Twitter I
recommend that you all follow me on
Twitter the link is right down there
it's right you know at the bottom here
where the description is it's very first
thing acetate follow me on Twitter but
I've been realizing as I'm using Twitter
that hey a lot of my pictures are
disappearing and I understand what's
happening I just don't get it I take
pictures I put him up and then as slowly
they're disappearing and I'm going what
the hell is going on but then it dawned
on me i use instagram and i use i like
to use instagram because i could take
one picture in one place and link it to
all my social media at the same time
saves you a lot of time you should take
one picture and it shows up everywhere
well apparently because of instagrams
you know acquire ship my facebook
twitter isn't too happy about the fact
that they're integrating some of
facebook's property into their system so
what they decided to do is they remove
the code that allows the system to
recognize if this is an Instagram photo
and they're now starting to disappear
from your twitter feed so now instead of
opening up somebody's tweet where they
have an Instagram photo and it
automatically opens now you just get a
link and no longer wear those photos
show up anywhere in the Twitter feed or
the little recent photos icon there this
is I guess okay considering the fact
that Twitter now has incorporated some
of the filters and effects and their
photos so taking some photographs on
Twitter won't be so bad but I am gonna
miss the fact that I was able to take a
photo in one place and have a show up
there so Gabe Newell I think that's how
you say his name Newell any WD LOL whos
the boss over at vowel had a
conversation with a blogger over the vga
is the other day and he spilled the
beans on the fact that they're really
looking at pushing their linux-based
steam system and once they're done with
that they're really looking at making a
living room pc or better known as a
console designed to compete with next
gen consoles so in the future you're
gonna end up having Xbox Playstation and
now the valve box or whatever it's gonna
be called don't really know as early as
next year they're really looking to
expand their clientele to more than just
pc users but he was asked about how open
sources console will be he was pretty
honest and said that you know it's gonna
be a pretty controlled environment will
rican troll a lot of what's happening on
the console but the cool part about this
is it's gonna allow a lot of console
gamers to start playing a lot of steam
games that are not available on console
i think this is really good it's kind of
a hybrid between pc and console and
maybe it's the kind of device that can
finally bridge the gap between the two
communities then maybe once and for all
just who cares about whether or not your
console your pc if you get one of these
things you can be both and you can
expect to see something like this coming
out next year from so it turns out
there's a little chinese woman by the
name of cig gog gog the deed lead Gina's
in Newton Massachusetts and she travels
up to New Hampshire to take a trip to
the apple store and the pheasant lane
mall and she bought herself a couple of
iphones online and wouldn't picked him
up and at some point got into an
altercation with the store manager and
was asked to leave she wanted to buy
more than two iphones but there's a to
iphone limit right now imposed by Apple
because of the shortages of the iphone
five so she says fine screw you and
Chile what she does is she goes home and
she goes back online and she orders two
more iphones and drives again out of
state to apparently avoid some of the
state taxes and goes to try and pick up
two new iPhones so if you're keeping
track that makes four iphones for this
particular customer well the store
manager recognizes her and says no you
are not allowed to get more than two
iphones so what does she do she takes
out her phone as she starts filming
everyone she took to filming everyone in
the apple store and this is really
pissing off the manager and he says why
are you filming and she says well
apparently through her daughter because
i guess she doesn't speak English that
she's recording other people that she
feels are being treated differently
because they're buying more than two
iphones so she starts filming and the
manager gets pissed and asks her to
leave and she won't leave she continues
to film and head record so naturally the
police are called and she gets into an
altercation with the police apparently
because of a language barrier again she
doesn't speak English
next thing you know this is happening
that's right the mall cops apparently
had enough of her lip and decided to go
ahead and taser her all because she
wanted to buy more than two iphones and
God just a little bit mouthy with the
manager and apparently things get really
serious if you go against the almighty
Apple what do you mean what do you mean
I can't have these four no it is time
