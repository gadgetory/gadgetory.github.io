to do a video that I've been asked to do
a bajillion times like literally a
bajillion I counted you guys have been
asked me how to do hard line tubing
tutorial and I didn't want to just take
random tube and start bending it for the
sake of a tutorial I want the tube to go
in something so I decided that we need
to go ahead and do an upgrade to coconut
monkeys computer because if you guys
remember I did a tutorial about how to
install a basic water cooling kit and we
use the Alpha cool loop and
unfortunately alpha cools tubing and
radiators are the radiators good it's
just it has a ton of flux in there
and as you can see the clear fluid and
clear tubing has turned a lovely shade
of aquamarine we don't want that so
we're gonna go ahead and do a hard-line
tube upgrade to his system and I figure
would show you guys how to do it in the
meantime today I'm going to show you
guys how to do some hardline bending
tutorials but speaking of tutorials if
you guys want to kind of learn about
anything pretty much what you can
imagine on the internet head over to my
sponsor tube for today's video
Linda comm /j you guys can learn pretty
much anything from there thousands of
online videos and even more written
tutorials about any subject you can
think of there's photography automotive
repair there's programming there's
computer building if you guys don't like
my videos go and check out there's
computer building even like home
decorating cooking anything you guys can
think of you guys know you're you get
done with my videos you can go and check
out like how to do doilies and stuff
don't lie I don't judge I do it right
now head on over to lynda.com /j and get
you a free membership trial and start
using it right now and learn something
new in fact if you guys have been using
lynda.com put it in the comments of this
video what it is you guys have been
learning about weed maybe I can learn a
thing or two but right now free trial
lynda.com slash J link in the
description go and do it and become
smarter now
like literally be smarter than me not
hard alright so how to bend hardline you
know we'll start with this there are two
types of hardline tubes out there there
is PT G and there is acrylic both of
them have their pros and both of them
have their cons I'm not going to get
into that I've already done a video on
that go and check it out click the
little magnifying glass on my channe
and just look up PE TG and you will find
any video about hardline now PT G and
acrylic both have their pros and their
cons if you guys want to know more about
that check out the video I did on that
will keep this video a watchable length
and not get too in-depth on that but
basically PT G is just plastic and fused
and kerlick which makes it much more
flexible as you can see it's not going
to crack it's easy it's easier to work
with it melts and bends at a lower
temperature
I say melt but really that's what you're
doing when you bend it as you're melting
it and you're keeping its shape by
inserting some sort of a silicone insert
which is what we've got right here I've
got two of these one is sanded down one
is knots and basically that's just
because there's some tolerances between
the two I like the etg because it's also
very prone to not breaking and
shattering which right there if I did
that with acrylic would have broken in
fact I've got proof of that right here
because you can see that these are like
all chipped and broken on the end
because if right now if I was to do that
a piece would probably fly off hit
coconut monkey in the face then he will
sue me and my insurance rates will go up
he'll become rich and that's not the
point of today's video but when it comes
to bending there are some tools that
you're going to need I like to keep
things really really simple and basic
some guys like to do the saw method
monsoon mm PC tech a lot of companies
sell tools that you guys can use to cut
this stuff but I like to keep it really
really simple this right here is a
cobalt I got it from Lowe's obviously
because it's cobalt this is a two pipe
cutter and they have different types of
blades you can put in here but I just
wouldn't got this it's like $9.99 it's a
pipe cutter and it's the same thing you
would use to cut copper pipe it works on
ptg you can't use it on acrylic though
in fact let me demonstrate why let me
grab a piece of acrylic here because I
don't really use this stuff anymore if I
try to put this on acrylic the way it
works is you tighten this knob down you
turn it you tighten it you turn it the
problem is the moment you start to crank
on it and cut it it looks like okay
we're going to cut yeah we're cutting
the problem is once you start to crank
it it's going to crack did you hear that
and this is how unfortunately
what it looks like acrylic is very very
similar to glass and it's like a plastic
glass if you won't fact acrylics not
even technically a glass or a plastic
it's more like a glass so anyway that's
why we don't do that but PE TG anyway
I've got a piece of PPG right here
somewhere that's also acrylic I've got
so much cylindrical stuff hanging out in
here don't ask why anyway this is PE TG
and one of the ways that you can tell
the difference is by looking at it from
the side PT G has a slight bluish tinge
to it where kerlick is going to look
very clear like glass but I like to use
this because it makes cutting a lot
simpler you can mark it with like a pin
or I like to put a scratch where I want
it where I want to cut and then just use
this to cut it and then to clean up the
inside I just use a step bit because one
of these steps is perfect for the
diameter of the tube just turn it by
hand like that and it will just shave
the PE TG very simple part of the
problems with PT G though versus acrylic
is it's very soft
and the problem is if you try and get
one of those those outer tools that a
monsoon actually sells when work will
cut the inside and the outside by just
kind of turning it the problem is that
chatters and the blade will skip and
jump you don't get a very clean cut so
that's why I like to use these two tools
this is a very clean outer bend this is
a very clean outer cut this is a very
clean intercut and that's what you want
other thing you're going to need
obviously a heat gun this is a very
cheap Wagner I would recommend spending
a couple of extra bucks and getting the
one that has the big base so that it
will sit on your desk and not flop and
move around on you and it's weighted
that would be actually a lot easier but
really this is just a hairdryer on
freaking steroids that's all it is and
it gets really hot well well in fact
right now we'll show you how the methods
for bending how to know when the
temperature is right for bending and
then what happens when you overheat it
or under heat it because that's the most
common problem I see is people bend too
soon it's not hot enough when they Bend
and they get flat spots and that looks
terrible the flipside is when it gets
too hot then it bubbles and blisters and
that's obviously terrible too
so let's go ahead hook this stuff up and
then I'll show you a little bit
do some of the bending and then what
we'll do here is we'll kind of do a sort
of a build montage you guys know I like
to do of upgrading coconut monkeys PC
because I kind of want this to be a
twofer make his PC look better and show
you guys how to do it in the mean time
so let's get started all right so I just
set my gun up like this this one's kind
of tippy be careful this end gets very
very hot as you can see things have
melted to it including some of the skin
from my thumb you guys don't want that
very very hot things are hot but anyway
there are most heat guns have two speeds
some of the higher-end ones have three
actually temperature so you got a medium
and a high let's go ahead and do this
actually let me take a piece of the
acrylic break that off right here and
I'm gonna show you guys what it looks
you see how easy I just broke that off I
mean literally that's this is one of the
reasons why we don't use acrylic that
much anymore in the modding world once
it once it gets any sort of a crack or a
stress fracture a leak is kind of scary
I'm going to show you what it looks like
when it starts to melt I'm gonna put
this on a medium heat if I go high where
this turns red-hot it's guaranteed to to
pretty much go from perfect temperature
to overheated instantly sometimes if I
want to get things going I'll put it on
high to get it kind of warmed up quickly
and then I'll move it down to medium
that way we don't get too hot too
quickly but let me go ahead and show you
what it looks like if you try and bend
it without an insert inserts are
absolutely necessary that you have to
have it if you don't have it then things
are going to fail let me show you what
it looks like if you try and do it
without an insert
okay so the temperature is pretty much
right for bending if I had an insert in
there but if I try and bend it without
anything in there
you see what happens it's very much like
what happens to a garden hose if you
don't have water in it you guys know if
you bend a garden hose without the water
on what happens the hose this collapses
but the one with the water is on the
hose can't collapse because it the the
space is filled this is also how men
Durrell bent pipes for exhausts and
things like that happen so as you can
see this piece would now be ruined
there's no there's no salvaging that
we're going to move on to another piece
here let me show you what happens if
when the temperature isn't right because
that's also a very common thing that
we've seen before so I'm going to go
ahead and do a bend here
towards the end where it's not hot
enough and we're going to show you what
that looks like so because one of the
most common things I get is Jay this is
happening I don't know why so if you can
see that the result of a certain
imperfection when it comes to
temperature and you can say oh okay that
happened to my my bend because it was
too cold or too hot that's going to be
the most useful thing you're going to
get today because I'm not going to be
able to show you how to properly measure
or how to determine where to do your
bends because I'll be honest I don't
measure at all everything I do is by
eyeball and I'm usually right the first
time it's more or less like an art I
mean how does an artist paint their
picture and just get it right because I
just do and I know that's not exactly I
just do so therefore you should do
that's like the worst tutorial in
history so that's why I'm trying to show
you some of the techniques and then
maybe you can develop you know your own
just do it
Nike mentality when it comes to this
anyway I own I key like $18,000 now or
something like that one thing to that's
really important is you'll notice here
that I'm always rotating it we don't
want to get it too hot so I'm always
rotating it and I'm moving back and
forth because a common issue people do
too is they only heat one spot but the
thing is for the bend radius to be nice
and smooth and even you've got to have
all the area along it also at the right
temperature
otherwise you'll have variants in there
where some of it cannot bend some of it
can the outer portion of the radius has
to be usually the hottest portion other
because it's got the most stretch
involved where the inside is going to be
kind of
crushing on itself so once I start to do
my bend - I'll heat up the outer radius
more than the inside what I'm also doing
- is I'm kind of letting the weights of
the tube I don't want that to fall in my
lap I want kids maybe another kid anyway
I don't I want that the weight of the
silicone insert and the tube to just
kind of be dangling on it that way I can
tell when it's starting to become soft
enough to bend because I think if you've
ever tried this before you start to ask
yourself like is it hot enough I can't
tell and they start trying to wiggle it
then you're Bend radius might be off in
the wrong spot just lots of things that
can go wrong but you can see now it is
starting to bend a little bit right here
see that just a little bit not much I
know if the camera can get that but it's
starting to bend right there I'm gonna
keep rotating rotating rotating if I
want to get a little bit more intense
heat I can move it closer move it
farther away I'd rather use the distance
I am to the nozzle of the heat gun to
control my temperature rather than
turning the gun hotter that's usually
not the way we want to do things here a
few moments later okay so as you can see
here it's starting to become malleable
now and sometimes I've seen some folks
go okay this is the right time to start
bending and then they just start to bend
well do you see what happened right
there that kink that you're seeing right
there is a result of two things one it's
a result of being a very tight radius at
too cold of a temperature and then
moving it too fast so this happens more
so with acrylic than ptg but ptg does it
as well where we were too cold and we
tried to bend and that's what happened
the other thing that would happen too is
right here you would probably get a
smooth radius and then a flat spot on
either end because again it would crush
this is obviously a piece of trash now
this is I think a lot of people sent me
pictures of this asking why did it do
that what happened what happens when
it's too hot well let me show you
acrylic acrylic is probably the most
dramatic result when it comes to being
too hot because it blisters up pretty
bad let me going to show you that we're
going to put this one on red hot to show
you guys because I think a lot of people
they're in pace
they just want to start doing their
bends they want to get it done and they
really start to to force their their
pipe a little bit to hardship you know
what I'm saying there you can take that
however you want but anyway this is what
too hot looks like all right so you're
looking at this and you're going okay
it's very flexible yeah my radius is
fairly smooth I make a little bit of a
flat spot right there but that's because
I didn't heat it that much it's still
very malleable so you're sitting here
letting it cool you know blowing on it
don't also don't dip it in water if you
dip this in water it will it will just
spider crack every word so you want to
sit here and hold it in the position you
want it to be in while you're letting it
cool you can't blow on it a little bit
blow on your pipe as you do you can see
it starts to get as it cools it gets
more more stiff and rigid trying to burn
your lips it sounds like a terrible
tutorial about something else new you go
okay yes I've got my bend and you're
like I can't get my tube out sometimes
you and I might to put little bit of
water in there you twist it as you twist
and pull and then you go oh man and
that's what you get you get these wort
looking things on there that's an
example of overheated acrylic now you
get the same thing with ptg the
difference is the ptg bubbles are bigger
they're much more bigger to get more
wavy rather than just being a straight
up blister like that but also that not
only do you create these blisters you
also weak in that spot where it can just
snap right off now it may look like I
actually pulled really hard on that I
really didn't but you notice it broke
right where the blisters are you see
that so you create a weak spot to when
you overheat it you create extra
brittleness so let's say this is a good
piece right here and something else you
may have noticed is as it was bending I
was flipping it like this and then I was
doing the inner radius and I was doing
the outer radius and I was kind of doing
that because as it's starting to bend
I'm just kind of
slowly work in that angle so I get the
radius that I want you notice I'm not
using a bending aid where some guys will
take like a tube and they'll Bend on the
tube it can collapse on itself and
create a perfect 90 or 45 or whatever
angle you want without having to worry
about you know going against something
that sometimes you see people say use a
toilet paper roll and or something round
like a pole or a desk leg I don't do any
of that this is just the way I do it
just freehand freeform like this but as
you're starting to get the bend you're
going to want to start working the
inside of the radius the outer radius
more than the inside like I said because
that's where it's stretching the most
and then eventually you can get a very
clean 90 degree angle that's pretty much
it that is all I do when I do my hard
line tubing so let's go and do this now
let's get this system drained and then
let's make this thing look a lot better
than it does now transition
you
you
whatever things in it looks a hell of a
lot better than it did before obviously
with all of that stained tubing having a
piece of that to me right there this
this tubing was clear when the when the
build was done member we did this back
in June of 2014 so it's been a year and
a half and this is what happened but not
only did the tubing you know leach a
little bit of plasticizer this color is
coming from the fact that the Aqua our
alpha cool radiator was not flushed
which is entirely my bad normally you
would take vinegar or some sort of like
a system prep and then you would clean
the system with a with an acid of some
sort and you wouldn't get this stuff in
fact all of that crud is sitting here in
this bowl and you'll see that up close
this is what's in radiators most of the
time unless it's a you know brand that
tends to clean their radiators before
shipping alpha cool does not so make
sure you clean your radiators but
bending the tubes and stuff is really
not that big of a deal
what you it it's like anything else the
more you practice easier it gets this is
the only Bend that we did that we ended
up not using everything else was the
first time attempt but that's because
I've been doing this now for so long
that it's pretty easy but anyway that's
pretty much it just make sure you keep
an eye on your temperatures don't try
and bend it when it's too cool keep an
eye on it before it gets hot it can not
only modulate the temperature of by
turning your heat gun either on medium
low or high but you can also vary the
temperature by how far away from the gun
that you are and make sure you heat up
the sides of where you're going to bend
to otherwise you get flat spots or it
will just it'll start to be a nice
smooth radius and then it will just kind
of sharpen out really bad and it look
terrible if it's not you know heat if
heats not evenly applied all the way
around where the radius is going to be
but other than that I hope this videos
helped you guys like I said I know it's
not the best tutorial with hardline
tubing but down in the comments once you
guys tell us about your builds if you
follow me on Twitter send me some
pictures of your hard line tubing builds
and if you guys are using soft tubing
and you want to avoid looking like this
in the future then definitely make sure
to kind of give hard line tubing a try
it's not it's easy it's just cutting the
tube and plugging it in you know and
then clamping it down as soft tubing is
but the end result definitely
a whole lot better anyway time to get
out of here guys thanks for watching
today's video a little bit longer than
usual but that's okay I want you guys to
learn something follow on social medias
and all that stuff and don't forget
check out Linda console and you guys can
learn how to do really cool stuff and
maybe even this in the future anyway
time to get out of here
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
