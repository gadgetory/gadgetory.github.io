somewhere I don't know but this way
people can't start yelling Li Lu it's
good I mean anyways watch Lu the chat
already saying late see it says it's
waiting on me
see we're life with a dove foaming body
wash commercial yeah like dove dove men
mental mascara they need to make an
automotive scented like body soap like
it smells like race fuel and rubber my
goes oh but that's not like a smell we
look forward yeah no smell means money
oh wait can they not hear you again oh
they're gonna be able to hear you again
what the hell remember last time I did
this - hold on guys
no I I got it translate for me
hey area is easier now sorry okay now
back well okay so here's the thing like
because I started Skype like okay so OBS
and Skype are like independent right
audio controllers of each other so as
you're being played through like one
speaker like OBS doesn't automatically
hear that you have to go in and
configure it but anyway I did it and I'm
a roll the intro now so whatever in
trouble all right let's welcome the whoa
I get a weird thing on welcome to text
coconut monkeys like going somewhere so
like say hi today Thursday Thursday at
the Metrodome aka the Internet
there we go so I was reading the chat
earlier I was sitting in here top
reading how dare you well I mean it so
put the link up early this week earlier
than normal or not the links I said it
was ready to go earlier than normal and
so I was curious this like what people
would be saying based on this title and
you know what I've come to the
conclusion of what's that everyone just
expects clickbait now
like everyone just or if you don't do
clickbait they will still call it
clickbait just because that's how much
of an expectation there is for clickbait
yeah what's the opposite of clickbait
not clickbait reality so anyway this is
not this is actually not a kliklak title
nick is pursuing other opportunities
well that guy he was he was he was
holding you back that guy get him
out of there oh wait is Nick is Nick on
the show right now hi Jay big boy you're
finally gonna go actually do something
in your field of expertise with your
your like steel camera uh maybe we'll
see ok so here's one say first of all
yes coconut monkey is so he's gonna
still kind of be around here and there
as a contractor type basis but he's not
going to be a full-time employee any
longer but you guys don't know this he's
got a double bachelor's degree he's got
a he's got a bachelor's degree in
business management
he's got a bachelor's degree in
photography and working like on this
YouTube channel was never like a passion
or I just turn down my volume that was
me that dinged I was never like a thing
that Nick I don't think ever and you
could speak for yourself obviously but
we talked about this this has actually
been coming for about 90 days now we
talked about this months ago and
preparing for this he's got Nick is
weird weirder than you guys know you
wonder why he loves packing he loves
moving he loves organizing that is not
traits we look for around here in Jays
sense that's really weird just in
general like like studio he was like oh
boy are we gonna move I love moving that
that's true actually I was really stoked
I'm moving so one of the things he's
pursuing actually is an international
logistics position with a company that
he's we've got some connections with so
I thought you said he was gonna join a
mover for a second letting students
working on pornhub says pre tech
sheshank
you know their internships are pretty
good critique shake is that like your
cousin no more money than God all the
porn does I got a job offer from stream
Nate you know that weird camgirl site a
guy worked for at Microsoft actually
went and worked there and offered me the
job didn't tell me what it was
until I went to lunch with him and then
he told me what it was cuz the company
had was under some shell company name so
they get a bunch of perverts applying
for the positions it was really weird
did you have a little bit of tech in
here today well we just chat with
coconut monkey onions how Darren is the
last we hear of Tech Talk did you hear
pornhub is accepting Bitcoin now I did I
kind of laughed when somebody tweeted me
that they're like mainstream media news
yeah Wow I guess they're leaking it to
the anonymous nature of Bitcoin right
it's kind of like buying adult novelties
like the last thing you want showing up
as a brown box that's like super adult
realistic sex doll toy right you don't
want that all over the outside of the
box right right you just want some
random generic name like red company and
then you open it up you don't want the
wife getting the credit card statement
they're like honey what's this
$29.99 a month to pornhub was it a young
must company the boring company the
boring company yep
well they already kind of do it to some
degree with a lot of the sites they have
that what is it called it's like e.e
Park is that is that it come on pervs
back me up here is an epoch it's like
one of those things where you can use
like 20 different payment methods and it
completely goes through some other shell
company so you're never directly
connected with whoever you're paying
really Shady
I think it's called epoch and it does
well the evens accept Western Union is a
method of payment
like you know it's shady when they
accept Western Union Zac nine nine one
two zero zero zero says Jay can do nude
PC built now who said I didn't do that
anyway you see police ones as well my
face right there I looked so unimpressed
in the replay no I still have Phil Phil
is still a full-time camera guys so I
mean I I guess unless he wants to just
make up a cute shirt and then have them
just do the pixelation filter yeah just
looks like you're Nate I like The Sims
oh I would totally wear that if somebody
made me like a t-shirt that just looks
like executed torso and you can see like
where nips would be in the belly button
and stuff I would totally wear that on
camera that way from a distance I look
like a nude female torso you need to
make it happen oh so I mean okay
Nik what have you learned working in
this environment for the last year and a
year in two months you like whipped
cream on your mouth yet it's okay what
happens when there's no whipped cream on
the mocks plate
hey hey Nik pop quiz right side up or
upside down upside down that's right
yeah right lock this guy you know oh man
something I also want to address to the
video that went live this morning
obviously wasn't a shot this morning of
our of our issue regarding the SSD being
dead it's looking more and more like the
wrong SATA plug ended up in the wrong
power supply box I wonder how that
happened I have no idea how that
happened no clue who handles the
equipment around here usually you and
you're building stuff but I usually put
on the table for you like hey grab this
yeah so making up to blame here a little
a little bit of is that computer builder
excuses like race car driver excuses you
got cpu builder excuses yeah my tires
were deflated dude
the wrong cable that burned it eight
octane they gave me 87 ask for 91
bro computers are simple like even J can
build computers so that's telling you
some way there's a problem is there's
only so many plugs right I mean
obviously the SATA side of it is
standardized but when the site that
plugs into the power supply there's like
three or four major power supply OEM
that these companies use and there's
only so many different pin outs that you
can do so the problem is a lot of these
companies will reuse the same six pin
plugs or eight pin plugs that plug into
the power supply but the pinout itself
is different so the plug might be the
same but the pin outs different so
usually your indicator that you're
putting the wrong plug in the wrong
power supply would be it doesn't
physically fit because it's keyed
different right but every now and then
you find one that shared the exact same
plug but not the same pins interesting
so somehow ended up with the wrong power
cable in the wrong power supply box and
then it plugged in it fit right if it
you didn't have to force it you know you
know he forced an icky
you did and then your SSD turned into
proof magic smoke we're still gonna try
and revive it it's looking like it might
be bison be salvageable but we can't
figure out is the power supply that it's
looking like it came from is the
gigabyte power supply I got like two
years ago when I built my test bench
yeah those cables have not been touched
since then weird and one of those SATA
cables ended up inside of our RM 850
power supply from Corsair ended up in
that box which we got long after that
gigabyte showed up sabotage yeah I think
this was Nick's final like act of
frustration for me was Jake to belay
Eric and he's like oh you know yeah okay
how can I get him and that's I think
that's I think is on purpose oh my neck
on the surface Nick's the kind of guy
that will play like he doesn't know what
he's talking about and just played them
but it's a brilliant act because then
you just like you want to get really mad
at him but then you feel bad because he
doesn't get mad back at you and then you
just feel like an asshole you're like
okay I blew up my cuz of something
you did but now I feel bad you know he's
like he's gonna be a serial killer one
day I'll call his dude it's like guilt
tripping me now - thanks Hey see right
there Ryan Ryan screen and chat says
someone didn't keep good inventory it's
true no actually he kept good inventory
it was on the list it's just you didn't
keep good work yeah I I think blame
should be placed on both you cuz J you
know you forced that son bitch and don't
even lie you know you did you used
greater pressure than what was necessary
Nick does it may look right in order to
get the force it clicks right in god
damn it Nick you always back him up you
could have at least thrown him under the
bus just for shits and giggles on your
way out that's only because he has about
36 more hours of being on payroll after
that he'll throw me under every bus
that's coming my way so so did it get
hit with a 12 volt rail or five volt
rail when you plugged it in the wrong
one hey I don't know it immediately
trips the circuit protecting the power
supply the thing is how the drive
doesn't detect when we plug it in so
well hell do you think you're gonna
salvage it are you gonna swap the the
board on it no really a really common
comment on that video over and over and
over again is that you can actually get
Windows to possibly buy power cycle
consider over and over with the powder
like in the OS that you can sometimes
get it to come back so I'm gonna try it
I mean what do I have to lose right
nothing I mean he'll I've said I'm not
even gonna like look at that and say
that's not possible because I've
recovered more than five hard drives but
I put them in Ziploc bags and throw them
in the freezer so this distal magical
 actually works most of the time
well I mean somebody somewhere at some
point thought about throwing a wet cell
phone in a bag of rice right Nazis -
iPhones like AppleCare so I don't the
deal with it no more yeah but all
Apple's gonna do now is give you like
some third time refurbed phone that's
gonna break on you in two months
dude Apple's getting bad man the Genius
Bar is all backed up I think they don't
have enough people for how many products
they've sold I don't like there a
problem is the amount or the lack
thereof of Apple stores in your area
because you can get a same-day
appointment around here Jax all we have
is the one I went out here one in
Seattle but I don't want to go into
Seattle for anything like I don't care
listen listen
there's that's the one I'm talking about
the one I call you and then there's a
MAC store that you can go to but they
have to actually mail it to Apple so it
like basically takes like two weeks yeah
freaks me out I never noticed that it
been so far back oh this guy right here
yeah it looks like you get pissed off at
a stamp oh yeah dude I can like make a
team with those suckers yeah well yeah
double-jointed okay ladies I call I call
it the g-spot or at the I've seen people
be able to point their thumb back like
like push it back but not just have it
go back on its own I mean I know the
fact that I actually have a muscle that
can do that play if the funny thing is I
can bend it that far forward I can as
you bend it almost further backwards
than I can for it it's not a loose
control arm and my knees are
invert - like if you ever seen me with
my legs stand together my knees bow out
not and not in they bow out it's really
weird whoever put me yeah you do look
like you live life on the on a horse
I've got one of them on cowboy walks
like if you hold your belt buckle if you
tear ethically wore pants we're likely
it's where those awkward suspension
setups that you don't know what to do oh
my god Jerry's got positive leg camber
yeah
I'm like a rhinoceros that I can run
really fast for a short distance in a
straight line but there is no cornering
it you were like the original Tesla 0 to
60
exactly exactly but like if they may
choose with stickier rubber I might have
a chance at cornering but I'd probably
just snap my knees before they found a
way to actually keep the power going
past 60 actually there was a guy at my
gym who has to have surgery on his ankle
because he popped his ACL oh by running
he was he the moment he took off from
the sprint was just you know he's so
much force he launched himself with he
snapped as hcof raised yeah that's
that's like a six-month recovery isn't
it I know he's having surgery or
anything about the recovery it's yeah I
know but will you have to write your ACL
won't if you snap it they have to go in
there and like reattach it and put
on it right yeah and then just gonna
line up and like somehow Oh magically
well that's the thing when it tears it
retracts right so it doesn't actually go
back so right if it doesn't start
healing on its own they have to do it
God I can't imagine what that must have
felt like although you know I snapped
attend it in the back of my leg I don't
think it wasn't the ACL but I'd snapped
attend it in the back of my uh right
between my foot and my knee and from
some medication they put me on that made
it weak and they're like yeah go don't
go to the gym or do any extraneous
ectopy you're on this medicine all I did
was stand up out of bed and that was a
snap that and the worst the
worst injury I've ever had was when I
was really big I was I was close to 500
pounds at that time when i stiii went to
pick up some of this like you know the
best pizza you could possibly gets like
mom pop type places right not ya John's
or Domino's like these these one-off
places and that's all that that family
does is made pizza for 60 years right
yep
so I we ordered it I went in and picked
it up and walking out of the restaurant
or the pizza parlor I stepped off the
curb and rolled my ankle and the thing
it was like one of those big curbs dude
was like eight or ten inches tall like a
big fat one and I my ankle rolled under
my under my leg so bad that it tore
every tendon and ligament on my left
ankle to the point to where they
actually thought I'd completely like not
dislocated but like broke off my foot
cuz this was as dangling
and the bruises and the and the black in
the purple wait all the way up to my
thigh not my like past my knee and all
the way up to my thigh with the way it
bled but you know what it's shocked I'm
sorry were you in shock from that like
how do you even tolerate that much pain
because I snapped just one little thing
in the back of my leg and I was laying
on the ground screaming bloody murder
okay
so first of all you've seen firsthand I
have an extremely high pain threshold
you did second I it didn't feel like
pain initially it felt like heat
I felt the pop I heard that I heard the
crunching I sound like breaking chicken
bones right but then I felt the heat
just like riding up my leg and I was
wearing long pants right and I tried to
stand up and that's when my foot
immediately like when I stood up like I
looked at the weight off of my leg the
foot just curled up like it just curled
like like a like a clubfoot like I've
seen babies with club feet yeah so it
looked like that and that's like Oh what
the hell moral the moral of this story
though is I never dropped the pizza I
held it up over my hand as I was falling
I never dropped it it stayed perfectly
intact in the bottle no joke guy walking
by was like Annie saved the pizza as I'm
sitting there with a foot that can like
go based basically in a 360 dangling by
skin nod was he just like you really I
basically just tried to stand up and I
like ooh something doesn't feel right
and I sat down on the curb and I said I
looked down at my foot and I was
basically looking at the bottom of my
foot with my leg going straight so yeah
that's what happened that's what happens
when a nearly 500 pound man steps off a
curb and rolls his ankle that was just
gravity so Jesus I can't even imagine
what that'd be like right now a mom a
little over 300 none I do not like it
like I'm yeah I I would kill to be back
in 250 and that was like my that was my
sweet spot for my nibbling little body
but got 500 pounds Jesus oh yeah it's
not I said no I'm sorry well you do you
make do you make your weight public or
you keep that a closely guarded secret
no I at right now I weigh 270 pounds I
have put back on about 35 pounds from
all the weight I lost in 2015 yeah
according to our body scan about 15 of
its muscle the rest of its fat that's
because I've been more sedentary and the
other problem was when I started lifting
heavy I underestimated the appetite that
comes with that and I just haven't made
good eating choices but no my weight is
completely public it's it's something
I'm gonna struggle with probably the
rest
my life and I'm gonna go up and down 20
25 pounds constantly I think the rest of
my life like right now my wife and I are
in a pretty I'm I'm basically plateaued
I've stopped the weight gain for a while
now I haven't lost anything cause I
haven't committed to it which is
terrible but but my wife has been
dropping weight like crazy cuz she's in
that weight loss mode right now I saw
the picture the other day that she
posted over on the probe I was like whoa
man that's that's crazy yeah she's lost
a crap ton of weight she's down like two
or three sizes and what the biggest
thing was once our once our youngest
daughter stopped breastfeeding that was
the biggest thing for her because it'd
be she had the kind of I know metabolism
or whatever that refused to let her lose
weight while she was feeding too you
know what I mean well I think that's
like pretty common is that because your
body knows it has to generate more
calories for something else that holds
on to everything they can well the thing
is it depends like our how'd this turn
into pregnancy talk so when we had our
first baby you know I had to shave the
nipple hair because the kids kept
coughing up hairballs anyway with our
with our oldest she kind of dropped
weight quickly because she was I guess
the amount of the amount of energy it
took just to make food was helping her
weight but every kid's different and so
this time she could not lose weight but
as soon as as soon as she got off the
nipple man did the weight to start
falling off her and it made like
anything else I'm sitting there looking
at this going wow she's uh she's
impressing me with what she's doing
which makes me more motivated to kind of
get back in that mindset but what I've
noticed I've been with my wife almost 19
years and we've never been in the same
mode at the same time I either I'm
losing weight like crazy and she doesn't
care yeah or she's losing weight like
crazy and I don't care someday we'll
both lose weight at the same time I mean
my wife kind of do the same thing too
I'm gonna say that that's almost kind of
a typical thing especially when you're
both starting heavy yeah and it's just
maintenance because like well one of you
is working out and doing everything the
other ones pretty much just keeping up
the because we both did it at the same
time like moods and stuff would clash
we've done that before too or it's like
if you're always worn out all the time
you get a little a little pissy yeah
well you're pissy all the time but
anyways well okay everything get tired
work out but it's like we don't want
your wife tired also
because it's one of those things it's
like you don't want to both be tired at
the same times that's a recipe for
disaster yeah no you know what though I
mean we haven't been eating out a ton
because obviously she she likes to do
her own clean cooking and stuff
especially in this particular mode that
she's in but if you've got one spouse
that's like hell-bent on just eating
right needing clean and exercising a lot
then you'd have to try kind of hard not
to get some residual effects from that
you know what I mean
especially that buys all the food for
the house I don't know shopping and
that's my problem right now I told my
wife I was like the only reason I'm fat
like this is because you somehow put
enough calories in the house for me to
find them like if you if you didn't shop
I'm more lazy than I am hungry like if I
get up and I'm hungry and there's no
food in the house I'm not gonna go
shopping I'm gonna just go back to bed
I'm not I'm not gonna go searching for
food that isn't readily accessible I
rarely do this but I'm actually gonna
ask the chat for some advice here I
never do that because I'm never gonna
get anything that could this consistent
but here's my problem my appetite is
non-stop and I'm not eating non-stop but
I'm hungry non-stop and that leads you
to make some bad choices and when I was
losing weight like I lost 72 pounds in
four and a half months in 2015 I had
people messaging me asked me if I was
sick hmm like viewers were messaging me
going are you okay cuz you're I watched
a video from a month ago and you look
like you got cancer like people started
getting legitimately concerned even even
look at - tech tips told me that he was
worried about my health because of how
fast I was losing it the difference was
I wasn't hungry I was cycling 25 to 50
miles a day and then I was eating right
I was only eating about 2,200 calories a
day burning 6000 calories a day on that
bike so that's what that was but when
you're burnt more than you're taking in
- that can kind of cutting three times
what I was taking it yeah so I was
burning on on average about 4 pounds a
week at the rate I was losing weight and
so my problem is since I started lifting
heavy now I'm hungry all the damn time
and I don't know how to curb it
healthily healthily and I felt the same
way back when I was weightlifting now
that I think about it - cos we used to
go weightlifting we'd always go out to
an all-you-can-eat dinner afterwards
then the next day we got an
all-you-can-eat lunch and then we drink
and go hit the gym again ok I see a lot
of people saying water here's what you
guys have to understand that there's a
big piece of information here in 2009 I
had gastric bypass surgery so the amount
of water I can intake
the amount I can drink at once is not
like normal I can't fill up my stomach
with water like you guys can because
there's no stomach for it to sit in the
other thing is I see a lot of people
mentioning no carbs no carbs no carbs I
understand that I understand exactly
what carbs do and I understand they turn
into sugar what is the problem is is I'm
craving carbs like crazy so I need some
way to curb the craving of carbs when
I'm hungry like right now we just eat
beef jerky right it's beef and it's
protein but the thing is when you're
when you when your body is is that
craving sugar it's like you want bread
you want potatoes you want that kind of
stuff that's like me all the time I do
have a suggestion that might help you
because I've been playing around with
stuff for the last couple of weeks
especially with like medication change
in hormone therapy and stuff thing that
seems to curb my appetite the most is
stimulants like just bar none just kills
my appetite dead like if I take a
hundred milligrams of caffeine like
every hour like take you know I do those
little freakin caffeine pills hundred
milligrams basically a cup of coffee if
I take one of those every hour I
literally will just forget to eat
it'll be like 10 o'clock at night and
I'll be like oh crap I didn't eat yet
today yeah but I have to for me
personally I would have to assume that
taking that much caffeine is gonna have
negative effects for me well you already
drink quite a bit though how many
coffees do you have a day guaranteed one
sometimes two so okay well one coffee
probably isn't gonna compress I suppose
fine anything that's got a good jolt of
caffeine and it is all you need
I see a lot of people suggesting like
stop lifting
that's a stupid suggestion well your
buck is your reason yeah because he
needs the energy or thinks it needs that
here's the science behind it as far at
least as far as my trainer who's NASA
and ASM or whatever sort he's a master
trainer and I say I'm certified former
professional bodybuilder mr. California
which is mr. Olympia like the guy knows
at least genetics right
yep you start lifting heavy your muscles
need to repair your muscles repair off
the fat your body craves food to make
fat to repair the muscle so it's like a
never-ending cycle the thing is sugar
turns directly into fat carbs turn into
sugar sugar turns into fest that's why
you crave the carbs I can eat an entire
freakin chick bike I'll go to I can go
to like sprouts or Whole Foods or
whatever and buy a premade baked chicken
right Alyssa the whole damn
thing and still be hungry yeah that's
what I'm fighting with right now
bubble go I've a protein protein like
vegetables like fiber and protein music
I'll just eat eat a lot of protein and
you won't be hunk all screw that man
protein I never feel full when I eat
protein yeah you know it's
but again yeah the carbs it's a delicate
balance but anybody says don't eat carbs
that's the thing that kind of bugs me I
know a lot of people that do the keto
diet and it works really well for them
and everything but it's like your body
runs on sugar I'm not saying you need a
lot of sugar but I'm just saying to
completely cut out carbs and sugar
entirely seems really unnatural yeah so
I'm still having carbs and sugar but I
try to avoid unnecessary sugar like I
don't drink sugary beverages anymore if
I do drink a soda occasionally it'll be
a diet if I drink a Red Bull it's a diet
you know aspartame eat the greatest
thing in the world for you but it's
still better than me getting you know a
ton more grams of sugar that I don't
need someone said swim or cycle I don't
have access to a pool and cycling
obviously is how I lost so much weight
the first time and that the weather is
turned just not like it was ever cold in
California but I'm sorry when it's 55
degrees and I don't have cold weather
riding gear or fleece-lined gear when
I'm moving you know anywhere between 18
to 25 miles per hour and a bike that's a
bit of a windchill okay yeah I
understand some of you guys in the East
Coast are still dealing with snow and
stuff but I'm sorry about 60 in
California we might as well be just
dying but the hours are longer now so in
the daylight's longer so I'm I am
standing on getting back on that bike
more often but man I just own you it's
it doesn't water California like doesn't
have water she can't you got water no
you don't it's a lie it's no it's fake
you've been to the Pacific Northwest
Nick you know we don't have water
compared to what do you say paired to
them yeah you guys like Waterworld it's
challenge back in the day and I got
on so many times from people from
California saying I was insensitive I'm
like if you guys were standing where I
am right now there is literally a water
source within ten feet in every single
direction you walk anywhere so like
let's talk about that for a second I'm
this in this episodes obviously all over
the place more than normal just you guys
are just joining us we're hanging out
with Nick because this is Nick's last
week he's going to be pursuing some
other opportunities that he can actually
use his education and degrees in more so
than being jay-z basically you you know
you know I have that $100,000 education
my shot bitch hey Jay you know what the
one thing you did give to NIC though
that he's gonna tell me
[Laughter]
you literally hardened NIC against
anything I don't know that that you you
I don't think anybody like you wouldn't
got a job in the mob and they just
started screaming at him and shooting
guns around him I think his pulse
wouldn't even go up at this point like I
said nick has a nick has a I'm telling
you
Nick's niceness his persona is all just
that a persona because Nick has done
something no one else has really been
able to do yes I'm a hard-ass I'm trying
to be fair I'm wrong sometimes and I try
to hide it I admit it but you've been
though you're the only person I know who
I can like get mad at legitimately you
do something that it deserves
like ramification or something and I
feel bad for it it's like a minute I
said how did this happen actually teach
that to Phil no Phil feels good Phillip
feels Phil how could he be mad at Phil
he's just the happiest little guy yeah
you guys are wondering where Phil is
actually he wasn't here this week he's
in Japan
he sent me all the pictures you got
overnight parts from Japan I'm so jelly
Phil Phil actually does a lot of stuff
for automotive and Formula D because
he's also a freelance videographer and
his professional videographer in the car
world and he's actually over in Japan
doing stuff right now so Julis do you
tell him he's gay all the time for doing
drifting because drifting is gay you
don't hey hey can you take that back
please how much how much camera does he
have on his car it depends when he's
aired out or not yeah if it's greater
than two and a half degrees that guy's
all right knock it off I don't think
it's like extreme cambric no he hasn't
mark three oh yeah if there are over
300,000 miles on it and on the engine
yeah yeah really yeah it's a very sick
swap okay okay
god that's crazy knees what kind of
power does that thing put down nothing
yeah well I mean it's a drift car you'd
assume that it means some kind of power
oh it's a golf it's front-wheel drive
dude okay now now I'm good okay hold on
hold on it he is a he's a professional
videographer for Boles media that does
that covers events like Formula D and
all sorts of stuff like all over the
country and in Japan so because he's you
know he's a videographer for it okay
thank you that's where I was confused I
thought I thought that he was doing
Formula Drift no I was like front-wheel
drive car what this does not have a goes
backwards but yeah he's got no but his
car is a is a mark three golf with a VR
six swap and has over three hundred
thousand miles in airbags it's not that
bad so like he couldn't keep up with the
Camaro
he couldn't keep up with me heavy to
like does that make that car really
stupid front heavy a little bit but it's
also it makes up for it in torque okay
but because it's not turbo deer they
don't tell what the torque is okay had a
buddy put a prelude engine and it was
the 2-liter prelude engine and all the
Honda Civic and that thing literally
didn't go around corners anymore hey
just understeered everywhere it's
terrible oh cool you know cars how's the
suit be running the sube is might be
time to put out the pasture actually did
something goes knock knock who's there
yeah v well the engines actually holding
together pretty well it's the
transmission that's going and that's a
lot more money than the engine like I
was hoping that transmission would last
forever but unfortunately the fifth-year
synchro is gone now like I literally it
takes a second and a half for me to
shift into fifth if I don't want to
grind the transmission and fifth is a
gear I use a lot in that car only
because you're doing your high speed
long drives and your your heart your
long poles once you just not go to fifth
gear and that goes with that by the way
speaking of that I broke my last record
I got it on my cobb accessport to say
871 miles an hour that's the route I do
it with that those lack of air that it
literally feels like you're on a boat
and open water
anything's connecting the road I'm all
almost certain that I'm just flying like
six inches off the surface of the
pavement cuz there's there's no
connection the wheel feels completely
dead that rally mode did yeah yeah well
I've got I've got a place where I can
deal where it's about a three to four
mile straight stretch nothing but just
run out on both sides five lanes wide
and nobody's there at night so I'm like
whee
but it didn't I was I was pretty proud
of her but now the transmissions being a
whore so I'm like damn it I wonder why I
don't know what I'm gonna get I don't
know what I'm gonna get well no no I
think the seat the syncro is not gonna
suffer from a hard a hard pass the seat
growing because I'm shifting seen the
way you drive it granny clutch it man
you can't granny clutch it no it's just
it's it's just time I mean I'm really
hard on that car that but the
transmission rebuild for it is about
about three grand just to just to
basically get it back to you know stock
fresh wood kernels if I want to build it
out and actually have it be like a built
transmission cod sky's the limit like
$5,000 up to $15,000 I was like and so
you could go with like rallies back then
you can actually why don't you just dog
boxes yeah what prospereth sells a cake
it's the engine transmitted it's the
engine and transmission the half-shafts
that come out to go to the wheels new
control arms and everything for the car
and the whole kits forty five thousand
dollars and it gets the car up to all
just shy of 500 horsepower at the wheel
and it's new turbo and everything on the
engine and I think they stroke it out to
2.9 liters instead of 2.5 but it's got
the dog box on it mmm
so six-speed dog box so I can just cost
as much as your car pretty mo $45,000
like brand-new Subaru just for I do it
I'd do it it'd be fun I mean there's
well you've driven in my car it's a fun
car like you even said yourself that
you'd consider getting a super just to
have something to horse around with like
in the dirt and stuff like it's it's a
great but I don't I wouldn't want a
newer okay when I say newer I mean like
blah by and newer I've like one of the
older Subarus like in the 90s or
something because then because then I
need to find a guy like you is about to
just upload his car because I want to
fix this transmission drop that engine
in there you know there's plenty of
scenarios like that out
I've considered remember when I sold my
gsx because I thought I blew up the
transmission again turn out to be just a
busted axle but I was so I was just so
fed up with the car by then I sold it
for $1,000 yeah I loved the car if I had
the money right now to like fix it up
properly and everything I would and the
fact is I don't have any money to go buy
another car right now anyway so I'm
thinking about just hanging on to it for
a while and if things turn around then
maybe I'll sink the money I'm never
gonna do the Cosworth build though cuz
I'm not gonna put $45,000 into my 2004
or 2005 Subaru that just doesn't make
any sense to me on any plan every night
but I probably wouldn't take the engine
and get it board out to pour out the
engines about two grand and board out -
I think it's 2.8 or 2.9 liters they put
sleeves in it do the forged internals
and everything on it's about another
1,500 bucks and then build the
transmission for probably like $8,000
and then you'd have something that
wouldn't be quite as good as the
Cosworth but still would be reliable and
putting down good power so speaking of
cars because I got the zl1 I've seen a
lot of comments people asking like
where's the Z what are you doing with
the Z and I keep forgetting like my
facebook is private and I pretty much
only post in our racing groups yeah so
the internet hasn't really been privy to
what I've been doing to the Z so the Z
is slowly but surely converting to a
full race car I mean the interior is
already coming out the roll bar of the
roll cage has already gone in and he's
fighting it a second away or by was that
is that a built cage for that or did you
want him for it I mean I bought it I
bought it but it was built before the
car I mean it was a it was fabbed in
another state and then it was afraid to
me that's awesome dude it looks good it
looks really good but the problem is why
are you already giggling is you know
where this is going yeah the problem is
that car where the cage was not built
for a 206 foot for 270 pound individual
so the cage of course pushes the seat
forward a little bit which even when you
saw the way I fit in that car with the
seat all the way back and reclined as
far as it could go my knees still touch
the dash my head still touch the roof so
imagine the seat being two clicks
forward now and not being able to
recline you are at all human you are a
tall creature so you have to put padding
on the bars don't eat through your legs
well no there's no door bars it's a
four-point right now so okay so for the
rest of this season I'm gonna probably
run it like this and then when we
when we go on winter break and stuff I'm
probably gonna then take it over to one
of our local fabricators and I'm
probably gonna get the floor pan lowered
to get the the car or the seat sitting
lower with a full like six point roll
cage you know the whole deal probably
even like lexan lexan glass but the
thing is like right now so I've got my
Sparco seat which the only way it's
gonna fit in there is if it's sitting on
the floor
so I'm actually dropping the car off on
April 30th to the fabricators to get the
new seat brackets and see the low mount
seat mounted for it my six point harness
and my helmet and Hans are ordered today
so I'm gonna go race it next month on
the 12th actually and you're not gonna
be able to go to that event although I
know you want to go Jerry because the
next day is Mother's Day so I know
you're not gonna be here for that but
yeah so it is slowly but surely gonna
turn into a race car so as soon as I
make it through the rest of this season
we go into summer break I'm gonna start
pulling out all of the internals are
absolutely all of the interior when
eventually do the a/c delete do all the
smog equipment delete it already has no
cats or smog going on anyway so yeah I
mean a lot of people been asking and
that's what that's what's going on with
the car but I've got to figure out
something that I drove it to work the
other day and driving home I started
getting a really weird funky sound in
the left front yeah and either my two
piece rotors coming apart or my calipers
coming off I gotta figure you're not
like a chatter it's a it sounds like no
it's like a it's definitely like a metal
creaking under deceleration have you
checked your your how tight your lug
nuts are that's the first thing I
checked okay cuz I was gonna say that's
what happened to my Subaru I think I was
telling you about that I was like
driving down the road and it was
creaking and creaking a crate in there
by the floor cuz your thumb keeps
bending too far another stage let me
show you okay let's goes like that then
like you're pointing at the guy behind
you to tell him that I mean so anyway no
so anyway yeah I mean something's just
come loose in the front end and I gotta
figure it out but I'm glad I drove it
now cuz I have a month to figure it out
so that's better than me putting the the
obstetric thing thinking I needed it and
driving GOG a month
oh the obstetric rings I hate those no
no no take the hub centric view to tell
a story so I bought new wheels but I
pulled out the hub sight recordings from
my rings from my old spacers because I
thought I need to use hub centric ring
still on the new wheels you literally
just have pancaked plastic between it
was metal metal but the problem is he
couldn't get the wheel you can get the
wheel to mount flat against the hub so
there's there's always rattle this
rumble in the back I couldn't tell what
it was and then we showed up for a track
day at ACS and I thought oh I might do a
session but I go back and check out my
car I'm missing a lug and like that's
that something's not right so I Drive it
around a little more and it's just - all
wobbly all over so I had basically given
Nick my spacers from my old stock side
of Nismo wheels for the 370z and when he
got his aftermarket wheels he didn't
realize it goes from a hub centric wheel
because member OAM lugs at least for the
nissan they're not acorn shaped they're
not cone they are a flat nut that pushes
against a flat wheel hub a wheel the
hole where the blood goes yeah and it it
requires a hub centric ring to Center
the wheel on the hub aftermarket wheels
have tapered lugs and tapered lug holes
which are lug centric which means
centers on the lugs my bed Nick left the
spacer hub centric ring which is about
twice the thickness of it like anything
OEM would fit which kept the wheel from
about a quarter inch from meeting the
hub so the whole time he was driving
around with wheels that he just
tightened down whatever orders of course
he tightens down the first wheel which
kind of Yanks the wheel off center and
then just works his way around so the
wheels were never flat against the hub
so I just going down the road
looked like one of those wobbly big-rig
container trailers I'm really surprised
he didn't bust the lash stud yeah no
pain yeah because he put all the stress
on those lugs
after that yeah which is why you lost
lug nuts cuz as the thing was wobbling
around and going like vibrated I it was
going tight and then not tight tight not
tight the lug worked its way off so yeah
I fixed it yeah Nick sent these pictures
and I'm like what is that doing there
he's oh that's the hub centric ring I'm
like but why he's like because their hub
centric I'm like no those wheels are not
have centric
you can rather run hub centric rings but
not ones from a spacer
usually if there's an indentation on the
back of the aftermarket wheel that it
recesses into but you're saying it was
too thick well yeah because it was like
a 20 mil spacer gotcha gotcha excited to
run spacers on on my Corolla back when I
had it for the aftermarket wheels that
are on there and remember I left a
spacer off once because it just fell off
the wheel while I had it off and I put
it back on the car and the car was all
like hey right yeah it's nuts so let's
go sown Izzy's gonna be a race car now
because goal so you're not talented
enough to drive the real car fast around
the track you got to be the slow one
okay Racing's him I've only got I've
only got three days left I promised my
kid for his birthday so when I get that
put together you want to get a get an i
racing event on the calendar so you can
embarrass me in front of everybody I
guess so I don't see why racing in two
years I've kept my case I just you know
have I ever say no to you goodbye that's
the subscription dude it's like the most
expensive sin there is it is and I've
been paying for for two years and
haven't even logged in just just I
wanted to keep it active hey Nick do you
ever do have a wheel or anything yeah
he's got my old years old 2077 yeah oh
that's a sweet wheel I mean as far as
wheels go that's actually a really
really good wheel still I want to get
new pedals for my racing sim though
because I want to go with the true
hydraulic style like you've got it's
just little bit yeah finding them is not
easy though anymore though they for some
reason all the companies that were
because there's like 20 companies that
were making these especially they're
like 1500 bucks
well these ones were the sim pedals were
because they're literally straight out
of a car they use the brake the the
master cylinder and the slave cylinder
from a real car real race cars so but I
wonder if you could just build some out
of like some 6040 aluminum or something
like that just just take a pedal set out
of like a existing car yeah they just
mount that's all they did with the sim
pedals if you look that they just put an
adapter on it so that the pressure
sensor that's on the master cylinder is
basically just reading pressure to an
Arduino board and then that just
pretends it's a it's a USB controller
and so you got what oh I see what he's
doing don't say
because he tries like you say and but
when you it says something else oh no no
no we don't that's bad yeah don't say
that nothing wrong with a g27 um anyway
yes
Jerry I Drive the Zeile one on track
like it's meant to be driven he sends it
really good no in less than 3,000 miles
I've already gone through a full set of
breaks and a whole set of tires no no
when I come down there I definitely want
to go for a ride in it hopefully on a
track somewhere I took I took one of the
guys in our racing group who's known to
be like one of the most ballsy he's
gonna send it and probably die guys in
our group I took him on a ride-along and
scared the out of him so yeah at
one point I was like I'm gonna do a
cooldown lap he's like yeah yeah you
should totally slow down I mean say I
said you're faster on pavement like I've
I've ridden what you still never seen me
on a track and the canyons aren't a
sarna the cannons are not even a
percentage of my ability cuz I'm not
gonna I don't want to wrap it around a
tree or fly a thousand feet off a cliff
oh no fair enough but I mean even so
though driving within the limits of the
road you were you were pretty close to
the limits of the road like you you were
staying just shy of it but yeah I was
definitely getting the Clinch factor and
I'm usually pretty relaxed like I even
go for rides you know hot laps with the
with the rally guys through the woods
you know where those guys will hit 80 90
miles an hour going through the woods
where you and I you know and the BRZ so
we're cruising along I like 45 but uh
yeah well yeah you're fit you're fast on
the pavement I would love to see what
it's like on a track with I made my
honey my instructor clinch he squished
his butt cheeks together because a
Buttonwillow going 13 CW which is a 13
turn clockwise orientation of that track
there's like a ton of different
configurations of Buttonwillow
well we're running 13 CW so if anyone
here knows that track you'll know I'm
talking about my Clark so there's
towards the last set a sector of the
track sector 3 you come out of a late
turn apex into like 3 s's so it's a it's
a right-hander left-hander right-hander
and then a left-hander again until a
long straight into a 90 degree turn
coming out of the esses
I was already doing about a hundred and
eight miles per hour with the wheel
turned over to the left i curbed it a
little bit too much on the left side
which kicked the car up which made the
backend start to oversteer towards a
wall and you but but the thing is with
my PDR my performance data recorder in
the car you see it a hundred and eight
and you know the wheels came off the
ground cuz it's like the miles per hour
like 100 Philly 103 104 105 108 120 it's
like whoa because the wheels just spun
suddenly right yeah you see a 30-degree
counter steer because you can see the
steering wheel and everything in the
steering angle and throttle and all that
you see that I never lifted the throttle
I stayed in and a hundred percent a 30
degree counter steer at 108 miles per
hour pointing at a wall just to
straighten the car back out and never
lift it my instructor was like from the
passenger seat that was scary
because of course at that point is just
along for the ride right right but that
the car probably to a fault doesn't
scare me enough on track so I really do
just let all 700 horsepower work their
way around the track it's fun though
it's a lot of fun that's why I have
buying tires looking right it's a good
thing you're on a relatively small track
because like if you took that thing out
to like the Nurburgring oh yeah bro you
do your simulator I'm pretty sure you
die on the first lap I can make it clean
through the Nurburgring though on my
simulator I'd probably lose a quarter
panel never once when I've bared witness
I don't know if it's just me being in
the room that somehow screws it up for
you but remember last time I was over we
had to fix your wheel and you did was a
four tries on the Nurburgring and
project cars with the Cadillac cts-v I
was ATS VR yeah yes we are you just kept
eating like about halfway through
the lab for three quarters rate to the
lap and just oh man yeah I suppose but
I've spent so much time on that track
sensing I do it in the rain now it's
scary it's scary
I've heard tracks a different animal in
person though I was watching a
documentary or some guy was doesn't
matter how many times done this in a
racing simulator dude when you get out
there the surfaces different every time
and in a simulator it's consistent but
in real life there's like oil all over
that track cap helpit Ellison 700 Wars
power what yeah JS jeiza
American built sports car has 700
horsepower and 700 torque I know that
that doesn't make any sense in any
universe because American cars usually
just have big motors they don't make a
lot of power and make 650 torque at 3100
rpm
so I've got a video of me of me at 5,500
feet doing a full entire first gear
burnout downhill so already we got
altitude and going downhill is not easy
to do a burnout and yeah but I'm not
putting that video online because my
license plate is completely visible
yeah no I'm fine it looks like like I
said I'm not a big guy I don't like a
lot of American cars I'd say probably
the Corvette yeah would be so and you're
about as close to a Corvette as you can
get I mean the two-car is pretty much
punch and in the same in the same way by
the way your figure there's a steel one
1le is faster than the zo6 on track it's
not faster in a straight line it's a
couple tenths slower in a straight line
but it's it's a more track focused car
than the zo6 the only thing faster now
is the Corvette zr1 which is twice the
price yeah I was gonna say that's a
completely different price point right
it's not even comparable now you're up
and you're up in like cheap Lamborghini
McLaren range you know with a zero well
you know make it work yeah I remember my
car weighs 3,800 and like 30 pounds it's
got it's a stage one so it's only got
700 horsepower but it's heavy and it's
only 72 thousand dollars all things
consider and though 3,800 pounds for an
American muscle car is nothing I'm
almost positive 200 pounds of it is just
the front seats alone with how heavy
they are with all the leather and the
power and all that stuff I believe it I
believe I pulled it all the C does
Alexis rx 300 that we had once and I
almost couldn't even lift it
I saw heavy us with all the in it
yeah this is it I eat glue says the zo6
overheats in and it does indeed overheat
the co one when Ali does not overheat
but I'm almost positive the car would be
150 pounds lighter if I took out both
front seats and put in like side belt or
Sparco like carbon fiber seats weaving
fiberglass seats I have a lead out
Turkey and locker keys and Turkey seat
in the American automotive the machine
with aluminum keep American we got to do
aluminum now I don't know Alcantara
leather covers we're gonna do Managua we
got our Managua querque race in the seat
number three do it for Dale do it this
later tater chip
jay-j put a mismo sticker on it oh god
no I asked if I put a s we put a Nissan
logo on and if I could ruin our cloud in
our class one with what our GTR guys are
I think some of the guys might notice
it's an engine swap by the way guys yes
I do love
Cletus mcFarland if you realize that's
who I was doing right there please
I love Cletus he is my favorite car
channel by far he's gonna have you know
never driven a 700 horse I'm trying to
think of all the cars that I've driven
everything other than electric car which
is like completely the exception to the
rule and await 1200 pounds more Nick I
mean Jerry in the dry at 70 miles an
hour on the freeway if I put my foot in
it I leave black on the freeway okay
sorry I spend the tires at 70 I have
witnessed that is just like earth moving
toward it's a stupid amendatory you get
spend tires the way I spun tires on my
stock tires 400 Pat roughly 400 pounds
more than my Subaru yeah
which which isn't an insignificant
amount of weight that's a lot of weight
but then when you consider that my car
completely tuned at the top of what it
can do without me wrenching on the
engine I'm putting out 333 horsepower
let me let me go ahead and Basel your
mind a little bit more okay so it's that
heavy of a car which already gives you
more traction right yep it is 70 miles
an hour doing a rolling burnout leaving
leaving black strips on the freeway in
the tire that's 325 millimeters wide
that's a 60 tread wear our compound race
tire Flintstones so I mean it's like
think about that we should put we should
put them like 225 s on the back that's a
bad idea I like driving cars where I can
drive it absolutely at its limit all the
time and not risk death and I feel like
my STI is even maybe even a tiny bit
above where that would be I can't even
imagine how I'd restrained myself with
700 or power I'd probably wouldn't even
tires wouldn't last a week we were
leaving the gym yesterday and we stopped
at Wahoos because you can get like a
like a protein dish there so I've gotten
like jasmine rice and beef and
we were leaving and I forgot that my
wife had a we were in the Camaro and I
forgot that my wife had the like the
both Styrofoam containers sitting on her
lap and I just sent it leaving sideways
she was so pissed she's like unless you
want this to be all over your
Camaro you'll knock that crap off I love
my wife to death but she's not the most
stable person in the passenger seat
meanwhile I already know how to brace
while holding two coffees yes so my wife
bless her heart and yes my wife bless
her heart if you've ever seen like a dog
in the back of a truck that's kind of
how my wife is in the passenger seat
she's sort of just at the mercy of all
of the centrifugal forces it's you're
sliding and slamming part yeah so
basically I took my corner of my eye
just see her like slamming all around in
the passenger seat like hanging on to
dinner for dear life and I looked at her
with this stupid eating grin like

okay so I was taking friends for a ride
so we did our last track our first track
session in the car the next day everyone
kind of came to my house we're hanging
out we're just talking and nobody had
gone for a ride in the car yet cuz I
didn't take him one for right on track
everyone was driving their own cars we
decided to go get boba and on the way
back from boba it's night time all right
it's dark I can't really see I'm first
at the light to turn left and light
turns green and my instructor Steven
Dougherty's in the back seat
yeah he's small out to be ale to
actually sit in the backseat of this
Camaro and my passenger had the seat
pushed forward it's got three people in
this car and basically right as I turned
the wheel and mashed the gas he goes cop
cop cop cop and I didn't see the cop
because we're I have to sit in that car
my left but the a-pillar of the window
blocks all of my 45 degree view out the
window because I sit so far back as I
turn the car and rotate it sideways the
car starts to slide as the cop and I
make eye contact and he's he's his
parked at the like on the left side
waiting to go like the other direction
fortunately he was there busy towing
another car and standing outside of his
car he's like was gonna come Chase me
but basically it was like you hear room
so the cars like sliding sideways and
then suddenly just straightens out with
like a snap as he and I make eye contact
and he gives me the whole like I'm gonna
remember you look I'm gonna remember
this car so literally I've just kind of
drove driven easy around town ever since
that note but I was behind you - oh it
was looking at me because I couldn't
stop my gurgling from my pipe so it's
like okay I'm like we had just had Bobo
so your pipes were gurgling yeah nosey
oh yeah well there's people bitching
about Car Talk
they always do though that's why we do
it it's not original to bitch it's like
if you're a viewer complaining on
YouTube you're actually the norm yeah
you're literally copying other people
get people started quilts stop you being
just like everybody else the bitches I
suddenly want to see J outrun some cops
I cannot run a Motorola I had a really
close call about two weeks ago where I
don't know if I ever took you for a ride
on that really windy road that's near my
house where I mean it's just super super
whitey it's not the one that goes up a
hill but it's one that just you know
there's not a straight spot and then the
entire three miles okay I think that was
probably I'm not gonna say if anyways
I'm dry I died haul ass around that
thing when it's dry and it's late at
night and there's nobody put on my high
beams and just go I come around a corner
and I see some light where I normally
don't see any light but I can't see any
car or anything and I go driving by
probably doing about 45 around a corner
that was a 15 mm-hmm and I look at my
rearview mirror and it's the damn cop
spotlight he was parked back in a bush
like like literally backed his car into
the brush between him and this little
power station thing and he had his
spotlight on he didn't turn it on when I
went by it was already on when I came
around the corner and some little
murdered right spot light so I slowed
down the car I you know start just
waiting for him to basically come he
never did Oh weird never did he was
sitting at the light was shining at me
it wasn't moving maybe he was outside of
the car or something like that but ya
know he had that super-bright a
spotlight shining at me as I was driving
away from him down the road as I went
around the corner and I was like I was
just waiting for him he never he never
did anything I was like yes maybe I
might have been that's a weird place to
try and like nab somebody it was so
weird like it was back it was like in
the brush there was no spot there was no
driveway there was no little parking
space or anything he just wedged his car
back in the brush and I was like Alex
Jacobson says I'll see you at Camaro con
bring in the 87 I Roxy
so yeah Camaro con is actually a week

I'm gonna be one of the featured cars at
the fast tech booth and so you can come

speaking of Camaros oh I hadn't I had a
1990 RS which was at the time it was a 5
liter throttle body injected and then I
had a 92 Camaro z28 which again
unfortunately was a 5.0 because I
couldn't afford a 5.7 so yeah this was
actually my third Camaro but yeah it's
my first alpha body though
a lot of fun I saw you turn on your
voice thing what are you about to do
don't win it noise I was gonna ask when
Camaro calm was cuz goes gonna I was
gonna pimp it for you oh yeah so it's on
it's on Saturday April 28th all right
here we go
come to Camaro con on April what's what
it was chimera Camaro Camaro County
April 28th and it's a it's at the
promenade in Temecula particular it's a
promenade and promenade is he promenade
whatever putting a Mustang piss them off
there will be some most things there I
think man so you got to bring your
mullets and bring your bud the Camaro
come without a mullet wig it's bring
your sister and your wife same person
what what's your guys's first car my
first car was a 1985 fuel-injected Ford
Ranger pickup truck standard cab
standard bed good man first car I was
late to drive or owned like the first
car that like I guess was your car to
drive
oh yeah let's do it let's do both what
was the car that you learned to drive in
like what was the what was the car the X
you got your driver's license ed the 85
Ford Ranger my dad was like you're gonna
drive a stick no it was a it was a
hand-me-down third generation I had a
hand-me-down third generation 85 Ford
Ranger but it worked so Nick what did
you what did you learn to drive in and
then what was the first car you actually
bought the one is the tested was the
2004 Honda Accord okay the one I drove
after the test wasn't 2004 Ford
Expedition oh yeah the friend II jury
testimony actually ran over his friend
with it oh my god he literally the heat
okay so I guess they read read the
people apart you're at the paintball
park and Jake jumps on the side like
swatted rails yeah yeah so we stand on
the side of it like SWAT Nick thinks
it's a good idea to just yank the wheel
and turn real sharp friend falls under
Legos under the back wheel yeah he is
the only guy here that could probably
say he's ran over his friend with a car
but I didn't get paid like all those
memes say like would you run over your
friend for X amount of money like I know
he'll do it for free do it surfers
driver's license
yinsen an expedition has got to run
somebody over and probably not even know
about it it's like a hidden mustang
thing you know people hunting oh it was
probably that it had a little bit of the
Ford blood in there yeah I got that Ford
mixture but after that the first car I
owned was the Volkswagen the 2004 GTI so
the car I took on dates
well because my Ford my Ranger was kind
of like a work in progress is how it
ended up purple on accident did I ever
tell that story no so my dad was like
okay when I was 15 I was joking around
like what car are you gonna buy me when
I'm 16 is like you can have the truck
I'm like haha no really is like no you
can have the truck it had been sitting
with like a blown engine for like a year
cuz mice my sister overheated the crap
out of it one day I was driving home
she's like the car the trucks acting
funny I walk outside there is steam
billowing from under the hood I walk out
there just in time to see her take the
garden hose and start spraying the
engine I'm not even kidding she sprayed
the engine and cracked the block because
it was overheated and she's put cold
water on it so my dad was basically like
if you want a car you'll fix you'll
learn how to fix the Ranger and you'll
drive it as my dad was a computer
programmer he did not have fixed cars he
was like I'll be damned if you're gonna
spend money on fixing cars when like I
have so you're gonna he bought me a
manual and he said I'll buy the parts
you learn how to fix it so my I spent
basically the whole summer before I
turned 16 the next year like rebuilding
the truck and he was like okay so as
your 16th birthday what I'll do is I'll
get the truck painted for you so we went
down to make oh you know like Earl
Scheib get myself my 399 paint job no
clear coat no nothing just paint base
paint what application runs through yeah
I've had to make up a job over I wanted
midnight blue I wanted like a metallic
midnight blue and it was the best shade
the best shade of midnight blue you ever
saw indoors under fluorescent light
outdoor in the Sun the other hand it was
purple so it was royal sapphire metallic
pearl I'll never forget the name because
it was a ford color remember those
purple for two comas yeah it wasn't a
color for it to coma oh yeah I mean tell
you to Toyota Tacoma okay yeah see that
was a problem that was a problem and I
was looking at the the domestic import
coma type r yeah SDM royal sapphire
metallic
you guys can go look it up on Google
right now just see exactly what color
was it kind of looked like the twitch
logo so anyway um I went to pick up the
car drove up into the parking lot and
I'm like hey look that's another Ford
Ranger here someone got theirs painted
purple and I walk in and we walk in and
they're like okay I'm gonna pick up my
truck and he walks me out to that car I
was like no that's not the color I chose
he's like yeah that's the color you
chose he's like this this is the pink
code was like no I wanted midnight blue
he's like yeah this one and so we I'm
like no this is not the color I chose so
we go inside he's like okay well I mean
we can repaint it but you got to wait
like 30 days you have to wait for the
paint to cure they can't just go sanding
it down and repaint it right away I
guess you could if but this is again
Mako we're talking about oh they can hit
it with a garden hose and paint it again
so we walk inside he's like I grabbed a
little color palette and I'm like that's
the one I wanted he's like that's the
one it is I'm like no it's not it's blue
so we walk outside and I then see the
magic of color change when you move from
fluorescent light to sunlight and I was
like oh crap
so in the 30 days or so that I had the
car that my dad was like fine no I'll
pay to get it repainted they were only
on charges like half price to change a
color right
is there a donal prep I guess yeah so
many people told me no keep the color I
ended up keeping it the problem was I
became kind of a laughingstock in high
school as the guy with the purple truck
so I put no-fear stickers on it do you
ever no fear I do I do
okay so was all pink though I had no
fear and it had the skull and everything
it was pretty awesome Wow told bro it
out the bill the only I was missing was
the metal malicious yeah it didn't exist
yet and some motocross bikes in the back
mm-hm
yeah oh yeah did you ever actually use
your truck as a truck it was a two-wheel
drive of course not it had a lift it had
a lift in like 31 inch tires which was
huge on that truck so so I basically
learned how to drive a whole bunch of
cars when I was learning to drive I
drove a 1976 Ford career which was the
smallest truck I think I've ever seen in
my entire life
it was so light that me and my dad
actually were able to pick up the back
of the truck and so my sister could get
under there and put tires underneath it
to set it on so we can do the brakes
because we didn't have a jack that's the
truck that I learned how to drive a
manual in but the vehicle that I drove
that I took the test in was a Ford told
for tourists that was an automatic
because it's always easier to pass your
test an automatic right let's to think
about so I did that and then after that
my my 76 Ford Courier my mom wouldn't
let me drive it because it was a manual
and I was still kind of learning how to
drive manual at the time so she made me
drive her fricken for Chrysler Cordoba
do you remember those oh yeah I know the
Cordova yeah like 20 I think I was like
20 to 22 feet long or something like
that and it had a giant 440 block v8 in
it with two carburetors and it it was
just a beastly beastly car but it just
floated down the road and you never felt
connected to anything it just felt like
you were in a giant boat and just trying
to keep between lines but that's why I
drove until I can start driving the
truck and then I I drove the truck so
much that the master cylinder on it
failed twice now most wrecked both times
so I sold it to dude for I think I like
150 bucks like it didn't get much for
and then I got a ranger to except for
mine was a 19 I think mine was a 1989
Ford redirect so that's a little bit
more square front end yes
aggressive-looking yeah exactly onion
chat says this whole show has been car
talk come on guys you're almost 40 let
go to this midlife crisis of racing cars
I'd like to point out he doesn't have an
actual profile picture because he knows
he'll get wrecked if he shows his face
and check oh he's one of those guys that
get puts on his old trench coat and
certain two cars are in it for life dude
why don't you stop playing with your
computers man you're not a kid you know
what's funny I have been noticing that a
lot lately that the people they come on
Twitter and wanna like talk you
always click on their profile it's
literally just a new profile with some
random name no avatar and the tweets are
to you I mean at least we put ourselves
out there and we don't hide anything
like all these people that come and talk
 to you they do it behind anonymity
because they can't actually take the
heat that will come back their way yeah
don't be a if you want to be a
dick be a dick to my face that's that's
the best way to do it so one wants to
know what your shirt says appreciate his
shirt says cancer what does it say
it's my it's my brand-new shirt I just
put up on the shop today so sell them
wares so if you guys hate cancer buy my
shirts there you go now to be fair Nick
is only 26 turning 27 in June he looks
31 turning 37
oh thanks Terry
you should send the shapes his face like
when Ashley shaves he looks like he's 12
I could get those happy meals I'm
curious so let's ask a question if no if
nobody knows in chat how old I am who
who looks younger me or J oh shut up
see this oness I just when it's obvious
younger now because he can't win
daughters of course I'm gonna have gray
hair and I'm your friend that's where
the roughness comes from dude all this
praise you dude oh great
oh all that gray shut up see in the
light but no it's oh shut up you have
less gray than I did at 13 I'm not the
Silver Fox that you're becoming but I'm
getting there
you know what's what's kind of
entertaining though is is watching the
people in chat that try to contribute to
car talk but they have no car knowledge
I mean that's okay we all started with
no knowledge but it's like don't offer
opinions if you don't know car stuff
Jerry as older looks younger hey Jerry
alright did you learn all kinds of
I don't know I mean go for a drive stick
though like was it your dad touchy uh
yeah my dad taught me when I was about
15 years old okay you have that up up me
yeah is that in the Ford Ranger had four
I had a four-speed in it and the clutch
pedal didn't feel like it was attached
to anything I said you have that up on
me because his dad taught him Jake
taught me how to drive stick
Oh but he said it wasn't the dead I know
they're talking to each other yeah
that was the only thing my dad ever did
that was actually like nice you know
what I'm connect you know what I think
is really ironic is the amount of people
in chat that say I look older than I am
I can see my analytics I can see how old
my average viewer is and the sad part is
most of the people are older than me
like believe it or not okay so yeah and
I ain't exactly attracting the 16 year
old female gamer viewer right you could
be if they're into it but my 65 and
older female viewership is like 11% rap
videos that would change but no it's
like it's like I don't understand why so
many people get so caught up so caught
up on like the age and thing if yeah I
got gray hair and I look a little bit
rough around the edges but if you knew
me when I was like
really really big trust me I would take
this body over that body any day you
know who else has great hair but still
really a lot young engineering explained
but you don't like the way he talks he
explain stuff mmm it's just too slow
yeah yeah yeah I mean he's he doesn't
look that old to me though I don't think
he's that old I just I just don't like
his talking mannerism I don't mind it
well cuz you to talk the same Oh
[Laughter]
I'm looking at my court demographic by
month in this month it's 25 to 34 is
that the number of viewers he did I
couldn't help it that what was set up
too perfectly
oh don't forget you have to upload
videos to get viewers and he subs if you
lost today those are the other brethren
a couple agreed a smile well it's
usually when I'm moderating he loses
subs doesn't wield the banhammer he hits
the band nuke as what he does there's a
lot of collateral damage at times I've
actually heard Nick be like oops I been
I accidently banned him and then it's
like Oh cannon ooh
because it disappears so niggas banned
innocent people on accident to warrior
which also it's like oh just make it
easy like create a little list and just
keep it for the show so you can go back
and unbanned them for whatever reason if
you how I supposed to keep a list
especially when it
they're usually fake accounts with like
a bunch of numbers and stuff there's I
remember one time there's a guy who made
like 10 accounts that whole hour and
just came off
I kept banning him over and over it you
know even if he has a script to make the
account it's still faster for you to
click hide user than it is for him to
script a new gmail account yeah you know
what I don't understand is they now
require to create a gmail account which
is what they were predominately using to
create the YouTube accounts rapidly
right they now verify it with an actual
phone number and an SMS message so these
people that are creating these accounts
and you can't do it with the same number
or I think you're limited to like five
accounts or something you can do with
the same okay I have three and yeah
the same account yeah so it's like after
because after a certain amount it just
tells you that you can't do you have to
use a different number so I'm like are
these guys actually going out and using
some script that's using one of those
like online SMS services and I mean they
it seems like they're going through a
lot of work to create a fake account
just to come back and say snarky
well if they spent as much time like
actually accomplishing something as they
put in trying to hate on people they
might actually be something you know
more than just you know sorry sack of
 that's miserable in their own skin
yeah well the good news is they don't
bug me as much now that I figured out
that I just saying I had literally had
sand for my mangina I know I got octor
to pull some sand me and Jenna and I'm
doing better now this question all-time
text says I'm going to get my first car
this year and my dad is making me buy it
myself I'm currently looking at either
in 1988 Mazda rx-7 for 4,500 based on
240 SX s 13 for 5,800 what should I get
that's still there's tax on the s
professor 13 though but it's you don't
have to worry about APEC seals dude
rotary yeah rotary engines you can just
eat through those and you don't want
your first card each at a house and what
he doesn't mention though is the
condition of either of these cars it's
40 man it doesn't matter if it's been on
fire before it'll be fine you just
popping LS and go yeah I can't even tell
you like so so the sanctioning like body
of the of the time attack group that we
do with a Nissan challenge like the
actual like company owned cars and s 13
and I can't even tell you how many times
they've just like use duct tape to keep
that thing on track and it still goes
and puts down good time just put duct
tape like on the door seals just like
push air along it and stuff like that
wait wow this is really technical but it
works you know yeah let's take the place
where I got my dye notes you done on my
car there shot there their shop car that
they have that's they call it
Frankenstein because they just use it
for testing motors and drive trains and
everything 240 yeah just stand there
because they said they can literally
throw any motor into it and like 24 de
is much better that's what the S 13 has
for the shop is a cage one yeah the
problem is they sound like ass like with
the exhaust that they have on that one
though with that header oh it's just
like painful you would yeah
is life I do like rotary don't get me
wrong I love rotary engines I'm just
saying for our first car they burn
loads of oil no matter what a state of
repair they're in and they they're just
not they're not good first cars TDS J
have you driven mg cars do I look like I
could fit in an mg not fit an mg I've
been in an mg before and just to prove I
could fit in one and I got stuck because
my body like cramped so it was a
convertible obviously and the
convertible top was down and it was that
was like 70s mg so it looked like a
little like little stink bug with a
convertible top and the top was down or
I'm sorry up so I kind of couldn't like
basically turned into a compulsion is to
get in it you sit like this but then I
got in it and I contorted in just such a
way that I cramped up and I couldn't get
out and the thing was it was when I was
working and doing custom stars car
stereo installs and I was the only one
at the shop at the time I got stuck in
the car
someone came out and saw me what his
name was Clinton he was a complete ass
he was the shop the shop manager we got
along but he was just an ass he came out
saw me and was started laughing and then
walked away now like now I'm stuck I
can't get out he left me there for like
10 minutes while I went to the bathroom
and then he came back and let the top
down well I got payback because we
summer in SoCal is hot and Jerry's been
here during the summer it's always it's
always hot there think it's nice D hot
so the the install bays that we had were
not air-conditioned so we had the big
roll-up doors right think of how hot
like a tire shop would look it was like
that but car stereo installs and he was
doing a custom setup inside like a 66 or
65 Impala and the trunks in that thing
are huge like a massively huge like I
could fit three of my bodies in the
trunk they used it as Dee derby cars
because of that now the guy was really
like skinny and linky and it wasn't that
tall he was like five seven five eight
so I guess he was laying down in there
and everyone else was like inside the
shop eating lunch or inside the store
eating lunch in the shop I thought no
one was there so I didn't want anyone to
take anything out of the trunk is he had
like expensive like amps and stuff
sitting there yeah and it was facing the
street so I walked by and just shut the
trunk just don't you know cars back in
the 60s like that there's a reason why
mobsters would carry people around in
the trunk it's not like today where
there's a little panic pull tab where
you can pull the wire and have the Trump
pop open let's just say about 25 minutes
later we're all sitting inside the shop
going
where the hell's Clinton where the hell
is Clinton we're calling his cell it's
ringing in the shop were like oh he
doesn't have a phone we're like thinking
maybe he's in the shoe
he's not in the like I don't
know maybe he walked down to like Arby's
or something down the street a half an
hour or so later I am from when I shut
the trunk we go out into the shop we
hear yeah he's just banging on this
thing I'm like oh he's in the trunk
I pop the trunk he looks like he stepped
out of the shower level of sweat right
he basically sits up and he goes I'm
gonna kill you and let's just say
he was like it was one of those like
you're not gonna know wind you're not
gonna know how good I am gonna get you
back I know he never got me back as a
company when I had business like a month
later oh so yeah anyway that was pretty
good you got you good fella's him I
didn't know he was in the trunk it
wasn't intentional is unintentional yeah
Jay what exhaust you got on what mine is
mine is Melissa hmm I said look at him
he's a drop of the whole two cars plural
thing Oh which which car no truck I got
the sienna oh I got the Camaro I got the
new Z well the Sienna stock no for now
why he put an exhaust on I remember I
wanted to the day we bought it you
should totally do the t's on it still
the the 370z has a motor die a full
motor dying set up so it's motor dying
test pipes with a motor dane shock wave
motor dying shock wave TDX are true dual
exhaust on it which is really loud and
then the Camaro it's actually all stock
exhaust except for a muffler delete well
has all four cats in it and still has
that volume level wait I get the long
tube headers on the truck mm-hmm did you
put the did you put an exhaust on the
truck yeah it doesn't Magnaflow okay
that's cool yeah let's go gonna say I
thought I thought that sounded pretty
burly what's that loud it's just a
Magnaflow with with a catback and that's
still I don't even think it's three-inch
I think it's tuned three-quarters it's
not very loud ladies oh the camp rose
with you making a silly smile and
where's the tech where's the tech you
got any checks you want to talk about
Jay um yeah rise into our second
generation launched I know nobody cares
by that name these four four people
I got an overclocking video going live
tomorrow about it oh here's a good
question for you what do you think
if the AMD guy running over to Intel to
help them make an integrated graphics
thing we tell about Raja Patel yes he
was pushed out of AMD he didn't run to
Intel he was pushed out of AMD Oh was he
that's that's the story I got through
some sources that are close to the
subject but not authorized to comment an
interesting that was like that's like
late last year news dude no no it's
probably it's because whatever project
he's been working on probably finally
came to fruition but he this was like
late last year he remember he went on
sabbatical right after Vega Losh
remember the fiasco with Vega and the
whole discount pricing and the retail
rebate and all that and everyone was mad
about Vega because it looked like a
bait-and-switch with price he left
during that and he went on sabbatical
and then in December he announced that
he was leaving AMD and then like the
week later it was like Raja patellas now
at an Intel I mean that's not really
it's not really that new it's gross
thing well I died just hold on here uh
always the same guy that rot Raja right
yeah hurry okay dorri I'm sorry see
Patel that's a Roger Roger yeah it's
it's the same guy but there is yeah it's
making rounds again cuz I mean the the
article that I have here was from eleven
nine so yeah about a half a year ago
yeah I came here I told you it was like
December was was when it was all kind of
like official but oh I can't believe
they put that's interesting so they
pushed him out and Intel scooped him up
rumor has it that there were choices
that he made that put AMD in a spot to
where they couldn't compete with Nvidia
based on the price point because Vega 56
in Vega 64 are great and just kind of
like raw power especially when they're
leveraged in in very certain
circumstances but the problem is the
price of HBM and at the time only
samsung was making the memory hynek's
hadn't come online yet they were losing
money on every single graphics card that
got sold basically so that's why you saw
those bundle deals where you could buy
it at a discounted price if you got like
a motherboard in a processor and all
that and even got like $300 off like a
free sync monitor or whatever that was
the only they could make money on it
because they had to kind of pick up the
slack with the other parts that still
had actual
our cup and had some you know points of
profit in there but the problem the
problem was the Vega 56 and 64 came out
and it was a it was a power-hungry card
it was hot it took lots of power it just
didn't compete in the gaming realm which
is where let's face it the majority of
cards that are sold are at least not so
much today but back then we're all about
gaming and they just didn't compete very
well with the gtx 1070
well the 1070 atti came out of the 56
anyway in 1070 TI came out and slid into
that $50 price gap so then within the
range of a hundred and fifty dollars you
had three graphics cards to choose from
and NVIDIA and all of which gave better
power to performance ratios and overall
better FPS than anything being offered
by Vega so Vega launched and just wasn't
competitive if you can even get your
hands on it so because of all of that
and because Raja was you know the whole
CEO or chief operating officer whatever
was for Radeon division yeah rumor has
it he was squeezed out and then Lisa sue
became the interim like CEO for that
division and then they brought in a new
guy gotcha I'm trying to find there's
it's actually not that guy this is this
is something even more recent I'm trying
to name but it was he was he's joining
the Raja guy he was another graphics guy
from AMD and I'm trying to find his name
right now I wouldn't be surprised if
Raja I would say hey I know a guy well
the blonde we need to grow our team so
the interesting part here's the tech
guys the hope you're happy open up your
ears it's one of those things where
because this is in Texas right Austin is
where AMD is is based and the question
of non-compete clause or comes into you
know question right cuz it normally go
to a you go to look for a giant tech
company like this and you're some sort
of an exec or even an engineer or even a
mid-level manager there's usually in
your contract as a lot of these
positions although are at-will working
states they still have a contract and
the contract states stuff like that like
non-compete you can't leave our company
to go and work for a competitor within a
certain amount of time right five years
ten years whatever maybe there's three
at Microsoft Bay I was three-year
non-compete
yeah so whatever it whatever it was in
the contract the thing was within within
one week to the next Raja was still on
paid sabbatical
from AMD next thing you know he's at
Intel for what I understand is they're
really hard to enforce like here in
California here in California some
people try it as well but it's easy to
wiggle out of it like it's yeah easy to
enforce the other thing is if AMD forced
them out I don't know if there's another
clause in there that states like you
can't force someone out and be like you
can't work in your field anymore you
know yeah I don't know I I don't think
that I think there that's why it's so
easy to combat and work against but in I
looked over my contract cuz I had to do
an exit interview and they laid me off
for Microsoft right and in the contract
it said that my non-compete doesn't
matter if they lay me off or fire me
that I'm not allowed to work in that
specific field of the industry because
they're afraid that you're gonna bring
trade secrets over right so now Oh Dow
Family Guy it's Chris hook Oh Chris hook
uh-huh so Chris hook you know it's April
11th updated he said okay you seen your
directory I'm glad you said that okay
yeah do you guys remember in chat
longtime viewers do you remember when I
put out my video talking about the Vega
pricing issue and I basically was like
here's what AMD told me they called me
late at night on a Sunday night because
I put out those tweets saying if they're
doing bait-and-switch I'm pricing I'm
not gonna work with AMD anymore and then
I said a source called me and was like
hey AJ this is the way it's happening we
know we understand the the the public is
mad and I'm gonna explain the back-end
pricing and I'm gonna explain the you
know what they call it the activating of
being able to sell it at standard MSRP
without the bundles and all that it was
Chris hook Chris hook is the one who
called me the thing was at the time I
had to say that I couldn't name him as a
source because he would get in trouble
but the bottom line is Chris hook is the
one that called me at 11:30 8:00 at
night on a Sunday to talk about this
because that's the level of bombardment
AMD was after so Chris hook was the guy
who called me he's the ball guy
according to this he left of his own
accord and it says that there's
speculation that he's joining Raja at
Intel for the discrete GPU and so when I
put out my video saying my source is
rock-solid it does not get any more
solid than my source was and people were
calling me like oh you're full of
you don't have a rock-solid source it
was Chris hook it doesn't get
much higher in Radeon at that point so
yeah
so they're losing bad their dough so
they're losing they're losing some power
here then this higher up guy in the am d
graphics division and he's picked up by
Intel - wow this is weird because you'd
think that if two high-ranking officers
AMD went and worked at a competitor not
not only just a competitor but working
on arguably the same technology at the
competitor that competes directly with
what they were doing but you think they
would push some lawyers at that and make
a big fuss maybe but I mean let's look
at it this way - AMD CPU divisions doing
pretty damn well the last two years yeah
the Radeon side not so well not so good
I mean when's the last time you saw a
new Radeon card before that what was the
last time you saw a new Radeon card it
was the RX series the rx 517 580 and
then five sixty and all that which was
just a generational refresh of the RX
470 480 which came out a year and a half
before that so you're not seeing these
consistent you're not seeing these
consistent new cards and new
technologies being pumped out as I say
new technologies loosely because they
ain't because NVIDIA has now been using
for two straight years the same Pascal
architecture but at least they're
putting out improvements and stuff on
that card you have a huge stack to
choose from Radeon if your exact and
that if you're an exec in that company
right yeah a high end execs execs and
companies like this they get huge
performance incentives and bonuses and
stuff and if you're not selling if
you're not making any money in that
division as an executive you're not
making any money either you might have
your base pay but then you're probably
on the chopping block every single time
you go to some damn staff meeting or
some sort of exec meeting right probably
a lot of fingers being pointed around a
lot of people you know biting each
other's heads off I've no doubt that
that's what it's like in the radion
division right now in the executive team
so it makes no it doesn't surprise me
one bit that he moved over to Intel
because Intel is still trying to bolster
its internal graphics it's trying to
compete with NVIDIA which is why they
teamed up with AMD for the new mobile
CPUs with built-in Vega graphics in an
Intel CPU which pissed off in video 2 it
went you know what though I'm thinking
this I mean this is highly speculative
but I'm thinking it out and it actually
could work it might be possible the
Intel is is poising itself - by AMD's
graphics Division I using Scouts I don't
think so I don't think so why by the
division when you can just breathe
no no but the same had happened yeah in
Microsoft it's not uncommon for a
company to actually hire the higher up
executives if they're behind the scenes
trying to work a deal before they make
it public so that those people basically
come over and make the merger smoother
but I don't think that I don't think
they have any interest in buying radion
if they believe that Radeon is a ship
with a hole in it right now just just
bring that just bring the intelligence
that's all they're gonna want
oh no but I but all that all the tooling
and all the technology and everything is
what they would want I mean big
companies buy shitty companies all the
time just literally just to adopt their
name in there but do you think until it
really has to retool big enough to
warrant trying to buy all of their
tooling factories and stuff sucks that
they don't do anything in the GPU space
set for the integrated graphics stuff
which is absolute garbage I think Intel
this is one area they don't have
strength okay how about this which is
cheaper than do you think buying Radeon
which you know AMD is not gonna want to
give up for pennies on the dollar
they're gonna try and get 14 or 15 bucks
for it I mean obviously yes at least two
Starbucks worth if if your Intel let's
look at it this way if your Intel which
do you think is cheaper to just bring
over the talent and then spend your own
capital on the tooling or paying for the
talent and the company from your
competitor who knows they're gonna you
know they're gonna want to they're gonna
want to shark the value of the company
sure so which do you think is cheaper
buying the company outright or getting
enticing the talent and tooling it
yourself
I missed their business management
management major let's hear it are we
thinking short term or long term versus
long term well okay so I think long term
you could get get the the staff get the
Intel you don't have to get the assets
that go with you Intel yeah whatever
you're cool you know what I'm talking
about be like get the employees cuz yep
they're gonna build you up to that
future ROI instead of buying the assets
and everything to get the like short
term ROI and then losing at the long end
so but it doesn't have a foothold for
GPU stuff AMD does well they don't
before all but they much more than Intel
does wouldn't they want
the name isn't the name important here
having the name Radeon having the name
AMD graphics or ever it's no I don't
think right now AMD Radeon graphics has
the sweetest flavor amongst yeah I think
the enthusiasts I think it's kind of a
coin to us because you're gonna get the
the diehards like oh I want this because
ATI Radeon is backing it but then you're
gonna want the the cutting-edge adopters
like hey perfect example how many times
have you seen people be like god I
remember when radium was good when ATI
owned them right so radians name
unfortunately ever since AMD has
acquired them it's been tarnished and
diluted yeah no I can agree with that I
was just thinking that it's it's well in
the I guess I guess the other thing I'm
not really taking into account here's
Intel might not have a huge game when it
comes to graphics but they are a huge
name I mean they are a household name
right so if they suddenly came out
swinging and said oh we're now making
graphics you know hardware that can
compete with Nvidia they'd be fine
standing on their own they wouldn't they
wouldn't need an intermediate to
basically make that look juicier than it
is I so don't think Intel you know what
AMD's help is gonna be able to compete
with in videos mobile graphics they're
max-q oh I don't want to rant about that
for a second we're gonna go Jays rant 30
are you ready do a grind your gears when
I was at Computex last year they and you
were with me during this gen son gets up
in this little polished leather jacket
and talks about the max Q 1080 and what
a great cpr GPU it is and mobile
computing uses blah blah blah less power
and yadda yadda yadda prior to that
Jerry you know this they were putting
nine ATMs inside of laptops right we
have as a mobile variant I have one the
only reason even shared the name 980 is
because it was basically the designator
to say it's the highest end mobile chip
but it shared nothing in common with the
standard 980 No then much more like a
hot minute they put full-size 980 chips
inside of GPUs after the 980 TI was
already out I mean in the laptops after
the 980 I was already out yeah then they
came out and put full-blown GTX 1080
which again was 170 watch ship graphics
inside of laptops I've got one I've got
one downstairs
Brian has one right there
powerful but they're still a bit hot and
they're in big ways big giant jassi's
and stuff so in video was touting how
efficient Pascal was and how amazing it
is for mobile gaming and stuff and how
the M variant doesn't need to be a thing
anymore then they changed the name of
the M and call it max q and do the same
damn thing
it's a 1070 that's slower than a regular
1070 and in max-q 1080 that's only about
the speed of a GTX 1060 you know six gig
so it's one of those things where it's
like an idiot pulls that again
where they just changed the name to make
you think it's something better than it
was but they're back to the whole mobile
platform mobile graphics chip again and
just calling it something different and
so that's a rant of mine but anyway
Segway throttling problems too with the
with the full-blown chips in the laptop
chassis that's up to the manufacturer of
the laptop it depends on the type of
cooling I mean in video is very strict
on the level of cooling that it has to
be there also very strict with Max Q
like there are hands-on big time and
have to approve the chassis they'll
bring the chassis and they'll do all the
testing like let's say Sager dynamics or
whoever makes it MSI NVIDIA has to get
hands-on with it and approve it to be a
max cube it doesn't if it doesn't get
the approval that usually we'll put like
a full size 10 70 or whatever in there
but to segue into my other my other
problem here is this Tech Talk is to
teknon an FPS so anyway my point being
even the Vega graphics that I would
expect to see inside of a mobile CPU
although you could probably get MacBook
Air sized laptops that are capable of
playing you know 1080p medium to low
settings 60 FPS I still don't think
they're gonna compete with intel enough
to entice gamer mobile buyers to buy
that because they're still not doing
like with the Intel Partnership they're
not doing discrete graphics with Intel
remember they're taking the Vega core
like we're seeing with the 2400 G and
the 2200 G and then putting that into a
mobile chip so it doesn't need a
discrete graphics card so you can get
the ultra thin ultra lightweight keep
you know basically your Microsoft
Surface 2 level of laptop that can
actually play games right so it's a
whole different market and I have I have
a
that that's what intel's trying to build
up by getting guys like raja and chris
hook and all that yeah and plus i think
if they if they did it right i think
they actually have like a really
sporting chance of creating something
that can compete with the discrete
graphics cards without having to be
discrete but AMD still has to improve
that that power draw from Vega well
again if Intel doesn't buy them then
Intel's good with power and Intel's got
power game on lockdown compared to the
other companies so as long as they can
get the guys from AMD to come in with
some of the information on how to how
their graphics processing stuff works
I'm sure Intel could like fix that
overnight I don't know why AMD is having
such a problem it could just be a matter
of like technology maturity to I mean
Intel just has more money to throw at
the problem and probably has better
equipment that makes better and more
consistent dies and AMD just doesn't
can't can't compete on that level for
the longest time
AMD was like two generations behind
Intel in the CPU side they are
significantly farther back than that on
the Radeon graphics side nothing about
Vega how about like their their
mainstream like the rx stuff yeah I
guess arc of Vega is what they call it
like the 585 70 I mean they're still
significantly behind where that's barely
competing with like 980 and 980ti stuff
so I don't know I guess time will tell
but anyway um well I guess the way we
end the show with the tech that was
weird
yeah way to go that makes almost no
sense all of it was just BS I know I
don't talking about and a lot of what I
said there is definitely speculation so
I mean there is that but anyway we don't
for sure Chris Huck's going to Intel but
I would bet on him going to Intel it
doesn't was a he was a pretty high-end
like marketing guy there he was pretty
he was pretty high up like if you got
information from Chris it was it was
solid yeah it said senior director of
global product marketing show the cake
let me see it oh my god look they got
Nick a cake it's a Hello Kitty birthday
cake are they edible kitties are they
ring the ring
I don't want no I'll give you a ring
guys we're gonna go if you just joined
us watch a beginning of the show I talk
about why NIC is leaving basically nick
has a very unique set of skills and
talents yeah so know Nick is Nick is
pursuing other opportunities actually
allow him to use his education that
wasn't cheap know if it doesn't work out
you'll probably find a way to weasel
back on the show hey Jake one last thing
though make sure before you let him go
that he signs a no-compete you can't go
realistic actually go to Linus you
Greenwich you brought me to Linus please
you don't be funny is it you see him on
Austin's channel like in a week I would
actually write you a letter
recommendation for any channel you would
like to be I don't believe you like you
just have that you have that grin on
your face like this is gonna be good oh
yeah I'll text him in like 90 days you
be like so how's the new guy working no
hey Jerry let me know when you get a car
tour car gasm going again our chasm with
me for a Subway sandwich jeans leave my
garage with the super it's he's I'm
gonna pay for the sandwich he has one of
those like buy one get one fries yeah
you sleep in the Subaru how about that
even better you can sleep in the because
you can't have the car in the garage and
you in the garage at the same time
adding moss on it though it would
probably be pretty soft and comfy I
probably would have cleaning it sooner
or later dude it's so gross now the
paint the paint literally just blow on
it and it comes off so I need to get
that thing wrapped well you gotta get
the paint fixed before you wrap it no
I'm just gonna spray I'm just I'm just
gonna say oh yeah I'll wrap it just wrap
it the wind rapid the way it is don't
listen to it better yet connects to dip
it I thought about doing that I'm not
gonna tackle that though you that
up it's pain in the ass I don't I don't
want to mess with it yeah anyway guys
will still see Nick around here and
there he's still gonna contract and do
some stuff you know that we need when
when we need it but now I've got to
figure out where he put everything
because he's the one that moved
everything around the store in the story
a scavenger hunt as my going-away gift
yeah and apparently he swaps candy bars
- that's the game I gotta play now is
ice which cable goes to which PSU and go
will it fry alright guys I'm running
that outro alright thank you for a stung
by Tex out number 158 instead go away we
just can't handle him anymore so he's
gonna go work for some drug dealers in
Southern California so yeah money's
money it doesn't matter if it's a nickel
or a quarter money's money go to the
cons is no Wi-Fi in the club no I find
the doctor later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
