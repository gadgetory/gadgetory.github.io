there had been quite the trend over who
could make the bigger case you've got
the 800 d you've got the 900 d behind me
you've got this switch 810 and then the
820 and then you've got you know the
half stacker you've got a lot of
ginormous cases out there on the market
so if you're one of those people who
find yourself looking for a small case
even smaller than micro ATX you've got
an ITX format right here from fractal
design and this is the node 304 we're
going to ahead and take a look at the
304 front throw a few components in
there and see what we've got in the
inside
now the model they sent me is the white
edition which I am a huge fan of white
cases if you follow me long enough you
know you have a switch eight ten in
white I now have a nine hundred D in
black but I really like white cases that
contrary to popular belief some people
think that they get dirty faster if you
ask me they hide the dust a lot better
than black
I mean dust is generally gray in color
so but anyway in the packaging here as
you can see we've got very nice and
sealed plastic package you've got the
hardware manual here it is available in
black and white
look at this thing this is just this is
hot looking I really like this taking a
look at the front of the case here
you've got a nice smooth finish it's all
powder coated white it's nice and glossy
you have on the side here where your
graphics card goes you do have a vent
this one here unfortunately is there we
go pop that a little bit in
transportation as you can see it popped
right back in on the back you've got a
single 140 millimeter exhaust fan and
you do have your PCI Express expansion
slots here that can accommodate a dual
slot card and on the other side here you
just have a nice vent here to allow more
airflow and then for the fans on the
front you have a vent right here on the
top on the side here you have your USB
3.0 your power switch and you have your
headphone and microphone jack and then
your LED is right here next to the
fractal design emblem on the front now
the case comes apart with four thumb
screws and it comes apart all in one
piece they're not individual sides it's
more or less a shell so as you can see
here it comes off as one shell
set that aside
and you can see you have nice easy
access to all sides of the case now the
front of the case literally just pulls
right off which gives you access easy
access here to the 92 millimeter fan
filters there but what I think is really
cool is the way that the hard drives
mount in this thing so because you're
dealing with as you know very tight
spaces the hard drive actually the hard
drives mount on top of everything and
just suspend down into the case
so the pieces pop out they are steel and
they can accommodate either two three
and a half inch drives or two SSD or two
and a half inch drives for each base you
could theoretically have two four six
hard drives in this case now other than
that there's not really a whole lot to
say about it I mean all of the fan
cables are sleeved and if you are not if
you don't need to have all of these hard
drive cages in here you could
theoretically remove all but the ones
that you need and have even more airflow
and if you wanted to go full water
cooling loop in this you could do that
and removing these would give you even
more space and support on the inside for
installing such components now in true
fractal design form you do have all
black sleeves cable and because the
power supply in this mount sideways they
give you a power supply extension cable
that is included here it's all twisted
up with the rest of the cables there so
this plugs into the back of your power
supply and then it's an extension that
goes onto the back of the case here so
that you can plug in power the case is
very sturdy in fact it's pretty much the
way it's put together is just front top
and bottom and it's all riveted together
and because the cover here is all one
piece when you screw that in it gives it
even more rigidity but I really like the
form factor of this case in fact so much
that I'm going to be putting my z87 I
gaming motherboard which is an ITX
motherboard in this case here in doing a
build in this here in the near future so
make sure you check out that on my
channel so if you're looking for a
really unique really small but fun
format here for a mini ITX build
definitely check out the fractal node
304 it's a very solid case in fact I'm
very impressed with the build quality of
this and I can't wait to do a build in
this I've wanted to do a mini ITX build
for a long time and this is going to be
the perfect case for that
can't wait to get started on that so
guys it's been Jays two cents what do
you think of this case do you think that
this is the unique design how do you
like the way the hard drives mount on
this and give me your thoughts as always
if you like this video you know what to
do either get a thumbs up or a thumbs
down share it with your friends if you
think this may fit something that
they're looking for and as always I will
see you guys next time on Jays two cents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
