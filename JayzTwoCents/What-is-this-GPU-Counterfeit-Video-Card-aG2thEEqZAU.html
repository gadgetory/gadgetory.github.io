I was at LTX 2018 a fan came up to me
and handed me these graphics cards and
said hey you want to make a video about
trying to fix these and I was like
what's wrong with them and basically he
was like they're those Chinese knockoff
brands and I was like oh okay well
challenge accepted and I feel like a
jerk I forgot your name I want to say
Craig but I don't think that's right but
you know who you are
so anyway we're gonna try out both these
cards and see if we can't make them
actually work I fully expect this to be
a failure but yeah anyway good content
hopefully nonetheless this card
literally literally looks like it has
rust on it shopping for a case from when
you build what do you looking for
I want something designed for water
cooling fractal design to find us all
the way check it out plenty of airflow
plenty of open interior for water
cooling radiator support it even has
mounts for your reservoirs I don't have
enough room for my hard drives okay
fractal design r5 look at all those hard
drive cages and you can fit your
radiators and water cooling in here no I
got a lot of hard drives but I also have
an e ATX motherboard okay I'm gonna try
something here okay bear with me you
might wanna stand clear I never actually
tried this before
yeah it worth fractal design to find r6
you can fit all your radiators a
crap-ton of hard drives and if it's a
ATX did this is perfect
nailed it okay so both these cards are
fairly old generations this one's
actually labeled geforce gtx 500 series
high-speed gd-r gd-r five memory with
the arrow pointing to I guess where the
memory would be like in their Fermi 2.0
GPU inside yeah
GPUs usually go inside the card but
check this out this is actually a galaxy
card but it's got this flip down fan so
that you could actually clean the
heatsink so this isn't actually really a
Chinese knockoff
but it definitely has a used secondhand
who knows what it's been through card
but this is galaxy before they changed
our name to Galax this card here he said
basically it will run for about 30
seconds and then shut off and I just
completely die no signal anymore so I'm
expecting this to probably be cooler
related this one is completely
unidentifiable this this is straight-up
a knockoff fake Nvidia card I mean look
even the stickers are crooked this
actually looks like those Arctic fans
likely because you could actually buy
aftermarket
Arctic coolers that's what this looks
like the PCB is like completely warped
so here's the thing with this card he
says it works perfectly fine if you just
let the basic VGA driver do its thing
like if windows detects it and installs
a VGA driver then it's fine but as soon
as you install any sort of Nvidia driver
then the card just completely stops
working so I need to see if I can't try
and maybe gpu-z
to see if this card has any sort of
identification but this is going to be
the hard one I think so we're gonna
start with what I think's easy and that
being the 550 ti now before I start
tearing into it I obviously need to kind
of verify the the issues so I mean I I
halfway expect this to just suddenly
work fine which always seems to be the
case right you have a problem with your
car you take it to the mechanic it
doesn't do it for the mechanic but the
second you drive away the problem comes
back I kind of expect that to be the
case here
I mean he did say that this card worked
for about 30 seconds I'm gonna turn this
off I'm gonna see if the other card will
work but if this one doesn't work then
I'll plug in another graphics card wipe
the driver entirely and try from there
but I really don't think I'm gonna get
either of these cards to work oh my god
listen to that it sounds like a
lawnmower oh holy crap that is so bad oh
we have a signal though so let me stop
you right there because if you look
closely Phil noticed while editing this
video that it popped up on the screen
momentarily and identifies as a GTX 650
Ti keep that in mind because I can
promise you this is not a 650 Ti and it
will all sort of make sense later but
yeah back to the show it's actually
booting okay so obviously the driver
didn't like fully apply which is why
we're seeing this crazy a scaling but
that's good as long as it doesn't try to
reinstall its own driver right now I'm
fine with that which it shouldn't
because we are not hooked up to the
Internet I want to see if I do have a
GPU Z on here derp and on GPU Z on here
crap so I guess I'm gonna have to plug
in the internet so GPU Z is a very
important tool that I use that anyone
that does anything with graphics card
testing and stuff should download GPU Z
because it will tell you everything
it'll tell you BIOS versioning it will
tell you it will identify the core if it
actually can be identified and that is
what we want so because I mean oh it
just tried to install the driver on its
own which I thought might happen once we
plug in the so it's doing exactly what
he said it would as soon as the seasoned
Nvidia driver black screen so the way
I'm getting rid of the display driver
and just trying to get everything
working from scratch which is by the way
the very first line of repair I always
tell people to do when they are dealing
with graphics issues is completely wipe
all traces of the driver and start from
scratch remember when you install nvidia
drivers and even if you click clean
install there's various things that will
overwrite there's some files that leaves
in place and just writes on
of the CDU or display driver uninstaller
will remove every trace of the driver
and give you a clean start so that's one
of the things we're gonna do right now I
want to get to the point to where we're
just with the basic VGA driver so that
we can see what's happening is what I
think might be happening with this
graphics card is I think it might be
lying as to what it is which means that
the driver is installing because windows
are Nvidia is doing its driver check and
it's like oh yeah this I this hardware
is identified as the yada yada and so
we're gonna go ahead and install it and
then it doesn't work because the driver
is not driving it properly because it
thinks it's one thing and it's actually
another so display driver uninstaller is
pretty simple download it update it
because it will check for updates it
recommends that you do this in safe mode
we're doing it in the regular desktop I
just do the clean and restart option
it's gonna create a restore point and
then it's gonna remove the driver and
reboot and then when it reboots it is
going to go right into the standard VGA
mode I'm also gonna uninstall or remove
our network cable that way we do not
deal with it auto installing again
because the next thing we're gonna try
and do here is actually disable the auto
driver install function built into
Windows alright so if you want to stop
Windows from or from installing drivers
on its own you can just basically go
into the search type in advanced system
settings or is it view advanced system
settings right there go to the hardware
tab go down here to device installation
settings and then switch that from yes
recommended to know your device might
not work as expected now I wouldn't
leave this on by default all the time
because this means when you plug in
things like keyboard and mice and all
that if it does have to do some sort of
driver initialization or basic
functionality for input/output joystick
game devices it may not work so this is
just for temporarily but if you for some
reason they're working on it and you
want it to stop installing the driver on
you like we just dealt with with this
guy then that is what you want to change
let's see if gpu-z can actually detect
it now okay so look it up the device ID
we've definitely got some clues here
because we were seeing some conflicting
information now here's the thing it's at
NDE which means in video 0 6 to 6 that's
basically the device ID when we
look that up we actually come back with
a G th p GT 1030 768 megabyte and then
the BIOS information right 10 de 6 to 6
which is exactly what our idea is the
problem here is that it states that this
is AG ddr4 with a 256-bit memory bus
which does not correlate with the 1030
that correlates with the 9600 at least a
lot more closely although that's a gddr3
so what we are suspecting is happening
here we have a GT 1030 with possibly a
9600 BIOS installed what we can't figure
out is why it worked momentarily okay so
we decided to go ahead and look up the
drivers for the GT 10 ok keep seeing
1030 the GT 130 and what we found out
was they actually stopped driver support
in 2000 and something or another 16 yeah
cuz 3/4 to dot whatever is or 3 3 4 to 0
1 is the last driver that supported this
card so if it tried to load our three
98.1 one onto this card it it obviously
wouldn't have worked so we just
installed the driver for this card and
then what we actually experienced was
windows identified it immediately and
was like hey new display driver found a
new display device found we're like oh
that's cool so what we got to do now is
I'm just gonna restart I'm gonna leave
it in the the slot that it's in I'm
still gonna run off the eye GPU and I
want to see if gpu-z will actually
identify the card it's all identified
now NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 but now it
says gddr3 but it says 384 bit
I don't think that's right and we're all
the gt1 30s showing 760 megabytes and
this says we have two gigs heaven time
I'm not gonna run 4k 8 8x MSAA though
that's probably asking for a bit of a
you want to run 4k 8 X fine we will try
4k 8 X whoa
[Laughter]
it's one though oh hey simply tell me
this is still a less than playable
experience I can't even get the mouse to
show up so although we got it to work by
simply just installing the proper driver
it's still a counterfeit card because
it's got like a mix of 9600 GT and GT
130 specs kind of mixed together because
as you can see here 16 ROPS and 64 TM
use here in gpu-z but we're only seeing
48 CUDA cores on the actual specs this
is expecting to see 768 megabytes of
standard memory config this is saying it
has two gigabytes of gddr3 this is
expecting to see G ddr2 and 192 bit bus
where this is showing 384 so yeah at
this point we pretty much figured out
that it was either a 9600 GT or a GT 130
and we pretty much are assuming the
reason why that it wasn't working is
because it's actually identifying as a
GTX 650 Ti which it's not and that's why
none the drivers were working because
the drivers that support that card are
not actually supporting the 130 or the
9600 so yeah it's still a counterfeit
card it who knows what's on there and
I'm not gonna start trying to flash bios
and stuff on there because I don't think
at the end of day it's really gonna
matter now we got to see if we can't see
what's up with this guy all right I
don't expect this to work I think this
card is just straight-up dead okay this
time it actually identified because not
only does it have the proper 10 de 12 44
1b for ca 0 0 - the other one just
that's how we know the other ones still
counterfeit cuz it didn't have any of
the other identifying numbers maybe I
should install the 550 ti driver first
based on the first part load VGA BIOS
well that's gonna have to be for another
time because I can't load the BIOS and
be flash won't let me do it it says it's
not an Nvidia graphics card and it says
it's not Nvidia graphics card because it
doesn't have a BIOS on it and I can't
get a BIOS on it because it won't load
because it won't load because design
media graphics card because has no BIOS
sometimes this works it's rare but
they're fixed it anyway guys thanks for
watching
I do like playing with broken hardware
here and then this thing never worked he
said it never worked and yeah so anyway
god that's a flexible cooler holy crap
alright ah okay
the sacrifice has been made pc guys it
fought back alright thanks for watching
I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
