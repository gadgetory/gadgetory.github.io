reservoir custom GPU block or a complete
loop and a box alpha cools wide range of
products can make your next water
cooling adventure and easy one click the
link in the description for more details
ok before you start throwing stuff at
your screen hear me out because I know I
said I wasn't going to do any more GT X
1080 reviews but Wenzhou tech reached
out to me and asked if I wanted to do a
fairly exclusive Arctic storm which is a
foam custom full cover water block on
their 1080 I was like you know what yeah
yeah I'll do it
don't hate me you guys know I love water
cooling so of course I'm a sucker and
I'm going to say yes to this which is
why I've got a a temporary loop setup
back here because it is a full cover
custom water block on top of one of
their amp graphics cards at least I
think it's an amp graphics card they
didn't tell me actually which card is
based off the amp for the amp extreme
even though I did compare the PCB to the
amp extreme and saw that it was
identical so I don't really know but
regardless guys I'm not going to talk a
lot about specs of the GTX 10 80 because
we've done so many 1080 reviews on here
there's plenty of resources we can find
the actual specs but today I'm going to
talk about two specific things maybe
three I want to talk about the water
block itself won't talk about the
construction quality of it and want to
talk about the cooling of it I want to
also talk about temperatures and I want
to talk about overclocking those are the
three things I really care about
overclocking temperatures and the
waterblock design itself now because I
know that you guys are just going to
fast forward to the benchmark numbers
anyway and someone's going to put a
little button down there and they're
like oh just click here to not listen to
the idiot talk but just see the charts
I'll go ahead and put them up for you
now
member
now it's kind of interesting about this
is this card features a seventeen
hundred and seventy one megahertz boost
clock sounds kind of nice especially
when you compare it to the founders
edition boost clock but this guy only
went up to nineteen hundred and thirty
six using GPU boost 3.0 reason why I say
only is because other 1080s that came in
here automatically out of the box for
boosting up just as high on air the
other thing I find kind of interesting
though is I don't feel like ZOTAC is
taking a full advantage of the amount of
GPU boost Headroom that they have at
these temperatures with only a seventeen
hundred and seventy one megahertz boost
clock because the amp card which is the
two fan air-cooled card not the three
fan extreme the two fan has an eighteen
hundred and twenty two megahertz boost
clock so I feel like this card could
have performed better out of the box if
they've been a little bit less
conservative with the boost clock on it
so I'm not too sure why they did that
but regardless it is what it is that's
the way that it shifts now overclocking
on the other hand is something
completely different and I'm pleased to
say that this card has matched the
fastest frequency 1080 I've had come
through this office yet which happened
to be the EVGA GTX 1080 classified at
twenty one hundred and sixty-four
megahertz this card is running twenty
one hundred and sixty-four megahertz
right now it is solid and stable all day
long in fact I was able to get twenty
one hundred and seventy seven megahertz
out of it but it wasn't passing all of
my tests it was only passing some and
that to me is not stable so twenty one
hundred and sixty-four megahertz is
where it is but at the same frequency
it's actually performing faster than the
classified card was and that's because
of the Headroom of the temperature and
what's happening here is as the
temperature staying so low down into the
high 30s low 40s
like I said forty C is as hot as mine
got the fluctuation in frequency is not
happening it is not going up and down
several steps it is staying solid and
locked at twenty one 64 at all times
which is really one of the benefits to
going with a water-cooled graphics card
GPU boost is always dynamically
controlling the frequency based on
various factors power target power limit
temperatures and of course the frequency
so as things start to change a little
bit or various scenes might load a card
on air to go higher
which might ramp up the fans a little
more and take up some of that power
limit then the card will start to
dynamically slow itself down slightly
we're talking a couple of steps here
steps of 12 megahertz at a time maybe 25
megahertz at the most which I usually
only accounts for about one or two fps
ever at its max but still when you can
get the card to be completely stable and
locked in at a particular frequency
you're going to get better more
consistent results so that's why this
card at the same frequency is performing
better than the other card at the same
frequency because this one never changes
obviously 20 164 is an amazing frequency
but it is still all luck of the draw
when it comes to the Silicon Lottery now
ZOTAC assures me they did not hand pick
cherry-pick this card
they even told me that they do not
emphasize overclocking on any of their
cards they're more about the
out-of-the-box experience so as long as
what they say is 100% truth and have no
reason to believe it's not the
overclocking results are completely luck
of the draw on my end here and again I
guess I've only had two cards come
through here that have gotten this
frequency and this happens to be one of
them coil whine on this thing is an
absolute minimum only if you're in a
menu system that's getting like 2 or
3,000 FPS likes like witcher you're not
going to hear any coil whine or buzz
whatsoever it's got a lot of extra
features on there that are really cool
especially if you download the zotac
software where you've got full spectrum
RGB control of the block itself now
speaking of the block it is a full cover
water block that is touching all the
things that matters trust me
I checked it's touching the VRMs it is
touching the MOSFETs and chokes it is
touching the core obviously and it's
touching the memory and all of those
things are being actively cooled so
obviously there's a lot of heat on that
block that has to be carried away but
the block has a very very high
efficiency high flow design where all of
the fluid is being transported and moved
through a micro fin heat sink in there
that is carrying away as much heat as
possible and it's doing it very very
efficiently because I'm not running like
a DD C or d5 pump on this I'm running a
$40.00 cheapo little pump that you could
get from like performance pcs and it's
doing a fantastic job at keeping
everything nice and cool obviously I
died the coolant purple I thought you
know with the green on
are going purple be kind of a cool
Batman type of theme you know Joker
whatever the only thing I have to say
that I don't like about this is the fact
that you cannot bring the ports in on
the top of the card they have to come in
either from the side which with the
extra height of the card in many cases
there's not going to be room to put
fittings sticking straight out like
technically they are on this bench
pointing straight up they can only go
from the bottom or straight out they
can't go from the top and I think a lot
of people would rather route their
cooling to go from the bottom of the
card out to the CPU or the other way
around out from the CPU to the top of
the card and out at the bottom so the
only way you could achieve that is if
you were to include some sort of
45-degree adapter on there which means
you have to buy more stuff but if you're
doing a custom loop these are things
you'd have to consider anyway so if
you're in the market for a high-end GTX
1080
that is has a lot of potential Headroom
for overclocking is not going to
fluctuate on you and has already
water-cooled so you have to worry about
doing it yourself and you can get past
the either love it or hate it yellow and
gunmetal back plate design which
admittedly would have looked absolutely
phenomenal in the yellow skunkworks
build this is definitely worth taking a
look at and doing some more research on
alright guys thanks for watching if
you've got a custom water-cooled GT X
1080 do me a favor in the comments of
this video
tell us what card you have what water
block you have and what frequency and
temperatures you are getting I think
you'd be kind of neat to sort of compare
results with that said guys it's time to
go and as always I will see you in the
next video it won't be about a 1080 I
promise that's like two videos from now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
