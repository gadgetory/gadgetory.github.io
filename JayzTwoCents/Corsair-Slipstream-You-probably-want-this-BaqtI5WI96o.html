actually is where we are right now
at course eros we're going to talk about
some of the products that has helped get
us to CES 2019 now we're gonna start
with peripherals yeah set it right
peripherals not couric real peripherals
are one of those things we haven't
really talked about much on this channel
because they're they're a 100 percent
subjective lifestyle choice that's
that's kind of how we classify
peripherals or lifestyle you interact
with the mouse - keyboard headsets sound
cards speakers and it's really hard to
kind of convey products and make it
relatable to the audience because you
can't feel it you can't deal with any of
that but there's some new tech that
Corsair showing that's gonna come in
later this year called slipstream which
is their new communication interface no
eSports gamers have of course just first
Wireless because of the latency and
input lag and just the connectivity
dropouts when you have other wireless
devices go to a LAN party with a
wireless mouse if it works you're lucky
because with all the wireless devices
they're stomping on top of each other
not enough bandwidth in terms of the
spectrum and it's just you can hear a
lot of blah blah blah it doesn't work
well well that's all changing with
slipstream Corsair has invested a ton of
time and money in developing this
particular protocol because the best
analogy that they could give us is they
are sending out packets down multiple
lanes of communication and they are
caught it's like a freeway with traffic
and they got various cars going
different routes to get to the
destination so even if some of those
packets get lost or get stomped on some
of its gonna get to its destination now
it's got a lot more functionality than
just that that's very high level sort of
description on that but it's increased
range you have wireless headsets and
microphones now wireless and headset
usually don't go together I've had some
wireless headsets in the past that had
very decent audio in terms of listening
and fidelity but then as soon as you
talk you travel propose different it's
just it's so compressed because of the
encoder that has to bring it down to a
bitrate level that can communicate
wirelessly and it was using the exact
same communication string that was
happening with the audio well now
they've got headsets are coming out
later this year that are going to
utilize sip stream and have dual
basically dual lanes of communication
with the system so the
headset microphone and the audio are
independent of each other using the same
technology technology I just talked
about which is allowing for a much
cleaner clearer higher fidelity
microphone so what we've got right here
this is the harpoon rgv Mouse right here
utilizing strips of slipstream and the
reason why they've sort of showed it on
this Mouse first is they want it to be
affordable to the masses so this is
their low-end Mouse that's utilizing
this new technology that people were
expecting to be expensive I don't know
what the price point was but I want to
say they can sense it like 50 bucks 60
bucks something like that this mouse is
actually connected to that computer way
over there yeah the one that guy way
over there with other wireless devices
going in this room obviously all of our
phones and stuff different spectrums but
they can still step on each other so
we're gonna do right now is gonna play a
little battlefield 5 with this about 15
feet or so away from this system to see
what the input lag is like and all of
that so this is actually the last Tiger
mission right here so we decide to go
like something that's actual shooter so
that you can see firsthand what it's
like now we are at CES obviously this is
this is not ideal for trade show or for
wireless performance because we have
what's called you know tradeshow level
interference everyone's using wireless
mics I'm on a wireless mic right now
obviously and what I'm looking for here
is any perceived lag or delay that's
obviously gonna show up when you were
dealing with wireless mice and gaming
and shooters so so far I'm not feeling
anything other than the bullets that are
hitting me because I suck okay ring it's
serious weird it's super serious on this
one
Oh oh yes yes they did out out out not
cool
I'm not feeling anything that would make
me feel like I couldn't play on this
even here at a trade show with the
computer 15 feet away I mean this is
this is the least ideal condition that
you would want to be in and I think the
important thing to remember is this is
not even ready for primetime this is
this is super early on something that
we're being told will be ready around q3
that they're debuting on their entry
level mounts I can tell you right now
that's actually pretty good so I'm
excited for this technology whether
you're into wireless peripherals or not
that's having this option to where you
can get you know wired level performance
whether you're an eSports level gamer or
just a casual you can tidy up your
system at least and it's not going to
cost you an arm and a leg that's why
they're debuting it on their entry level
mountain anyway guys that's just our
look and talk about slipstream keep an
eye out for that later on this year I
guarantee we'll probably hear more about
a competition some more devices because
it's also gonna connect up to three
devices with a single dongle so you
could potentially have your keyboard
your mouse and your wireless headset one
dongle it's all gonna do the frequency
searching your spectrum search all in
its own to find the clearest best
channel and it's it's gonna be in my
opinion something great to look forward
to because I want Wireless again in my
home system alright guys once again a
huge thank you to course there for
sending us to CES 2019 and check the
link in description below to find out
more about their new Corsair One and
Corsair one pro gaming systems and
desktop systems and as always we'll see
you guys in the next video it should
probably be like literally in a couple
minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
