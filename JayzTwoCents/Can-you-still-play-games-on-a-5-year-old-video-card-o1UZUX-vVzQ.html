here inside of the movie - you're the
movie set man what's up guys jeez - cent
- and you know what I'll be the first
one to admit that we're pretty lucky
around here we get to play with the
latest and greatest hardware gtx 980ti
titan exes
now what happens though when you take
modern games can you try and play it
with a five-year-old graphics card once
we're going to do today we're going to
lose the 1080i and the testbench we're
going to install a GTX 680 we're going
to see exactly what kind of performance
you get when you take something that's 5
years old and try and apply it to stay
you
I think it probably goes without saying
that with a five-year-old card like the
GTX 680 you're not going to exactly be
getting away with any high resolutions
anything above 1080p is probably out of
the question
today on the title obviously but
anything above medium settings is
probably out I'm thinking we're going to
be at low to medium settings based on
modern titles but the older titles that
are from the generation when this card
was king would probably still be okay to
run at 1080p medium to high resolution
or me to my settings anyway so right
here I'm in afterburner I did actually
apply a little bit of an overclock I got
a 50 megahertz overclock to this and
just do a hundred on the memory I want
to see if we can push this just a little
bit to see if we can get a some more
performance out of this this is not just
a bass 680 although it has a blower cell
cooler on it this is I believe the super
clock from EVGA I know it doesn't have 2
6 pins as the 6 pin and an 8 pin so is a
custom card so let's just let's go ahead
and go back into some let's go and go
back into some GTA 5 and kind of
comparisons that's where we started and
we saw we were getting stupid amounts of
FPS let's just see what happens so here
we are in GTA 5 walking around it's
Franklin as you can see we're getting
pretty impressive frame rates I'll tell
you the truth I wasn't expecting 9 DSPs
right here 84 85 this is a lot higher
than expected to be what are the
settings so if you know GTA 5 will kind
of auto detect the GPU and try and tune
itself automatically so it's obviously
not going to the same settings as a
1080p eye but we've got MSAA it's off
that's fine I'd be worried about the
2gig buffer on the 680 in today's title
running out of memory so I don't want to
put on MSA maybe we'll test it and see
what happens though we've set at 1080p
and if we take a look at the rest of our
settings here B seems off is good
population density is maxed population
variety is nearly maxed and distant
scaling is maxed texture quality normal
and everything is a mix of high and very
high settings motion blurs off that's
perfectly fine with me
ambient occlusion is on high tension on
high I was not expecting this type of
fps GTA 5 is obviously not just about
walking around on foot what about when
you're moving quickly in a car because
obviously the faster that you're moving
around the heart of the system is going
to have to keep up with the amount of
things being rendered especially in a
large world like this
yes I know that GTA 5 has a lot to do
with CPU but this is a really matter the
point is are we having a good gaming
experience here and I'm going to say
that anywhere between 84 to 90 FPS as
I'm driving around this old well let's
face it this is a Mercedes and how you
look at it I'm going to call gta5 on a
five-year-old graphics card granted you
have the CPU power to keep up with the
world it's very doable we're not
dropping out of the 80s that okay 76
right as I say that but still that's not
bad what about a game that's not quite
so demanding well let's have a look at
Battlefront especially Battlefront 2
coming out a little later this year this
might be relevant our graphics settings
are at 1920 by 1080 full screen refresh
rate 59.94 because that's what the HDMI
signal sending vertical sync is off
field of view film grain we don't want
film grain screw film grain resolution
scale graphics quality is on high and
it's ultra let's try it ultra shall we I
mean I don't think it's a very demanding
game so let's see if we can even play
ultra like this we'll just do a little
survival mission here and we're getting
200 fps in the loading screen I mean
that's something it's all about the
loading screens that's where you really
do your benchmarks not bad 70 FPS we
look over to the Sun we see these
beautiful textures and stuff it's on
ultra so this was maxed out 73 75 you
look back this way yeah I think I think
70s is pretty doable he'll be gay oh
crap
they're stormtroopers they should be
able to shoot me so here's another
popular game people like to play
overwatch now I'll be honest I don't
think I've ever played an online match
but anyway here's the settings these
things optical buffering off reduce
buffering off enough this is good or not
have any presets on this thing
Oh quality are there hi is that good
there any higher than high okay high
ultra an epic rub of that so let's see
what we got I guess we'll just try the
hi we're getting 70 FPS is there like an
FPS number that people kind of it seems
locked at 70 though almost like almost
like something is limiting the FPS as
they're setting limit fps oh just play
based let's do custom fine brain cap 300
there we go I'm sure someone's already
watching was like I yeah right okay
we're getting 121 FPS 123 I haven't seen
any bad guys yet
well I killed somebody
that's cool
I want to flies Claire killstreak oh
this is a I know huh
and I chose easy hello all it matters
though is that the FPS is really high
and I can kill well stupid AI clearly
say I is not running on NVIDIA
deep-learning
so we jumped into a modern title here
this is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon we're
at 1080p we wat we pop in here did a
preset of medium and this is where I
started to get concerned about the two
gigabytes of vram buffer on the 680
because as you can see we are exceeding
the two gigabytes available on this card
it's but it's saying based on the
settings we have 2.3 gigabytes of vram
is required or recommended
we've only got 2017 available so it's
basically blinking red telling us we
have exceeded our budget so let's do
this let's just see right now what
happens if we try and play when we have
exceeded our available vram I'll be
honest this is not a title I'm expecting
to hit 60fps n I'm just not I don't
think it's going to happen I think we're
just we're just too old
on this hardware yeah we're sitting at
about 41 FPS 42 it's fairly consistent I
mean you could play this if you wanted
but it's obvious right now that our
hardware is definitely holding a stack
at this point we've got plenty of CPU in
the test rig obviously just not enough
GPU so can we tweak these settings
enough to actually be able to play it
let's have a look here video we're at
1080p I'm going to keep it at 1080
because I think that's important I want
to play it native res what about if we
go down to preset low I was if we go low
we're in the green now in terms of VRAM
so that should be good news we're at one
point seven seven five gigs of VRAM
required okay so by just going down to
low we at least went up to 59 60 fps
looks like we can barely squeak out 60
but remember five-year-old graphics card
that's important to note here what
happens if we get into a firefight and
it's fine though this game which is not
only pretty beautiful looks extreme
flat now like all of the modern textures
and such are gone so what if we play
with this just a tad bit more draw just
keep that low AME occlusion that off
texture quality is put that to see the
moment I hit texture quality to medium
from low as when we go way up over our
VRAM usage you got anisotropic filtering
that'll help smooth out some of these
lines here I think that's what I say
about anisotropic filtering is it's
usually as free it doesn't cost me it's
a free effect doesn't cost anything in
terms of GPU overhead vegetation quality
we put the to medium okay that might
help a little bit 5350 to see it's kind
of bouncing around I mean I would still
call this playable this is one of those
things where if you want to play the
game and just enjoy the story mode and
kind of forget the beauty of the game
then you can do it because I mean as you
can see right here we are sitting at 61
you can shoot the birds here can't you
I've killed birds before I could have
swore you could kill the birds always
coming back oh yeah see I just shot that
bird out of this guy not bad
65 64 I mean it's doable I'm actually
not finding this to be too bad another
truth
are you hiding I'd mind a truck you're
scared should you through the windows
near you yeah this is this is actually
very playable as far as I'm concerned
now of course this could never be any
sort of a potato GPU review without
talking about some csgo seems to be
always high demand for csgo coverage on
some of this stuff so here we go we've
got 1080p once again this is where it
put the settings on its own we've got
high high high very high enabled NSA a
disabled for vertical sync disabled
motion blur so so far haven't seen over
two hundred and seventy FPS in this game
yeah I know I don't have a loadout or
anything I'm just checking the game
hangar guys I'll say the mouse movement
is definitely quick if that was the
reason you guys wanted this but yeah I
mean is that good
it's 260 fps good on a five-year-old GPU
I expected it to run just fine
considering the source engines been out
for so long
okay I think that's enough test written
for that the match is starting and I
don't want to embarrass myself any worse
than I already have so peace out guys so
that was just a little taste of what
it's like gaming on a five-year-old GPU
now I'm very well aware that most people
would never run a config like this you
know x99 6100 k 32 gigs of DDR for
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz on a
five-year-old graphics card I mean it's
an incredibly imbalance system so I'm
very well aware of that so let me know
in the comments below if you guys think
I should do some sort of throwback five
years maybe than seven years to see what
happens when we take some really old
hardware and try and play games today I
think that's a very realistic situation
for so many people out there and I hear
you guys I hear you that most people
can't afford this new stuff so I'm kind
of curious on what you guys think anyway
guys it's time to go thanks for watching
and before I get out of here if you're
in the market for your own GT X 1080 TI
founders edition card which was what we
started this video with then look down
in the description below where you'll
find a link to those using my Amazon
affiliate anyway guys thanks for
watching let me know what how you think
I should build upon this little retro
throwback series and we'll do the best
we can to get that implemented as always
see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
