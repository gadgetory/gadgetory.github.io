is Vega embargo day which means your
inbox is obviously exploded with Vega 64
and Vega 56 all over your subscription
feed and this video is no exception but
hey at least I made an embargo date now
there is a whole lot of information to
talk about with the new Vega
architecture and I'm not planning on
going really deep down that rabbit hole
there's a lot of information out there
is a lot of good news outlets and
journalism in the tech realm that are
going to be covering all of that stuff
so the information is there if you want
to find it so I'm going to talk about a
couple of things here I'm going to talk
about gaming and I'm gonna talk about
compute because I feel like this card
definitely fills a gap where there is a
need and we're going to do a kind of a
quick rundown of specs so the Vegas 64
it's got 64 compute units that's why
it's called Vegas is before you can you
guess how much the 56 has yep you're
right 48 of them no I'm just kidding
obviously that's 56 when it comes to
core speed here we have got a twelve
hundred and forty seven megahertz clock
speed on the 64 with a turbo clock of
fifteen hundred and forty six so
obviously the improvement in clock speed
is there versus Fiji what we saw on
theory because that was sitting right
around 1150 if I remember correctly then
the Vega 56 comes in at eleven hundred
and fifty-six megahertz one day fourteen
hundred and seventy one megahertz turbo
clock so I'm impressed to see that
they've been able to pull more clock
speed out of the HBM - especially with
where they came from HP m1 now I know
why you guys are here it's because you
guys are interested in gaming
performance but trust me when I say
there is way more to these cards than
just game performance but you also have
to kind of know where they stack up so
there was a lot of anticipation that HB
m2 and Vega was going to come out and
just decimate the 1080 Ti when it comes
to high-end gaming and unfortunately
that's not where it's placed in the
lineup it's not placed against the 1080
Ti nowhere near the Titan X Pascal it's
actually in the market for gaming
anyways - but right up against the GTX
1080 there it is right there it's going
to put up there without falling there we
go and then the Vegas 56 as you can
probably guess by now is placed against
the 1070 I don't want to knock that over
so that's basically what you're going to
see right now on these benchmarks as we
move
word 64 versus 1080 and 56 versus 1070
so with all that talking out of the way
let's just go ahead and get right to the
numbers
now let's talk about a couple of things
with those benchmarks that you just saw
obviously all four of these cards are
founders edition cards all four of these
cards will hit their temperature max if
you allow them to so what I did to try
and level the playing field was I up the
band curb on all four of these cards
slightly but I didn't touch core clock I
didn't touch memory clock power target
none of that stuff I just didn't want
the cooler themselves to be holding back
the performance of the core considering
the fact that there are going to be
custom cards available for Vega which
will alleviate a lot of the temperature
Headroom which we are pumping our head
up against and obviously there are
custom 1080 cards available on the
market as well the other thing too is
when it comes to price I used two
pricing for the standard air-cooled card
and not the limited edition card because
there's no performance difference
between those cards I confirmed with AMD
that the only difference is the
aesthetics of the shroud and the
backplate and has nothing to do with
performance increase with this card
whatsoever
obviously the liquid-cooled card right
which wasn't even included in today's
video does cost more and has better
cooling and moreover overclocking
Headroom and all that stuff so we're not
even talking about that today so that's
why for pricing I used the black cooler
like you see on the 56 right here that's
also available on the 64 now if you pay
close attention in those benchmarks
you'd see there's a pretty interesting
picture that's been painted here in what
Nvidia has done between two different
series of cards the 70 series and 80
series obviously on Pascal and these 56
and the 64 and that AMD seems should
brought the performance of these cards
closer together then Nvidia did with
their 70 and 80 series card so you've
got the Vegas 56 which is beating the
1070 in just about everything
but you've got the 1080 which is edging
out the Vegas 64 in just about
everything but of course there is some
there were some strange outcomes here
where for instance in Metro last slide
it really seemed to favor the Nvidia
cards where it definitely pulled way
ahead of both Vega 56 and 64 but if you
took a look at the division then the
Vega pulled way ahead
it of the Pascal cards and then if you
look at wildlands which again is that
although it's a Tom Clancy game it's not
the same developers or the same engine
there's a modified engine they're used
in wildlands Nvidia pulled ahead again
so it really depends on the titles and
I'm hoping that there's going to be some
optimization as time goes on in terms of
being able to fully leverage the amount
of raw horse power that exists in Vega
because if you want to talk raw horse
power
there's definitely more of it in Vega
than there is in Pascal least of 70 and
80 series Pascal if you take a look at
its compute performance because I'm
looking at notes here because I won't
get these numbers wrong here if we talk
about Vegas 64 here Vegas 64 has 12.6
gigaflops of performance when it comes
to floating-point performance versus the
8.2 gigaflops found in the GTX 1080
now if you're using software that can
actually take advantage of that type of
compute power then you're going to get a
much better value with the 64 and a
slightly lesser price point than the GTX
ten-eighty giving you a more rounded
experience where your GPU is more useful
in more situations than just
quote-unquote gaming now looking at the
Vegas 56 it's pretty impressive because
that the $400 price point they have
exceeded the 10 gigaflops performance
figures when it comes to floating point
at 10.5 versus only five point seven on
the gtx 1070 so double the floating
point performance when it comes to the
1070 so again the same situation where
if you and premier loves premier will
take advantage of the horsepower in Vega
big time so it really depends on what
you're doing with your graphics cards
and there's always more than just gaming
when it comes to GPS especially in
today's day and age right obviously I
hate to even mention it but
cryptocurrency has been taken advantage
of graphics cards you guys have seen
what has happened to pricing because of
it and man I'm kind of fearful for the
market for these Vega cards if they're
just as good or that much better but
yeah you can see that if you're looking
for pro workflow and with the amount of
stuff that's locked down on the 1070 and
1080 just how much they want to force
people into their pro series of cards to
get that level of performance AMD's just
laying it all out there it's completely
unlocked available everything is there
they're not they're not stripping down
features on a software level and that's
a good thing obviously now let's go
ahead and talk about thermals and power
consumption for a minute because that's
important too right with all of that
compute stuff out of the way in gaming
this is
another huge portion of what these cards
you know it that you should consider
there's actually three power profiles
per BIOS on here and there's two BIOS on
these card so it's a total six different
power profiles depending on where the
switch is toggled so you have a balanced
which is kind of normal mode you have a
power saver mode and you have a turbo
mode and of course you have custom where
you can change everything on you can
change the cloth states the fan curve
the power consumption you can undervolt
it you can do all kinds of stuff but
power consumption on these cards is
pretty heavy in comparison to the 70 and
80 series pascal cards which only top
out around 180 so there is definitely a
lot to consider here when it comes to
power consumption so if you want to look
at FPS per what Nvidia is definitely
winning in that category it definitely
goes without saying that Vega has
certainly certainly power-hungry that's
why you've got to eight pin power plugs
on here and you know if you're using a
workflow though that can take advantage
of all of those gigaflops then you're
probably pulling a lot of water turn the
wall anyway let's say when I mentioned
though is there does seem to be an
improvement on the fan design not
necessarily in terms of cooling but
aesthetics where they have certainly
made the blower style cooler a bit less
noisy than it used to be in fact it's
running right here next to me I have
turned down the ban curve a little bit
though because I didn't want to be
picked up on the mic but they have made
an improvement to the fan they've made a
little bit larger there's more surface
area but it does a pretty good job at
not being too intrusive and it has a
nice just smooth feeling to it we're
back when like the RX 470 and 480 came
out that was also using a blower self
and it just was choppy and was
inconsistent and Hetal it just was not
pleasant to the ears it definitely made
an improvement to the fan so that's good
to see so as I said in beginning this
video if you're looking for a deeper
dive into the rabbit hole of all of the
specs and all the architecture when it
comes to these new graphics cards from
AMD then definitely check out some of
the other journalists out there that are
doing a fantastic job of covering that
level of detail but I hope at least what
I've showed you guys today gives you
some sort of picture of what to expect
on a more mainstream consumer who might
not be as interested in talking about
HPCC or high bandwidth cache controller
and stuff like that because some of you
I know me personally I'm just like show
me the numbers and those are some of the
numbers I have to present so hopefully
you guys have enjoyed it tell me what
you guys think of Vega though I know
some of you are be disappointed hoping
that this was going to knock nvidia off
of its pedestal of being the fastest
GPUs in the world but I guess it really
again considers yet to really consider
what is fastest right its fastest in
floating-point precision and its assets
in gaming that's a lot of fastest out
there so you guys tell me what you think
sound off in the comments below and as
always thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
