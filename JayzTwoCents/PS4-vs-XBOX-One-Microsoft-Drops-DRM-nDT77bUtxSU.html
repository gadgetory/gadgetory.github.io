decided to kind of rethink and take a
few steps back regarding their internet
check in and drm policies okay okay so
on the I mean this really is a good
thing I wanted to let some of this
information sink in and do a little bit
of research before I decided to go ahead
and give some comments on this first of
all Don Mattrick who's the Xbox division
president we all remember that guy
fortunately we have a product for people
who aren't able to get some form of
connectivity it's called Xbox 360 right
so stick with 360 that's your message if
you don't like it if you have zero
access to the internet that is an
offline device that was then and he had
this to say today the sharing of games
will work as it does today you will
simply share the disc the downloaded
titles cannot be shared or resold he
then went on to say that also similar to
today playing disc-based games will
require that the disc be in the tray a
little over a week ago I put up this
video right here that said I'm going to
buy the ps4 and I want to go ahead and
clarify that I'm still more interested
in the ps4 than the xbox one for a
couple of reasons the xbox one still
requires that you have the Kinect
plugged into the console at all times
but he did also address some of those
concerns earlier this week about having
the Kinect always connected especially
for a lot of you that are worried about
having to connect on and listening and
possibly spying on you at all times and
not knowing where they did is going a
lot of people would want to unplug the
kinect but you can't do that he did go
on to say that you get to control
everything to connect sees and hears and
one is listening and how it responds in
the sensitivity and that that data isn't
getting recorded and it isn't getting
sent anywhere or so they say you really
are just left wondering a camera and a
microphone that is always on and a
device that up until today was going to
be always connected
where was that data going to go it's
still kind of a scary thought I know we
live in the digital day and age but I
did not like the fact that that connect
has to always be connected he did say
that you can disable it inside the
console but that it still has to be
plugged in and if there are games that
are going to require the connect be
plugged in and active but that just goes
no but that's a given you can't play say
a connect based game without having to
connect on and active but in my last
video people really wondered as a pc
gamer why i gave two cents or even cared
at all about console drm if anything as
a pc gamer i am subjected to way
stricter drm policies in any console
gamer i can't share any game that i buy
and play on my pc once i buy it once i
download it and install it it's mine
there is no way i can give that to
anybody else so if anything for years
I've been conforming to the very policy
that it was that I was speaking out
against regarding xbox one and ps4 but
there are some good things that came out
of this because Microsoft this past week
has just taken one hell of a beating I
mean their PR department must have just
been sweating bullets Don Mattrick had
to have been losing sleep over the ps4
vs the xbox one especially when six
months ago Sony is the one who initiated
the drm policies that they were looking
to implement with the new playstation
they kind of got the conversation
rolling xbox jumped on board and then
playstation backed off after they saw
what happened just in the hours between
their two key notes over at e3 but as a
pc gamer why does this matter to me
because it shows how strong we as
consumers really are over the influences
of these massive corporations in this
world Microsoft is one of the largest
companies in the world and it took only
one week of people like you people like
me people who are willing to stand up
and say that we don't like this policy
and as consumers we hold all of the
control Microsoft without you buying it
without me buying it doesn't matter what
it is you and I have the control to
change these types of decisions and as
unexpected as it was companies like Val
are actually jumping on board you should
recognize valve from huge titles
like counter-strike half-life and valve
has now announced that they are looking
into allowing you to share their games
between steam libraries that would make
probably one of pcs first open drm
policies or major reversals regarding
drm policy in pc gaming it's huge all
because of what's been happening over
the last week because of decisions that
I've made the decisions that you've made
and the fact that we are not going to
let large corporations determine what it
is we want or what it is we feel we need
don mattrick actually said that
Microsoft considered the impact this was
going to have on Armed Forces not just
the United States all around the world
and when Don Mattrick said that they've
considered that impact but they found
that crowd to be such a minority that
they couldn't make decisions based on
that small demographic even the US
military was getting involved in the
envy Microsoft hate over the last week
and it's because of the fact that for
the one of the first times as people as
consumers and talking with our
pocketbook we were able to move a
mountain like Microsoft and get them not
only to look like complete idiots but to
change their mind entirely regarding a
policy that they were very very adamant
about over 50,000 of you watched my
other video I've only got 14 thousand
eight hundred subscribers clearly more
people are watching that video because
people are sharing it people were
searching for it and a lot of you really
agreed with what it was I had to say and
I'm still going to buy the PlayStation 4
whether or not i buy the xbox one now is
really going to depend on what people
have to say about it after it comes out
I'm not going to completely run off the
fact that I would own it now that I know
that we were able to make a major change
and a huge victory for gamers around the
world I might later on down the road ps4
is still where it's at for me when it
comes to consoles but the major thing
here that I want you to take away from
this video is that we as gamers did it
as consumers like I said we hold the
power without money they're nothing just
out just like without your views this
video in this channel is
it just goes to show how big of a result
you can have if you just work together
and just come together for a common
cause and you don't mess with gamers
there is no doubt about that you just
don't mess with gamers now if only we
could come together as a mess and make a
movement against a company like Apple
because they seem to think they know
everything that they know what we want
we don't know what we want they know
what we want and they're going to give
us what they know we want because only
douchebags actually buy products from
Apple as if we aren't good enough to
actually know what hello</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
