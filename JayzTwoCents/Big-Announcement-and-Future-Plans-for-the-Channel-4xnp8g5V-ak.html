Jays to sense the channel where we talk
about pc stuff technology reviews gaming
raging during the arnold schwarzenegger
impressions and stuff what does that
mean to you well it means Jays two cents
wants to bring you the best quality
content that he possibly can so because
of that Jay has decided or why am I
talking about myself in the third person
hi my shrink says to stop talking about
myself in the third person otherwise you
guys are gonna think he's crazy but I'm
crate jay is two cents me has decided to
go ahead and accept sponsorship from
aqua tuning now before you freak out
before you start hitting dislike and
before you start raging let's go ahead
and talk about what that means to the
future of my channel and what that means
to you as fans of Jays two cents for me
here we go that third person twilight
zone lubish thing yeah are you being
grazie we're going to think that you are
crazy hey stop it Arnold look get down
Babu chef's got lean on why are you guys
even subscribe to me it's always a
touchy feely subject when it comes to
sponsorship because people seem to think
sponsorship like major athletes or
racing teams or whatever or paid money
to say hey guys we were able to do this
today because we were sponsored by
Penske and pence keys is the best racing
team ever in LA that's not what
sponsorship is to me sponsorship to me
means that aqua tuning has interests in
my channel and the growth and they want
to be able to contribute to me and allow
me to be able to continue to grow and do
the things that I do if I believe in
their product which I do see I've been
doing water cooling and custom
modifications of computers and lighting
and all sorts of cool stuff God for over
20 years and for the last 10 years I've
been doing water cooling in every single
build I've done for myself been using
aqua tuning and the companies that they
represent
alphacool phobia monsoon all of those
companies for years and I've definitely
believed in the product that they that
they provide to the public so it's not
like I'm accepting you know any sort of
parts or a sponsorship from a company
that I have no experience with that in
my opinion would be a little bit
contradictory to what it is that I'm
doing with my channel so this means
something for you guys because now I'm
going to have the entire backing of a
computer modding company like aqua
tuning that's going to allow me to do
more builds more customization more
custom pc videos that you guys have
definitely shown that you have the most
interest in on my channel so this wasn't
a decision I made just for the growth of
Jays two cents but also for the vested
interest that you guys have into my
channel and seeing all the weird stuff
that we can do with a computer it also
means I'm going to have a lot more
backing when it comes to be able to do
giveaways for you guys and that is the
best part because there's no other way
to give back and say thank you to you
guys than just throwing something out
there for you guys to be able to grab
kind of like the you know thousand
dollars worth of giveaway I'm doing
right now which of course aqua tuning
has helped out by providing the fan
controllers and in the future we've got
even more that we're going to be doing
so I think this is a win-win for
everybody there's no reason for anybody
to freak out any of the reviews that I
do are definitely going to be my own and
it doesn't mean that I'm not able to
review parts from other companies that
can still review any part that I want I
can still do any kind of video that I
want and I give one hundred percent
honest opinion from myself when it comes
to anything that I review whether it be
from aqua tuning or any other company
but it does mean that I'm going to have
a little bit more exclusive access to
some parts that may not be right away
available to the public to give you guys
first-hand accounts and first world
first exclusives and you know you guys
are going to be on the cutting edge of
some of the coolest things that you
could possibly do for your pc so hope
you guys understand the reason why that
we did this weird there because we want
the money we want to do the money's no
we don't want the money Arnold if you do
what they could do the choppers we hit
the Bible Chapas I'm just gonna cut this
video off now before it gets even
weirder than it already did guys I'm
doing this for you
for the future of the channel it's been
a crazy year and I can't wait to see
what the next year as to bring do me a
favor look in the description check out
aqua tunings facebook page go and say hi
tell them j sencha tell them that you're
really looking forward to seeing what
kind of partnership aqua tuning and Jays
two cents can bring you guys in the
future and with that there's only one
thing left to do there's only one thing
left to say get down you do the job this
is crazy we got to get out here what
this happening to me I'm going crazy
