figured that since I'm doing an AMD
video today I might as well at least
wear my red shirt but I said on Twitter
a little while back that I wanted to do
more affordable product reviews so today
we're gonna be taking a look at two new
graphics cards offered by AMD the RX 470
and the RX 460 and they're actually two
different custom variants that we're
taking a look at which is kind of ironic
cuz I'm still waiting on some custom for
ATS to come my way but that's really
kind of besides the point we're going
take a look today at the msi RX 470
gaming X and we're going to taking a
look at the XFX rx 460 a lot of X's and
these in these titles this time around
with its wide 30 Hertz to 144 Hertz
freesync refresh rate the Nick CS view
24 inch 1080p gaming monitor brings new
meaning to buttery smooth gaming want to
learn more then check out the links
including my review down in the
description now obviously the two cards
I'm pitting against the RX for 80 today
are a ib or add-in boards which means
they are custom built cards designed by
their respective manufacturers in this
case MSI and XFX and the rx 40 that I
have is a reference card which means
there's no additional boost clock
there's no overclock applied in fact
even the cooler can barely keep things
under control so to try and keep things
fair I did the exact same settings I did
on the our X 480 review which is where I
bumped up the fan curve to try and keep
it from doing any sort of dynamic
frequency control and causing the core
clocks to slow down I figured that would
keep this test as fair as possible
considering we are looking at
aftermarket cooling solutions on the two
cards that work introducing today and
one other thing is the driver being used
on all three cards today is the latest
AMD driver at the time of making this
video sixteen point eight point two
which is available for download on AMD's
website so without any further yammering
I'm going to go ahead and present to you
guys the RX 400-series lineup and how
they stack transition
you
you
so those are the benchmarks guys and
there's a couple things that actually
surprised me about this and I want to
talk about that today the RX 470 is very
close to the RX 480 and if you actually
take a look at the variants of these
cards I do have a 4 gigabyte 470 versus
an 8 gigabyte 480 now there are 8
gigabyte versions of the 470 available
as well but what's kind of interesting
about that is it bumps the price of an 8
gigabyte 470 up to the base price of an
8 gigabyte 480 and I don't know if I
could recommend an 8 gigabyte for 70
over an 8 gigabyte 480 because you're
still going to get better core
performance out of the 480 if you can
find the unicorn custom board that that
are floating around out there that still
are waiting and slowly making their way
to the reviewers to check out so
obviously I would have liked to have
taken a look at a custom 480 versus
custom 470 and 460 but as you guys can
see the 470 in its MSI variant and its
OC profile and it does ship actually
with the gaming profile enabled but
obviously for this test I enabled the OC
profile so it ran twelve hundred and
fifty-four megahertz only twelve
megahertz slower than the rx 40 is 1266
but obviously a custom 480 would be
higher than that but you gotta admit
though for the hundred $99 price tag the
4 gigabyte card ships at its really
really close to the RX 480
now the other card obviously we took a
look at here was the very budget-minded
rx 460 from XFX it's only a 2 gigabyte
card 128 bit memory bus and really it
comes in it I think today at about 129
dollars based on new egg pricing you
know it's not going to really break next
when it comes to performance in fact the
2 gigabytes is a limitation and a lot of
games if you start to turn up any of the
settings especially things like
anti-aliasing so the RX 460 really fits
into the budget minded gamer that's
never going to consider going above
1080p with it and is happy with medium
to low settings but then again
considering the fact that the card is
completely silent just like the RX 4 70
it makes no noise it's a small card that
makes the XFX rx 460 perfect for small
form-factor builds travel systems and
even home theater pcs
because it can do 4k playback with no
problem whatsoever and it's absolutely
silent but in terms of gaming though
what you saw in those benchmarks were
identical settings to every test I've
ever done which is pretty much maxing
out the settings or getting fairly close
to that so the numbers you see with the
460 are pretty much going to be
worst-case scenarios bump down those
settings a little bit and the FPS will
go up now I'm going to do another video
in the future about overclocking these
guys I didn't try to overclock the 470
or the 460 they deserve it especially
the 470 with its custom cooler on there
and it's custom board but I didn't want
this video to be too long so I think
we're going to do that in another video
and I'm still trying to get my hands on
some custom 480 guys so that we can see
exactly you know what the whole lineup
has to bring but if you look at the
price points 129 199 for the 4 gig for
70 and 239 for the 8 gig based model 480
there's a lot of performance to be had
for under $300 and I think that $199 4
gig for 70 is definitely a sweet spot so
there you go guys obviously there is
some fierce competition taking place at
the $200 price point because Nvidia also
announced its 1063 gigabyte variant
which I'm kind of dubbing the 1050 Ti
honestly because it's got some shaved
cuda cores and stuff but yeah that's
kind of besides the point let me know in
the comments or the like button or on
Twitter or whatever if you guys want me
to take this these cards and put them
against the new 1063 gigabyte card that
card exists only to compete with the
ones we just took a look at and I've not
compared those cards yet so I have no
idea how that's actually going to stack
up so if you guys want me to do that
test let me know also - like I said I
will be doing overclocking on the 470
and a little bit on the 460 to see
exactly how much performance you can
squeeze out of 200 bucks I mean it's
nothing more fun than taking a graphics
card and just ringing out the FPS
maximizing that FPS per dollar alright
guys time to go thanks for watching this
video share it with people you think
will help and as always I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
