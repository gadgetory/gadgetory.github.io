and we are at the South Hall here at CES
2015 button come with me as we walked
through the hall and check out some of
the coolant interesting stuff that is
gonna be new for 2015
you
ok so we've wandered over here to razor
here at CES 2015 and we are taking a
look at the razor turret now the turret
is their solution to multimedia pc input
output or not really output but input
for a mouse and keyboard now we've
actually got a magnetic mouse here on a
small mouse pad that can actually hold
its magnetic force up to about a 45
degree angle so as you're moving around
in your lazy boy your recliner your
couch not going to be fumbling around
trying to find your mouse now this is
actually a bluetooth or pointed device
as well as the keyboard now in Bluetooth
4.0 mode you actually get up to four
months battery life on this and it only
takes two hours to charge once the
battery does finally die now does also
have a 2.4 gigahertz Wireless setting on
there as well a little bit less battery
life but if you don't have bluetooth on
the device you're connecting it to you
do have that option as well but what's
neat is when you're done using this you
always have this the complication of
where to put it wires everywhere how to
store it well it actually folds flat and
if you look right here on the coffee
table you can see we actually have a
wireless docking station here are not
wireless kasumi it's got a contact
docking station but with a single
charger plug on the back and you simply
take your turret you plug it in like
this it's charging same thing with the
mouse you plug that in and it's charging
so two hours to charge on both four
months battery life on the keyboard and
Bluetooth and about 40 hours battery
life on the mouse under continuous use
this is something we're going to be
looking at maybe in q2 we will be doing
a review on the channel and excited for
this since I'm starting to get the wife
and myself more into multimedia PC and
this is a very good nite solution for
mouse and keyboard so guys thanks for
taking a look today at the razor turret
here at the razor booth at CES
so if you guys have been following
technology for any length of time
chances are you have heard the name
monoprice chances are you've also heard
that name because you were shopping for
inexpensive cables but one thing you
need to be aware of his mana price is
actually much more than just inexpensive
cables they have a huge range of
products that they actually carry their
OEM and odm for a lot of different
technologies like security systems 3d
printers home theater entertainment
centers TVs monitors headphones
microphones they have a massive catalog
and they're actually local to me so I
like to check out some of their stuff if
you guys are looking for just some cool
OEM or odm in expensive type stuff
that's going to give you some great
quality then make sure you guys check
out monoprice
ok so we've waddled our way over here to
DX racer and I'm actually really excited
about this one I've not had a chance to
actually sit in their chairs in person
I've seen all the hype I've seen the
website but it's always been you know
how do they fit I've always been a
little leery considering I'm a big guy
I'm 6 foot 4 300 pounds I know it's
surprise right but anyway they have
chairs here that are designed for all
body types that got gaming chairs that
stay real low to the ground ergonomic
desk chairs spinal support and stuff in
the moment i sat in their king chair you
know that's it that's like well it's
King I'm as well sit in it but once i
sat in all of the pressure was actually
relieved from my spine and I was very
very comfortable now i work an IT a lot
of people don't know that and i sit a
lot if you can't tell i said a lot and
of course having a bad back like i do it
becomes very very painful to sit for
long periods of time so they have agreed
to put their money where their mouth is
and they are going to send me one of
their king series chairs to test out and
see how it actually performs on a big
guy like me for long-term sitting so
stay tuned for that but DX racers got
some really cool stuff they're showing
off here you guys live in the USA or
anywhere in the world really and you
guys are interested in a very ergonomic
gaming chair desk chair whatever it may
be definitely check these guys out we're
gonna go ahead and start wandering
around CES a little more and see what
kind of trouble we can get into maybe
we'll run into another youtuber or
something who knows alright guys let's
go
hey guys so we have wandered over here
to the Sennheiser booth and I'm talking
with Scott now Scott's going to show us
a product here that's kind of a addition
to a product line that's been around for
a couple of years we're talking about
the Sennheiser momentum so Scott I don't
pretend to know a lot about audio so I'm
gonna go ahead and let you explain this
we're we're looking at we are looking at
the second generation of momentum
products so we have both wired and now
wireless which is the really the big the
big hit for us here for the CES show a
couple of new updates that we've made is
now we have a folding design for
portability which we saw in the
urbanites as well yes we have bluetooth
4.0 NFC and the wireless as well as
active noise canceling and with the
around here it's a little bit wider ear
cup so we're able to get better passive
isolation which is also help enhance the
bass response as well excellent yeah
they look very very comfortable the is
real leather real real leather very
plush very soft very form-fitting so you
were you were talking about the base off
camera a little bit tell me about how
the how the bass sounds on these well
with a noise cancelling headphone it's
kind of very very much a characteristic
that some of your sound will diminish
with that because the electronics are
kind of counteracting those same
frequencies the great thing with the
momentum is that doesn't happen so we're
not losing any bass response we're not
losing mid-range or treble or really you
know taking anything away from the
overall sound experience which is very
neutral but you know Pleasant longer
listening times and something that
really says you know you don't want to
take them off excellent yeah they look
very comfortable they I mean I like the
style of them that leather stitching in
there guys these are the brand new
wireless momentum here from sennheiser
and of course gotta give a shout out to
sennheiser for providing us once again
our CES coverage with the audio
equipment to keep being sound and great
as always guys make sure you check out
the sennheiser website if you have any
questions and maybe i will take a look
at these in the future who knows but
thanks for watching guys we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
