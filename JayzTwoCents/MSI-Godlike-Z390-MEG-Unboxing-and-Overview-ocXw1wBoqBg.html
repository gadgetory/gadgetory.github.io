rock you've probably heard by now that
the intel 9900 K and ninth gen family of
processors has been announced they'll be
available for purchase later on in
October and we can't really show you
anything performance wise until then but
we can at least start talking about it a
little bit and show you some components
so we are gonna go ahead and kick things
off here by taking a first look here at
the MSI z3 90 godlike Meg yeah Intel's
launching a new platform for this but
that's a point in discussion on its own
but yeah we're gonna see what MSI is
bringing to the table with the very
first motherboard that we are looking at
for this new line of processors a strafe
RGB mark 2 from Corsair features genuine
Cherry MX switches perky RGB
backlighting USB pass-through for
convenient access and dedicated
multimedia keys with integrated volume
knob making it a great value for gamers
in keyboard enthusiasts alike learn more
about the strafe RGB mark 2 by visiting
the link down below so this video it's
not gonna be about Intel 9th gen
specifically there's a lot of
information out there I didn't go to the
event I liked it to stay home and spend
some time with family so please go and
check out some of my colleagues out
there like gamers Nexus Paul from Paul's
Hardware Kyle from bit wet hardware
conducts those guys were all there I
believe and you can find information on
their channels that go a little bit more
into depth what I will say though is it
is a of course a pricing point of
contention as always because the 8700 K
when it launched it was obviously coffee
lake 6 cores 12 threads with
hyper-threading on an i7 and it was more
expensive than the 7700 K which was
roughly ish the same price as a 6700 K
and they are calling this an i-9 and
9900 K don't confuse that with the
typical 900 series that you would see
like the 79 80 XE which was on X 299
this is a Z 370 main stream platform
processor so don't make the mistake of
pairing it with the wrong motherboard
just putting that out there also to
those rumors said it does work perfectly
fine on a z3 70 motherboards so we will
be testing that when we do our full
performance review but obviously to get
all the features you're gonna want these
the 390 chipset which was kind of the
same thing they did with the 8700 k now
in terms of pricing this processor is
to be over $500 which puts it
significantly more expensive than the
2700 X which is obviously I think where
a lot of us are going to be doing our
testing because you can actually get a
2700 X 4 under 400 leaving you enough
money to buy the processor and a
motherboard on AMD for the same price of
just the processor that's currently
launched on Intel obviously there is a
pricing model that everyone's following
in 2018 which is Jack the price as high
as you possibly can which really sucks
because this is now the time to build a
computer if you're going to everyone's
kind of shown all their cards you know
it's coming you know when it's coming
you know the pricing so you're gonna be
able to now make informed decisions
without being worried something new is
gonna come out down the line so here it
is right here the EMA side meg z3 90
god-like it is the god-like series from
MSI has always been there fully like
their full built Titanic when it comes
to a motherboard it has all the features
and it's basically holding nothing back
it's overclocking friendly this has a 16
phase power delivery system on it and it
is definitely a behemoth did I say right
this time behemoth there's a lot of
features on here this is a very crowded
motherboard this this is a very top of
the line product what I'd like is back
in the day MSI used to color code their
motherboards based on the tier that it
was yellow was for overclocking remember
the empower X power then you had the
blue which was mainstream so you have a
blue motherboard meant to mainstream it
had some overclocking features some
gaming features but kind of just sort of
a no-frills and then we had red which
was all their gaming stuff well they've
kind of done away with that now and as
you can see we have a nice monochromatic
gunmetal sort of a titanium look which
is a lot more premium looking and it's
also gonna not clash with color scheme
so they're not forcing a color down your
throat and as I thank you for that
because nothing is more annoying than
having a great motherboard that's the
wrong color and then you don't use it
because of a superficial decision like
that I digress so that was a tangent so
here we go here is the motherboard
layout right here if you look at all
these chokes right here you can tell
there is a massive power delivery on
this 16 phases to give extremely clean
power so that this can be used for
extreme overclocking you can also tell
us to use for extreme over
clocking because of the dual eight pin
EPS power right up here close to the CPU
giving plenty of current to the CPU if
you really want to push this and go for
world records and stuff which obviously
is going to take place once this
launches up here at the top you also
have three fan headers for while
technically five one two oh six one two
three four five six fan headers right
here which is kind of nice because that
gives them close proximity to things
like your AIO coolers your fans that are
up at the top of the case or the back of
the case and it really kind of sucks
when motherboards will only put or
manufacture to only put one or two CPU
headers at the top and the rest are on
the side or at the bottom when most of
the fans are at the top of the case or
the front of the case speaking of fan
hitters you have another 1 2 3 right
here at the bottom unless I'm missing
one and you've got two more that are
right here in this shield what's right
next to it though is the supplemental
power for the PCI Express Lanes and I
don't like this being in the middle
right here because this is an awkward
place to put it this is something that
should have been down at the bottom if
you ask me because you're gonna be
running this from your PCI Express power
cable from your power supply Renia up
here right on top of your graphics card
is a very strange location so here's the
memory slots right here you can see they
are shielded this is supposed to help
with more stable memory overclocking and
just a better socket design so you're
not you don't have EMF bleeding over
into the sockets near it this right here
is a cue code readout or basically a
trouble code readout so this will show a
number depending on the post code and
you can see where your system freezes if
it doesn't boot and then right below
this here will show this in a second
this is actually an OLED display that is
customizable
now this over here is actually an
infinity window this is just a design
aesthetic that looks like it goes down
well for infinity because there's
mirrors under there of course you've got
the Meg logo which is going to light up
right there you've got the MSI dragon
which is a part of every single product
but what I'm really happy about and I'm
so glad they did this dual USB 3.0 front
header connections that are next to each
other nothing is more annoying than
having USB 3.0 header over here and
another one down here because these are
very thick cables with at least 3 C's
that are pain-in-the-ass to route and
then having to have them split and go
off different directions just make the
aesthetics
look terrible so the fact that they did
that is a huge plus I think them for
that the second I saw them that I saw
that I practically wanted to give my rep
a hug because I was like thank you for
doing this
most manufacturers aren't doing that now
let's say that you are and not really an
overclocker but you you hear me
preaching about how overclocking can
give you more performance for free msi
knows that not everyone's comfortable
with that so they've actually got this
overclocking dial right here at the
bottom now this is this actually will
load up different settings in the BIOS
to give you a boost in performance
without having to go in there and
manually overclock it and it does it
within safe parameters so you don't have
to worry about damaging your hardware
because you didn't understand the
settings and you pushed something too
far and then something ends up in magic
blue smoke this knob right here will
allow you to do different overclocks
even while the system is powered on so
you could just turn this knob and it
will self adjust to give you more
performance as long as the cooling
Headroom is there so I would definitely
recommend at least an AI o or a big
Noctua air cooler if you're gonna be
doing something like that right next to
it you've got a surface mounted reset
and power button which is nice because
we're gonna use this on a test bench and
then down here we also have a BIOS
switch because this is a dual BIOS
motherboards you could run some crazy
BIOS settings for testing and then just
flip back to standard if you want to use
it as your regular desktop we've got
three onboard m2 with what they're
calling their shield frozer now this is
this is not the first time we have seen
something like this from MSI where we
have what's considered to be passive
cooling for m2 now if you're not aware
m2 or nvme SSDs are extremely fast but
as such they also can get extremely hot
under constant read/write conditions so
MSI had actually come out with this this
cover on their previous motherboard for
the Z 370 that Steve from gamers Nexus
found to be a little bit lacking in
design and only touched one side of the
end dot - not the other it created a bit
of a heat pocket only half the chips are
being cooled if you had dual sided and
nvme chips or PCB which many of them are
now because capacities are increasing
but as you can see we now have an awful
lot of thermal pads on here creating a
situation where it's actually touching
both sides of the m2 now
say they put a lot of R&amp;amp;D into this a
lot of testing because they really are
afraid of stiva gamers Nexus no they
don't actually say that but they they
want to make the community happy they
agreed that there was improvement to be
had there if you look at the expansion
card here you can see it's actually only
on one side and I think the reason for
that is the problem with the motherboard
as you can see this is down on the
surface and then you have graphics cards
on top of it and it's impossible for air
to get down there but with this being
like this air can actually come in
through the back and through the bottom
and the top wherever airflow is because
as you can see there is a big gap under
there so it's actually touching the side
of the chips that would be blocked but
the bottom side is not being you know
it's not actually touching any thermal
pads or anything like that so I guess
one could say that they technically
didn't have to put this on there at all
they could have just mounted the nvm
ease and let them be air cooled but
without the top plate touching it I
guess maybe there should be some testing
done with that I have find out Steve he
will test this so let's go ahead and
power this on and see what it looks like
with it all lit up alright so let's take
a look at some of the lighting here so
as you can see the OLED that true gaming
and you can program that down there to
actually be anything that you want so I
can make it say J's two cents the best
YouTube channel in the history of
YouTube I mean it would be alive but hey
as you can see because we have no CPU in
there it's telling us CPU error so this
is extremely user friendly and
identifying what is wrong with your
system and why it's not posting can also
see that infinity window check that out
you see that window how it just kind of
goes on for freedom
I was gonna say something else after
that and I don't know what side whatever
and beyond there we go you can see the
mag is lit up and then look at the
dragon see how the dragon just sort of
glows through there it's not like RGB in
your face this is our GB you can make it
RGB but they have it just sort of
glowing red out of the box so I think
that this is a very very good
implementation of features to make Z 390
at least something exciting to talk
about when it comes to motherboards
because I feel like motherboards are the
unsung hero they are responsible for so
much of your computer they responsible
for everything
but they don't get any of the glory the
glory always goes to the graphics card
because you get so many FPS but the
motherboard is responsible for
everything it's your mom you respect
your mom or she whoops your ass when
you're out of line at least she used to
now you get in trouble if you do that
but my mom she was German she did not
spare the rod okay so we're gonna go
ahead and end it there obviously we're
gonna do a build with this we're gonna
do all kinds of stuff with Zee 390 and
testing and probably another
overclocking session with Steve and Paul
I think that's become a bit of a
tradition now as something new comes out
we overclock it until it breaks or
someone gives up or whatever and then
when they give up then you swoop in and
take the score they see try and make
them think that you gave up well they
moved on to other things but we didn't
really cuz I care about my ego and I
want to be good so I digress but anyway
you know in fact Phil even made a good
point he's like this is the first MSI
motherboard he's seen that doesn't look
ridiculous because some of the some of
the ways motherboard manufacturers in
the past have gotten your attention by
the motherboard being on a wall at Fry's
Electronics or Micro Center or whatever
is to make it basically jump up and down
and scream and wave its arms going hey
look at me but the problems and you look
at it you go hey look how ridiculous
that my motherboard looks but not this
one it's all black and gunmetal and RGB
goodness but not RGB when you turn it on
which is really nice so anyway you guys
Tim what you think in the comments down
below like I said we will be doing full
builds with Z 390 tests we're gonna be
doing all the hyper threading testing on
the i7 or at I 9 to not hyper threading
and i7 seeing how things have progressed
but until then we're gonna go guys let
us know what other products who wants to
take a look at with the Z 390 launch and
we will of course check it out thanks
for watching and as always we will see
you in the next one really glad instruct
myself on the back of that I was all
worried
oh wow those are lit up I didn't okay
alright well okay there's that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
