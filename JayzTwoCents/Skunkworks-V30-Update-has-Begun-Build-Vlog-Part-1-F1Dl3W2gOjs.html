click the link in the description to
learn more ok so this is actually take 2
of this intro so I've already started
taking some of the parts off
unfortunately I'm a noob and I didn't
check the audio levels then there were
none
anyway we're finally tearing apart
skunkworks
as you can see check it out blurry and
everything Hey look a finger umm yeah so
here it is the backside the booty end of
skunkworks
so we're going to be doing a few things
here not only that we're gonna clean
some dust
if so gross it's funny how many people
say you can't use air flow fins because
you won't get any if they like you mean
look at all that dust obviously we're
getting plenty of airflow so let's go
ahead and talk about real quick what it
is that we are doing with this build
blurry so this build is more than just
upgrade of graphics cards you guys know
I've been going to I've been teasing
forever that I'm putting in a threeway
Titan X video or video cards but I'm
doing more than that I'm actually
relocating the pumps I'm putting in
different radiators I'm adding a
different radiator I'm redoing the
tubing I'm going from acrylic to ptg and
I'm going to change the whole layout and
changing the hard drives putting in all
new cables so it's more than just video
cards that's why this is taken so
freaking long so for those of you who
have never seen this build before I have
no idea what I'm even talking about with
this system skunk works is kind of a
Nakoma cumulation of awesome things that
I've collected on this channel in focus
my hand is like totally pushing the
focus right
oh look there's like a jet fighter
flying over we don't look too far from
some military bases so every now and
then we get like really loud jets that
fly over so skunkworks is more than just
and over-the-top extremely expensive
stupidly ridiculously overkill PC it's
it's an accumulation of things that I've
collected on this channel as the channel
is grown I continue to build on and
build up skunkworks because it's more
like a centerpiece of but I kind of
consider an accomplishment with the
channel so the system is more than just
a system it's actually cut for me it's
kind of a symbol of the growth of the
channel so that's why I put so much time
and effort into the system but it's got
a 59 60 X in there fully water-cooled
right now it's got 3-way 980 s in it
harddrive situation still isn't great
it's got a 500 gigabyte 840 Evo in there
it's also got a 256 gigabyte m6e Plextor
SSD and it's got a 2 terabyte and a one
terabyte drive I'm going to be changing
it out to 2 4 terabyte drives and it
might be put on I'm going to be putting
in another 500 gigabyte SSD so because
I've actually been running out of some
storage for games believe it or not I
mean with games like Grand Theft Auto 5
taken up 60 gigabytes and hardline taken
up 50 gigabytes in battlefield 4 take it
up 50 gigabytes you can see how fast you
run out of SSD space so I'm going to be
putting in I may be replacing the 256
actually the another 500 so at 2 500
gigabyte SSDs then I'm at 8 terabytes of
hard drive Western Digital black storage
so I haven't decided if I'm going to
raid those I don't think I'm going to
raid them because I want each Drive to
have a separate purpose I'm also not a
fan of software raid now have a RAID
controller card nor would it look good
in this build so I'm going to be going
specifically with each card having a
different purpose one being a YouTube
Drive and one being like a redundant
backup so yes I know raid can do
redundant backup by the way I just
explained why I don't want to do raid
for all of those armchair quarterbacks
out there anyway we're going to
completely tear this thing down we're
gonna be putting in all new soft tubing
all new fittings and everything so this
is a bigger job than
and I think many people were expecting
it to be so without further ado let's
get building oh yeah one other thing I'm
not going to be doing like live video as
it's happening because I don't have a
camera man I'm here by myself and that
would take me forever and a day to get
done and I just don't have that kind of
time so we're gonna be doing updates and
that's just gonna have to do there's no
other way that it can be done at some
point I might pull up my GoPro and the
headband strap things you guys can get a
maybe a first-person fov on there of
what it's like when I'm working on it
but today's goal is is really going to
be just tear down the system get the
case cleaned I've got a new mid panel
going in there so I can change where the
fittings were I'm going to change all
the layout and so today's main goal is
to get the system torn down and cleaned
because it is filthy alright enough
yakking let's go ahead and get some work
done now I'm sure there's gonna be a lot
of people out there going damn Jay what
the hell you just got new core or cables
why are you getting new ones well as you
can see right there this is paracord and
the paracord stains really badly if it
touches up against anything dark-colored
in that dirt that you see right there
was actually transferred from the rubber
grommets by doing nothing more than
pushing them through so we went ahead
and went back with a plastic sleeve that
way we could get it you know so that
it's not staining like this so yeah
that's that's the reason why we just
took out all these cables so that we
could actually redo it with the color or
not the color but the material that's
not going to stain but she looks kind of
naked now it's like literally computer
porn well I'm not going to lie my dream
system is a bit of a bitch you can see I
even cut a hose right there the problem
with this was I could drain it enough to
work on it without any problems but
getting everything in the basement out
such a pain in the ass because all those
tubes that ran from those fittings to
those fittings the coolant would just
get trapped right there where they
crossed over and there was no way to get
it out so I just ended up having to make
a big ol mess as you can see yellow
coolant everywhere but oh well it just
means now when I go in
do this one and I redo it I'm going to
want to make sure I keep the drain
system a little bit more in mind but oh
well live and learn
jeez a neighbor's dog is annoying listen
he does that all day
hate that dog and oh there was a drip
you see that so that's why I've got it
lined right now with paper towels and
like rags because it's just still
dripping and we still have some coolant
trapped in the upper rad as well as the
CPU block so oh well I got a completely
clean this thing out anyway so might as
well alright so this is what skunkworks
looks like when it's pretty much
completely gutted as you can see there's
no mid panel in there because I got a
new one that way I can drill the holes
where they matter all the radiators were
taken out they are over there as you can
see because we are going to be putting
in new black guys
GTS radiators and I'm going to be doing
a 560 on the bottom with a 280 on the
backside so we have a cross-flow
and I'm doing a new 480 on the top but
they're all 30ml or 35 millimeter
radiators so they're thinner but they're
higher fin density and it will give me
more room to work with and I am pretty
sure adding the 280 even though the
thinner rads are going to give me better
cooling for the GPUs I know some people
right now are probably like what the
hell what do you mean thinner radiators
are going to give you better cooling but
if you actually look at a lot of the
heating charts you'll see that thicker
rads and thinner rads of the same
surface area meaning a 5 60 45 versus a
560 35 or 30 are going to have like one
or two degrees difference at the most
when it comes to complete watts
dissipated so it's not going to be
hurting me and actually adding the 280
back there which is gonna be half the
length of the case is going to give me a
lot more surface area I'm hoping to get
the cards down into the 40s under load
that's my goal anyway so we're going to
have 1 2 3 4 5 6 140 millimeters worth
of radiator cooling for the bottom for
the three Titans that's just absolutely
insane I mentioned this is an overhaul
and one of the things I always said
about skunk works was it never had
storage worth mention
there was just like a hodgepodge of
drives and it didn't make sense what
we're putting in eight terabytes worth
of Western Digital black to four
terabyte drives again not going to be in
raid I already said that and I took out
my 256 gigabyte m6e Plextor SSD and
replaced it with the HyperX you can see
in there and then I already had the 500
gigabyte Evo so we have one terabyte or
the ves SD and 8 terabytes worth of hard
drive storage yeah I would rather just
have a one terabyte SSD and then maybe
another 500 gig or even just to one
terabytes of SSDs that would be amazing
but yep that's all I've got all right
we're done for the day it might not look
like much has changed into a last
segment or clip or whatever but I scrub
the crap out of this case this case is
like spotless it is as nice as the day I
got it so we're starting all over with
this thing making it look brand-new and
I thought you guys would get a kick out
of this
you see these tubes right here that's
all the acrylic that was in skunk works
I know it looked like so much more when
it was all together and had fluid going
through it but that's it everything else
was soft tubing down in the bottom
that's all that showed so I am going to
be putting more acrylic tubing up top I
like the idea of it being very not
cluttered but I like the idea there
being a lot of tubing so I thought that
was kind of interesting but we did get a
little bit farther though than just
cleaning up I assembled the new pumps
here as I mentioned I'm bringing the
pumps from the floor up into the top of
the case and so these are going to be
going you know up in there you can see
we got the pump and everything on there
it's pretty much the exact same
reservoir bass and d5 top that Paul used
for his arctic panther build and so I
liked it so much I decided to get two of
them for this build and then we create
different tops on the reservoirs that
way I can actually have input to the top
if I need it so yep systems completely
cleaned ready to go new mid panels ready
to get fitted and drilled for the new
holes and where they're necessary
because I still have to
it tubes down to the radiator and both
radiators in the bottom here so I still
have to drill those tubes but anyway
there's the the 980 s right there and no
people were like hey J you do giveaway
do giveaway to giveaway no I'm not
giving away these 980 s sorry I said
very Canadian or they're sori sori a I'm
not giving away the 980 s they're going
to be repurposed other things other
times so anyway
stop asking for my 980 s so that's it
for today thanks for hanging out guys
while we take a well take apart skunk
works this is now the third time I have
completely disassembled this system in
nine months ten months it's a lot of
work but damn it's fun like I said this
this system is like the symbol of the
channel so that's why it's kind of fun
to tear it apart and rebuild it that's
kind of what you have to do is youtuber
you kind of have to keep changing and
evolving and trying to keep it fresh and
that's exactly what the system is all
about
so anyway I'm gonna go out with Adi on a
date with the wife tonight and then
tomorrow I don't know when this video is
going up it should be going up tomorrow
technically which is Wednesday today is
Tuesday I'm only going to get to work on
it tomorrow and then part of Thursday
because I'm going to be taking a mini
vacation this weekend taking a little J
down to the zoo and SeaWorld and all
that stuff so we will not be working on
it this weekend will be continuing next
week so anyway guys thanks for watching
hope you guys have enjoyed and as always
see you the next one and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
