right now because I feel like crap and I
know you guys want to hear that but I'm
giving you at least a little bit of an
excuse as to why I sound this way but I
still wanted to make a video for you
guys so I figured I know I said I wasn't
gonna do Bill Bob I'm still not doing a
bill dog I'm keeping my promise on that
I figured we'll just kind of do a
project update that's what we're calling
it a project update on the parvum
building let's play about this I've
never come up with a name for it I never
came up with a name for it maybe I maybe
I want you guys is help on that maybe I
don't I don't know the fraggle design r5
is so amazing it fits all kinds of cool
hardware in there water cooling air
cooling and on top of that it's silent
and it's awesome like explosions or like
Hawaiian explosions but I figured since
it's been a while since I've talked
about it and I teased it in some videos
and I showed in the background of some
other videos and it's been all over
Instagram if you guys aren't following
Instagram you should be because then you
would know a lot more about this build
we're gonna go ahead and talk about it
and do a project update on the parvum
build all right well there she is she's
not done as much as it may look like
it's done trust me it's not done it's
got a lot to go I'm not going to give a
full case review right now because we're
going to do that in the future but as
you may have guessed or you can just
tell by looking at it this case is all
acrylic in fact looking at the company
literature and the pamphlet that came
with the case this is not only acrylic
its recycled acrylic so this is like
green environment stuff right here
now it does have a 120 millimeter fan in
the front which we have a radiator on as
you can see right there that is a black
ice GTS 120 on the front and then as you
can see right there we have a 240 on the
top we do have BitFenix Spectre Pro fans
on there and then you can see we've got
our custom cables I've got a gigabyte g1
gaming GTX 970 with ek waterblock on
there very very sexy and then you can
see we've got a whole lot of fittings in
there
with bits power 10 by 12 millimeter
acrylic tube you guys already saw the
video I did where I built that pump out
you can see I had to swap it for a
smaller res the res didn't really fit in
there without it got too close to that
right there so I couldn't actually fit
that fitting so that was a bit of a
problem even that res on there is too
tall to wear I couldn't stand it up
without it impacting on the card right
there on the back we do have a gelid 80
millimeter fan and I needed to get more
intake in this in this case so that's
pool is an intake front rad is pulled as
an intake and then as you can see I
still have to sleeve this stuff right
here but it's just kind of tucked away
res is not mounted down yet res has to
actually come up slightly like that much
literally to fit perfectly as you can
see we've got some tension going on that
fitting right there so I need to Rhett
raise my dollars oh no wait that's
something else diving I need to raise
the res up just a little bit I still
have to drill the acrylic and mount it I
do have parvum sending me another one of
these blocks as you can see these little
Junction blocks is how the whole thing
assembles together because I want to put
one in the middle to combat a little bit
of sag that I'm getting speaking of sag
as you can see the GPU does sag a little
bit sorry for that sniffle not kidding I
really am freaking sick and I'm still
doing this but figure we'll do a simple
vlog style you guys really like this and
this is how all of skunkworks was done
but you can't see the 970 is sagging a
little bit I need to come up with a way
to reinforce this just a little bit like
from there to there you get that click
its clicking on the back of the case so
they'll freak out also too because this
motherboard I'm using which is the EVGA
z97 stinger it does not have a GPU clip
I have no idea why EVGA did that I don't
understand so now the graphics card can
actually pull out of the back portion so
much that moves the GPU can actually
pull slightly out of the socket if it
wants to so I've got a dilemma here I've
got to find a way to secure this card in
there a little better I'm not happy with
the way that that
art is secured part of the problem too
is just I understand why part of them
went this route but the rear plate just
pushes against the back of the GPU to
hold it in place that in itself is not a
problem but that coupled with this being
a clipless PCI Express port on this
motherboard those two together creates a
problem I would never ever ship this
case and that's kind of a problem for
you because I thought that this would be
an awesome land rig considering going
someplace like port and unless I Drive
which is not going to be super likely
then I don't dare ship this thing so
anyway let's go and talk about the water
cooling loop as you can see we have a
lot of chrome bits power fittings in
there we do have the ek water block back
there as a supremacy Evo camera doesn't
know what to focus on we've got as I
said a DD C Lang DD C pump with the put
together here with the ek heat speech
she's came to talk heat sink with the
bits power palm palm top as well as the
reservoir for that so the reason why I
am using these 90s because I've been
asked a shit-ton why I'm doing this and
I'm not bending it considering I'm such
a an advocate for bending well one of
the reasons why is because this is ten
by twelve millimeter tube and not 13 by
10 millimeter so this is much thinner
wall tubing then say going with like the
Primo chill ptg stuff I've been using
for other builds so bending it and it's
acrylic so because it's thin and bending
it also weakens it more especially when
you heat it up I don't want this thing
to have any chance of cracking so it
made more sense for me to just go ahead
and go with these fittings than it is to
bend this now this adds a crap-ton of
cost to that now people ask me all the
time - where to buy all this sort of
stuff all of the components here with
the exception of CPU motherboard Ram and
GPU it came from performance - pcs comm
so huge shout out to those guys the
other guys
actually funded this build for me to be
able to kind of have fun with a parvum
case and put whatever I wanted in there
and not worry about the costs so huge
thank you to those guys they have kind
of taken it up the rear a little bit
especially with the cost of these
fittings because not only do I have all
those I didn't know exactly how many I
would need so I've cut even more right
here and if you figure these are at
least 10 to 12 bucks a pop man they're
expensive and then there's the box of
stuff for the part that still needs to
make its way in there like lighting and
and all that crap so yeah there's been a
lot of money that has gone into this
build just for the sake of building out
something fun for you guys so but yeah I
still - sleeve this I still have to
sleep some more cables you can see back
there the cable sleeves themselves were
actually done by a company called
sanctum sleeving and sanctum has
definitely done some good work for me
they're the guys who also did the skunk
work stuff as you can see right there so
they did all that cables leaving for me
and not only did they give me the cables
but they also give me a ton of extra
sleeving stuff since I told them hey you
know what I'm probably have to sleep
some more stuff I don't know exactly how
I need to be done can you send me some
supplies and this is what they sent me
so awesome awesome thank you for that
this is a 24 pin that we ended up not
using in this bill because it was too
short I originally had it going through
that hole back there it was too tight of
a Bend the power supplies right there
I'll show you in a second so they on
rush order got me that other 24 pin
which you see back there that runs all
the way to the front of the case and
comes back which actually put them
behind on some orders and got some
people really mad at them so sorry
sanctum but thank you for repairing that
or redoing that for me quickly these are
the other cables for power supply to go
to two SATA drives and then my lights
and my pump so these are the side panels
here for the case what I'll show you
right there is as you can see they have
custom edge to one of those to say J's
two cents on the side so that's pretty
freakin awesome I've never had a case
said J's two cents on it this is not
actually like H this is actually
engraved it's like actually cut pretty
deep into the acrylic panel so that's
really nice but let's go ahead and look
at the back of this thing because this
may not look like it but look at the
size of my hand in here this is not easy
this was a super hard build and it's not
done as you can see I've got to rip
everything out of here still even after
we're done you see how like these
fittings don't even have like the clamps
on them at all like this is just mocking
up before I'm drilling holes or anything
to mount the pump and stuff I need to
know how everything is going to be so
this is just a mock-up I still have to
take everything out of here and then
yeah so one thing parvum is also doing
is they're sending me a custom front
panel where instead of saying parvum
right here i'm going to have a really
cool like an arc reactor logo from
Ironman I think it's going to be neat in
there because it's blue behind there
will illuminate it it's going to look
nice but this is the way it comes from
the factory they're able to custom cut
anything you give them for the most part
into this and so this is the way it
comes but you'll see in the future when
it's done when we do the actual build
video how it looks and so I did an arc
reactor logo which was kind of neat and
then as you can see here this is the
back once again look at the size of my
hand to this thing so you can get a
really good idea of just how tight and
crazy this this build is and considering
this is MITx and you saw the size of
that motherboard that should be pretty
good indicator too I mean again here's
my hand it barely fits right there so
yeah these are the custom cut cables and
sleeve cables to length as you can see
sync them did a fantastic job
everything's exactly as I ordered okay
so this right here is where the hard
drives mount they actually mount on
their side like that SSDs this version
of the case only fits two and a half
inch drives it doesn't fit standard hard
drives in there it's off like probably a
good five or six millimeters without
where that it won't fit so yeah I'm
going to be putting a two and a half
inch one terabyte ma let's see laptop
hard drive in there two and half inch
you know HDD for a laptop and I'm
putting a 500 gigabyte
let's say HyperX SSD in there so we'll
have 1.5 terabytes of storage which is
good for a gaming machine we're not
hosting any huge files or anything so
yeah that's what the back looks like
it's Kush it really doesn't look like it
but this is so much work involved
there's what that BitFenix Spectre pro
looks like there in the front and then
bare up there on the top I left these
screws these are just the like steel
screws from Lowe's that I had to use to
mount this I don't know yet if I want to
paint those white or black or just kind
of leave them that color I think it
looks nice because they match the
fittings that are inside that build but
yeah that angle right there just doesn't
give you a good indicator of just how
cramped this build is then man I don't
know what else would but I don't want to
say I chose that 670 over the cryo Venom
r9 290 water-cooled card I have right
there which would have also fit in this
build quite nicely
it comes 100% down to the thermals since
I only have a 240 and a 120 for an
effect of 360 millimeters of radiator I
had to go with what's going to give me
the best thermals so yeah that's that's
why we have the 4790k in there as well
as the 670 a single 360 worth of rad
should be more than enough for that but
everybody test tested these fans out
with the side panels on and they move
plenty of air even with a 80 mil feeding
it in a 120 mil so that's good we'll
just make sure that we run these fans
faster than these fans that way we get
positive pressure in there which is what
we want so anyway that's the part so
obviously this is not a complete build
vlog or even a finished product but I
wanted to give you guys some sort of a
tour of what's been happening in the
meantime proving that I'm not just
sitting around scratching my ass am i am
doing that that's all I'm doing
good for more than just that so I'm
sorry that this video quality and comedy
content wasn't up to par but I wanted to
put something out for you and so got
some more stuff to do on this loop I'll
show you guys the loop order and all
that at the end when I do the review
will do temperatures will do gaming will
see how fast porn loads on this we'll
see exactly how well this machine
performs I expect it to do pretty damn
well considering the amount of hardware
that scram
in here I know we'll talk about doing
porn benchmarks and then cramming of
hardware it see I just realized I
haven't even shaved that's what that's
how much I feel like crap if you guys
watch Tech Talk tonight then you know
 ready it got a little weird all
right when we come back when you see the
skin I promise it's going to be up it's
gonna be running it's going to be liquid
filled and hopefully not leaking all
over the place will do benchmarks
we'll have fun we'll sing Kumbaya we'll
make s'mores and in the morning I'm
making pancakes
cuz I it was waffles protein
pancakes actually alright as always
follow on your favorite social media if
you were following an Instagram or
Twitter you would have seen all of this
already so why aren't you following
you're missing out alright enough about
the shameless plugs I'm learning the
arts of shamelessness through Barna
Cleese is quite a good teacher at that
see you the next one thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
