thank you very much head shot with a
tank that's so going on YouTube
everybody you're watching Jays two cents
where the advice is always free and
today we're bringing you an awesome
video of the launch of armored kill for
PC premium members this is the
battlefield 3 expansion if you're not
familiar it's going to be a lot of tanks
a lot of artillery trucks a big-ass
plane flying around in the air and I'm
here to talk to you about what I think
this expansion is going to be like
before I play it and I'd like to compare
what I think now versus what I feel
after I'm expecting there to be
fast-paced gameplay I'm hoping they sped
it up a little bit when it comes to the
vanilla game it was very slow 45 minute
maps hour-long map and that led to a lot
of people quitting before the match was
even over if one side was just
dominating the other and close-quarters
really brought in the fast-paced feel
the battlefield so I don't think they
can afford to revert that back to a slow
style of gameplay so I'm really hoping
that they did something that will combat
the length of the matches now this
picture here really pissed me off
because as you can see there are two
Vipers in this picture upon doing some
research prior to this and watching some
other reviews on the PlayStation since
those bastards got it a week early there
is not two Vipers in any map so this is
either just a doctored image or
developers screwing around with an idea
or just putting false hope in our heads
but either way let's go ahead and show
you some highlights and some favorite
moments from me experimenting around
with armored kill and we'll circle back
at the end and give you my opinion I am
so screwed here
sucker oh I got nice but is it gonna
kill the guy it did I got an assist I
was killed by a phone number
crying out loud
the tank and it can't just run over a
car hmm
let's go save f
take that
yes yes I knew it I knew it whoa you
scared me bro oh no the gunship oh I got
the big gun to conclude it's not I can't
find bad guy so
you
oh god oh god we're going down yes I
gotta kill just before we before we blew
up s boat yeah the gunship is really
retarded it's stupid why oh it's back up
I'm getting in it mine yes that was like
the longest javelin flight ever it was
doing like loop-de-loops and figure
Eight's and it drew i love you in the
sky before it actually hit its target
but it got it I found an ammo box just
chillin out the middle of the field name
it to sign from God I said I need more
javelins and then there was a random
ammo box
but here
sucks to be him really come on he's just
hovering there finally sheesh
Oh anti-vehicle metal pin and ami bro
who ain't I got zoom optics on this
thing get lower get lower get lower yes
that's three shoppers shot down so far
with the tank destroyer I love it it's
thing is so overpowered whoa oh my God
he's flying oh that's not good roads
where we're going we don't need roads
seriously where are we going here we go
take it the fast way down oh my god
ok
it says oh this is bad for the back
I hereby dub the mountain village Jays
two cents land I'm like the most
ungraceful tank driver ever damn it i
forgot to load out again shit like nice
oh my god dodge flying helicopter parts
that bastard
oh my god what has happened
thought I heard a helicopter there oh my
god how many points they get for that
come on guy oh you've got to be kidding
me
got him ok guys so that was some of the
good stuff but now that I've had
probably the better part of the day to
actually play this expansion I've got to
tell you there wasn't a whole lot
leaving me smiling at the end of the day
I can't quite put my finger on it yet
but there are some main griping points
I'd like to go ahead and bring up while
you watch this particularly bad stretch
of recording that I got here where I
wasn't doing too well and I'll get a
little bit more into detail about what i
think is broken right now one of the
things they changed was the tank no
longer has the double tap ability what
that means is you can no longer fire
your main weapon and then instantly
switch to your secondary weapon and
shoot it if it's using the same cannon
so for instance you couldn't shoot a
shell and then shoot a canister yeah I
understand that's more realistic but I
don't recall that being in the patch
notes maybe it was I don't know if they
snuck it in there secondly the tank
destroyers to me they just seem gosh I
don't know if overpower it is the right
word but they are very fast they're very
nimble they still take a decent amount
of hits to kill and if they have a
reactive armor and they have that 'he
cannon they can really f up &amp;amp; main
battle tank yes I understand they're
called a tech destroyer but i would
think that they'd be a bit easier to
kill or at least disabled with a single
javelin there was one stretch where i
had shot a tank destroyer with two
javelins it wasn't even disabled so go
figure on that one they tend to put all
of the vehicles in the deployment which
yeah I guess that makes sense but if
there if you spawn a deployment and
there's nothing there you are really
really far from the rest of the game so
you're either huffing it for 10 minutes
or you better hitch a ride or hope
somebody comes and picks you up they
also seem to be putting maybe one
vehicle
each cap area haven't quite figured out
what vehicles those are yet that's why I
say it needs a little bit more time
before I can make a true conclusion but
ultimately at the end of the day it just
felt too much like people cared about
getting in these tanks and running
around than actually playing the
objective I understand it's new and that
may change over time people may start
playing the objective map recognition is
obviously a bit low so that makes it
kind of difficult but I'm just not
feeling this expansion the ac-130 is
another main gripe point of mind you
can't repair it so it just continues to
take damage until it explodes which
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense
considering if you own the cat point
that gives you control of the ac-130 and
it gets destroyed it almost instantly
responds so that seems a little bit odd
to me secondly you can't defend from the
bottom of the plane the anti-air guns on
that thing or on the top so if you have
a jet that does a belly strafe on you
there's nothing you can do about it I
was not particularly very good with a
c-130 I had a very hard time getting
kills but I've seen people do just fine
with it so I'm gonna chalk that one up
to me just being bad but it does seem
extremely easy to shoot down there's two
seats in the ac-130 and each seat has
its own Flair and so if you don't have
coordination or any way of communicating
with the second gunner there's a strong
likelihood that you're both going to
flare at the same time which then leaves
you very vulnerable because the flare
durations or the flare cool down is on a
pretty long time er I don't know exactly
what it is but it felt really long
lastly I don't know if there's something
wrong with a javelin or they just made a
mistake somewhere in the code but it
tends to just they're beeping and not
locking on longer than normal and
there's sometimes where it keeps beeping
even after you unequip it or you take
out a different weapon that's extremely
annoying but I noticed that even though
something maybe painted my javelin will
sit there for eight to ten seconds
before it actually gives me a final lock
and by that time it's just useless
because whatever I was locking onto you
may have already driven away or flown
so that's extremely frustrating all in
all it almost feels like there are too
many vehicles I understand its armored
kill and it's the intent and flavor of
the expansion but there are just so many
vehicles running around it's very
difficult to get anything done anyway
this is just my opinion does it mean
that your results will be the same as
mine I'm going to give it some more time
but right now I'm just going to go ahead
and say that I am fairly disappointed I
think I was expecting a little bit more
out of the vehicles I mean the tank
destroyer is just a smaller faster tank
you have the artillery which is kind of
difficult to figure out the arch of the
Rockets I the couple of times I got in
and I couldn't hit jack shit and the ATV
why why is that there I understand it
was in bad company 2 but there's no
point for it it's slower than the Jeep
yeah it's all terrain it can go over a
lot of rocks and stuff that normal
vehicles can't and it's just turned into
another vehicle to put c4 on i just
don't really understand the whole point
of the ATV
well I hope you guys have enjoyed
