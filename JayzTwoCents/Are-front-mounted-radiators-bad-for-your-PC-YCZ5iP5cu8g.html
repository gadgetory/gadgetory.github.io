here when I did the video about my 6700
K build last week a lot of folks
pointing out the fact that there's a
front-mounted radiator on there and you
can't do that because it's going to heat
up everything in your system and it's
terrible and the world is going to end
as far as we know it and it's just bad
for all of your parts and I got to
thinking
I've been putting front mounted
radiators on computers for years and
years and not once has any of those
terrible doomsday type of predictions
ever happened so I thought maybe today
we would just kind of go ahead and do
for the sake of science a video here
about comparing temperatures with the
radiator mounted to the front and seeing
if allowing warmer air to enter the
front of the computer really makes a
huge overall difference
the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro
from Coolermaster combines modularity
with creativity giving you the freedom
to build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description
okay so hardware wise it is an intel
6700 K it is overclocked we'll probably
be doing somewhere around 4.7 for this
test at something like one point three
volts somewhere around there we want to
pump some heat we don't want to we want
to really kind of go for some numbers
here in this test we just run stock
speeds and I don't think anything would
really be affected which is actually a
good thing but we want to see in kind of
a worst-case scenario whether or not the
claims of front mounted radiators are
going to cause problems temperature-wise
for your parts so it's a 6700 K
overclocked corsair h 100 i we do have
in here also a reference titan x of
course they're all reference but it is a
blower style cooler so it's going to be
getting all of its air from inside the
case the case cooling is not going to
have any effect on the temperatures of
the GPU which is why i'm using a blower
style cooler all of its air it's getting
is going to be atmospheric air inside
the case which means if the front
mounted radiator really is warming up
the case then we can go ahead and see
that by using a blower style cooler
because that's the only place that's
getting air if we use the atmospheric
cooler where it's circulating the air
into the case and then the case has to
exhaust it then the case itself is going
to play more of a factor here than where
things are placed so that's why we're
going with the blower
cooler on the tight next we're going to
tight necks because it is the biggest
most powerful hottest GPU core right now
that nvidia has on a single GPU yeah I
mean yeah there's a Titan Z that has two
GPUs but that again is a half exhaust
half recirculating cooler which would
not have worked very well for this test
okay so just to do some baseline numbers
here I have a laser temperature get
probe as well as an air temperature
meter so right now the ambient
temperature here in the room that's
going to restart this is sitting at 24
Celsius or 20 or 75 point well now 75.2
fahrenheit is what the air temperature
is in this room so now before we start
the test I'm going to go ahead and set
this on top of the exhaust fan here I'm
going to let it measure the temperature
of the air exiting the system here for
about 60 seconds or so and then that's
our baseline that's where we are right
now before running any tests and running
any sort of heat through the system and
letting things kind of balance out and
then we'll run it through load get our
numbers make sure the ambient
temperature in the room is the same I've
got the air running to keep it pretty
consistent then we'll do it again and
compare and they'll do the same thing
with the GPU okay so the air coming out
of the computer is measuring seventy
seven point zero Fahrenheit and in see
for those of you using Celsius that is
twenty four point nine that's what it's
showing there seventy six point eight
because it comes down pretty quickly
here so that's what we've got here is a
baseline so let's go ahead and start our
a 264 let this thing heat up the system
and let's see how hot it gets to
transition
I've had the test going now for over ten
minutes I stopped it for a second there
and forgot to hit record on the camera
anyway ambient temperature in the room
is still seventy five point two and I
have had the thermometer up here
measuring the temperature exiting the
case with this thing going a hundred
percent and as you can see we actually
did get a little bit of throttling here
on the CPU we due to temperature we
actually hit a hundred C on the first
core several times so that's just to
show you here that we are pushing the
same for as much heat as we possibly can
I don't recommend actually doing that
and forcing your CPU to go all the way
to throttling temps but I wanted to
exacerbate that's exacerbate not the
other word on the kind of exacerbate the
situation as best I can to get these
tests you know as concrete as possible
so anyway we're going to remove this now
and the air leaving the case is at
seventy eight point six degrees
Fahrenheit or a twenty six C so as you
can see it's the I mean we can pretty
much already call this conclusive if we
wanted to where the air that is exiting
the case is hardly heated up by the air
entering the case at least with the H
100 I if I go ahead and set this thing
on the front so that it's measuring the
air that's coming down and it does if
you guys are curious about whether or
not the s 340 can actually pull air in
very well or if it's too obstructed you
can see this little blade right here
will actually move due to the air flow
and tell you how much air is actually
going in there now I believe you guys
will actually be able to see this it's
double check here so if I set this thing
on the front of the case right here
check this out see that it is pulling
air in just fine so we'll let that
measure the intake temperature right now
intake temperature going into the front
of the case let that go for just a
second here okay that takes time to
actually measure and balance it out all
right
seventy seven point nine degrees
Fahrenheit is what's entering the case
and what is exiting the case
seventy eight point six so do you see
how the front intake radiator at least
on a setup like this is not really doing
a whole lot in terms of heating up the
system there's that test let's go ahead
and do this now let's go ahead and take
in fact I'm going to skip taking the
side panel off for the CPU test there's
really no point in fact I'm go ahead and
stop this now and I want to doing too
much more throttling on my CPU see the
temperatures came down really quickly
back down to the 30s on the core let's
let things cool off and then we're going
to go ahead and run a GPU test on this
and then we'll see if the GPU
temperatures rise at all if we do it
right after running a stressful CPU test
I really don't think that's going to be
the case just based on the numbers that
we've already seen now I'm not using an
opinion here I'm using a thermometer to
do the test so I don't see how you know
this could be an opinion thing this is
just flat out what does the thermometer
say anyway let's go from there okay so
what I've done right now is I've loaded
up GPU tests for Valley benchmark and we
have overclocked the GPU one hundred
megahertz left at stock voltage and I
have also raised the thermal threshold
for the GPU to nine to one degrees
Celsius in MSI Afterburner
and we're going to let it the test run
and run and run until things have
balanced out I think we're pretty much
already there based on my previous test
where we're hitting 84 degrees Celsius
on the GPU so that's below our maximum
temperature in GPU Boost 2.0 which means
that the core right now is running a
hundred percent it's not being thermal
throttled at all and then we are going
to heat up the H 100 I as best we can by
running a 264 and then switching to
Valley and seeing if we got any
difference in temperatures and then if
we did we'll take the side panel off and
compare if we didn't and the GPU didn't
throttle at all then we can go ahead and
call this test complete I guess
okay so I've had Valley going for I
don't know how long now at least 15
minutes temperatures are very stabilized
ambient temp is 78 Fahrenheit on the dot
and that's 25 point 6 C so the
temperature in the room went up a couple
of degrees simply because of the
graphics card that's important to note
because remember when we did this with
the CPU test temperatures didn't really
rise at all
temperatures exiting the case right now
remember the CPU is under small load
when you're doing gaming gaming does not
put a huge load on the CPU so I don't
expect this to be a whole lot different
here especially since we have a blower
style card I already explained why I
went with that seventy nine point seven
Fahrenheit case temperature and that's
going to be twenty six point five C so
as you can see only a few degrees like
three degrees raised on the case
temperature at all now what our maximum
GPU temp get to our max temperature
whoops our max temperature was uh it
looks like we've got a max temperature
of about eighty-five eighty-six we hit
86 once all right so the next thing
we're going to do now let's go ahead and
load up that CPU again let's make that
nice and toasty and then it switched to
a2 valley and see if we get any higher
temperatures I don't think we're going
to quite honestly I think the GPU is so
hot it's going to create its own
atmospheric issue where we're going to
see more issues happening with the GPU
than we are with anything CPU radiator
wise causing any problems for anything
in the system but if we open up Corsair
link and look at the temperatures I mean
shoot we've got 23 degrees Celsius on
the on the hard drive 35 degrees Celsius
on the motherboard 35 C on the other
spot on the motherboard that it measures
I mean 29 C on another motherboard
temperature location I think I think
we're starting to get our results here
guys so Valley has been looping and
looping and looping and looks like we're
sitting at a maximum temperature once
again of 86 degrees Fahrenheit or
Celsius on the graphics card my bed and
case temperature is sitting at 86 point
one degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit Dan I
can't get those numbers straight okay 86
Fahrenheit in the case for Celsius
that's about 30 degrees Celsius so one
thing to keep in mind here is that the
ambient temperature in this room has
gone up considerably because the
graphics card is putting off a lot of
heat so a lot of that raising
temperature is actually attributed to
the graph
card and the amount of heat it's putting
off more so than the fact that you the
CPU and the front mounted radiator was
affecting anything in fact if we look at
the curve here for the CPU everything
stays pretty consistent everything for
the graphics card temperature-wise
as you can see right here stays very
very consistent on temperature in fact
we even dip down a little bit and came
back up slightly so there's a lot of
things that could be factoring
temperatures not just the location of
your radiator one last thing I want to
do before we talk about conclusions is I
want to try and run both at the same
time and see how much it really does
affect things now I'm at that actually
take my overclock off of the graphics
card because I tried doing this once
already and I ended up getting
instability on the graphics card as a
CPU is at a hundred percent load and so
believe it or not your CPU stability can
affect what appears to be your graphics
card overclock but could also be your
CPU causing problems as well
ambient temperature in the room right
now eighty four point five degrees
Fahrenheit twenty nine point one C so
you can see the temperature in the room
is going up and equally the system
temperature is going up as well it's
kind of funny how that works huh anyone
who understands temperature in physics
and thermodynamics will know exactly why
that makes sense okay so both valley
benchmark and aida64 have been running
for quite a while now you can see the
cpu temp in the case there is at ninety
C on the socket exhaust temperature on
the top of the case is at eighty three
point four degrees Fahrenheit it
actually came down a little bit for
Celsius that's twenty-eight point five
now if you want to see something
contrast actually we'll we'll take a
quick reading of the rear by the
graphics card and that'll give you some
insight as to why the temperature in the
room came up as I started the graphics
card tests okay so I've been sitting
here with my hand pretty much being
toasted alive on the back of this Titan
X remember this is not overclocked right
now this is factory temperature graphics
cards currently running at eighty-three
Celsius we came down three degrees
Celsius from the overclock and the rear
temperature the air exiting the back of
the graphics card one hundred and thirty
six point four Fahrenheit
56 actually it's coming down obviously
it's away from it so let's say 55
degrees Celsius is the temperature of
the air coming off the back ooh that's
warm
so let's go ahead and talk about some
final thoughts in all of this now one
reason I didn't bother taking the side
panel off whatsoever was the fact that
our tests that we did first pretty much
concluded that even though the CPU was
running full speed even throttling a
little bit that we were only getting a
couple of degrees difference in
temperature between the intake temp and
the exhaust temp so to me that meant
that the H 100 I was not really heating
up the air enough to make any sort of
difference I think we saw what three
degrees Fahrenheit difference in
temperatures it wasn't a lot now what
you saw here was the fact the GPU alone
makes more difference to the entire
rooms temperature which is going to
affect the entire system temperature
than anything else in your system now
I'm not saying that front mounted
radiators won't affect your temperatures
I can guarantee you right now that if I
took my skunkworks system here and I put
the GPUs on a radiator that's front
mounted we would see a system pressure
system temperature increase on all the
components across the board and the
reason for that is it comes down to
watts displaced by the radiator there
becomes a point where you have more
radiator than is necessary so it only
gets to a certain operating temperature
and that's it but what happens is when
you have an under sized radiator and too
much wattage being pushed through that
radiator then you end up having heat
soak where it gets hotter and hotter and
hotter now something else I also did to
try and make this test as absolutely as
worst-case scenario as I could was I ran
the fan profiles on the H 100 I at
balanced because I didn't want it to
overcompensate by running a ton of air
through it which would obviously cool it
off and would make the case cooling much
more of a factor than how much the H 100
I is heating up the temperature inside
the case if that makes any sense to you
guys so running it balanced and only run
about 1,300 and maybe 1,400 rpm
fluctuating back and forth and maximum
RPMs of those static pressure fans now
don't misquote me here because I am NOT
saying front mounted radiators will not
affect the overall system temperatures
they
we'll and as you saw here it affected us
only a couple of degrees but if we had
more heat going through that radiator
let's say we had the graphics cards or
the CPU and everything in a single loop
then yeah the entire system temperature
would rise but then again if the parts
that are mostly being cooled by the
radiator are part of that loop then the
only things that are going to make any
sort of difference would be like
motherboard temperatures and MOSFETs and
things like that which can be affected
by those but unfortunately there's no
way to really measure those in this test
because it's an all-in-one cooling loop
that's something that would be a much
more in-depth test later on but there's
physics involved here and physics cannot
be twisted and changed by opinion and
what I want to tell you now is if that
you have a case like the s340 or other
cases that really only offer
front-mounted options for all the one
water cooling loops or even custom loops
don't be concerned about it causing any
sort of temperature damage to your
system it's not going to happen I've
seen all kinds of misconceptions out
there and flat-out wrong information
being regurgitated and thrown up all
over the community of people saying
front-mounted radiators will cause your
system to overheat and it's just a
flat-out lie there's more to it than
being cut and dry like that and in your
most most situations it's not going to
matter so building your case put the
radiator in the front if that's where
you want to pull it put it and stop
worrying about it
play some games have some fun watch some
more of my videos if you want but I'm
going to get out of here because I am
heading to PDX land tomorrow morning
today is Wednesday so this is the same
day video hitting the PDX land I'll be
hanging out with Jerry maybe we'll do
another Q&amp;amp;A video or something those are
always fun not doing another drunk Tech
Talk don't ask don't even bother to
waste your time anyway guys we'll see
you there I'll be doing a huge live
stream like all weekend long for PDX so
make sure you guys are there to check
that out it's going to be on my twitch
channel my twitch name is Jay's VFX
J ays VFX not Jays two cents anyway guys
I'm gonna get out of here we will see
you in the live stream follow on Twitter
if you want to know when it's going live
at JSU sense enough shameful plugs you
know makes me happy when you guys follow
me and say J we love you because I love
you guys too anyway time to go we'll see
you in Portland
