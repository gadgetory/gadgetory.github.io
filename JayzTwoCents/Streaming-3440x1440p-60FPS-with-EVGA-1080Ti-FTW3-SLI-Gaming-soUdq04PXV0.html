takes a moment I guess I might as well
tweet this stuff out huh
it should tweet it out there's a stream
going you listen back real quick see oh
yeah
adios not too bad okay what's up guys
nick is back there on a wireless mic
we're gonna do here we're gonna do we're
gonna play we're gonna play some games
here you can see the specs of the system
down there I built out a new system over
here - well I had to build inside one of
the Cougar cases I put a 69 hundred K in
system in there but it's got both of
those for the win three cards that I
showed and here we're gonna be doing I'm
actually going to be live-streaming 3440
by 1440p capture at 60fps so I'm really
going to be doing a lot of stress on
this I am doing a hardware level
encoding not H dot 264 software level
encoding so I'm offloading a lot of that
to the GPUs I want to leverage as much
of that power as we can so before we get
going my mic is not muted can you guys
hear me
it's you guys from hearing right I'm
staying me playback yes you can hear me
fine my mic is not muted it's weird
though because like sometimes people
will come in the stream when it auto
plays the auto the audio doesn't show up
but then when they recent when they
refresh it audio shows up so anyway yeah
I know you guys can hear me I'm playing
back the stream myself so I know it's
working um okay let's do this
so Nick and I are going to coop you're
only going to see my screen because I
don't have a way to capture his yet are
you playing in 4k back there no playing
Kennedy but you already know those cards
can handle 4k at like 100 FPS this is
true he's running on to 1080 TI founders
editions I'm running on to 1080 TI for
the wind cards you can see them right
there that are there so yeah
it's a system I I built just to just to
use this case yeah for now anyway
probably as you guys know Computex
always brings new hardware new hardware
is afoot
anyway if anybody does feel so inclined
is to donate though the button is there
and I will go through those super
comments towards throughout the stream
we'll kind of pause here and there do a
little Q&amp;amp;A s and play so who thinks we
should just shut up and play or I should
hook Nick isn't talking I don't talk can
you give me an audio check audio a
little bit check Nick they're like check
one two one two you're looking away from
your mind oh well it's only directional
not what's right no when you turn your
head away from it okay so I had anything
right now
okay cool um I also will have fraps
going in there so you guys can see the
FPS shut up in stream bro but I am
streaming you mean shut up in play so
you get it right I'm gonna drink my
Starbucks cuz I'm basic nikka Starbucks
too so we're both baked basically here's
stream at 1080 the stream is at 1080 I'm
capturing 1440 I'm capturing ultra wide
so you got to give him into startup here
it's a legal age to get a gun in the
u.s. saying about guns well it's about
guns in the game but not in real life
from guns oh my gosh so many people is
going by so far ronald
dousset's Wow Doucette are you serious
that's my grandmother's maiden name his
dousset's
she was from Rhode Island the dousset's
it's funny to hear it family family
history name of mine
look at that capturing that 21 by 9
goodness isn't it awesome yep I'm about
to get stung
I think you're gonna be carrying you a
lot probably okay I'm starting my
campaign and then you can hop in with
mine more 21 by nine stuff I got I want
to start maybe incorporating 21 by 9 in
the benchmarks but it's it's just
testing five resolutions
it's a ridiculous
so many hours hours upon hours upon
hours yeah that in lots of trial and
error um when they crash well that's
only during the the overclocking part
that's why I push the overclock to see
how far they can go
stable but I don't rerun all the
benchmarks in terms of like putting up
all the charts again anymore I just I'm
trying to find a middle ground on that
because a lot of people doing really
good coverage anyway what do we gotta do
here we just fit oh yeah we just
finished this area like all the box so
oh I got some donations I see that
David Lee AJ really enjoyed videos
recently bought nati founders edition
house and get upgrading the rest by
early next year what's your opinion
about installing EVGA hyper ki yo cool
uh it's a it's a good option early is it
just kind of sucks to do that later
because then you're spending more later
should we steak stick in this zone or go
to new zone uh where I beat the Sun
right yeah why is it not showing up the
FPS counters not showing it fraps is
being dumb let me do this
hold on sec guys I'm going to bring up
the built-in one yeah I bring in the
built-in one on which we call is this
you play this piece of crap I don't like
you play
yeah how's that see if that shows up no
it's really small anyway I do have a
game capped at 60fps because I'm
streaming a 60fps and if I play in a
much higher framerate then the stream is
then this the frames will sometimes drop
you'll get a lot of dropped frames I've
taken league at 40 dropped frames as run
in 100 FPS monitor and I do Mick casting
it I do obviously get the full 100 FPS
when gaming on here so I could confirm
but yeah so what we do is I just match
the FPS in game to what the stream is
that way all frames are rendered equally
okay Nick I don't know we should do
should we stick in the zone and get guns
and side missions or move on to another
boss mission it's up to you because I
have all the guns memory or well the
guns I want I don't have crap Oh cuz he
also your map with look at your map
because I have all my I am looking at my
map ok skill points Dinah's hatchery
case the 5.56 mag I could use as for my
clan for probably five six it's extended
mag yeah let's do that
alright so i'll snipe and you do all the
guns and anti helicopter stuff okay
and the driving ok the driver telling to
do the driving
ready yeah
turn that radio off you're gonna draw
attention sir hanging out there with
that sniper rifle
oh I'm going to drift that till that car
got in the way
geez Santa Blanca drifty Oh Oh my bed
insurance will cover it
let's see I think this is a shortcut no
game sound but sorry about your crops oh
you're okay there's no game sound
there's no game sound yeah hold on you
see
um there should be game sound let me
check this real quick mmm
might be my mixer let me check that real
quick
and I fix this hold on guys oh that's
why hold on okay let's see here
OOP
I'm not a fan of OBS studio there we go
now this game sounds okay good it was
still trying to go through the
soundboard
oh okay well it goes better there it
doesn't like when I go from desktop Oh
like you know you tap out and tap back
yeah as we reload all in pictures Oh
scratch buggy what are you doing oh why
did you jump out of thing I saw the
off-road buggy I'm gonna pick it up but
there's Santa blocker right uh hold on
is only two of them hold on
and I got the already want to run them
over
you can't rid um over jerk here you go
this is way cooler anyways nearby I like
it
well it's fast to go so you tell me we
can just go up this mountain yep
whoa I gotta get me one of these oh crap
what is he saving its magic Paul's balls
so dumb all right we're gonna have to
fight our way into this cash aren't we
follow this weapons cache you okay just
I want a snipe oh geez I did I did a
tactical bailout at 1 mile per hour okay
I'm very bad at sniping so expect fails
let me get my spot other loadout in two
spot and I'll get you that their drone
thingy yeah oh wait I ever get spotted
wait he says shit balls let's raise it
what are you doing
what spotted us though that our car yeah
you got him you just drove up chicken
okay all right
I killed him kill this guy I'll kill you
God by the helicopter God I'm doing two
four two three four three I'm getting
excited
no one else is in mine site
plagg needs arises kill this guy oh crap
- mrs. Cottam you're so good haven't
dropped a single frame though
ah shit
okay okay go get them weapons and we'll
take that helicopter somewhere I kinda
want to fly a Cessna somewhere but I
later all the ham distance you seen man
I'm pretty good at evading yeah this kid
I love might are just an ultra no this
is a custom settings right now I can put
it on oops
no no what
I'll put out an ultra would have to turn
off temporal pay because it doesn't like
temporal when it's on SLI it tells you
not to and then I turn off motion blur
and I'm going to turn off turf effects
turf effects is good for like screen
shots it's terrible for gameplay i under
to reload the game for the texture
qualities alright thanks for the
donation what size tubing do you have in
skunk works it's 13 millimeter there so
there's the ultra settings it's still at
60 it's a weird flickering texture right
there though see that okay oh it's not
doing it on the stream though it's just
what I get to do it oh no see it's not
doing it over there on the screen
capture but it's doing it here mmm
alright a feeling will get shot down in
this it's only the helicopter that's
flicker on a lot of light strange here
maybe a pixel problem is solved now I
don't know I mean I am going up right
now at 5100
K I can try upping the bitrate slightly
and sit that house I'm not streaming at
1440p don't be dumb it's streaming at
1080 but I'm playing 1440p so let me see
if I can switch it I know it would let
me switch the encoder settings in the
OBS caster it's just 6,000 yeah it
doesn't look like it will change while
streaming when it used to be used to do
that before okay well let's just have to
do all right
oh boy I forgot you
I forgot the controls oh shit
there we go these are like the dumbest
controls ever I don't know where I'm
flying right now I'm just flying I'm
doing on for the ride
I want to go sucess no in the map
anywhere I want a Cessna good to find an
airstrip huh mm-hmm
how about the improvised runway that
probably have it huh yeah let's go there
I've said a million times I'm playing
1440p I'm not streaming 1440p
the 1440p stream option in YouTube is a
beta I don't want to stream a beta I
don't think there's any Sam's in front
of us it should be okay
isn't this improvised strip where we did
the last mission yeah there's a them
Intel stutters
is there an airplane down there see a
helicopter my bid see a bird I only see
a helicopter I don't see a fixed-wing
crap I want to fix Wayne I know where
there's one but we really have to fight
our way to get there oh let's try this
other airstrip in front of us that base
right there in front of us that has
fixed wings there oh right right but
there's a lot of Defense's there dude I
cleared that by myself though last time
well I'm down for shooting stuff so now
you are there's a fixed thing right here
on the runway that looks like we're
gonna have to fight our way in there
though okay really okay you almost went
through my blades supportive at it
he said you're sniping right if we want
to call it that oh jeez ah my buttons
that was not a crazed whole ending hit
up oh I landed it in the middle of the
street sorry guys here we go
okay I'll snipe all right I'll just
clean up from behind
I missed hold it
I'm so bad at sniping where I stuck
trying to account for bullet drop it
isn't there see if I can kill two guys
with one bullet
ah they moved ah he ran away
hold still while I kill you jerks Oh
language all right I have an idea here
oh that flash my tango where I wanted it
to go oh that's gonna Nate I'm dead my
grenade landed right on me not nice I'm
so bad at this oh I got you
thank you for that mm-hmm Thanks
you sure really just don't get a ten
seventy spend more and get a 1080 while
I'll agree the 1080 is great you blip
the plane I've looked a blue a fuck
that's why we came here wasn't it yeah
at least the helicopter still alive will
the plane respond it will but like leave
the area well that was a fail
yep there's a weapons case here though
at least see here I was thinking I was
about to like save our hides at that
rebels blast and wanting one of these
yeah because I like to think about three
seconds in front of my face you know I
you know what I call that keeping things
interesting that's what I call that
oh there's in television
yeah
okay let's go back today look up here do
you want to try and steal one of those
airplanes from the base yeah price range
of 10 60 or wait for Vega course you
should wait for Vega but Vega is not
going to be in the price range of a 1060
though like nowhere near it
I've got to say though I'm pretty
impressed that I'm maintaining on qHD
ultra-wide while live-streaming on the
same machine I'm playing on 60 fps I'm
ok with that
I'm flying like a drunk I'm sorry got
this oh we're crashing out right can i
book this guy it's like a boo-boom
boo-boom wait where is it I don't see a
motorcycle and all guide ah that's like
nothing on my screen the motorcycle
underneath us
oh he's right behind us yeah but I'm
doing a very bad job at this I like
goofing right in front of him I'm trying
ok now go oh I missed story of my life
but it's ok I got this I keep trying to
steer with the mouse I'm so used to
battlefield
yeah what I'm doing crap I meant to do
that
so just start shooting people or know we
got this I'm good
oh good they're gonna spot us that's the
only dad
I do need ID Nick we have problems yeah
Oh ooh I got it actually look like it
went up our butt but it didn't kill us
so I think I should just drop us off
over here what do you think yeah yeah
they just kind of like hoof it there
just let me snipe though last night you
always get this knife
Oh God
ah my god what's happening okay maybe it
wasn't my best landing okay it's okay it
wasn't my best landing are they hunting
us know they're not hunting yeah we go
no I'm not sure hunted are you know they
just have a group looking for us out
there
but usually will say hunted if they're
hunting you
going true do you have the knife right
there oh they have a jammer on I forgot
your space has a jammer do you have the
drone that can actually attack yeah like
the explosive one yeah yeah I do but I
can't do anything to a take out of
jammer
yeah just trying to avoid the sniper in
this towers let's take a look I have
done I have no angle on him it's too
dark you can't see in there if I shoot I
think he's outside on the other side of
the balcony that's a problem Keith on
the left side of the hut but yeah he's
outside the right he's not in doTERRA
he's in the tower I don't see him at all
like I don't think we wanted to allowed
here do we a big a challenge to say the
least
how do we go over this wall forgot
little signals can see you're here uh
can we make a hole in it no okay so wait
oh we can go all the way over here oh
shit
you almost saw me hold on I'm gonna kill
his ass I got this there took up stuff
his head cool but we have to go this way
because that's where the entrance is or
yeah when the light when I rated this
place for the mission I entered were
there where that other Tower is I err
dropped in the middle but is during
night Oh God
got him it is one more in there a thing
that's called teamwork there's one like
right outside of it got him oh there's
another one got him okay we got to look
us a hole right here there's a sniper in
this other tower too I'm sure
so usually is
I'm in
deploying drone
sicles all bad Jamie there's no jammer
I'll go take him out and then I get
sniped from up here or you get sniped
from up here once I get him oh I see him
let me see if I can kill him if I miss
then you get okay okay he was like she
walked in front of the door like a split
second well he's looking at the left
window I know he walked right past this
little gap I had to kill him and take
him out okay
he's down okay
can you get that gun a minigun down
there you got the minigun gonna lay off
the weapon down cool cuz the hangar is
right here kill it we just got to clear
the area around the hangar we should be
fine
well we also take out those Sam's right
there on the runway all right
Oh I'll make my way over they don't get
very far well I have taken off with
those Sam's before but I'm just saying
Kim if we really want to make it a
challenge I can do it no no I mean my
flight skills yeah I'll get them go down
just mark them out on the map I mean
it's um
I'll do the best I can I have no drone
capabilities right now but I'll try and
get the Pats there's some Pat's out in
the middle of the walkway brings us to
ten mill the runway I mean Oh
these planes are not going to be as good
at trying to avoid the Sam's then the
sessions are and the hangar that we
still a Cessna from J play minecraft no
the hangar where the Cessnas are is
closed because that's part of the
mission sekai sex okay see if we're on
the first and
yeah YouTube's kind of lagging right now
like I'm not lagging I haven't dropped a
single frame I'm steady at 60fps 5000
kilobits per second kilobytes per second
and I'm not dropped a single frame so
any lag eNOS is totally YouTube okay
there's one guy down I'm going to pop
the sniper and just let me know when you
want to blow up with Sam's okay cuz cz
blow those up everything's gonna go hot
right yeah and it's certain range but
he's trying to light the whole there was
one back here - there's three Sam's
total okay I'm sure was one guy after I
get this tower down
I want to get the air plan at the back
of the runway here because I have the
longest chance of taking off yeah that
says one all whip at the front right
there I marked it oh wait I marked a bad
guy but I did mark the sama there too
you see it yeah though i mark the bad
guy okay I'll get the samba
that guy's way out of my capable sniping
range
with the jammer
it's on the other side of the base I
think the demo right stems are tagged
ready to go as soon as we're done with
this little mission we're doing here
just for the hell of it then we'll enter
a chat when you're playing games do you
just sit there and read chat how do you
play part of what we're doing right now
is we are testing this SLI streaming
capability of a 1080i so wait for that
new media chopper to glare I don't think
taking off in front that we do that od
Dutch or any dad chopper be bad or a
good idea that's bad bad twitch
streamers do I'm not a twitch streamer
go to twitch if you want that shit this
is called work I'm working right now
can't you see how hard I'm working huh
the GPUs are on air they're exactly as
it come out of the box and I overclocked
either where the temperatures at right
now let me see
temperatures are currently very right at
blow stuff up for THC let the fans like
the fans are running at 72 see have a
aggressive curve on right now 47 see
what's because I also jumped out of the
game for a second there so okay
what up is reload um make sure I'm clear
right around me here yeah I guess blow
it up blowing out loud noise guys okay
no one got alerted though all right make
way over to the airplane where's that
chopper at I hear it somewhere above
I like how I just float up into like
thin air
I got it offline
oh crap crap crap crap crap is not
turning an austere brew there we go
woohoo did it well god yay see a little
low here can't like up the landing here
how do you do that and another button I
don't know I mean it doesn't show a
button for landing gear is there anyone
knows and tell me the he maybe doesn't
do anything
oh those lights elf or Lenny here oh
shit shit that went to the lobby okay
okay
all right let's lie
no G doesn't do the landing gear guys G
does alights this wildlands yes it's
wild lens wow man you know it's not ll
goes to the lobby
I'm not disabling the g-sync right now
or the vsync because I don't want the
frames to be all jittery for you guys
when I'm streaming 60fps but then I'm
letting the frames go as high as they
can on the graphics cards and you guys
will get all kinds of crazy studying but
it will go as high as about 130 fps
and it goes down to about 86 85 fps oh
we gotta say I'm locking onto us here we
go you have to canyon turn oh god here
we go they're coming back the other way
oh that was this direct hit
fortunately we were about 15 feet off
the ground okay
I'm owing to get out of there yeah well
we're at a base miles well Raiders got a
really entail shut it down fast mister
this is that's calm yes you're right no
no it's huh this is one of those like
you have to race to the next Santana to
shut it down kind of thing okay I'll
Drive you shut it down ready there's a
buggy right here stopping the buggy I
thought let people go go go go
I'll take the track
yeehaw
oh it's down in romantic comfort
amantha the primary puzzling ah did you
make it yeah but it's like mine there's
Unni dad Patrol was like literally this
is the dead base well I'll go back to
the tower Fisher restarted fair warning
he obviously hasn't been us yet honey
background on him I'll put together what
we've got partly copy that
honey leads for us what kind of report
that Elgato set up one of them got the

I'm Kevin whole each other two double
decisions okay I'm getting out here I
got this huh alright
Oh God sniper out now dude I told me I
could hear the sirens in there oh my god
I wasn't running this is why you
shouldn't protect your bases with
chain-link intimates
this thing's gonna blow up Co to fail
out it's just about to blow up you have
one of them helicopters or something
do not snipers are shooting me is hers
no this doesn't watch dogs I guess it
kind of looks like it but this is wild
limbs watch dogs I have a desert it's

back how do I switch the season I'm
Everett needle but I want to go to the
gun oh we gonna have to like let me get
out and go to the back yeah here we go
or I can do that from the inside come on
ARMA 3 would be great cpu test I agree
but where are we going we got all this
new Intel is this 4x scope let's go get
some major Intel that base I was at has
major Intel oh so I guess we're going
guns loud I think we're going to have to
because there's a lot it's a movie
database not a Santa Blanca I could call
in reinforcements too or you can't go
- maxed out Apollo I don't think I have
any hopefully oh we're being hunted
again on all right that's ok I want to
shoot them there's no engine sounds
coming out of this on my screen but like
this is like a hybrid
the thing is the hardest thing to shoot
a party house I'm going to get the Intel
if you want to hold them off
I am hacking the computer in both
directions in height with cartel
prepares a struggling moment snowman got
intel on a psycho
oh I make a big boom huh oh I got shot
stopped I met me I'm in the second story
are you anywhere near me no you're not
no I'm totally gonna die one day
I'm probably gonna die requesting a
helicopter I'm requesting help but it
says help on the screen yeah
when I request help oh I'm down okay I
got the Intel though or no way it's
gonna go away now right no you should
pitch account once you pick it up okay
I'm going to when we respond right here
I'm just gonna chill in this but I'm
gonna answer some questions here in the
chat okay hi Jay do a dance I don't

in a long long time yeah I've had the
370z for over a year and a half pound
there stood get it done hey Jay how's
the SLI scaling
I can tell you it scales really well
with high resolution like 4k in 1440
1080 at bottlenecks most views can I
speak Spanish
no at the ending it with that no have
that something like how hard was it to
build Terry cruises PC what's in a hard
build Dara you're gonna look at the
Cougar Panzer max we have one please
activate the FPS counter it is activated
it's really small Finn the corner fact
I'm gonna take it off the right now we
were on very high when we go back to
high battlegrounds from what I've been
reading it's just like h1
it's like king of the kill but like
better hitboxes or something like that
but I'm not really down for like The
Hunger Games style kind of game I got
sick of eating of the kill real quick
are you picking your nose on cam no she
looked look like I'm picking my nose it
sure doesn't a little haha looks like
you were just digging as I see it real
is you like suck your finger right after
yeah there we go
what's getting dark um as a fire on the
hill let's see hi from Russia
ooh Russia Jay can you speak bahasa
malaysia now hold that even a real thing
hey Jay can you thank you for hooking up
eminence with the 980ti
yep we still to sign that ga are you in
love with Terry Crews not really I mean
I like I'm once I'm in love with him
Jay greetings from Romania so the land
of the best internet in the world from
what I hear
do you prefer streaming on your 10 1800
X um you know is I can't really compare
and let me tell you why the 1660 900k
that I'm running right now at 4.4 has
more memory has quad channel and I'm
running to 1080 TI's whereas the 1800 X
was being limited by the to all the
Titan X Maxwell card these 1080i is like
obliterate the Maxwell cards so I get
much better fps much better gameplay
with us cause of the graphics cards so
until I do in 1800 with the same GPUs to
really compare right now the overall
stream experience is better
on this but that's because of the GPUs I
really believe is fitted Egeus li the
GPUs are better and I'm doing hardware
level encoding the n bec encoder and not
the h.264 encoder so I'm trying some
different things right now had the
coolest got J you have the coolest job
ever hired me no so you limited by SLI
type do you if you if you don't realize
how far Pascal has come over Maxwell
just because it says Titan doesn't mean
shit but the 1080 is better for gaming
than a tight next Maxwell in my opinion
and they on the benchmarks look very
similar but the lows are much better on
Pascal than the Maxwell Titan tap Titan
X Maxwell was much hotter and the 1080
was a watch much better card the 1080i
is literally like 50% faster than the
Titan X Maxwell card and that makes a
huge difference especially when you're
running at these resolutions q HD 21 by
9:30 440 by 1440 it's a huge amount of
it's like 3/4 of the amount of pixels of
4k it's a big screen to push and I'm
running two of them right now
I just wish more people would understand
that and stop making dumb comments Jason
is stupid why not Titans can't fix
stupid
I have two Titans are in the garage
where they belong hey tuna dead guy yay
J we know Pascal's better yeah Joanne I
know that not all of you know that
though it's Harry Cruz next hero I want
to say is a hero but I'm kind of a fan
well cool in am i running these days a
mixture of things skunk works are still
running the green pastel it hasn't
changed colors but that's because green
was not one of the pigments affected by
the brown issue the orange died back
there and the horizon system though has
started turning brown mixi nickens see
that too so that's one of the things
we're gonna do we're going to tear that
system apart again but I had no
intention that being a permanent system
anyway I just built a really cool a
kick-ass horizon system because nobody
else was at that time but it wasn't
intended to stay together those tight
Nicks Maxwell cards they're just too
damn hot and not fast enough I'd rather
run to 1080 air-cooled cards in to Titan
X max
cards can you water cool in a Lenovo
laptop sure just pour a glass of water
on it tell me how it goes
Pascal has just Maxwell on steroids you
know let me tell you I'm gonna this is
the savage part of me people love about
my live streams let me tell you why
that's a stupid comment
okay now I'm sorry I'm putting on blast
but you kind of asked for it you made a
comment that proves stupidity and I'm
going to prove it that's like saying now
the coding set 1 to 1 is just CCX on
steroids it's like it's a faster better
performing piece of machinery in every
way and whether it is Pascal and first
of all Maxwell is not FinFET and Pascal
is so they're not the same core anyway
which shows that your ignorance there
but because it's faster and cooler I
don't give a shit if it's bla bla bla on
steroids it was faster and cooler that's
all I care about I don't give a fuck how
they achieve it as long as they achieve
it why don't you use rise in this dream
you know that's another thing that like
is really irritating people think
because ok that's a train in the game in
a real life ok um people think because
Rison is great that like all youtubers
should just switch to rise it no I'm not
going to just switch to rise n there's
no reason to just switch to rise n it
does well I want to see more maturity on
the platform before I start putting all
my eggs in that basket and I'll never do
that I'll never put all my eggs in
anything whether it be a AMD or Intel I
run a mixture of both around here I run
laptops I even have a Mac and now you
run this Intel system and we've got the
rise n system you know why I can give
you like full transparency reviews and
good point of perspective on these
because I use multiple things I don't
fanboy up and go I'm only using Rison
from now on which is what a lot of the
internet thinks you should do which is
really stupid
nobody should just do that anyway
triggered no you know once it's
triggered I would say that this is
educating because people out there that
go here's the thing with Rison you have
choice now you have choice and you have
again the the value $2.00 argument with
Rison which is a great thing but you're
still going to have people that
for a brand over another and some people
will pay more for brand preference which
kind of sucks in a way I guess but what
I think really kind of sucks here for
the am for the for the enthusiasts
rather than an Intel or an AMD fanboy is
you have the Intel AMD is that are going
blah blah blah Intel's better and you
have the rise and fanboys going nob
AMD's better AMD is better but this is
the first time AMD fans have had in
years when they can actually argue that
not only is it cheaper but it's faster
and so they are literally just like
beating the shit out of that drum and I
think for the most part just agnostic
enthusiast like myself are just sick and
tired of it like literally just sick and
tired of it Ju in a bad mood make mine a
bad mood today no you're pretty good
it's just I've seen him bad mood hey Jay
what's your temps in SLI that's a good
question I don't have a meter up let's
see
51 see is what they were running right
now in game but I have the fans cranked
up just a little bit the fan curve is
set to aggressive just play the game no
I'm taking a break from the game to talk
to you guys for a second you don't tell
me what to do
any giveaways Jay have you looked at the
channel have you looked at the title of
the video before the stream we switched
to Vega if it kills a 1080 T I will I
build a system in use Vega of course but
define switch with the exception of
skunkworks I've never built a permanent
system have a No okay then hello Pappy
what the N is that tiny fractal build
which you kind of wanted to pull apart a
while ago I wanted to pull apart to put
in a better GPU but then like you saw
the GPU like there's no room for with it
like it has a GTX 970 in there from
gigabyte the g1 gaming which is a little
bit smaller like lengthwise then a
founders 1080 which I want to put in
there so it doesn't fit with where my
pump is I had to redo the whole damn
thing and if I'm going to redo the whole
thing
it's I'm not going to redo it with a
4790k I'm gonna step up to Sky Lake or
Kaiba lake uh I was gonna say put a mini
GPU you tell me the problem is if I want
a water cooler it has to be a block
available for it yeah
true I want to see you snipe and crash
plant planes and choppers we'll get
there in a minute
chill out 3:07 yeah we got about another
awareness dream for about another half
hour or so what current case do you have
is it cold I'm currently running right
now the Cougar Panzer we were I built
this this system of it last week Nick
like last Monday yeah we built this
system and I really like it it's got
tempered glass you can see it's got the
NZXT cracking in there and fans that
I'll look up as well the coarser Maglev
fans it's a cool case I really dig it
and by cool I do mean cool because I'm
gonna do a review of this case - sorry
about the camera flopping around now I
gotta get it back on the monitor um it
has room for push-pull 360s that's
awesome
on a mid-tower case a mid tower case
that has room for push-pull 360s oh and
still has room for pump and radiator or
radiators and reservoir so I really am
digging that how old that case 45 that's
just a dumb comment let's see hi Jay
from London excited to be getting the
rise in rig together awesome what is the
case name again it's the Panzer from
cougar this Panzer and Panzer max the
panzer max is the full tower version and
the panzer which i have is a mid tower
with tempered glass side panels the
panzer max does not have tempered glass
panels
do you trust putting two 8-gigabyte or
four for Ray for RAM sticks do whichever
I've actually been noticing even with
even skunkworks when I have a tram
sticks in there I can still overclock
just as far in the past you just put a
lot of stress on a memory controller to
add all those dims anyone get as good of
an overclock but that hasn't been the
case for me lately I hope I win that bad
boy maybe
did you see people donated I do see that
I'm going to scroll to their comments in
a moment I don't only cater to the
donators hi from Scotland hello
FPS it's in the corner it's a super tiny
because it's 1440p stream bitrate right
now is that 5200 has intel said anything
about Sony to have intricate overheating
issues that came up a few weeks ago I
don't know go look at the Intel website
or see if there's a press release on it
and doesn't talk to me do a finish
impression I don't even know it like
isn't finished was to be like one of the
hardest languages on the planet I was
told or was that I thought it was
finished I could be wrong I don't know
people say fart yeah see that's why kids
should be allowed in the stream
alright let's here look at comments here
let's see Ronald you set already
mentioned that one David Lee thank you
sir I already answered that one more 21
by 9 stuff it's not as nish as you think
I never called it niche and I have a lot
of 21 by 9 monitors what size - I
already answered that one keep up the
good work man your living legend
definitely not a legend but thank you
Andrew thank you for having awesome
channels love motors and PCs that are
both funny and imported keep it up and
hi Nick Andrew says hi Nick oh you said
hi to him already right hi Andrew yeah
smells Montana says follow me on
instagram fake boho show fo sho I guess
you guys can go follow him let's see
Kevin ham when you're going to open J's
merchandise store when you t-shirts bro
I get my samples in today actually my
final samples in them we will be opening
the store shortly I have one of the
hoodies over there Nick gonna grab it on
the table yeah hey buddy I've been
wearing that last couple days doing some
product testing if you will wait yeah
this dude is wait right here
wait be over here I'm gonna blow the
logo up a little bit so it's a little
bit bigger though
I'm Jimmy Oh says fuck everyone in real
life okay
he then he says he'd donated $2 to be an
idiot I agree
gobby says I need help when Windows
updated it turned defrag back on and
defrag my SSD and it says it has zero
megabytes of total storage is there way
I can save it 1 defrag should not kill
an SSD that's for sure no idea
anytime install gigabyte App Center
software my PC to adjust BIOS my 1080
icecap to 20 FPS any idea what caused
this issue stop using the gigabyte app I
know that gigabyte literally with the
they call it guru 3d is the worst of all
the GPU apps is like the worst all right
let's do a little bit more gaming before
we shut this down all right
it's dark so we should do something
other the guise of darkness um mr. major
Intel right there let's go get that or
we don't have a vehicle do we okay
fallin in get up get everyone
that's my guy putting his finger in his
ear ah
clean out your wax Brea where's this
vehicle you're calling I don't know it's
only 600 meters this is red it dropped
it off at some random location - it's
hopping next to us
or actually I have an idea you just
steal one we need this for unofficial
government business and you'd you get
ain't up stamina on this guy geez he's
got listen Durance that I do hmm
I like how I want to steal a car but now
there's not one coming right like here
already pretty much ish over to here you
wanna kill these guys
yeah okay I'll get the big guy
how I just do this how they not got it
does he miss oh I do that a lot don't I
yeah there was a guy not building to
your riot got him
okay oh you called him helpers no well
they came to help either way yeah that's
cool I've got to shoot that light drunk
let the shit out this dude's light
I'll scan the area oh nevermind wait
here
here we go wrong guy in my badge proud
even night-vision yeah I got it now he
come out I'm using a tard a long-range
me irregular you would want video for a
souvenir what are you gonna do with
someone else you where you got it
hotel oh my god it is my so much boiler
dropping on tar can I go loud go for it
I like your net I'll sneak around hey
save draw attention to you so I could
get past a little bit easier oh that
one's good I mean to blow anything up
but I did oh here comes a car I'll
handle it I got him but
there we go whenever you go mammal here
can't hit that radio radio the motors
the mortar strike upgrade do I have to
kill this thing no no you just have to
activate it okay and then we have to
defend it for X amount of time well let
me where's the weapons cache here
somewhere I got to reload it's upstairs
why not I see it I go down I'm so blind
it's on the mat but I can't find it it's
on the roof oh it's on the roof how'd it
get there oh there a ladder I'm gonna
get up there on the roof
oh there's another one screw it oh
there's like a whole convoy okay these
candles I'm shooting the candles out
that's like pro status right yep I'm
being spotted jeez it's a lot of people
hi it's going well there's a convoy
right next to us too that stopped as
well okay it's kind of funny gracias our
friend there just told me where we can
find in this sounds like we found
another candidate or intimidations how
come I'm down that little building yep
they converged on my location Oh give me
a moment hey J and Nick may I join your
session guys it'll be fun
nope just us
hell yeah moment I'm just going to keep
doing the help a lot of that guy's here
huh yeah that's cool I'll go back and
activate that little radio thing well
let's clear the escort above it or the
escort the convoy above us first we
don't add grow so much I need ammo
so can you move case yeah I'm just
trying to get the hell out of here so I
can stop being spotted by these guys
carry back down the hunted
oh they're moving in yep oh crap I
thought I had didn't really have my
launcher on I gotta face
hey that I dragged out come on guy move
it up that's innate I'm rolling up on
the ambulance him oh this guy back here
shit go oh shit
really didn't even see him
1080i SL s ce2 and SLI top card 15 C hot
or any ideas yeah it's normal the card
you have the graphics are the displays
plugged into always runs hotter plus the
top card is always harder as well
because it's pulling up some hot air
from the card below it and let them know
with it very normal
if you're going to do an SLI Q&amp;amp;A video
crap I feel like I spotted this and then
just took off
it's funny how they do that well yeah
I'm gonna stop okay go forget that Intel
oh we have anything to dad to deal with
huh
oh no they're fighting each other up no
they're not
and then go back for more Emma yeah I
shall try and cover you as best as my
new BS can how's that sound
yep perfect
let's be clear that most of it you want
to get to Intel before we do the other
mission right next to us I'm already
taking that we dead right now
okay another me dead car coming up what
about the thing that you marking them
out that's a major Intel oh I'm gonna
take care of this any dead as they pull
up my
like where the car did a little wheelie
because another one come on guys see
what you got
come on Unicom you watching they're
coming from behind you got those guys
coming up on our front yeah yep okay
nobody else went from behind
I'll take care this other car come
I got three more grenades oh we're good
we cleared yep yay
teamwork teamwork makes the dream work
coach I'll plate it there we'll let the
rebels in one supplies it pays back
later
ah this is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon it's
a fun game especially when your friends
if friends playing with you it's pretty
fun I got eyes in a weapons case yeah
it's so many people all but here guys
you're using right in I'm in right in
breath I still highly recommend rising
but I have other things to use and
systems to build too you know my very
tight B's
it tells over here I'm taking supplies
okay
do we win all like Burt Reynolds back
there where is it on the table yeah
there's
shipping manifest fool in love
processing yeah the dick tell me
something that hurts my feelings Oh your
take on the cartel using my shoe up
these candles like to smoke oh that
sound right to you
drug smugglers have tried that shit
plenty of time ever on this kind of
scale here the cartel get the cocaine
into the box the inner bags get an
airtight seal let's go to was a gun case
where uh you knew that you're already
there no I was getting hammer oh it's in
the next building over here where I
recommend risin 7 1800 X and a gtx 980ti
for editing streaming and gaming sure
but I think we already knew that
no we're not going to play battleground
thank Astrakhan that's kind of like
saying would you recommend the best
hardware ever for doing things
the real challenge comes to those people
that don't have a $500 budget on a CPU
those are the guys who really have a
hard time trying to figure out what to
get
we'll grab a knife breaking this wall I
think you break that wall dude I knew
that these Zeus trucks though man
they're built to stuff stuff I was in TJ
okay see we got let's get out of the way
here
can I show fps I am showing your purse
because can't help it it's really little
clinic where the craps wasn't showing us
I have craps up right Nick isn't in the
corner right there yeah see it it's just
not showing up in that game and take
them out okay what time is it
we got to end this in a couple minutes
so let's do this we'll just end it with
a mission no we'll just end up a little
more chatting because we don't have time
to do the next mission before we have to
go oh this kind of litigation like a go
looks like a dodge with the hood all
jacked up but can look like a Chevy
Colorado to me check Colorado yeah I'm
gonna I'm gonna blow it up okay I'm like
right next to it
well then means move alright I guess
you'll burn out movin okay oh let's see
here I can't find an F P D temp overlay
for this game that works no um perhaps
was working earlier it just stopped
and for some reason right now like it's
showing up on it's showing up on my
screen
really they showing up on my screen but
not on the stream and it was earlier but
I mean basically you need to know is
it's just lost at 60 it's not
fluctuating from 60 which is what I want
because that's what the stream is locked
to Jay will you change the game nope
because we're about to end the stream
people need to stop being stupid
that's goes for the entire world why is
this hair gray because I have gray hair
why are you dumb because you were born
that way okay what's the fastest you
have got your memory speed 1080i I
haven't tried to overclock the memory
very far I mean it's already technically
overclocked from the factory but I think
I could do like a plus 300 on it um dude
you pooping your chair seat dumb
comments yeah dumb comments what the
fuck is repeating repeting oh yeah
because somebody types repeating wrong
we can see but it's really small I can't
make it bigger it's just the way it is
have you played Tom Clancy's Splinter
Cell yes is it fun yes well you probably
liked its loss-making like a metal gear
I just like to go loud yeah like could
be like this I like to go like this
things watch to shoot this guy
I missed my favorites plane I saw the
chaos theory or and black lists black
this was a good one dance hey white rice
night you suck at sniping I really do
this guy's just cowering stays dead oh
my god yeah I really do suck a sniping
but how do you get better you just have
to keep trying right yeah you're trying
shoot that guy through the window oh I
missed again oh well let's see what is
the best budget friendly and it scrolled
away sorry HL 3 half-life 3 I wish but
they confirmed that's never coming it's
never coming up High School Musical is
my favorite anime what get out more
often
J you finna fine as fuck send nudes you
killed Kenny
Jay you streaming Jay what Jesco turn
vsync off damage the GPU no it doesn't
damage the Jeep uh this is why tech
channels will always be around Vegas
Beck's rumored what do you think of wild
lands I think it's fun when you play
with friends when you're kind of when
you're by yourself at the AI it's kind
of boring unless you're into being like
leaving your squad mates alone just have
them hold position yeah and do
everything yourself is 5 gigahertz good
for 7700 K I think you can answer that
yourself question for Nick AMD or Nvidia
for CAD for Kat Nick doesn't do CAD
computer aided drafting Nick isn't a
drafter what's that what's the best
budget-friendly CPU for streaming
69 50 X until CPU damages your GPU
J don't think they're stupid that's what
they're I know
it's yes the thing that was like people
will start to say stupid things just so
that so that you'll read them that guy
that like was shooting his car he just
got out and walked away so walking down
the street now yep and I'm back to being
normal
try and blow up his car with my sniper
rifle will you stop that let's see if I
can hit this chopper from way back here
oh so close
oh he made a quick turn Denis yeah he's
coming back around no way off I only got
one left
he's just doing circles now whoa what's
hitting him I am okay I think I'm
hitting I mean you see sparks yeah okay
I missed oh that one miss don't write
over him
I shot his tail rotor with my sniper
rifle you love my Nissan we stopped
typing that my Nissan is a Nissan
nothing special it's an it's a Nissan or
it's a Nissen if you're from the UK Sam
I think he's out of range for me like so
dramatic
is he hunting you like you can't find
you or what he's just doing a circle
thing
oh he's spotting me right now he spotted
me yep oh that mean again though better
run out of bullets here
I'm down oh I shot him no crap there's a
whole unit a patrol coming now yep and
I'm almost dead myself I'm trying to get
to you okay they're on foot so that's a
good thing
oh crap Here Come three helicopters or
two helicopters at least
okay healing you
dang helpful now Oh put this a lot of
love what's going on they're mad there's
mad as the Internet is when I'm not
using rides in I got one helicopter hi
bad news I'm out of all my bullets
except for my handgun but well I don't
know how much small arms fire is gonna
hurt that McDonald they're a heck of a
pilot it's dropping down alright how it
sounds like has mechanical failure when
you shoot the pilot well it does have
makalya
mechanical failure he's like smacked
against a joystick is so tech better
than nvidia yep so tech makes and video
so much better
no and it he makes the core that's
inside this is okay my planning on
building a mini PC with custom water
cooling loopers appointments nothing's
pointless if it works for you ooh I got
bullets now seven of tarvold stuff yay
all right I think it's time to go all
right we have got to solve time granddad
we got to run back home
it's been a couple more minutes with the
chat and we're going out of here some of
your questions lol how have you not
slammed your phone palm face power your
palm to your skull because I have five
years experience of listening to these
comments okay where'd we leave off with
the donations here anytime I still give
it okay is the Cougar Panzer water
cooling friendly yeah I answered that it
has clearance for 360s in push pool and
sales room for reservoir and pump and
long GPUs let's see
Matt Merkel says oh I already answered
that 15 C top card on top is hot I
already answered that I run 290 80s
still it held off on Pascal because I
need to dual boot Mac OS X for
programming and pro audio there weren't
Pascal drivers until recently now that
there are 1080i 1440p 444 it's 110 atti
is going to beat your 980 s in sli in
terms of like PC gaming I don't know
much about what you're doing on Mac that
you would need the Pascal in your Mac OS
for so I see it your dual booting though
but anyway 1 1 1080 would be better
1080i excuse me be cooler and quieter
and all that stuff are you going to
review to Windows 10 creators update
absolutely not what direction do you
twist your nipples clockwise remember
one curious of your experience is going
from nobody to a public figure how it
changes your daily life if it makes you
feel like a different person how you
deal with everyone wanting to talk to
you like they know you you know what
Nick has known me long before any of
this internet fame stuff so I'll let him
answer in his honest opinion whether or
not my personality has changed it hasn't
changed
I think still as salty as ever yeah
you're still same brutal brutal salty
honest what I love is everyone who tells
me that the fame has made me salty which
means they obviously haven't watched me
for very long because they would know
that I was just always without it yeah
ray so you've always been a little bit
salty but the thing is like I just don't
deal with stupidity and when people do
stupid things I call them out on it and
those people like no you have to be nice
cuz you're a public figure I'm gonna
click that shit I don't live you don't
you don't put a double standard on me
and I'm not gonna live by your double
standard you don't tell me they get to
be rude but I can't like give it back
that I can't get right back to them what
they give me that's that's wrong that's
that's not the way that's not the code I
live by um how about the other part of
his question where he asks if it makes
you feel like a different person I don't
feel like you're a different person
even you've got a little bit of the fam
you've been recognized places by
yourself at school and out and about at
work yeah where you work here and a
couple times yeah I think that's this
this that's the only weird part that
you're never going to get used to it is
recognized like I don't know where no
the being recognized I'm fine with it
it's the wrong button it's the fact that
I think the people who recognise you
quite often forget that they know more
about us than we know about them we know
nothing about this person that just went
up and lit was like hey I have like to
them sometimes you're their best friend
uh-huh but you don't know them so it's a
really one-sided relationship yeah and
so sometimes they'll be like hey I sent
you that I made that comment on your
video did you see it and it's like click
what I don't even know who the heck yeah
I mean I I don't know your screen name
and I don't read many of the comments
because there's like 80,000 of them per
month but but it's just that that's the
narrow down they'll give you they're
like hey I made a comment on your video
I hope you read it it's like ok if I
read it you're making a lot of
scratching sound your mic oh sorry
how do you deal with everyone want to
talk to you like they know you um a a
very famous person once told me that I
know I'm not talk about Terry Crews a
very famous person once told me when I
used to when people first sort of
recognized me I played it down I was
like no no no this regular person I'm
not important blah blah blah
they told me that what I was doing was
wrong because to that person they get to
decide how important I am to them so for
me to downplay their excitement for
meeting me is wrong and rude so what
they basically said is just embrace it
be excited about it and just know that
you're making that person's day if
they're excited to meet you downplaying
it really is is like shutting it's
basically yeah it's like shutting them
down and that's not right gotcha okay so
I guess have to change it up on my end
hmm manbearpig says 1070 SLI over trying
to sell it and buy a 1080 TI
look if you can I always will recommend
getting the fastest single card solution
you can afford up front if that was the
1070 and then you bought a second one I
would still of course highly recommend
selling 272 1070 SL is for a single
1080i because of the performance gain
they're usually the only thing that
would either make me tell someone to
hold off or wait or whatever would be
the timing of it if there is a new GPU
around the corner and it's a particular
time of the year where new things tend
to release then it might not make sense
to to buy something new but it's
definitely the right time to sell
something because once the new thing
comes out overnight your product goes
down in price on the use market and if
you wait too long then you're then the
thing you're selling is not worth as
much so but then you have to gamble
right if you don't know when the new
things coming out do you have something
to use in the meantime what's up I mean
that's that's the that's the the
challenge I already answered the mini PC
comment uh thanks guys for doing great
vids you're welcome
hi Jane coconut monkey led the videos
wish I could give more no sir the fact
you gave anything means a lot
helps me pay this guy's salary thanks I
have one 980ti and I was wondering if
one more 980ti for the win or 110 atti
for the women ID same answer I just gave
about the 1070 and I came in one minute
ago so they probably didn't hear my rant
before they commented that
you think a video will be releasing new
GPU soon J they got an event coming up
later this week it's GTC which they
always have an event around GT see I do
not look if Nvidia launches a new GPU
right now I don't know I think I think
the internet will lose shit because the
new Titan X was already like that didn't
need to happen it didn't it didn't need
to happen the 1080 Ti happened ten
months into the lifecycle of Pascal
which tells me they're trying to expand
the lifespan of Pascal they're trying to
normally like 18 anywhere between like
14 to 18 months is the typical kind of
lifestyle or are summe lifespan of a GPU
core and when they launch a new core 10
months into that that's a new flagship
it makes me feel like they're trying to
extend the life of their current
generation of GPU which maybe that's
because they don't want to come out with
something new until Volta I have no idea
it's all speculation it's all guesswork
do I think they're coming out with a new
GPU GTC iShares how hope not whoa number
2 what year would you guess wait wait
what year would you guess HDD and RAM
combined I understand a question where
you buy like a 500 gigabyte stick of
non-volatile DDR programs installed
directly to memory oh I thought RAM disk
always accessible because they would not
load into memory execution I'm not
entirely sure what you asked me it
almost sounds like you're asking me
about a ram disk the problem the RAM
disk is most of the time when you shut
down the system you lose the disk
partition the disk that's created you
have to recreate it
most people like RAM just soar fun to
play with because of the stupid speed
that they create as a hard drive but the
problem is like like I said getting them
to be a permanent solution is not
practical
Dierks RL says have you ever had a
chance to test the effects of PCIe Rises
or cables on SLI performance
I love the mounting options it allows
but don't want to hinder 10 series SLI
performance I think I think the length
matters more so than anything I've
personally not tested anything long I've
tested the riser cards that come with
like some of the the GPUs or assuming
some of the cases like the the nano
define s it has a riser card no wait no
that one doesn't was it's a 202 the 202
has a riser card there was no difference
in performance but it was a rigid card
rather than like a ribbon cable card so
the length of it is is what's kind of
matter most I believe but I've not
tested at what point there's a
diminishing return you don't have
noticed it's mostly very foreign names
that are asking me like why you switched
from Rison right mm-hmm it's always like
a very foreign name I've noticed I don't
I don't understand why but it's it's
like I don't it's always some crazy
foreign name it happens
um hey JB played pray yet it's amazing
I've been seeing a lot of people talk
about pray but I haven't played it I've
been thinking about it just about rx 584
171 was it a good buy the four gigabyte
version yeah um I I don't I don't think
four gigabytes is enough moving forward
from where we are today but for 171 it's
a decent price didn't say which one
though
well foreign people I bet you don't know
any don't you have some money to burn as
you make sense
fun fact my mom is a German immigrant so
on your ass that's I know plenty of
foreign people okay Jay does our five
sixteen hundred and sixteen hundred X
when overclocked have some more
performance I heard something about that
is the truth
I have budget to buy any of these two
but wouldn't but why wouldn't I save
some money they're going to be very much
like a bend CPU situation you may get
the overclocking performance and a
sixteen hundred to meet the 1600 X but
you might not so it's a gamble
gee I have a 372 let's race for that
1080 TI I've not been beaten by another
na and 370z by the way or your engine's
Calicut unicorn at least when when you
die note it mm-hmm what gave me a mouse
do you personally prefer this one that's
not available anymore this is the
coolermaster CM storm Reaper mouse they
don't make it anymore I don't know why
it's my favorite mouse ever it's weighty
it's got really good optics it just
feels really good it's a palm mouse not
a claw I really like it they stopped
making it shortly thereafter I don't
know why
Oh CJ are you hyped for Vega I'm excited
to see what they have to bring I mean
I'm curious as to what the price point
is going to be tell you the truth
because preliminary testing like the
early stuff they showed like CES
and what they showed in San Francisco at
GDC also showed that it was like edging
out the GTX 1080 but we all know how
much the 1080 Ti is destroying the 1080
in terms of its own performance so if it
falls in the middle of 1080i and 1080p
going to be of 1080 is currently 510
atti is 700 what's it going to be 600 I
don't know we have to see I'm choosing
between 1050 TI and 1060 just get the
1060 don't get a 1050 Ti there's no
reason to get a 1050 and even then it I
would never get a 1050 or a 1050 Ti over
like binocs for our 585 70 in that range
there's no point is running MDOT to
memory worth it you mean storage MDOT -
isn't memory it's very fast
I mean it's direct to the PCIe lanes it
doesn't go through a SATA controller
mm what would be a good GPU to match
with our FX 4100 but still work with the
feature
FX 8320 i've got some news for you
there's no future for the for the FX
a320 that's that CPU has has run its
course it is very dated at this point so
anything you get any modern GPU above
like a 480 is going to be slowed down by
d3 20 guaranteed let's see here what
would you recommend to someone trying to
sell an FX series motherboard CPU and
RAM to try and build a new horizon rig
get as much money 40 as you can I don't
know you're not going to get a lot of
money for that you might get a couple
hundred dollars total towards the rising
rig but I mean forums if you have a
reputation on forums can help you sell
it other than that I'm not sure what
you're asking me Fred says why did you
switch from dxracer chair sinking of
Guinea 1 but holding off I'm just done
with the whole ridiculous concept of
racecar chairs being an office chair
they're comfortable at first but the
problem is I was dealing with things
like the handles breaking the base
starting to creak and pop and make all
kinds of crazy noise even Jerry's fix
when he came down here and took the GS
researcher part worked for like all of a
week and it started popping and making
all kinds of noise again nothing beats a
properly designed office chair what do
you think of these autonomous chairs
Nick I love these ones they're really
comfy and the only problem I have is the
headrest on these likes to just kind of
like randomly right it's a desk full
head rest but I like the adjustable back
support on this more than the dxracer
and stuff like that there is no
adjustable back support on those chairs
well they give you that pillow that you
never use that's not adjustable this is
the pisser
it's another pillow and all it does is
push against your back you can't adjust
how firm it is how you can move it like
up and down as much as it goes that's it
but you can't adjust the depth of the
butt like you can slide the butt on
these chairs forward and backwards to
make it more like behind your knee or
more underneath your ass this is like a
BMW see ya um let's see versus a
straight bucket seat
would you say thirty point forty by 1440
to 100 Hertz is a better experience in
4k at sixty absolutely that's personal
preference though and I have not gamed
yet on any of the high refresh rate 4k
monitors so I can't include my my
comment we're getting that mic for
driver says hey Jay I think the last
person was asking what you think of
Intel obtained and the eventual move for
RAM and hard disks to single pool of
memory
oh don't octane I don't have obtain to
play around it I read the new briefings
and stuff I'm a little turned off by its
price obviously and I think that it's
more of a people who want to be early
adopters on new technology and there's a
lot of diminishing returns on costs on
that but I see that they have varying
levels of price point so I'm not
entirely sure yet but yeah I do but also
to only the latest motherboards are also
supporting Intel obtained I don't know
if this backwards capability on
motherboards I already have MDOT to nvme
or xev MDOT to convert the gen 3 the gen
3 or gen 2 either way I don't know if
those backward support for those so I
guess time will tell
4790k will bottleneck a 1080 TI I don't
think so
hey J I was wondering between a CSP g27
9q or PG 3 for aq what would you pick
also the quality control butter I really
like my three my PG 348 the internal
speakers on them suck compared to the
creditor now the predator and the Asus
have pretty much the same panel like the
panel supplier on the inside of them
their take on things I like the bezel
and the stand and the lighting and the
speakers and all that stuff is different
the predator is so good I was using it
purely to edit my audio for the longest
time and I used to get so many comments
like oh my god you your audio is so good
audio is so good there and they were
like I want to know what reference
monitors using is like I'm using
internal speaker on my monitor to edit
the audio and people didn't believe me
Nick saw it it sounds really good the
problem the asus is they really cry
doubt and cheaped out on the speakers
are using these so I'm actually using a
sound bar right now for this until I get
some some reference monitors all right
one more comment here or two more I have
a 546 70 K at 10:17 I'm seeing a lot of
hundred percent usage is a time for a
newer platform and just go 144 or 1440p
and 4k monitor to stress the GPU um
sounds like you're playing a game that's
very CPU intensive you could you can try
upping the resolution but I don't know I
mean I wouldn't I find out I'm really
curious as to how you're stressing a 46
70 K are you overclocked 100% usage on
the CPU what game you playing something
like ARMA because it sounds like you're
very CPU bound
ok I'll switch the video you all have
small box right now no because I don't
have a scene setup for this for the big
box and it would be a studio I don't
it's weird like when you switch a
different scene I don't have the option
selected right now where when I switch
to scene it deactivates the previous
scene unless I restart OBS which will
stop the stream I wasn't planning on
doing a full-on Q&amp;amp;A like this so the
scene wasn't set up alright any downside
using one res long as I have a radiator
between each component and Anup room it
doesn't matter where the radiators are
in your loop it's not going to make
things run cooler the overall loop is
going to run at an equalized temperature
so the radiator is going to determine
how cool your loop gets where the
radiator is in your loop does not
determine how cool it gets if that makes
sense
so run things based on what makes sense
in your case that you're using and don't
worry about trying to get a radiator
before the res it just always seems to
work out that radiators go before the
res because most of the time they'll go
from the radiator back to the res
because the radios at the highest point
so with that we're gonna go guys we're
going to try and do streams like this we
play some games I'd like to do it weekly
and I'm thinking that I'm going to
switch the upload schedule to Tuesday
Thursday Saturday moving forward Nik
agrees with that it's hard to get a
video up Monday when usually we're
spending Friday getting things ready or
finishing up things from the final week
that we just finished and then having a
video ready to go Monday's hard so we're
thinking we're going to do Tuesday
thursday-saturday moving forward except
for this week there's a video going up
Wednesday because of NDA left so there's
that anyway we're gonna go Nikki wants
anything for go bye guys
so insightful chase I guess that's just
where we're going to stop it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
