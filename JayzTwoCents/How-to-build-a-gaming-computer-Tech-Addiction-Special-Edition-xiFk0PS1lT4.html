as I've been promising for the last
couple of weeks I want to show you guys
just how easy it is to build your own
computer and there's nothing to be
scared of because these aren't my part
so if anything breaks it's not my
problem so let's go ahead and jump right
in and build this thing all right guys
let's go ahead and talk about the parts
got a whole stack of parts here
everything was bought fresh nothing was
reused for the graphics card one with a
Asus direct cu2 gtx 660 this is not the
TI version guys this is the standard 660
this was the best graphics card we could
afford for this budget but in all the
features we were looking for a nice heat
pipe design very quiet operation for the
motherboard we again went with the basic
gigabyte b75 m d3h very solid
motherboard it's going to be a computer
that's on all the time so it's got very
stable operation in it so that's what we
needed we also needed a micro ATX board
to make more room in the case so we
didn't go with a full-featured full
sized board and I'll tell you in the end
this is a very impressive motherboard
processor straightforward I 535 70 K we
got this thing at a very reasonable
price at micro Center and for the memory
we're using ballistics 8 gigabytes of
1600 megahertz ram we didn't go all out
on the power supply unit we went with a
thermal take TR to 600 watt it is an 80
plus rated PSU so it's going to get the
job done for us and for the case we're
using a Diablo Tec evo ATX mid tower
case nothing special had all the
features we needed and it was all
powder-coated black including the inside
one of the things you should always do
when you build a PC is use a ground
strap I don't use a ground strap I never
have I built at least 20 computers in
just the last few years alone never used
a ground strap and I've never had a
problem but manufactures will tell you
is recommended to use a ground strap
what you want to do is remove your
motherboard and place it on top of your
motherboard box this gives you a nice
surface to work on it won't scratch your
table because of all of these solder
points right here which are very sharp
want to install the CPU when the
motherboard is free of the case when you
try and install it inside you have a lot
less room to work with and the processor
is the most fragile part of the build so
you want to make sure that that is
protected at all times one of the most
common mistakes people make when
installing their CPU into their
motherboard is they don't orient the CPU
properly you'll notice up here that
there is two notches on the top of the
processor does not just correspond with
two notches that are in the socket so
you want to make sure that you get those
lined up and that you drop the CPU on
there evenly and it will fit right into
place it seems simple enough but you'd
be surprised how many people have
actually destroyed their sockets by not
properly installing this is also another
part that a lot of people are afraid to
do is to properly lock down their socket
when you bring down the latch cover here
it goes under the screw but when you
push down the lever and you get about
halfway it starts to get really really
tight you actually are going to feel
this rod Bend and it's going to make you
think you're hurting your processor but
you're not you're making sure it has a
nice secure set of seal and contact
between all of the different pins
underneath the process of this build
right off the bat we're not really
planning on doing any real overclocking
so we've opted to use just the stock
intel heat sink fan over time we will
replace this so we're just going to go
ahead and leave the stock thermal
compound that is on the heatsink right
here but what you need to make sure is
that you orient a fan and a spot of
which you're going to be able to easily
plug into the fan header which in this
case is to the bottom and to the left of
the product you want to make sure that
when you seat this you get the nipples
the
Computers like dirty talking you want to
make sure you get all four of these
nipples lined up on the holes we're
going to push this down
you heard it locked push it to the right
and it's locked in now instead of going
around in a circle you want to do this
in a star pattern so you're going to go
directly across what you think I want to
go ahead and talk about before we
install the memory onto this motherboard
is the importance of checking the
channel configuration of your
motherboard these are not all the same
one would think that the two blue
channels and the two white channels
would be separate but that's not true
for all motherboards so make sure you
take out the manual and don't toss it
aside until after you've looked at this
and determined what your memory
configuration is speaking of which is a
good thing I check the manual because
this is one of those motherboards where
to get a dual channel configuration you
have to use the same color if you're
using two DIMM slots
now for the case we just went for a very
basic very simple Diablo Tec mid tower
case you want to look for something that
has intake fans on the front on the top
this one just happens to have a couple
on the side but what I liked about this
particular case is the fact that it has
it's all black powder coating
different motherboards have different
whole patterns for mounting locations
you have micro ATX ATX and so what
you're going to want to do is you're
going to most cases have these holes
marked unfortunately this case doesn't
so what you have to do is you're going
to have to hold the motherboard up to
the holes just so you can get an idea of
which pattern of mounting screws you
need to use and then what you do after
that is you're going to put in your
standoffs for your motherboard
before install your motherboard inside
the case you want to make sure you get
the IO plate oriented properly there's
nothing more annoying than getting this
thing in the case upside down and then
it doesn't match up with your
motherboard when you try to install and
so when installing your power supply
it's important to think about where your
computer is going to be installed if
it's going to be sitting on a desk like
over there go ahead and show the mess in
this office there's no carpet to worry
about for my power supplies I'm able to
keep the fan pointing down which will
keep the dust from getting inside the
power supply in it however this model up
here is going to be installed on the
floor sitting on carpet so if we have
carpet plugging up this hole it's not
going to keep very much air from it's
going to keep air from getting to this
power supply unit if it's faced downward
so we're going to go ahead and mount
this model facing up so that they can
get fresh air from inside the case
this next thing we're going to do now
that we have our motherboard installed
our power supply is mounted we've got
our eight pin to our CPU ran a little
bit I don't like this but this case
doesn't really allow us to run it behind
we're now going to install our GPU and
this is the Asus DC 2 or the DCU GTX 660
from Nvidia so we're getting pretty
close to having all the guts installed
here we've got the power supply unit
we've got it routed to the back zip-tied
got a graphics card a motherboard memory
processor heatsink and the added fans
okay guys so here it is it's all put
together the wires are you know some
people might say this looks alright I'm
anal retentive and this bothers me a
little bit but we did the best we could
with the cable management in this case
again this case was only 37 bucks so you
really can't complain powder-coated
black it looks pretty good we get the
wires up out of the way a little bit
there but the backside it's really not
too bad I just kind of select the excess
over here under the drive bays you won't
really see it but what you got to be
sure of is that you don't have these
bunched up in a particular spot so where
you can't get the side panel back on you
can see they stick out a little bit but
when you push it on it with your hand
you can see that there's some slack so
they will compress and close but before
we stick the back panel on we have to
make sure that this thing actually works
so we're going to do next is we're going
to go ahead get the monitor keyboard
mouse hooked up to this thing we're
going to do our first test to see
whether or not I broke it
we built ourself a budget gaining chance
method I broke it you signed a waiver
okay so moment of truth it's put
together it looks pretty cool we're
gonna hit that power button and see if
it actually boots
oh we got a beat look at that we got a
post
yeah AJ's two cents did the amazing
plugging-in apart so you guys see how
easy it is to build a computer literally
building a computer these days is
nothing but putting together Legos the
most important part you have to remember
is be gentle with some of it I've seen
some of you guys that practically
shoehorn in some of these YouTube videos
computer parts into a computer I
understand you're excited I understand
at your computer and you want to see how
I want to play it on a play on my games
I want to watch porn to night but you
got to just be patient
this stuff is fredrik and you can take
some extra time like I did and make sure
you put together you know the wiring in
a nice neat matter check it out these
white LEDs here it'd look really nice
there is an awful lot of air swimming
animals it's kind of a noisy computer
but the guy who built this computer for
doesn't care about the noise and it's
just going to make sure everything stays
nice and cool and I'm going to go ahead
and get the operating side
operating system loaded on the and we're
going to put on some benchmarks we're
going to go ahead and just see exactly
how this thing benchmarks don't go
anywhere
that was really gay
so guys just a chance I'm just going to
do a quick overview of the computer into
parts that go for my friend I wish
spared no expense on this computer at
all this I mean what would with the I
Intel processor right here it's like the
39,000 K or something like that for the
DES motherboard it was important that we
had something to handle all this power
so we went ahead look wiki the gigabyte
where's that ETA b75 and a bunch of
numbers you might matter we will mix in
with a ballistics the ballistic they
spelled that wrong it doesn't happen
let's just have an X this is probably
one the like messed up version so it has
an excellent whatever and this dish bad
boy right here this is our GTX 260 6 GTX
660 started sale and it has a header on
it and its head your feet into a turbo
and this is the intercooler
in there and it's got two fins on the
bottom right there which is really
important because when you have the top
of the line like this right here you
have to properly cool this so that's why
we call these fancies led's led's add
like 100 megahertz to the speed of your
computer I think I spit on the lens so
you might want to watch out
um this right here this right here is
like a flux capacitor coil this this is
actually very high-tech this isn't
release on the market this is
proprietary design simply for this
computer and I I can't really talk too
much about that NASA told me you know
listen the wall that you use of this
technology but I've said too much but
anyway that I thought maybe you guys
want a little bit of information about
computers so you know it's the only cost
like $4,800 lucky too bad and so
oh I know the front this is like our
this is like our intake right here mrs.
JDM it came straight off a Honda and
this computer is so badass then we
actually needed a automotive parts to
cool it so there you go hope you guys
enjoy this is Jay's tution Christian
