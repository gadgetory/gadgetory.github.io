I did the mini ITX build I mentioned
that I use glass tubing and I asked you
guys if you wanted a tutorial about how
to use glass tubing in your systems now
I admit I'm not the first one to ever do
it but there's very little information
out there about how to do it so today we
are going to try and turn this a little
bit more mainstream by me showing you
the methods that I use to cut the glass
and everything you need to know about
using glass inside of your system
today's video is sponsored by Scottevest
the clothing company known for its
innovative designs allowing you to keep
your belongings safe and secure so you
can focus on the more important things
in life today I'm wearing the nomadic
hoody I like it for its bold design
lightweight but warm micro fleece and 13
pockets allowed me to keep everything
that matters most to me near and dear
and I don't worry about losing that
980ti you guys know how much I love my
980 T is but maybe this bold design
isn't for you well that's okay because

with a disclaimer one working with glass
obviously is can be sharp so you might
want to you know not cut yourself -
there are a lot of methods of cutting
glass and the methods that I chose here
for this video are going to be amongst
the cheapest way to do it because let's
face it a lot of us are looking for the
cheapest way to do something and I'm no
exception to that rule and number three
obviously you do this at your own risk
if you mess up your system well that's
all on you now why would one want to use
glass tubing what really comes down to
nothing more than an aesthetic at least
in my opinion there's not really any
sort of a structural integrity to glass
compared to PE TG or acrylic some might
think it's really really brittle it's
actually not I think acrylic is a bit
more brittle than the glass tubing
because of the wall thickness but for me
I used it because of the clarity it just
looks so
oh damn clear its scratch-resistant and
it's actually going to be more
compatible with fluids than any plastic
out there I mean why do you think they
use glass beakers in science labs and
dealing with acids and stuff is because
glass is pretty much impervious to
almost everything so kind of a case in
point when you're dealing with PE TG is
there actually is a glycol in here and
that's one of that's why should with the
G stands for in PT G and you can't use
glycol-based fluids with this otherwise
you'll start to run into some problems
with melting and things so when it comes
to PT G hitting the market a lot of
people freaked out because some coolants
do have glycol in them when it comes to
acrylic I've shown you guys in the past
that it's not very shatter resistant
hard impacts can crack it and break it
granted I don't think you plan on
dropping your computer but you know
whatever I think it's just one of those
things where people moved from acrylic
to PT G because it was new it's nothing
necessarily bad with acrylic either and
acrylic is clearer than PE TG when it
comes to you know how clear the actual
plastic is and it looks a lot better
but yeah all in all glass is definitely
the clearest it looks the best in my
opinion and like I said it's not going
to have any adverse reactions to any
sort of fluid now as most people know
soft tubing tends to cloud over time
this is some of the soft tubing that was
used in my test loop with distilled
water and yeah as you can see here it is
turned pretty damn cloudy now obviously
there are some tools that you are going
to need one of the first ones more than
obvious is the fact you're going to need
glass tubing now this is available from
companies like Mayhem's in fact you can
get these at like Granger and a lot of
industrial supplies as well but I am
holding Mayhem's glass because that's
what what they sent me but anyway it's
going to be coming in a bunch of
different sizes twelve millimeter
thirteen millimeter and sixteen
millimeter one thing to point out the
method I'm showing you today will only
work with twelve and thirteen I don't
tend to use the big stuff like sixteen
millimeter so you're going to have to
assume you're doing 12 or 13 you're
going to need a drill one that goes up
to at least 13 millimeters of opening in
here and we'll talk about why in a
minute you are going to need some files
I just use a straight file and then I
use a rounded file here a triangle file
would work as well but we've got some
files truly doesn't matter how course
they are and of course you are going to
need some sort of glass cutter or score
now I've got two different models right
here that I'm going to demonstrate this
guy here I got from Amazon for 11 bucks
this guy here I got from Amazon for 35
so you got two different options here
depending on your price point and I'm
actually a little bit more fond of this
guy and I'll show you why when we do the
actual cutting cutting when we do the
actual cutting tutorial we get to
cutting later and then of course you're
going to need your rigid fittings for
either a 12 or 13 millimeter you decide
most people do 13 millimeter that's kind
of the norm but yeah anyway just regular
compression fittings that you would use
for hard tubing like PE T G or acrylic
are the same tubing fittings that you
are going to use for glass okay so one
of the things I recommend is that you
actually use either acrylic or PE TG to
get all of your links situated so I
would completely build out the loop with
plastic and then use these as your
templates for cutting the glass the
reason why is it's a lot easier to make
adjustments to plastic by trimming off
you know eighth of an inch a quarter
inch whatever then the glass because the
thing is with the glass you need to have
something to grab onto for leverage to
break it and you're not gonna be able to
do that if you try and score the very
end of glass it just doesn't work very
well so although it's going to be a
little bit more expensive you know a few
extra bucks to get the plastic
definitely do plastic first then cut
glass now cutting the glass is actually
very very simple it's nothing more than
creating a weak spot for the glass to
break you want to control where the
glass breaks because we are quite
literally going to be breaking glass and
that's how we cut it you know there are
some very expensive lathes and stuff
that you can put glass in that has a
special cutting wheel that would slowly
cuts the glass as its turning on a lathe
n it spits you know coolant on it just
like a CNC but it's for glass and it
cuts it very nicely
obviously these are glass cutting
companies that deal with a lot of
science beakers and things like that we
are not you know we're not scientific
around here this is this is this is
freaking Haggard garage when it comes to
tech man so that's where this guy comes
in right here you are going to want to
mark the glass and the way that I do
this is let's say let's say this is the
length that we needed to be right there
right so ignore this part that's hanging
off for this just use our imaginations
that's all it is right there so I take
these I line these up together and then
I take my file and then I will take the
edge of it this is where kind of a
triangular file comes in handy but this
is a nice thin file here and then I will
put a good score in that glass that way
I can see exactly you can't really see
on camera but there's a little scratch
right there
that's where I need to cut so that's how
I do it but this guy right here you
could try and put this on there squeeze
it by hand and it is that this is
considered a fingertip score and then
you know you can try and turn that and
get your scratch the problem is this one
here as you can see because it's a cheap
model it's got some let me show you here
it's got some side-to-side movement the
problem is this wants to walk on you and
then you end up getting a spiral scratch
which isn't going to do you any good so
what I found works for me is I will
literally just chuck the glass up in my
drill you want to put your clamp right
here pretty loose that way doesn't so
that way it doesn't crack the glass and
you see I just made a lathe I pretty
much just made a poor man's lathe so
then what I do is I line the scoring
wheel which is right there that's that
little wheel I line that up where I want
the score to be hold it tight and just
kind of go slow and then speed up slowly
and then you can see we have put a
pretty good score in this glass now I
like to make sure that the groove is as
deep as possible so I let it go around a
bit and you'll hear it cutting the glass
too
there we go so you can see we've got a
pretty deep scratch right there now what
we've done is we've told the glass
pretty much exactly where we want it to
crack fortunately when the end right
here is broken and then it's filed down
and you stick that in the fitting and
it's got the clamp that goes over the
top that doesn't actually show believe
it or not that little mark is on every
tube inside the ITX system but you can't
see it because the clamp on top of the
compression fitting actually covers that
so once that's taken care of you want to
add a little moisture to the cut I
literally just lick my finger and wipe
it around and it sounds going to gross
but and then you're going to apply with
your thumbs pressure on either side as
you're pulling back like that and away
with your hands and then there it is
there is your nice pretty even cut you
get a close-up on that so that's good
enough right there it's straight and
it's not jagged so you can see right
there without even cleaning it up it's
actually not that jagged and that
wouldn't even cut you it's not that bad
at all now official glass cleaning would
say that you'd want to use some sort of
like a Benson torch and torch the end of
this and it's going to like kind of
flame polish it and smooth it out
obviously I don't have a Venson torch so
we are going to chuck it back up in my
grill and then I just take my file as of
spinning
and then that is what we are left with
right there yeah not too bad for being
kind of a poor man's method huh now the
reason why you really want to make sure
you clean up that edge is because there
are oh ringing side of most of the
compression fittings especially here on
the bits power 12 millimeter compression
fittings these are the ones that I use
inside the ITX build when you push that
in you want to kind of give it a little
bit of a twist and then it fits in there
perfectly but if you don't have that
smoothed out you have any sharp edges
you're just going to slice that Oh ring
now it's not a huge deal if it does cut
that o-ring a little bit because it does
have another oring at least on the bits
power fittings that goes over it right
here and then when you push down on the
clamp that's going to compress that
o-ring against the glass and the actual
fitting so it's not going to bleed but
there it is that is what the glass looks
like a little bit dirty at the moment
but yeah you kind of get the idea but if
that right there isn't a reason to go
with glass I don't know what is now the
more expensive tool that I showed right
here this is actually designed to and
I'm gonna put a link to Amazon and of
course it's going to link to my
affiliate so you know if you guys use
that thank you for that - both of these
tools like I said I bought both of these
off of Amazon now each wheel inside of
the or each chain link right here has a
scoring wheel inside of it and the idea
is that you open up the jaws like this
and then close the chain around it this
is actually not easy to do at the angle
I'm trying to do this for you guys so
yeah you lock the chain in like that and
the idea here is as you squeeze this it
starts to give a score as you turn it
and you can hear actually hear it
cracking or scoring I should say and
then as you turn it and get a score all
the way around it
you're supposed to simply pull the
handle that will get this in focus that
would be a good idea huh and then when
you pull the handle it just breaks it
apart the problem I have with this is
look at how jagged the ends are so one
of the reasons why I bought this tool
was to see if it's any better and I can
you know tell you why I like the other
tool better now you can also chuck it up
and
use it as a scoring tool in the drill
like I just did so let's go and show you
how that works now this can work in the
drill the same way like I showed you
with the finger tips core is that you
can simply put a little bit of pressure
where you need the score to be and then
spin it with the drill take this off and
then you can snap it in the same manner
so that works really well too and that's
one of the reasons why I got this is
because this doesn't want to walk on me
like this does so if you're going to be
doing a lot of builds like I think I'm
going to be doing a tool like this might
come in handy
but the fingertip score is definitely a
mitts about 11 bucks on Amazon it's
definitely a way to get started so there
you go guys the J's two cents method of
scoring and cracking the glass which is
really nothing more than just kind of a
standard conventional way of cracking it
so when it comes to the tools like I
said 11 bucks versus about 35 bucks you
can see the links to these down in the
description if you guys are curious
about that if you're only going to be
doing one build then you could get away
with this you want to give yourself lots
of extra glass because every now and
then you crack it and then it chips off
really deep inside the edge of the cut
and then you've got to cut that piece
all over again so you want to make sure
you have a lot of spare and like I said
there's no real trimming it down to size
because the closer that the score is to
the end of the glass when you go to
break it the more the glass wants to
kind of break apart and become jagged so
there's really no simple method when it
comes to trimming the glass at least
without one of those lathes that have a
cutting wheel so that's how I did it
that's how I did the glass in this ITX
build and I'm going to be doing glass in
future builds I might convert skunkworks
to it the downside is that you've got to
use 90 degree fittings to do the bends
because heating and bending glass is not
easy especially to make it keep its
shape because filling it with something
to make it keep from or some sort of a
mandrel to keep it from crushing on
itself with the amount of heat it takes
to get glass to Bend means like the
silicone tubing we use a ptg would melt
long before the glass does glass is
really strong stuff actually anyway
thanks for watching you guys requested
this video it was actually pretty easy
one to do if you know a better method
for cutting glass or you have any tips
for me or anyone else
on how to get better cleaner cuts on the
glass without getting too expensive
remember these are these are people who
don't work with glass every day
including myself so going super
expensive on the tools makes zero sense
so if you've got another poor man's
method to cutting glass and keeping it
clean put it in the comments or tweet it
at me and I might do an update to this
video showing other methods anyway guys
thanks for watching once again these
videos aren't possible without you and
I'm hugely grateful for that because of
that I will make another video and I
will see you in it till then</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
