gonna build a computer today I'm
building a computer for my
brother-in-law if you guys duck when I
started this channel I'll be back in
2012 we had identical systems I had
built my AMD 8120 FX system which had
white tubing and all that you guys go
back to my very first videos you'll see
that well he had a matching system he
liked my build so much he was like build
me one too that's still the system he's
using to this day let's just say it's
not exactly getting the job done it has
two gtx 680 s in it which is not
terrible but i mean today you need more
than two gigs of VRAM and is still
running an 80 150 I think because I did
80 120 he had a 8 150 but I digress he's
got a 128 gigabyte SSD and he's got a
hard drive in there and he's got water
cooling that has been running for have
him here
it's time for an upgrade so we actually
are gonna be celebrating Christmas with
him this Sunday a little bit late
because of his work schedule so I
thought how better to brighten up his
holiday than to give him a brand new AMD
rig I got new merch it's available now
crowd me calm slash tasty sense we got
zip up hoodies we got tri-blend we got a
new logo I digress since 2012 it's like
the rest logo you guys been asking for
that anyway well guys live it up we hope
kinds of zip up hoodies have beanies
polos don't take my word for it cuz
obviously I can't do this ad so just
look in the description below and you
guys will find the link Thanks so he's a
huge fan of AMD I we talked about
building him a system earlier this year
and talked about budgets and this and
that he's like well I've always stuck
with AMD because I think they're a good
value and obviously now they're not only
a good value they're an amazing
performance for that same value so we're
gonna stick with AMD for him because
that is just like I said what he likes
so we got the 2700 X right here this is
the highest end GPU can possibly get
right now currently on the X 470
platform at least two after CES there
might be something new and if it's
backwards compatible with motherboards
that will probably upgrade him in the
after that launches anyway but this is
the best you can get currently I'm using
the Asus crosshair 7 hero Wi-Fi board I
I have a lot of X 470 boards I could
have used I'm specifically using this
one because he
currently has the crosshair five so it's
literally gonna be like the 2018 or last
couple days of 2018 version of what he
has from 2012 so that's gonna be that's
gonna be fun I'm using an EVGA 850 g3
supernova power supply with a black
sleeve cable set for that more than
enough power because of the parts that
we're using and I'm kind of going all
over the table here this right here is
actually one of my Titan X's out of
skunkworks remember one of these went in
the editing rig well this is the other
one and it's going into his he's always
been a huge fan of skunkworks so I
thought it'd be neat to give him a piece
of history out of that build we are
gonna be giving him a hyper x 960
gigabyte SSD no MDOT twos for this build
because I honestly don't have any
they're all gone so we can see about
upgrading him as time goes on as well
and in terms of storage but I'm also
giving him a one terabyte Seagate
Barracuda Drive he doesn't play a lot of
games he's got his favorite games like
Neverwinter and Battlefield and stuff
like that so this should be more than
enough storage to where he can actually
put all the games he likes to play on
the heart on the SSD anyways and put all
his family photos and videos and stuff
on the hard drive I'm gonna also have it
rigged up so that we can add more
storage later on as needed and for water
cooling we're actually going with soft
tubing because he loves the look of
white tube yes I know I could have
gotten white rigid tubing but we're
gonna go with soft to me because we want
to stick with ease of serviceability
because we're me changing out the the
hard or not the hard drive but the CPU
and all that stuff I wanna be able to
easily remove it and we're moving dead
bugs I know someone said I was having
mini-strokes I think I just proved their
point you know the real reason why I'm
using soft tubing though is he loves the
look of white tube we've got it right
here sort of just gravity sort of
stretching it out because it's pretty
coiled up but also I want to show that
not like I get all these comments people
like I want a water cooler I'm afraid to
hardline it's like people have started
thinking that hardline is the only thing
you can do so we're gonna break that
stigma today obviously we've got our ek
supremacy Evo AMD water block it's an
RGB block all of our compression
fittings are reservoir pump combo which
is sleeves
thank goodness already we are going with
dual three sent three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiators because that's how
we like to do we like to go with bigger
than we need to one form alpha cool one
fractal design this is actually a a
disassembled Kelvin expandable AIO from
fractal design but they actually use
alpha cool radiators so that's why
they're identical this one just says
fractal design on it speaking of fractal
design he said he wanted to go with the
define s case the define s2 has launched
since then not to mention it's gonna
make this really easy to water cool in
because I'm not just doing a build today
I want to see how fast I can build this
so we're gonna start a timer or at least
Phil's gonna start a timer and I think
periodically throughout the montage he
should show a little bit of a progress
of how long it's been and let's see how
fast Jay can build a water-cooled rig oh
I forgot to quickly talk about the
memory g.skill Flair X because rise in
and best memory you can get for risin
let's do it I'm gonna be seeing that the
whole time ahead
alright so 2 hours and 48 minutes later
and a big-ass mess and a coolant now
that we're not happy with we're done
notes are sitting at BIOS I know the
parts work though because we've already
uses motherboard in the CPU before we
just realized that Green was the only
coolant that I had I had any distilled
water in here believe it or not none
whatsoever
so I used the green just to because I
thought maybe it wouldn't look as bad as
it does but because of the white tubes
with the green it looks very wrong like
it needs to be clear so now I've got to
drain the system which I'm a drain in
here I just drain it through the
reservoir I'm bolt it and hanging out
the side one of the roof nice things
about soft tubing and then I have to
flush it which won't take long it's
fresh coolant and then Holly go get some
water and put in clear but 2 hours and
48 minutes and as you can see we decided
to also not go with the front radiator
because there's no way out and make it
look clean absolutely none the triple
rad is plenty I'm surprised at how much
air the NZXT fans move thrown know the
truth there's a ton of air coming
through here so I was worried they
weren't gonna move like they're gonna be
more airflow optimized but when they're
all lit up and stuff it'll look kind of
cool I mean that's the other thing too
we could tie green in by making the huge
shine green and then we have a green
cane if we're gonna do that though we
should have done black tubing so does we
have black dipping too
all right do we have motherboard lights
yes we do power button yes look at the
art look at the the reservoir I did an
RGB reservoir Oh bubbles
okay still going EQ memories past yeah
hey two hours and 45 minutes isn't bad
if you don't count the time it took me
to drain the system but hey I hope the
bald Arg bees you got the RGB up here
which you know doesn't really do much
because the radiators so offset it
blocks a lot of light but everything
looks good to me
idling at a good temperature we can
overclock this biatch both drives are
showing up in the boot manager so that's
perfect now I just need to get the OS
installed and stuff so this is what
happens when you have to get work done
and make a video at the same time and
make a computer for someone that you
promised a computer for a long time ago
so follow on social media if you guys
want to see whether or not he likes I'll
post a picture and embarrass him like I
said Sunday this Sunday the 30th I think
it is is warmer having our get-together
with that side of the family so you guys
can follow it at Jase two cents or an
Instagram same thing at G's two cents
guys thanks for watching and as always
we'll see you in the next one and for
the record I could have built this in
about an hour and a half if I didn't
care about neatness or wire management
or functionality you easily just we
could have built another table one
called it first boot but that I'm
actually okay with presenting to someone
as a gift they don't like it well then
I'll cry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
