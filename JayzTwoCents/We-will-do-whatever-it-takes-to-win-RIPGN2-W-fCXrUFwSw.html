you know what guys I got new merch it's
available now crowd me calm /jc sense we
got zip up hoodies we got tri-blend we
got a new logo I digress since 2012 but
the rest logo you guys been asking for
that anyway
well guys little bit uh well kinda stuff
zip up hoodies beanies polos don't take
my word for it cuz obviously I can't do
this Edie so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks all right here we go
Steve like I said in our last video
Steve threw down that gauntlet and he
beat our score but there's a big
asterisk and I say ass strict no tricks
asterisk asterisk asterisk
Astrix so so Steve threw down the
gauntlet but here's the thing the
original ripped Gian and ripped J
competition was about the twenty atti
because we just sort of were having fun
and overclocking it on air conditioning
and water and stuff and then it started
to progress from there to ice buckets
and air conditioners with ice buckets
and dry ice at least for me anyway I'm
the only one that would exotic cooling
so far and we had this gentlemen's
agreement to not to use ln2 and i-i in
our last video I mentioned that we went
ahead and said screw it and we went Ln
two and I went ahead and honored that
agreement until I saw that Steven
decided to start using the Titans so
that means all bets are off as far as
I'm concerned by the way I got a little
bone to pick with Steve and I pointed
this out to him he said that we pulled a
Linus and we were playing the game no
one's playing with single card
fair enough he doesn't watch our videos
I don't really watch his either to be
fair so I guess the fairness is all
around oh my god Jay Steve I said in
that video very specifically so
hopefully you guys saw it that we were
only doing CPU score we were trying to
improve our CPU score enough to make up
for what was obviously going to be him
beating our GPU score but because Steve
went with the the Titans I decided we
our goal here is gonna be to beat his
score using our twenty ATT eyes now
we're doing two different approaches and
this is now quite literally just an x OC
match which stands for extreme
overclocking you know x OC means so now
it's on
okay so here is the setup basically the
same as we have for dry ice - 1600 watt
power supplies are 99 80 X C with our
kingpin cooling pot our latest kingpins
latest design but what I'm doing right
now is I've got a pond pump that's in
here even though it's sitting in an ice
bath you still have to have some sort of
water flow through the fins to have a
better transfer so we've got this guy
here basically this is just like it
looks like a showerhead sure it's only
part of it but from what I've seen so
far we just need water moving through a
portion of it to get the effect that we
need worst case scenario where I can do
like last time is take this off blow the
water across it and then our radiator is
actually sitting on screws or pegs that
are holding it up off the floor so water
can go through so we're almost ready to
do this I've gotta update drivers right
now on the system we saved our profile
from a 5.9 I'm gonna load that profile
but then I'm gonna dial it back some -
like maybe five six five seven work back
up to that five nine and then just go
for it with GPUs without pushing GPU to
the absolute limit I don't want to run
on ln2 before I post a score that's
gonna beat Steve and yeah in fact what's
that score gonna be now all right so his
cpu score is a twelve thousand three
fifty five remember we broke 14,000 his
graphics score was a 16 652 so yeah we
definitely won't catch them in graphics
that's because obviously our twenty
nci's are not gonna go as far as his
ours is a fifteen nine fourteen so we're
not that far behind we're gonna catch up
so much on CPU that Steven's gonna have
no choice but to go to cooling to beat
us which means we're gonna have no
choice but to go Titan someday and
that's why this season 2 is gonna be
fine
so I don't want to waste any of the ln2
that we've got over here because we've
only got ten liters we've got only this
the torch fell over so we've only got
this little guy to get us through this
and normally when people are doing oh
geez
some people are doing over the clocks
and stuff mate they have a lot more in
reserves wait we don't know we're not
think positive if we die and we beat
Steve did we really die stab that with
your knife but not my finger ha told god
dude water flying over here that's a
burst disc just kidding it's capped off
sometimes especially she has to Mexican
food that had spraying back at me like
Peter north and now when I did my
cpu video a lot of people saw me doing
this and we're kind of freaking out
thinking I was capping this off of
making a bomb I wasn't capping it if you
guys watch I never even actually screwed
it on I was getting the condensation off
of it and just setting it on there so we
don't burn off as much of our fluid
trust me I'm trying not to turn it into
a pipe bomb oh oh so let's go ahead and
just run one score this is also only at
5.7 I think I did enough 5.7 or 5.5 let
me see five point seven so this should
theoretically give us a higher score
than we got previously and it should
beat Steve remove this should definitely
be our winning score right here already
but I mean obviously want to see how far
we can go
forts 15 4 5 5 was my previous best 15
649 so we already beat our best and I
think we're like we're still a couple
hundred points behind Steve yeah he's at
15 8 to 6 but that's a 5.7 remember we
got 5.9 to work so we frozen the
bearings on the vrm fan because the
vapors are just going down on it and so
it's freezing like the bearing grease
whatever is in there it's running up 1.5
5 volts or something
go on 15 7 2004 gonna be able to beat
Steve graphics course 1606 8 that's
higher graphics core than I've had
before Wow
I don't know if that's gonna happen six
figures so we're thinking now since I've
wash I missed since I've got to come up
with a hundred extra points just to
match him ID at this point what do I
have to lose so I'm just gonna go for
broke at this point and I'm gonna try
pumping more voltage in it I get one
point five or one point five one five in
the one point five five two point three
five on the VIN holy crap okay fingers
crossed
this is already better than we got on
our last six gigahertz but then again I
took the voltage it just went they might
froze
give me a minute we're doing so good
yeah it wasn't a super hard lock reset
button worked you want something got any
more of them volts come on that's what
I'm usually when we run out of voltage
so I'm dropping the voltage back not the
voltage tube I'm dropping the clock down
I'm bringing the mesh up and we're just
gonna try and get us some more memory
here we have no choice I mean six just
wasn't gonna seem to happen right there
and as soon as I started the CPU test
yeah just powerful we've got the GP or
the power supplies going to two
different circuits in the building when
we experience the shutdowns like this
last time that was when we were dealing
with our VIN was too low I don't want to
add more videos already at 2.4 I have no
idea how high we can go on that safely
so I don't want to end our day super
early because I blew something up so I'm
hoping five nine I can't believe bring
in the CPU score up to where we did was
not enough to get ahead of Steve I
wanted to do it the twenty atti is and I
probably could if I'd like kingpin cards
or something then obviously because
there's less power limit so we could
just push those farther put ln2 on there
and all that sort of stuff but
yeah this is frustrating fun but
frustrating ah GPU crash it's this one
just shutdown 25.9 slightly tighter
timings just a couple of things
nope speed of stable okay we're at minus
105 so just oh okay like like like
Stephen said if the engine falls out at
the end of the drag race but you still
cross the finish line first you win
I hope the engine doesn't fall out hey
how long it sits there okay cool ah ah
 hell doesn't like that timing a
knew it wasn't going too well I'm not
out of ln2 yet okay that's it this is
out now we got one thermos left I slowed
it down this is quite literally our last
attempt I'm not feeling too confident in
this one I mean we beat our previous
score but obviously we should have it's
a better CPU that's clocked way freakin
higher and I'm happy that we beat our
GPU score as well I really thought we'd
be able to carry and beat Steve with 220
ATT I still with L and two on the cpu
GPU started crashing in an area where
they weren't crashing before dialed
everything back to where we were with
our very first test what up guys about
this much here in this thermos that's
the last of my L into this is our last
test and the very least we'll be able to
upload our score and move up the
leaderboard from what number nine or
whatever gay little bit deeper into the
top ten all right well now the tests
aren't loading so I want to see if we
can do a cinnamon run on the CPU a quick
I'm really curious as to where our score
would be not sure it's gonna even pass
to be another thing it's just gonna
crash insta leave it I'm gonna try it
really to get something out of this
video where you gonna get more obviously
this is this is gonna go on for a while
we keep leapfrogging this time he jumped
so far ahead I didn't get a chance to
really leapfrog so the
balls in my court and it's gonna be fun
and interesting I think but let's see if
we can't get through a Cinebench test
with 5.9 just to see what happens I'm
gonna pour what a little bit I still
have in here in there just slam it all
right that's all of it
it's in there keep going cool cool cool
cool cool screw it go one frame all
right well you guys have never heard the
story I told very deep dug down
somewhere in one of the tech talk
archives I talked about a time I was
walking home and he's eating the baby
Ruth had to go to the bathroom really
bad and almost made it home I made it as
far as my neighbor's yard where I then
proceeded to poop myself while wearing
shorts while eating a baby Ruth and my
neighbor was lowly as lon
watching me myself in his front
yard so they just shat myself today find
it's only befitting to enjoy a Baby Ruth
come before you Steve just not today
means back remember the mammaries
mammaries Vince was like cracking sound
could be a thermal place your thermal
brace breaking Phil's nut dear wonder
how a guy as stupid as me can do this Oh
Jay you're doing Ellen - I love her
from my perspective gamers Nexus is evil
nuts from a South Carolina actually is
North Carolina's you've got wind Steve I
have the high ground No
now strike him down complete your
training
let the Allen do floater you're okay
stupid he'll be anything now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
