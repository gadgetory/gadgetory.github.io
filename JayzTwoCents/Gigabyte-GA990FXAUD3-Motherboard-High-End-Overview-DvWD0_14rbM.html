two cents regarding motherboards and
today we're taking a look at the
gigabyte 990 FX 8 UD 3 so stick around
because this motherboards guaranteed to
tickle you where it matters now this
particular motherboard the UD 3 is for
the AMD AM 3 plus socket but if you've
got Intel don't worry because the UD
line is available in Intel sockets as
well the 990 FX does boast a lot of the
features that you would expect from a
high-end motherboard
it does have crossfire and SLI supports
you can run your favorite graphics cards
regardless of the platform AMD or Nvidia
it's also boasting some new technology
here with two times the copper PCB and a
new glass fabric PCB it's designed to be
a little bit more moisture resistant and
a lot stronger the UD 3 does have some
high humidity protection which is
perfect for those of you that live in
wet climates it does feature a dual UEFI
BIOS which is perfect in case you have a
BIOS failure you're not going to break
your motherboard and perhaps most
important of all it does feature all
Japanese solid capacitors so you're not
going to deal with any of that dreaded
coil whine inside the box here you are
going to find your 990 FX au d3 user
manual a multilingual installation guide
book you'll find four solid black sata3
connectors which should be more than
enough to connect all of your
peripherals you've got your rear i/o
plate and you do have an SLI bridge that
comes with the motherboard this is
interesting to me considering its dual
compatible with crossfire but it does
not include a crossfire bridge so you'll
definitely want to keep this in mind if
you're going with AMD graphics cards now
if you're anything like me you probably
are turned off by the blue PCB on other
gigabyte motherboards but don't worry
because they've listened to your cries
and now they've given you this sexy
black and gunmetal coloured motherboard
this thing is just beautiful to look at
especially if you have a window in your
case you're gonna want to show this bad
boy off socket why is this thing as an
am3+ FX compatible socket but it is also
backwards compatible with your Phenom am
3 and your old am 2 m2 plus sockets the
Southbridge on this motherboard is a
passively cooled sb9 50 tips set
providing you with six native SATA 3
ports with superfast gigabits per second
link in raid zero one five
and 10 support I really love the fact
that the SATA ports are labeled right on
the motherboard right next to the SATA
ports there's no question about which
device is plugged in where slot wise
this motherboard does come with 2 PCI
Express 1 X 4 PCI Express 16 X although
only two of them are actually wired to
the Northbridge you do get a standard
PCI slot this is one of the only
high-end AMD motherboards still offer a
PCI slot the UD in the name refers to
the ultra durable heat sinks that are
installed on all of the key components
on the motherboard that generate a lot
of heat the vrm is the North Bridge the
South Bridge they're all very durable
very quality copper heat sinks which
keep your motherboard running nice and
cool for a nice long life the IO side of
your motherboard contains all of the
connections you would expect to find on
a high-end motherboard you've got more
USB ports and you could ever possibly
use you've got two powered SATA
connectors on the back you've got USB
3.0 LAN
fiber-optic you've got your 7.1 analog
surround and a ps2 port taking a close
look at the PCB you can see that new
glass fabric material that it's boasting
on the box it's very smooth it's got a
nice dull finish to it it's not shiny
and it's very very detailed and it's
awesome designs like this that really
make this motherboard stand out in the
crowd one of the most common problems
that new builders have when putting
together their first computer is not
knowing where to plug in all the
different connections
well this motherboard clearly labels it
out there right there for you with all
the USB ports and gigabyte it even takes
it one step further by color-coding all
of the front panel connectors for you so
there's no question about where all
those little wires go and last but not
least you're given four connectors for
your fans your CPU fan a power fan on
the right you've got a system fan down
on the bottom right and you've got a
system fan too on the bottom left and
they're very easily accessible so there
you have it guys that's been the js2
sense review of the gigabyte Ga 990 FX a
ud3 motherboard for your AMD am-3 plus
FX processor don't forget this
motherboard is available in intel
versions so if you're in the market for
a brand new high-end motherboard check
out the UT series from gigabyte we're
guys if you liked what you saw today
there's plenty more in my channel if
you're not subscribed why the hell not
it's just a little button just click it
just click the damn button you'll get to
see all kinds of product reviews you get
to sit some rants every now and then
I'll destroy something kind of like you
see on the video right here I tend to
take my anger out on things sometimes
with the hammer sometimes with my truck
but the bottom line is you need to be
subscribed to J's two cents because you
never know what I'm going to bring you
in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
