it smells like it smells like Domino's
Pizza intensity and us and sweat and
it's great it's a great Musk it's coming
out summer 2015 it's cold
PDX sent by Jerry violently now back to
you Jay audio equipment for PDX land was
provided by Sennheiser check out the
stuff that I was using in the links down
in the description hey sure is that a
fat joke hey what's up guys Jays two
cents here we were at PDX land here in
well Portland and this is actually my
first land of it it is pretty freakin
cool we got over five hundred systems
here most of which are custom and most
of which unfortunately make skunkworks
look like chump works but anyway I
digress so let's go ahead and come on in
at PDX land and let's see what is going
on this year
so if you guys have been watching my
live stream on Twitch here at PDX LAN
you've noticed that my HyperX cloud
choose do not have these stock ear cups
on there and that's because we are here
with edge pro gaming and they make
custom ear cups for pretty much any
headset on the market and if you guys
don't have that particular headset you
probably have something that'll fit
anyway so tell tell us about the
technology and your ear cups and why
would anyone want it yeah you bet
so what we do is we make ear cushions
like you say for just about every
headset out there the materials that we
use are really cutting-edge we've been
making these for over 20 years but the
materials are like conformal foam it's
space-age stuff super comfortable evens
out the pressure really well around your
ears the great thing too is when I was
wearing them they're there so noise
isolation that I I couldn't even hear
Jerry and that was great
you guys have no idea how much I would
pay for that so well but no you guys you
guys did like avionics headsets and
things too right loud engines and so the
pilots have to be able to isolate the
environment so they can hear radio
communications that's correct we've been
working in aviation now for about 25
years and thankfully almost all the
parts that we use for aviation work on
gaming headsets it's what as well so we
didn't have to reinvent the wheel and
you know we have the top cushions made
with sheepskin and leather they're super
comfortable we have the cushions
that's important that's important in
Atlanta they you got to protect the butt
these things are amazing we all sit on
these in our office chairs as well so
they're and I can see this also too if
you've got kids that play like football
t-ball or have taken cinnamon on the
bleachers that's absolutely right
awesome all right guys so you can check
them out over at WWH pro-gaming comm and
you can see what they've got really cool
stuff and I'm telling you they're more
comfortable the base is improved in the
headset it just took everything about
the headset that I loved it enhanced the
sound even more so there you go guys
thanks for talking with us we're go
ahead and get lost here a little bit
more in PDX
ok so if you guys follow barnacles
nerdgasm and all on youtube you know he
has recently sold his soul for a
high-end Puget System now Puget systems
is here they're one of the sponsors here
at PDX land and they've got some stuff
on demonstration including an oculus
rift dk2 on a racing simulator which is
a lot of fun unfortunately makes me sick
and dizzy so just kind of a quick
rundown about what is you're showing
here and who you guys are well Peters
systems is a
local system integrator out of Auburn
Washington just south of Seattle and we
have a some toys to share with everyone
we have a couple of oculus rifts but we
actually brought a couple of our
workstations that we sell here I mean
it's way too much power for the oculus
rift but we just wanted to kind of
showcase what we do it's also way too
much power for what you gave Jerry just
saying he yeah you know he does real
good on minecraft with that and
minesweeper now also too I just want to
give a huge thank you to you guys
because you guys did give me a system to
use while I was here I've been streaming
on that system that small little ITX
build tiny little slim case my god I
think it's powerful for what it is yeah
we really we really like building we
have one right behind us here and we
called her an echo three and we put a
980 in yours for this weekend I know it
was that stock speed and then I
overclocked it so hope you guys don't
mind but I did overclock it a little bit
and no it's holed up great I mean 4790k
in there 16 gigs of ram SSD 500 gig SSDs
980 overclocked you guys even use a
ribbon cable on that to move the GPU so
it's away from the CPU and the board's
you get proper airflow fans that blow
directly on that's a really
well-thought-out so something so Chris
thanks for talking with us today and
we're gonna go ahead and see what else
we got here at PDX
all right so we've wandered over here to
the case labs booth here at PDX and we
have something extremely rare here and
that is somebody taller than me
no guys we're here talking about their
brand new x2 line of cases now we've
talked about this for a while kind of
like off the record and I expected there
to be a next nut sorry next to case I
don't expect there to be three of them
so why do we have three well we kind of
sprung that out one of the things we
wanted to do was to be able you know we
always have products with groups of
families always have you know M a.m. 10
th 10 with Merlin line we have the s m5
s mas c 10 the same thing with SMA 800
SMA a never get that ones to end yes of
course you were billed so with this one
we wanted to originally started out with
the x2 wanted to keep something that was
really small really compact
kind of more focusing on all the one
coolers with that being said we also
didn't want to eliminate water cooling
altogether we also thought would be a
cool idea to have kind of a small server
Nass kind of setup so we went out with
this x2m which is actually just a little
bit wider a little bit deeper right here
we have some hot swap bays but it would
also be really cool
for water cooling as opposed to just
like an all-in-one for the eksu and we
also have the x5 which is just the same
width and depth as the x2 but it fits an
M ATX board in there so we were just
trying to hit all ends on this one
now what I love about these is you guys
said we wanted to build a case that was
much more affordable but it still had to
be all aluminum because that's what you
guys were about now I can tell you right
now that these cases are way more
affordable than something like the SMA a
even when outfitted so we'll talk more
about pricing and stuff when we do the
review but just know that I am gonna be
doing a review of this case as well as
cramming as much high-end hardware as I
can in there with water cooling to put
their their build concept to the test so
we'll be looking at that here in a few
months and we're looking at something
like this right here or where this right
here in white so I'll talk a little bit
more about that but guys the all
aluminum cases here and I really want to
say like what your projected pricing is
I won't but trust me guys it's exciting
so thanks guys for talking with us and
we will definitely be talking in the
future I have to sell my soul a little
bit but it's worth it
so there is a gaming evangelist amongst
us and that being Edie is Crisler
crystal Crisler I was once a Chrysler I
don't know why I like you everybody does
my nickname in the Navy was Mopar
just because nobody would pronounce the
last name right I get it no I just
thought you were really into dodge no
okay so if you guys don't know Edie is
actually one of the reps here for
sapphire but that's kind of takes a
backseat to what he's really here for
and that is for his evangelist attitude
towards gaming as a whole especially PC
gaming Atlanta events like this so tell
me what why you're here and what you're
all about I couldn't ignore that
photobomb well why I'm here obviously is
for sapphire technologies and we are
really really wanting to make a push for
PC gamers it's time to get serious about
PC gaming and let's face it when you're
dealing with cards like the like the 270
280 290 that's what they're meant for is
PC gaming so you mean they're not for
doorstops
no they're not for doorstops and despite
what Logan believes they are not for
coasters so I get to come to these
events we give away some prizes we talk
about PC gaming in general we get to
spread the word that we are what we're
part of the community we're just like
everybody else we love the game we love
to be involved with it and it's our
opportunity to do so it's important to
also mention that sapphire is a sponsor
for this event
yes we're sponsor for this event and for
14 other LAN events this year that I
know of currently now let me tell you
guys why I love edy there's two reasons
I got to meet him in person at CES for
the first time we only conversed through
email before that and I immediately
recognized you were more about the
community necessarily than you were the
brand at first like I mean obviously
you're sapphire but you were like gaming
community is what you're all about and
that's what you're bringing a sapphire I
have a really simple philosophy it
applies in business and applies for this
as well when you're part of something if
the hole does well the individual parts
do well that's and that's what I've said
many times on the stream why everybody
needs to survive in this community the
other thing is he got me playing plants
vs. zombies garden warfare which Paul I
am at propone twitch if you guys don't
know has been playing and streaming and
it looked like fun I just never bothered
downloading it
I've been streaming that more than
battlefield here and I'm a battlefield
player yeah I did this to Richard honey
to
Richard huddie had never played it was a
huge battlefield for player love
battlefield 4 and now every time I see
him online he's playing plants vs.
zombies and now the last reason why I
really really love Ed is the fact that
you guys say I don't do enough AMD
reviews especially of graphics cards
even though I've done every AMD tier of
graphics card there is on the market
edy has graciously sent over three
graphics cards for review the first one
being the r7 260x which is definitely a
more mainstream entry level anyone could
really afford it they say get into
piecing gaming the 285 ITX yes
the only I TX 285 on the market that's
correct and then the 290x try try try x8
gigabyte card that we're really gonna
put that to the test with like Skyrim
with mods and things like that yeah it's
a really neat card it's it's kind of a
niche market card but what we did was is
we had our eight gig vapor-x which
actually was much more successful than I
believed it would be because its niche
market so kind of for the people that
want to do more than gaming they want to
do the direct compute applications that
will use that 8 gig buffer but the price
was a little high
so we got rid of the vapor chamber went
down to a standard heat pipe cooler with
triple fan we're able to reduce the
price and we're gonna be putting that
all to the test trust me on the channel
we're gonna save some surprises for the
channel but if you guys you're watching
this obviously after the effect but I've
been live-streaming with Edie all
weekend playing plants vs. zombies so
you can go watch a replay of that Edie
thank you very much for talking with us
today cannot wait to do those reviews
and we're gonna go play some games now
guys so it's time for you all to leave
so get the hell out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
