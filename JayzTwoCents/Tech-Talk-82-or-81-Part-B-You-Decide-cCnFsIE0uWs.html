a lot of loose skin and stuff and I was
saying that I'm really fortunate that I
really don't have a loose skin problem
then and then Jerry was like well my
wife's vagina you know didn't like blah
blah blah after after a heads and
actually heads in or whatever and I'm
like um the vagina is actually
engineered to you know we tracked and
but you know what I realized just after
saying that statement your wife had a
c-section so I caught it when you said
it I just duh ok well that was a lot of
sense but still even even so I mean like
women they give birth obviously don't
come out the other side like pass and
watermelons every time they go to the
bathroom I'm just saying like there is
some retraction there and the chat wit
silence is clinic 40 that's a on tech
tom we start no no way I'm gonna be the
weirdest starting conversation ever of a
tech talk ever in the waiter wave we've
talked about it before though where we
were like you know if you guys heard the
conversations that took place before the
streams actually started ya like like
Jerry just randomly goes oh my god
there's dry white stuff all over my desk
and he's like flaking it off I'm like
picking it off of my fingernail don't
worry it was Greek yogurt I say that we
just tell it I what it was Greeks yogurt

81 be your choice take whatever you want
all right so you'll see okay so trapped
is wonderfully okay remember last week
we were having isp problems which cut us
short at like 30 minutes so okay no isp
problems because we don't have ego Ariz
why we're calling it technically 81b is
because we're gonna reuse the topics we
never got to last week we're pulling
those right out of the hopper so before
I roll that intro real quick I just want
to say I'm roll the intro and then Jerry
and I've decided that since you know you

the fat when Jerry skinny on the inside
barnacle ease the foul oh so you're
bringing out the Jerry yeah it's like
it's split personality Jerry's the
skinny inner personality and Barnacle
esis now spoken fat personality gotcha
they're gotcha I gotcha so uh nice
figure we eat the start of each show we
just kind of do like a quick update on
how our stuff is going because the
public accountability is what why it
works for us it's true and then we'll
get into the topic so I'm gonna go ahead
and row that intro eventually it's so
weird that I can't hear it but it's
going though and you like guide is
losing weight fattie losing weight look
at them back and Patty's losing weight
that that is a very insensitive term
overweight people losing weight
overweight no cuz i refer
gravitationally challenged
gravitationally challenged I like that I
like that Newton's friend all right so I
mean all right so I've been in a
lifestyle change now for six months I'm
pretty well acclimated how would I'm not
following you Jay I'm not following you
ok I just need to get that clear to
everybody i know everyone everyone seems
yeah how do people think that like
you're trying to like carbon copy what
i'm doing it it's not going to work it's
not know we do completely different
things Jay gets on his little little
bike and butters up his thighs and goes
and rides like a hundred ma chamois
butter I shall I think you can get some
of that dude
seriously ripped the skin I know my
thighs last time I walked up the hill
well my thighs don't rub but I i did use
the chamois butter for other sensitive
parts and sensitive regions mm-hmm I
didn't get some chamois butter you can
just go to a bike store though I try to
talk before and that didn't work out too
well you should use gold bond oh no I
coupon somehow it makes me feel like I'm
like elderly or something if I have to
slather on the gold bond I'm mom doing
her oh no gold mine it go bonds of
powder it's actually an athlete's foot
powder but it burns like crazy if you
put it on like like chafing thighs yeah
I'm gonna pass on that I think I'll just
I'll just stick with the butter maybe a
real butter I can't eat the real butter
but gonna slather inner thighs of it but
but go low fat you gotta go margarine
won't flat look like my dream in english
today but anyways guys my i'm doing a
die everybody's like you need to call it
a lifestyle change fine I'll
given okay it's a lot you know what I
got called out on that when I once said
that I'm not on a diet and if you look
at the actual definition of diet it
simply means a list of foods that people
eat it doesn't mean you're limited to a
specific list of foods it's just
whatever you consume is your diet but to
let you guys know this is the thing is
everybody's like you shouldn't eat like
a rabbit I agree the first week I took
things a little too far I've adjusted
them for this week and I'm still losing
weight like like crazy so what I'm doing
now is I'm eating I'm still eating a lot
of meat lot of protein low carbs I'm
trying to eat more fruit in the morning
and lunch instead of at night and an
item focused on eating protein and the
cool thing is though is when I have a
really bad craving I'm like this
diet I'm gonna jump off the way again
I'm done and I've been there like I
don't know four times out of the last
eight days but whenever I get to that
point I just go take a peach out of the
fridge cut in half sprinkle cinnamon on
it stick it in the oven and take it out
and it's literally the most delicious
thing I've ever eaten like I would pick
it over ice cream I saw that Instagram
film photo you did after my ride today I
was tempted to try it i just got it
delicious dude it's like it's way better
than you'd think it was for some reason
when the peach gets really hot in the
oven and it caramelize 'as a little bit
it changes the taste and the texture of
it so it tastes like you're almost like
eating like an ice cream or something
it's smooth nice so you're on the wagon
still you're gonna have those days where
you're like this but you know what
those are the days those days are going
to happen
you're gonna you're gonna fail yourself
a few times are you but it's going to be
how you respond to that failure that
ultimately leads to your success not
that you had the failure its how you
responded to it well so far I've only
had during my whole diet i've only had
the one cheat meal so so that was good
that cheat meal me up bad like
literally i'll sit on the toilet trying
to like yeah that skin never would have
recovered if anything came out I mean it
was that bad yeah and so now I'm back on
the wagon I've been eating good but the
cravings are starting to go away I still
have them but there they are going away
because now it's like I like bananas I
love those salads uh I started mixing up
like you suggested and doing fish and
meat instead of just me and it's it's
all helped I mean I'm getting there and
I weighed myself today at my lowest i
was to 88.1 but i know i lost a lot of
water weight cuz i was out walking in
the sun today sweating my balls off yeah
so i imagine i'll probably be up around
probably like 291 292 but still that's
down from 308 at my heart if you weigh
fasted in the morning when you first
wake up yeah and then you weigh again
and let's say like six in the evening
you can kind of take the medium of those
two numbers and figure out what your
actual weight would be that's what i
need to do cuz in the morning I'm
everybody's like you'd think you'd be
your lightest in the morning but you're
not not always no I wake up and I take
my weight in the morning I'm like
word that bound come from and then like
eight hours later I take my weight again
I'm like three pounds disappear you want
to hear scale no you want to see
something that messes with your head is
I can I can weigh before I go on or
unlike let's say a 40 mile ride yeah I
can way before that ride and then way
after and it could be upwards of five
pounds difference in an hour I can also
reweighed yes from sweat or just just
from sweat and exertion and then I can
weigh again in two hours and be heavier
than when I started so you the worst
thing you could do is is weigh yourself
constantly keep that in mind but I just
want to give an update on go team j you
guys know at the weight loss competition
at the gym there was one week left final
weigh-in this tuesday the 30th and for
the like last two and a half months I've
been chasing down first place this girl
in first place and weighed in on tuesday
and then they up late updated the
leaderboard i am officially first place
now 15 point oh five percent body weight
loss and she's at 13.5 8 and i still
have another week to go and I've already
dropped two more pounds in the last
three days
it's just a little bit I don't know
she's never there when i'm there we come
at two different times to do our
weigh-ins I bet you she is pissed my
trainer is her trainer he said that she
hasn't come in sense oh she's probably
eating a bucket ice cream now oh it's
all for naught j bv no no it's not over
yet one more week so she could be crash
dieting right now I'm expecting her to
crash diet so I'm putting in some
serious like she's all just doing like
prune juice chasers I know I told you
that's how the asshole beat me in the
weight loss contest back on Microsoft he
literally just sit over in the corner of
a little cubicle chugging his prune
juice all day just going to the
like eight times I'm like dude that
doesn't count as weight loss yeah
anybody did well one last week was
actually eight point two pounds of
actual weight because my water weight
doesn't fluctuate like yours nearly as
much sodium probably in my diet than you
do that's one thing I haven't been
watching as my sodium I have high blood
pressure or anything so like a pocket
inside of it I have very little sodium
but yeah I'm down 62 and a half pounds
62 20 pounds something like that and
what a period of time since I was at
your place God dude that's nuts yeah so
I'm at 247 right now and my goal by
Tuesday is to be at least 2 42 I want to
lose another five this week did me
torment you with pizza pdx LAN like like
get your will always prefer when I was
pretty fresh in my lifestyle like food
changes when I was down there and you
you saw on my face it wasn't eating easy
but you also saw that I stuck with it
yeah it also make you feel like to
FD ate a slice yeah because I had you
know I had my cheat meal I saved it for
when I was down to your place that we
had and she is with you if you
don't eat it all the time Jesus out of
the day I want an entire week without
eating any cheese for the first time you
got to keep in mind i mean i put cheese
on everything cheese on my eggs cheese
on my french fries cheese or cheese on
my cheese cheese on my Cheetos no but uh
it was so bad when i eat i went need a
notch O's with cheese on him and it was
that you know oily cheese yeah oh
dude my guts were just like bro that's
like that's what I used to like feed my
body every day and it was fine about
that I just don't have like a beautiful
poop nap i love how everybody's like a
little tech talk all we're doing is
talking about like poop and losing
weight but you know what though people
people care and that's what they keep
acting so that's why we do these updates
yeah care about people that care
if you don't care yeah son of a bitch
yeah um or other son of a bitch I
haven't had fast food in six months so I
don't know I wouldn't even want to think
about what happens if I did to add a
sausage biscuit my basically almost got
like murdered by everybody online for it
so I have accent I've had nothing but
home-cooked meals ever since I I changed
and I've had a couple of nice
restaurants they eaten out out at like
four fathers day I took the whole family
to a place called paul martens which is
like a steakhouse okay and they had a
father's day brunch and I had like
mushroom egg white omelet you know with
spinach asparagus and fresh fruit so I
like that's not even really like eating
out you know what I mean I know eating
for a purpose instead of eating for
sport is is boring sometimes you have to
get really creative yeah just keep it
interesting though so anyway um yeah
guys we got rid of all the assholes that
left because they don't care about us
now the ones that care about us let's
give them some tech Jay no well spend
the first 10 minutes probably of every
tech talk giving updates because I mean
 I'm surprised like I guess I was on
the front page of reddit because of my
weight loss thing a picture that I put
up and then it's it's still like on that
first page of pc master race sub forum
where I guess a lot of people were like
wow in somebody's into tech and fitness
is really cone your your camera is like
completely autofocusing like crazy is it
really yeah you drink your cup and it
focused on your cup and then it focus on
your mic and then it focused on you this
is what happens when you use a Microsoft
product normally I use a c920 logitech
but no this time I pick up the Microsoft
webcam that thinks it knows focus better
than me cuz Sachin Adele runs it now
everyone keeps telling I'm on the skinny
side how could I be skinny in 247 pounds
I'm cuz you're like 18 feet tall oh yes
I am Groot hey IM JS d sense that
doesn't sound as cool as I thought it
did might I didn't know that was Vin
Diesel I didn't the first time I watched
it and then I was like that has to be
the best casting call ever like imagine
if your vin diesel and you're just
sitting there like dude we're gonna pay
you a million dollars here's your script
route we are Groot done all done drop
the microphone bitch I'm out gets paid
like like $25,000 a word
hey I still didn't get you a link to the
doc like the email I sent it to you in
the chat on on skype I can't take it in
sky because I have being captured right
now and if I do that it uncap sure you
wish you couldn't take it escape all
right where do you want me to send it
where do you only send it Jamie Ellie I
said email it you've got to use email
really Oh what you guys blame Jerry
right now for not be able to panchayat
call me he did not receive it and he did
not that was very unprofessional DJ so
everyone asking about the fury X my
video goes up tomorrow here's my fury X
right here I'm actually this is my key
to its mind icky I'm not gonna give
any details and I'm just saying it's a
piece of I know nothing about it
probably as an Intel processor in it
haha see what I did there yeah Segway so
anyway guys I my video will be up
tomorrow I'm done recording with this
for now I'm going to be doing
professional application to benchmarks
on this to chest test out that 8.6
teraflops but actually in the meantime
it's going to be heading over to paul's
hardware i'm gonna loan it to him
because i'm really interested in his
take on the matter and i think you guys
are too so i'm gonna loan the card to
him so you guys can see what he has to
say about it he's just goes sold on ebay
you know that guy's shifty as he's
gonna give me ten percent okay then
that's okay then he's gonna sell it give
me ten percent fifties your launder
hardware launder all right so we talked
about the eighteen eighteen t slapped
with 100 million fine there they're
appealing it but you started to talk
about Stephen Elop leaving Microsoft
yeah so anyways everybody refers to this
guy is the mole so if you guys don't
know he was the CEO of Nokia during the
acquisition his mobile department by
Microsoft and there's a lot of evidence
and proof out there to show that he
actually had interaction with Microsoft
long before the acquisition and that
there was a huge conflict of interest
and they also i think game wasn't a 25
million you know me poke the doc yet i
was 25 million dollar bonus bonus yeah
bonus yeah it was 25 million dollar
bonus for him getting the microsoft uh
in nokia deal sign so basically at
microsoft acquired nokia so the CEO of
Nokia gets a 25 million dollar bonus
from Microsoft for signing that deal so
that whole thing just wreaked I'm sorry
but any normal person on this planet
could live off the interest on
investments of 25 million dollar
as a one-time fee never have to work
again nor would your family or your kin
yet this guy gets it as a bonus bonus
now what happens in the end are they
like shutting down the division slowly
yes so so well they're not shutting it
down what they're doing is they're
downsizing because they're rolling the
division into windows so Windows is now
going to be the mobile platform the
desktop operating system and the game
console all all in one division so
basically they have three times the
duplication and they're getting rid of
all the duplication but the thing is
they're saying that he's leaving that
Elon's basically leaving with you sue is
Kurt no but here's the funny thing is is
working at Microsoft leaving never means
leaving nobody ever know have you ever
had 25 million dollars exactly there
they're basically asked to leave and
part of them getting their severance
package or whatever is they have to be
nice on their way out sorry oh icic so
so so i think ii was no there's no
kicking screaming stomping exactly i
think you know one of two things happen
these this is all conspiracy theory
folks but I think Elan was either
redundant so they decided just to kick
him to the curb and he was I think one
of the original players to be the CEO
but he got beat out by such an Adele but
anyways I think he's either being pushed
out or he's leaving to go try and head
another company to be a mole again and
try to acquire that company into
Microsoft cuz he's already done it
successfully once so he's actually so
it's like Microsoft denies all existence
of this guy's kind of like the CIA J get
caught you're on your own yeah it's like
it's like here's what we're gonna do
we're gonna just let along go he's gonna
go pursue his career it let's say a
rival company and then he's gonna work
his way up to CEO because he's got
excellent credentials and all this and
then as soon as you become CEO microsoft
gonna be like hey one another 25 million
dollars that microsoft owns the company
it's gonna be like that that's i mean
that's the far i'm working at the name
of this guy that i that i did a video on
last year that was that you know what
was his name God was his name um the guy
who talked about the always on DRM for
Xbox one before it was launched Ali you
know he oh yeah that guy put his foot
his mouth or whatever then he was like
gone yeah but but they say that he had
you know on his own recognizance like
reason
I just kind of what you talk I know I
know a lot of executives of Microsoft
like personally like people that I would
consider my friends they have resigned
their Commission to go either retire do
other things and by resigned it means
the board was like we need you gone so
we're gonna give you like five million
dollars if you just send out an email
saying you love us keep morale like ahh
I'll tell you right now I worked for a
large company back when I was like in my
early 20s and but I didn't have the
greatest workers your early 20s one so I
was weird I was a long time ago so okay
I wasn't the greatest at work ethic and
I mean I was still like living at home
and there's a spider in the corner my
window over there I don't like spiders
it's a black widow that's like a
California now the black widows mostly
stay outside and shed mr. oh that's what
I have my black widow farm is in the
shade so so anyway uh what was I going
this oh yeah okay so keep long story
short I was called into the office one
day where there were several bosses my
direct supervisor their supervisor and
like the general manager of the company
and it was like you know please have a
seat it was like oh I know where this is
going about to get fired and basically
it went like this there were two pieces
of paper slid in front of me one was
your resignation and one was your
termination you pick which one you're
going to sign one gives you dignity and
one doesn't so that's basically the
choice i was given you can either resign
or you can be fired we highly recommend
that you resign that's kind of the way
the conversation went so yeah I think I
was 19 I think it's actually more
beneficial to the company's if you
choose the resignation path because if
they fire you then they have to deal
with all the legalities of you
attempting to get unemployment and all
that stuff and then I'm stepping in and
having it oh that was that that was the
other thing too because i did get fired
I want to say what what I did for a lip
for a living back then let's just say I
drove a big truck and I was told wear
brown pants drew they were purple oh
never mind them oh I see what you did
there so anyway um I was I was basically
told that due to the
negligence of my actions should I pursue
a unemployment that it would be met with
in court with you no evidence showing
reasons why unemployment would not be
beneficial so they had it all like well
thought out let's just put it that way
but yeah that's hardcore well i'm pretty
sure microsoft it goes similar to that
except for the difference is they don't
put both options in front of you so much
is one option as a stack of money on top
of it right there like this is the
resignation path and as you can see it
has a pile of thousand dollar bills on
it that's that's pretty much how it goes
at Microsoft right yeah everyone's
asking how old I am I'm 34 so this was a
long time ago hey so you're 34 we've
gone over this like somebody's you're
younger than I am we've gone over this
under how many times look like 10 years
older than me how could you be younger
than me out of ten years older than you
well you know when you've got rosy
cheeks and they're always shiny hey you
know what I noticed though some of my
gray hair starting to go away a little
bit I'm getting some color back Jay
don't feel bad for you because I've got
like a billion gray hairs in my head
okay sir yep you got enough of them that
are like what it blends with the other
color it just looks like you have like a
sandy awesome hair color for me yes I
got like a French in brave I've kind of
got like the Fantastic Four thing going
on yes you do the doctor well I know if
I could get faster yeah if I could get
fired from Jay's two cents and take a
twenty-five-thousand-dollar bonus hell I
probably do it no so anyways long story
short Elon probably was fired is what
happened but in a way where he gets a
lot of money and he gets to leave and I
would not even be the least bit
surprised if we don't find out six
months down the road that he's the CEO
of another conflict of interest company
that Microsoft micro hard micro hard
sounds like a website for nevermind
anyway so that happened were you guys
see it don't because I want to know if
my conspiracy turns I did midget porn
hmm oh how far into Game of Thrones are
you now ok so now I think I'm almost a
diary in the season for almost oh yeah
we're well they're attacking the wall
don't give it anything for anybody oh

it's gonna happen right that wasn't
really a spoiler huh no I
what we're we're halfway through season

Spock and over and they were all wearing
red shirts and it's like if if the guy

Game of Thrones have sex with girls are
frequently to oh my god that show you
know what is I always refer to Game of
Thrones as HBO porn cuz cuz I mean it
literally is like actually it's more
like a shop for porn but it's more like
Showtime showtimes a little more nor
known for the softcore in my opinion
that's true well I remember growing up
like when I was just the last I stars at
night I used to go over to my
grandparents house just because they had
Cinemax and they were sold that they'd
always go to sleep like it 8 8 p.m.
before anything came on Cinemax so they
had no idea that Cinemax is ran like
softcore porn all night so I just go
over there when I was like 12 years old
and just watch porn to like 2am is
awesome everybody's like why do you like
to go to see your grandma why do you
estate over agreement really nice loaded
like she's nice
lady and she makes good good ass bread
man I it's like back in the day remember
the the cable boxes with the scramblers
yep it was like for the radio shack
parts list to make your own descrambler
yeah it's like trying to look through
the lines and every now and then you
think you saw a boob but it's just a
forehead with a pimple yeah it's like
and then it would straighten out and
never strained out it always be black
and white 2 and you'd be like oh I
saw something it was always clear that's
what I thought was funny as they'd
scramble it like oh yeah here let's
protect your children from it but all
you here's your imagination sometimes
it's better than what's on screen though
that's true if imagine if you're a blind
kid like if you're a blind kid that's
basically watching the porn cam is like
unrestricted access to the porn channel
Alyssa Alyssa made says did Jerry jerk
off at his grandparents you it is
entirely possible that that happened
dozens of times grandma's like
shampooing the carpet there's a Bible
just one why are the sheets always
crunchy Oh God we didn't move on oh like
you weren't a twelve-year-old boy once
come on give us remember 12 you're the
one that already told me I was born a
3xl he didn't have internet back then
okay but we have to get by with the
skinemax back then it was like when you
had 28 baud modem and the image is
slowly coming in and you're like God I
don't want to see your face just keep
going down and it freezes yeah this site
you downloaded porn back in my day a TD
t phone number entered dududududu nanak
ok initialize z modem k bunch of
characters across the screen initialize
transfer wait 24 hours then have like a
naked picture of like you do you
remember like okay so how do you rick
roll someone today you put up you put a
fake title they click it and then all of
a sudden he knows did it didn't you did
you like Jackson for it yeah then it was
that it was a normal female body down to
right where the cleavage would be and
then it's something totally nasty below
that so as images loading and you're
like yeah yeah yeah ah what the hell's
you have to wait another 50 seconds or
whatever for another picture to low dude
I remember the first time that I
experienced graphical internet so just
so you guys know like pre day
everybody takes graphical young the
young generation takes a key porn okay
ascii porn was never something I was
interested in but it did exist and it
was a real thing but the real thing have
you ever been to read it I I've been to
read it but I haven't seen ascii porn
I'm gonna go check that out I've been to
the comment section in YouTube yes have
you been to the comments section of this
live stream mmm yes oh man anyway that's
got way off the rails but anyways uh god
what the hell was I just talking about
no no I'm all looking through the chat
here you're talking about um like non
graphically that's right so so before
the graphical Internet where you had a
web browser you had a terminal program
that was only capable of showing text
and colored characters and that was how
you experience the internet and if you
want to download a picture you would
literally initiate a transfer download
it exit out of your terminal program
open up your image viewing program and
then load the image and that that swatch
want to look at one image now with the
graphical internet I remember was it spy
glass mosaic was the first web browser
ever used I respect it was graphic
before that we all use links which was
the text based linux equivalent uh but
anyways I remember spy glass mosaic over
2400 baud modem and it's like you'd go
to a web page and it would start loading
an image and just like those BBS days
just be like 'hey 'hey i'm that's what
i'm saying when image loads slow as you
know that's what i was referring to the
image is loading and you think you got
something good because the top third of
the image looks normal but then like it
like they they Photoshop the image so at
the bottom it's something completely
nasty you wouldn't want to see like it's
just completely Photoshop minutes to
download it
said oh yeah
or but I can ok ah bitch
I'll belch Quail ranch blue whale branch

all right so you had some other stuff on
here that you want to talk about I do
but I'm wondering how much that you
still want to talk about or if you
wanted to if you want to talk about the
two things I had the two things i wanted
to mention let's talk about your
here well we'll leave these for the last
if we have time let's talk about your
stuff ok one of them you brought up and
i agreed um the intel processor Andy
Andy getting somewhat called out but
then then slowly defending their use of
the evident L i 747 90 k in that tiny pc
they showed at e3 and just to be
absolutely clear everybody called me out
like oh man that's such clickbait AMD
didn't try you know md knew exactly what
they do and they were a hiding anything
i understand that i completely
understand that but still you should
never use your competitor's product you
just unless they're there are some
unless 'as like if they make something
different than what you make but in this
case AMD and intel or direct competitors
at the CP level it be like lamborghini
putting a Ferrari engine in one of their
cars it was a better engine but but as
AMD trying to get in to the system
integration game or what
