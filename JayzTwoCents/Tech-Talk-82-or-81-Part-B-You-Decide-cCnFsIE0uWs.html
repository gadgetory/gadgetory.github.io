vagina is actually engineered to stretch
okay
we're relaxed oh oh we're live we're oh
yeah I probably should get a little
warning oh well that's fine but China
talk number 282 we were we were just
talking about how skin stretches and
retracts when you get fat you get skinny
and we were all wide like vaginas aren't
the same way well Jerry was talking
about that that what is it beats to
beast or what is it Oh Beast the Beast
okay he's my new hero online like I
actually you're not my hero anymore he
is that's fine that's fine I don't want
to be your hero you'll always be my hero
sandwich J no anyway he was talking
about this will beats the beast guy and
how you know he's he looks really really
cut but he's got a lot of loose skin and
stuff and I was saying that I'm really
fortunate that I really don't have a
loose skin problem then and then Jerry
was like well my wife's vagina you know
didn't like blah blah blah after after
our heads and actually heads in or
whatever and I'm like the vagina is
actually engineered to you know retract
and but you know what I realized just
after saying that statement your wife
had a c-section
so I caught it when you said it but
still even so I mean like women they
give birth obviously don't come out the
other side like passing watermelons
every time they go to the bathroom I'm
just saying like there is some
retraction there and the chat wit
silence is 40 I'm gonna be the weirdest
starting conversation ever of a Tech
Talk
ever in the wait wait we've talked about
it before though where we were like you
know if you guys heard the conversations
that took place before the streams
actually started yeah like like Jerry
just family goes oh my god there's dry
white stuff all over my desk and he's
like flaking it off I'm like pick it off
of my fingernail don't worry it was
Greek yogurt
I think that we could tell it was Greek
yogurt
it was Greek show yeah it was great if
you know what I mean hanging out hello
so I'm not going to tweet this out real
quick we are
right right tweet this out too so people
actually come in 1 4 82 or an 81 be your
choice take whatever you want all right
so let's see ok whatever
okay remember last week we were having
ISP problems which cut us short at like
30 minutes so okay no ISP problems
because we don't have III going on today
now the reason why we're calling it
technically 81 B is because we're gonna
reuse the topics we never got to last
week
we're pulling those right out of the
hopper so before I roll that intro real
quick I just want to say I'm roll the
intro and then Jerry and I have decided
that since you know you guys know since
January I've been doing the go team J
thing the weight loss thing a lot of you
a lot of you like it some of you don't
if you don't that's a huge bitch sorry
to - freakin bad but Jerry is on board
now is you're going you're in week 2 now
right uh yeah week 2 of go team barnacle
ease go team is it go team barnacle ease
or go team Jerry let's go go team
barnacle ease ok barnacle ease the fat
when Jerry's skinny on the inside
barnacle ease the foul oh so you're
bringing up the Jerry yeah it's like
it's split personality Jerry's the
skinny inner personality and barnacle
esis now spoken fat personality gotcha
there you gotcha I gotcha so uh no I
just figure we eat the started beat show
we just kind of do like a quick update
on how our stuff is going because the
public accountability is what why it
works for us it's true and then we're
getting into the topic so I'm gonna go
ahead and row that intro eventually it's
so weird that I can't hear it but it's
going though that is a very insensitive
term overweight people losing weight
overweight I refer gravitationally
challenged gravitationally challenged I
like that I like that Newton's friend
alright so I mean all right so I've been
in a lifestyle change now for six months
I'm pretty well acclimated Howard I'm
not following you
J I'm not following you ok I just need
to get that clear to everybody I know
everyone everyone seems like yeah how do
people think that like you're trying to
like carbon copy what I'm doing it's not
going to work it's not no we do
completely different things J gets on
his little little bike and butters up
his thighs and goes and rides like a
hundred Moss chamois butter I shall I
think even get some of that dude I
seriously ripped the skin no my thighs
last time I walked up the hill what my
thighs don't rub but I I do use the
Shambu butter for other sensitive parts
and sensitive regions mmm I didn't get
some chamois butter you can just go to a
bike store though I try to talk before
and that didn't work out too well you
should use Gold Bond
Gold Bond somehow makes me feel like I'm
like elderly or something if I have to
slather on the gold bond I'm doing her
oh no gold bonnet gold wants a powder
it's actually an athlete's foot powder
but it burns like crazy if you put it on
like like chafing thighs yeah I'm gonna
pass on that I think I'll just I'll just
stick with the butter maybe a real
butter I can't eat the real butter but
can i slather my thighs with it but but
go low fat you gotta go margarine won't
flash English today but anyways guys my
I'm doing a diary buddies like you need
to call it a lifestyle change fine I'll
 give it okay it's a lot you know
what I got called out on that when I
once said that I'm not on a diet and if
you look at the actual definition of
diet it simply means a list of foods
that people eat it doesn't mean you
limited to a specific list of foods it's
just whatever you consume is your diet
but to let you guys know this is the
thing is everybody's like you shouldn't
eat like a rabbit I agree the first week
I took things a little too far I've
adjusted them for this week and I'm
still losing weight like like crazy so
what I'm doing now is I'm eating I'm
still eating a lot of meat a lot of
protein low carbs I'm trying to eat more
fruit in the morning and lunch instead
of at night and an item focused on
eating protein and the cool thing is
though is when I have a really bad
craving I'm like this diet I'm
gonna jump off the way again I'm done
and I've been there like I don't know
four times out of the last eight days
but whenever I get to that point I just
go take a peach out of the fridge cut in
half sprinkle cinnamon on it stick it in
the oven and take it out and it's
literally the most delicious thing I've
ever eaten like I would pick it over ice
cream I saw that Instagram foam photo
you did after my ride today I was
tempted to try it I got it so let's just
dude it's like it's way better than
you'd think it was for some reason when
the peach gets really hot in the oven
and it caramelize --is a little bit it
changes the taste and the texture of it
so it tastes like you're almost like
eating like an ice-cream or something
it's smooth nice so you're on the wagon
still you're gonna have those days where
you're like this but you know what
those are the days those days are going
to happen
you're gonna you're gonna fail yourself
a few times alright yeah but it's gonna
be how you respond to that failure that
ultimately leads to your success not
that you had the failure it's how you
responded to it well so far I've only
had during my whole diet I've only had
the one cheat meal so so that was good
now in that cheat meal me up bad
like literally I was sitting on the
toilet trying to like yeah that skin
never would have recovered if anything
came out I mean it was that bad
yeah and so now I'm back on the way
again I've been eating good but the
cravings are starting to go away I still
have them but they're they are going
away because now it's like I like
bananas I love those salads I started
mixing up like you suggested and doing
fish and meat instead of just me and
it's it's all health I mean I'm getting
there and I weighed myself today at my
lowest I was to 88.1 but I know I lost a
lot of water weight cuz I was out
walking in the Sun today sweating my
balls off yeah so I imagine I'll
probably be up around probably like 291
292 but still that's down from 308 at my
if you weigh fast it in the morning when
you first wake up yeah and then you
weigh again and let's say like 6:00 in
the evening you can kind of take the
medium of those two numbers and figure
out what your actual weight would be
that's what I need to do cuz in the
morning I'm everybody's like you'd think
you'd be your lightest in the morning
but you're not not always no I wake up
and I take my weight in the morning I'm
like weird that pound come from and
then like eight hours later I take my
weight again and I'm like three pounds
disappear no you want to hear scale no
you want to see something that messes
with your head is I can I can weigh
before I go on like let's say a forty
mile ride yeah I can way before that
ride and then way after and it could be
upwards of five pounds difference in an
hour
I can also reweighing yes from sweat or
just just from sweat and exertion and
then I can weigh again in two hours and
be heavier than when I started
so you the worst thing you could do is
weigh yourself constantly keep that in
mind but I just want to give an update
on go team J you guys know at the weight
loss competition at the gym there was
one week left final weigh-in is Tuesday
the 30th and for the like last two and a
half months I've been chasing down first
place is this this girl in first place
and weighed in on Tuesday and then they
uh played updated the leaderboard I am
officially first place now fifteen point
oh five percent body weight loss and
she's at thirteen point five eight and I
still have another week to go and I've
already dropped two more pounds in
three days that's right a little bit I
don't know she's never there when I'm
there we come at two different times to
do our weigh-ins I bet you she is past
my trainer is her trainer he said that
she hasn't come in sense oh she's
probably eating a bucket ice cream now
oh it's all for naught jbv no no it's
not over yet one more week so she could
be crash dieting right now I'm expecting
her to crash diet so I'm putting in some
serious like she's all just doing like
prune juice chasers I know I know that's
how the asshole beat me in the weight
loss contest back at Microsoft he
literally just sit over in the corner of
a little cubicle chugging his prune
juice all day just going to the
like eight times I'm like dude that
doesn't count as weight loss yeah
everybody did well one last week was
actually eight point two pounds of
actual weight because my water weight
doesn't fluctuate like yours nearly as
much sodium probably in my diet than you
do that's one thing I haven't been
watching as my sodium high blood
pressure or anything so I was like ah
 it inside of it I have very little
sodium but yeah I'm down 62 and a half
pounds sixty two point eight pounds
something like that and what a period of
time since I was at your place God dude
that's nuts
yeah so I'm at 2:47 right now and my
goal by Tuesday at least to 42 I want to
lose another 5 this week did me torment
you with pizza at PDX land like like get
your will he's put up for when I was
pretty fresh in my lifestyle like food
changes when I was down there and you
you saw on my face it wasn't eating easy
but you also saw that I stuck with it
yeah it also made you feel like too
after you ate a slice yeah because I had
you know I had my cheat meal I saved it
for when I was down to your place that
we had and she is with you if you
don't eat it all the time cheese's out
of the day I want an entire week without
eating any cheese for the first time you
got to keep in mind I mean I put cheese
on everything cheese on my eggs cheese
on my french fries cheese or cheese on
my cheese cheese on my Cheetos no but it
was so bad when I eat I went made nachos
with cheese on them and it was that you
know oily cheese yeah oh dude my
guts were just like bro oh that's like
that's what I used to like feed my body
every day and it was fine about that I
just don't have like a beautiful poop
now I love how everybody's like a little
Tech Talk all we're doing is talking
about like pooping and losing weight but
you know what though people people care
and that's what they keep activists so
that's why we do these updates yeah care
about people
we care if you don't care yeah you're a
son of a bitch yeah or the other son of
a bitch I haven't had fast-food in six
months so I don't even I wouldn't even
want to think about what happens if I
did to biscuit and I basically almost
got like murdered by everybody on line
for it so I've accent I've had nothing
but home-cooked meals ever since I
changed and I've had a couple of nice
restaurants they'd eaten out out at like
for Father's Day I took the whole family
to a place called Paul Martin's which is
like a steak house okay and they had a
Father's Day brunch and I had like
mushroom egg white omelet you know with
spinach asparagus and fresh fruit so I
like that's not even really like eating
out you know what I mean I know eating
for a purpose instead of eating for
sport is boring sometimes you have to
get really creative yeah just keep it
interesting though so anyway yeah guys
we got rid of all the assholes that left
cuz they don't care about us now the
ones that care about us let's give them
some tech Jay no we'll spend the first
10 minutes probably of every Tech Talk
giving updates because I mean I'm
surprised like I guess I was on the
front page of Reddit because of my
weight loss thing a picture that I put
up and then it's it's still like on that
first page of PC master-race sub-form
where I guess a lot of people were like
wow in somebody who's into tech and
fitness is really cool your your camera
is like completely autofocusing like
crazy is it really yeah you drink your
cup and it focused on your cup and then
it focus on your mic and then it focused
on you this is what happens when you use
a Microsoft product normally I use a
c920 logitech but no this time I pick up
the Microsoft web cam that thinks it
knows focus better than me cuz Sachin
Adel runs it now everyone keeps telling
me I'm on this side how could I be
skinny in 247 pounds I'm cuz you're like
18 feet tall oh yes I am Groot I am Jays
do you sense that doesn't sound as cool
as I thought it did I didn't know that
was been diesel I didn't the first time
I watched it and then I was like that
has to be the best casting call ever
like imagine if you're Vin Diesel and
you're just sitting there like dude
we're gonna pay you a million dollars
here's your script Groot we are good
done all done drop the microphone bitch
I'm out gets paid like like $25,000
word hey I still didn't get you a link
to the doc like the email I sent it to
you in the chat on on skype I can't take
it in Skype because I have being
captured right now and if I do that it
on capture you wish you couldn't take it
in Skype
where do you want to send it where do
you all my Senate Jamie mail it I said
email it you've got to use email really
Oh guys blame Jerry right now for not be
able movement I am yeah he did not
receive it and he did not that was very
unprofessional DJ so everyone asked
about the fury X my video goes up
tomorrow here's my fury X right here I'm
actually this is my piece of it's
mine to keep I'm not gonna give any
details and I'm just saying it's a piece
of I know nothing about it probably
as an Intel processor in it haha see
what I did there
yeah segue so anyway guys my video will
be up tomorrow I'm done recording with
this for now I'm gonna be doing
professional application to benchmarks
on this to chest test out that 8.6
teraflops but actually in the meantime
it's gonna be heading over to Paul's
hardware I'm gonna loan it to him cuz
I'm really interested in his take on the
matter and I think you guys are too so
I'm gonna loan the card to him so you
guys can see what he has to say about it
just go sold on ebay you know that guy's
shifty is he's gonna give me 10%
okay that's okay then he's gonna sell it
give me 10%
he's your launder hardware launder
alright so we talked about the 1818 tea
slapped with 100 million fine there
they're appealing it but you started to
talk about Stephen Elop leaving
Microsoft's yeah so anyways everybody
refers to this guy is the mole so if you
guys don't know he was the CEO of Nokia
during the acquisition that I've known
his mobile Department by Microsoft and
there's a lot of evidence and proof out
there to show that he actually had
interaction with Microsoft long before
the acquisition and that there was a
huge conflict of interest and they also
I think gave him was at a 25 million
leap off the docket
I think it was 25 million dollar bonus
bonus yeah bonus yeah it was 25 million
dollar bonus for him getting the
Microsoft in Nokia deal sign so
basically at Microsoft acquired Nokia so
the CEO of Nokia gets a 25 million
dollar bonus from Microsoft for signing
that deal so that whole thing just
wreaked I'm sorry but any normal person
on this planet could live off the
interest on investments of 25 million
dollars as a one-time feed never have to
work again nor would your family or your
kin yet this guy gets it as a bonus
that's a white bonus now what happens in
the end are they like shutting down the
division slowly yes so so well they're
not shutting it down what they're doing
is they're downsizing because they're
rolling the division into Windows so
Windows is now gonna be the mobile
platform the desktop operating system
and the game console all all in one
division so basically they have three
times the duplication and they're
getting rid of all the duplication but
the thing is they're saying that he's
leaving that the Ilan's basically
leaving wouldn't you sue as Kurt no but
here's the funny thing is working at
Microsoft leaving never means leaving
nobody ever no have you ever had 25
million dollars exactly they're
basically asked to leave and part of
them getting their severance package or
whatever is they have to be nice on
their way out sorry Oh
so I think he was note there's no
kicking screaming stomping exactly I
think he want one of two things happen
these this is all conspiracy theory
folks but I think Ilan was either
redundant so they decided just to kick
him to the curb and he was I think one
of the original players to be the CEO
but he got beat out by such an Adele but
anyways I think he's either being pushed
out or he's leaving to go try and head
another company to be a mole again and
try to acquire that company into
Microsoft because he's already done it
successfully once so he's actually so
it's like Microsoft denies all existence
of this guy's kinda like the CIA Jay get
caught you're on your own yeah it's like
it's like here's what we're gonna do
we're gonna just let Ilan go he's gonna
go pursue his career it let's say a
rival company and then he's gonna work
his way up to CEO because he's got
excellent credentials and all this and
then as soon as he becomes CEO
Microsoft's gonna be like hey want
another twenty five million dollars then
Microsoft owns the company
like that that's I mean that's the far
I'm working up the name of this guy that
I that I did a video on last year that
was that you know what was his name his
name the guy who talked about the
always-on DRM for Xbox one before it was
launched how he you know he oh yeah that
guy put his mouth or whatever then he
was like gone yeah but but they say that
he had you know on his own recognizance
like resign
I just kind of what you talk I know I
know a lot of executives of Microsoft
like personally like people that I would
consider my friends they have resigned
their commission to go either retire do
other things and by resigned it means
the board was like we need you gone so
we're gonna give you like 5 million
dollars if you just send out an email
saying you love us keep morale like ha
I'll tell ya now I worked for a large
company back when I was like in my early
20s in bet I didn't have the greatest
workers your early 20s once well I was
weird I was a long time ago so ok I
wasn't the greatest at work ethic and I
mean I was still like living at home and
there's a spider in the corner of my
window over there I don't like spiders
there's a black widow that's like a
California no the black widows mostly
stay outside in the shed that's what I
have my black widow farm is in the shape
so so anyway um what was I going this oh
yeah
ok so keep long story short I was called
into the office one day where there were
several bosses my direct supervisor
their supervisor and like the general
manager of the company and it was like
you know please have a seat it was like
oh I know where this is going I'm about
to get fired and and basically it went
like this there were two pieces of
papers slid in front of me one was your
resignation and one was your termination
do you pick which one you're gonna sign
one gives you dignity and one doesn't so
that's basically the choice I was given
you can either resign or you can be
fired we highly recommend that you
resign that's kind of the way the
conversation went so yeah I think I was
19 I think it's actually more beneficial
to the companies if you choose the
resignation path because if they fire
you then they have to deal with all the
legalities of you attempting to get
unemployment and all that stuff and then
them stepping in and having it oh that
was that that was the other thing too
because I did get fired I want to say
what what I did for a lip for a living
back then let's just say I drove a big
truck and I was told wear brown pants
drew they were purple oh never mind then
oh I see what you did there so anyway I
was I was basically told that due to the
negligence of my actions should I pursue
unemployment that it would be met with
in court with you know evidence showing
reasons why unemployment would not be
beneficial so they had it all like well
thought out let's just put it that way
but yeah that's hardcore well I'm pretty
sure Microsoft ago similar to that
except for the difference is they don't
put both options in front of you so much
is one option as a stack of money on top
of it right you're like this is the
resignation path and as you can see it
has a pile of thousand dollar bills on
it that's that's pretty much how it goes
with Microsoft right yeah everyone's
asking how old I am I'm 34 so this was a
long time ago least a year 34 we've gone
over this like somebody you're younger
than I am
we've gone over this I don't know how
many times look like 10 years older than
me how could you be younger than me 10
years older than you well you know when
you've got rosy cheeks and they're
always shiny hey you know what I noticed
though some of my gray hair starting to
go away a little bit I'm getting some
color back Jay I don't feel bad for you
cuz I've got like a billion gray hairs
in my head okay sir yep you got enough
of them that are like what it blends
with the other color it just looks like
you have like this sandy awesome hair
color for me yes I got like a phantom
brave I've kind of got like the
Fantastic Four thing going on yes you do
the doctor well I don't know if I could
get fired
yeah if I could get fired from Jays two
cents and take a twenty five thousand
dollar bonus hell I'd probably do it
anyways long story short Elon probably
was fired is what happened but in a way
where he gets a lot of money and he gets
to leave and I would not even be the
least bit surprised if we don't find out
six months down the road that he's the
CEO of another conflict-of-interest
company that Microsoft might go hard
micro hard it sounds like a website for
it nevermind anyways yeah poor you guys
see it because I want to know if my
conspiracy turns I did midget porn oh
how far into Game of Thrones are you now
okay so now I think I'm almost a diary
into season four almost oh yeah well
they're attacking the wall don't give
anything for anybody oh did I just
well they know eventually it's gonna
happen right that wasn't really a
spoiler huh no I
what we're we're halfway through season
five we're about to finish it off so I'm
sad I don't wanna have to wait a year
for everyone else to what I heard that
John Hsu I went all right though heard
he's he's perfectly healthy and nothing
nothing happened to him everybody's
perfectly healthy in that show no one
dies know it if you need a lazy did you
see the mean what is it is it who's the
writer on you know what the only Gregory
are are something like that or George RR
something anyways I saw a meme that had
a picture of Star Trek it was everybody
on Star Trek that meant any anything
like Captain Kirk and Spock and over and
they were all wearing red shirts and
it's like if if the guy if the guy who
wrote Game of Thrones Star Trek yeah cuz
the guy the red should always be buddy
in Game of Thrones like nobody's safe it
was like it was like in Space Quest I
don't have a last name you're gonna die
no you know nobody gets mutilated but I
have decided I need my very own reek
you need a reek I did a reek of my own I
could get so much done if I had to reek
and no but did take him they're lopping
off their twigs and berries that's how
you keep them loyal and so you keep them
it seemed to work pretty well
you almost got his freakin sister killed
oh my god spoilers spoilers spoilers
this whole show spoilers hi every great
bringing it up I remember I by the way
I've covered up the chat but I heard
that guy in Game of Thrones has sex with
someone's boiler
Oh RR martin okay I've also heard that
the girls in Game of Thrones have sex
with girls are frequently - oh my god
that show you know what is I always
refer to Game of Thrones as HBO porn cuz
cuz I mean it literally is like actually
it's more like a shop or porn but it's
more like show time show times a little
more known from known for the softcore
in my opinion that's true well I
remember growing up like when I was just
the last at night I used to go over to
my grandparents house just because they
had Cinemax and they were sold that
they'd always go to sleep like it 8:00
8:00 p.m. before anything came on
Cinemax so they had no idea that Cinemax
just ran like softcore porn all night so
I just go over there when I was like 12
years old and just watch porn till like
2:00 a.m. is awesome everybody's like
why do you like to go to see your
grandma why do you stayed over grandma
is a nice lady nice
lady and she makes good good ass bread
man aye it's like back in the day
remember the the cable boxes with the
scramblers yep it was like the
RadioShack parts list to make your own
descrambler yeah it's like trying to
look through the lines and every now and
then you think you saw a boob but it's
just the forehead with a pimple yeah and
then it would straighten out never
straightened out it always be black and
white - I saw something it was always
clear that's what I thought was funny as
they'd scramble it like oh yeah here
let's protect your children from it but
all yours your imagination sometimes is
better than what's on screen though
that's true if you imagine if you're a
blind kid like if you're a blind kid
that's basically watching the porn
channel is unrestricted access to the
porn channel élisa élisa made says did
jerry jerk off at his grandparents yeah
it is entirely possible that that
happened dozens of times grandma's like
shampooing the carpet the sheets always
crunchy okay we didn't move on oh like
you weren't a 12 year old boy once come
on give us remember 12 you're the one
that already told me I was born a 3xl he
didn't have internet back then okay but
we have to get by with the skinemax back
then it was like when you had 28 baud
modem and the image is slowly coming in
and you're like God I don't want to see
your face just keep going down and they
like freezes yeah this site you
downloaded porn back in my day a TDT
phone number entered nanana okay
initialize Z modem okay bunch of
characters across the screen initialize
transfer wait 24 hours and then have
like a naked picture of life do you
remember like okay so how do you
rickroll someone today you you put a you
put a fake title they click it and then
all of a sudden you nose did you did you
did you like Zac then yeah then it was
that it was a normal female body down to
right where the cleavage would be and
then it's something totally nasty below
that so as images loading in you're like
yeah yeah yeah oh what the hell's II
have to wait another 50 seconds or
whatever for another picture to load I
remember the first time that I
experienced graphical internet so just
so you guys know like 3d
everybody takes graphically the young
generation exactly porn okay ASCII porn
was never something I was interested in
but it did exist and it was a real thing
fulfill a real thing have you ever been
to read it I've been to read it but I
haven't seen a ski for and I'm gonna
have to go check that out and you been
to the comment section in YouTube yes
have you been to the comments section of
this livestream yes anyway that's got
way off the rails but but anyways god
what the hell was I just talking about
no no I'm all looking through the chat
here you're talking about like
non-graphical that's right so so before
the graphical internet where you had a
web browser
you had a terminal program that was only
capable of showing text and colored
characters and that was how you
experience the Internet and if you want
to download a picture you would
literally initiate a transfer downloaded
exit out of your terminal program open
up your image viewing program and then
load the image and that that's watch one
to look at one image now with the
graphical internet I remember was it
spyglass mosaic was the first web
browser ever used I respect it was
graphic before that we all used links
which was the text-based Linux
equivalent but anyways I remember
spyglass mosaic over 2400 baud modem and
it's like you'd go to a web page and it
would start loading an image and just
like those BBS days just be like 8e I'm
that's what I'm saying though when the
image loads as long as you know that's
what I was referring to the image is
loading and you think you got something
good because the top third of the image
looks normal but then it like they they
Photoshop the image so at the bottom
it's something completely nasty you
wouldn't want to see like it's just
completely Photoshop minutes to download
it
said
well that I can bitch
brown brown blam-blam-blam-blam well I
say we do a live stream of nothing but
your mouth music just start up to be a
couch all right here let me uh let me
give you some Vidya some Vidya there's
some vid yeah there we go
all eight pixels came in came clear came
in very nice and clear vid yeah there we
go
we got the vid yeah refreshing the
stream all right and we're back right
hurry back uh should be right back it
shows it's online for me is it working
to say online alright what's going on
guys all right so you had some other
stuff on here that you wanted to talk
about I do but I'm wondering how much of
that you still want to talk about or if
you wanted to if you want to talk about
the two things I had the two things I
wanted to mention let's talk about your
 here well we'll leave these for the
last if we have time let's talk about
your stuff okay one of them you brought
up and I agreed and be getting some what
called out but then then slowly
defending their use of the of an Intel
i7 4790k
in that tiny PC they showed at e3 and
just to be absolutely clear everybody
called me out like oh man that's such
clickbait AMD didn't try you know AMD
knew exactly what they were doing they
were a hiding anything I understand that
I completely understand that but still
you should never use your competitors
product you just it unless there are
some unlesss like if they make something
different than what you make but in this
case AMD and Intel are direct
competitors at the CPU level it'd be
like Lamborghini putting a Ferrari
engine in one of their cars you know it
was a better engine but but as AMD
trying to get in to the systems
integration
game or what
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
