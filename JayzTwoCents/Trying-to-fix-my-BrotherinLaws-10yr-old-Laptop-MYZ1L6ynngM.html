this is a dell inspiron it has seen some
better days it's got a broken hinge heck
even the chassis is cracked but that's
okay this has been around the world a
couple of times it's even been on an
Afghanistan military deployment
so yeah that's Afghan dirt that you're
seeing probably but you've heard me talk
about this before this is from my
brother who is a retired military
veteran and I got basically it handed to
me and was like hey it doesn't work
anymore but we've got really important
pictures we'd like to get off of here so
can you please save those and I was like
yes I can save those in fact I'm gonna
try and do you one better I'm gonna try
and save the machine it's not really
worth saving but hey they can let there
they can let their five-year-old pound
away on the keyboard or something MSI
brings ultra-thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz 1080p
panel nvidia graphics and 8th gen intel
cpus make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more and how to preorder by
following the link in the description
below first and foremost we have to
understand what the problems are now
this is an old T 4400 base Pentium dual
core loosely based upon the Core 2 Duo
architecture but here's what we're
dealing with right here it works in a
typical fashion you know when when
somebody who's not you know really
versed in computers hands you compare
with a problem you go what's wrong with
it they go it's just not working and
you're like well what doesn't work and
they go well it doesn't start now that
could mean maybe the picture isn't
coming up maybe the computer isn't power
on in our case it will sit right here
loading for the longest time and then
what happens is it basically tells us
that we have a corrupt boot sector
basically it just actually gives you a
boot error and like an error code and
the whole deal what I love though is the
built-in Diagnostics and let me show you
this part because I feel like I'm
playing an old like a dork turn-based
video game that's all text-based
that sounds like I'm playing an
old-school game man if we go all the way
back to like there yeah who remembers
who remembers when this was the sound
effects you got in games so what this is
basically telling me is that it actually
detected an error the last time the last
time I tried to boot self test self test
log contains previous errors that give
an error code a message can be can be
used by Dell technical support to help
diagnose a problem all right we just
want to continue yes we're gonna get to
now it's testing the optical drive this
has an optical drive and a PCMCIA slot
and it was a pretty massive slot back
there it is right there but yeah this
whole giant car that was about that long
would slide into that and sock it in and
that was actually how you had hot
swappable devices in a laptop what's
funny about that now is cuz everything's
just done through either a Thunderbolt
USB 3 type C whatever
oh look VGA test where color bars
displayed look at that look at that font
so we going to board this but I just
thought that was an interesting little
piece of information to show you that
this had actually a built-in diagnostic
and it did catch the error the error I
caught was actually just previously
logged error saying Windows wouldn't
boot now this was updated to Windows 10
thank god he actually participated in
the free windows upgrade because had
this been an old Windows Vista machine
or god forbid a Windows ME which I
highly doubt I think this was initially
an XP machine I think I could be wrong I
don't have boot drives or boot disks for
any of those operating systems sure I
could easily go online and get it but
because this is Windows 10 we might
actually have a chance of recovering it
through my Windows 10
disk right here so we're gonna try this
first see this is why I say look it's on
Windows 10 here's the problem it'll sit
here I'm preparing automatic repair
forever
it does not move from this point a
couple of things this could mean one it
could just be a corrupted
they're of the hard drive that destroyed
the bootloader or it could be a bad hard
drive all together I don't know
so yeah we just need to make sure
Windows doesn't automatically wipe
itself which it can do wah wah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah is it going to
boot up this we don't want setup though
we won't repair because if I do setup
that's gonna that's gonna screw us cuz
it will wipe the drive so Windows setup
64-bit and we're gonna tell it to repair
if it can't repair then it'll do that
we'll do it the easy way take the drive
out offload the pictures and then go
from there so we've been sitting here
for a while and it's just not actually
loading I'm you got a cursor it's not
actually loading a menu so here's what
we're going to do we're gonna go ahead
and play it safe and we are going to
shut this down we're gonna open it up
take the hard drive out use one of my
hot swap sleds from my Atomos which is
just a SATA 2 nap inch drive thing and
then we are going to recover the data
make sure that's nice and safe and then
we'll see if we can get this working
again but that is a secondary mission
objective primary mission objective is
to save the pictures otherwise then
you're dealing with an upset sister
who's known to get emotional at simple
things imagine losing priceless
irreplaceable photos
literally at the end of all this I'm
like what's this
it wasn't that's the thing it's like ah
now this is the atomos Drive sled for
two and a half inch SATA drives it's not
meant for computers like the sense we're
about to use it but it's nothing more
than a hot swap drive that has a sled
that's designed to go into the Atomos
but this will work with any drive and as
you can see it has the slot cuts and
slots and all you need there's nothing
to actually mount this down so you don't
want to lift it up and break it if
you've never broken one these tabs these
are extremely brittle plastic so you
just slide it in like so and then it
terminates to a USB 3.0 and this one
right here is actually for supplemental
power so you have the USB 3.0 and a
little bit extra power going through
there so we are gonna plug this in right
now navigate the extremely unnerving
contents of my sister-in-law's hard
drive and with these two computers side
by side in contrast it's kind of insane
given how far we've come in the last
nine years in laptop technology so it's
actually a partition on this drive right
here so we're seeing local disk v and
local disk F it's indexing it right now
but so far we're not getting any sort of
capacity to show up and that worries me
a little bit because if this drive is
completely corrupted I don't have the
tools necessary to extract the contents
from it now there are companies and
sources out there that you could send a
hard drive to and they can recover lost
data even from bad sectors I personally
don't have the ability to do that so if
it ends up going that route today
unfortunately I won't be able to show
the results of that so the recovery
partition showed up but the local disk f
is still not and what's interesting is
the recovery is half full but what we
notice right now is we're sitting here
waiting and waiting and waiting but the
drive is not actually turning oh wait
yes it is something is not right with
this drive which we kind of already
expected right so we're looking at the
performance graph for the drive and you
can see it goes up to a hundred percent
usage here where I say actually it's
active time this drive has probably been
completely
just it could have been shocked really
bad I mean there's all kinds of things
that could have happened with this but
you see here read speed write speed it's
just completely sitting here doing
nothing with active time so I'm thinking
this drive might unfortunately be
unrecoverable by me anyway
I feel bad though because I'm trying I
want to get these photos off of here but
I can't make I'm Eli kind of like a
little glimpse of life for a split
second there and then stopped
that might be why Windows continues to
fail to boot because we saw update
repair trying write an update repair
automatically happens if it sees what
two or three failed boots automatically
which means this drive could just been
shutting down in the middle of the boot
process I'm gonna make the call I'm
gonna make the call to the sis well
unfortunately guys this is a fail video
they happen every now and then I love
those videos that have the happy ending
where everything worked but it's not a
total loss because I took the 7200 rpm
one terabyte drive which is a bit of an
upgrade from her 250 50 gig 450 550 5400
rpm G's numbers hard talking and I went
ahead and put that inside of her system
and we are now installing Windows 10
which means now at least this will still
work hardware wise there's no problem
with this so at least there's a silver
lining because we were able to get a
working computer for her once again but
I guess this is a lesson in keeping
backups of things that really really
matter to you well we need to back up
our design elements folder on my
computer that has like everything we use
anyway guys we're gonna go I wish this
had a happy ending unfortunately now my
sister gets to experience with data
recovery is like when you send it off to
a specialist so yeah no idea what that's
gonna cost her but she's not too happy
lesson learned in backing up your
important data so hopefully next time we
can have a happy ending not that kind of
happy Anna you know what I mean you know
and we didn't pay for the happy ending
this time around I should have but don't
forget those speaking of happy endings
we are also doing a huge giveaway right
now where I'm giving away a CPU a
motherboard memory graphics card cooler
all kinds of stuff to give you a huge
upgrade to your existing system or to
kick your next build off on the right
foot check the link in description below
if you guys want know more about that
and as always we will see you guys in
the next one
Dover check the link in the description
below if you guys don't know about more
about the bed load up so I just talked
to my sis and Mac hey let's drop the
process that's this one
yeah play out the keyboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
