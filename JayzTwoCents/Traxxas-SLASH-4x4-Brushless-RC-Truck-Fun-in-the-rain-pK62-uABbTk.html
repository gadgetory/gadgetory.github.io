things a little differently today we're
gonna review a piece here from Traxxas
that was actually sent over by my
friends over at mass drop because they
just launched their new Arcee page where
they're doing group by discount pricing
on our see stuff and they've also got a
Corvette page to can they have done like
maybe something JDM or whatever anyway
we're gonna take a look today at the
slash 4x4 and since it's raining outside
so poorly I figure we can also give a
little bit of test to their claim of
being waterproof so I guess go ahead and
check that out
that'll be fun right okay so obviously
this isn't my set I am at my buddy Rob's
house I'm gonna give a huge thanks to
him because you know we all have that
friend that knows something more than
you about a certain subject and he's
like my RC guru friend and not to
mention he's also got more space over
there we can get in the dirt so I want
to get a thanks to him for letting me
use his garage here but when it comes to
the specs here this is a brushless motor
it's got their VX l3 waterproof
electronic speed control which is one of
the reasons why we're checking that
today it's got a seven cell nickel metal
hydride battery which I think is kind of
disappointment number one I think with
how cheap lipo is getting I would have
liked to have seen tracks to send this
with lipo straight out of the box as
with all things RC one of the easiest
ways to get more power out of your RC is
either through gearing or through more
cells but this is a seven cell 8.4 volt
so it should have some pretty good
get-up-and-go it does have their what
they call their ID technology so it's
basically a smart battery it's going to
communicate well with the receiver or
the transmitter as well as an app that
you can download from Trax's if you guys
can see my breath it's actually cold
here in California where it's like 48
degrees right now we're not used to the
shit but you can download the app and
you can see some telemetry when it comes
to your car your remaining voltage speed
I mean all sorts of stuff is that's one
of the reasons why we're doing this
video today is the fact that you can buy
the optional module and see a lot about
what's going on with the car that's
something new but anyway it does also
feature a 2.4 gigahertz radio which is
pretty much standard these days but it
is a ready to run out of the box which
is kind of nice because you can get
yourself a kit but then you've got to
add your own radio your own electronics
and then you're left trying to figure
all that stuff out but this thing does
come out of the box ready to run now
this is also the
or Mike Jenkins edition can I wish a go
with Leroy Jenkins but whatever I'm
assuming that's gonna be what the
library is based on here but if we go
ahead and take off the four pins for the
body you'll see one of the reasons why I
like electric cars I used to do nitro
but nitro was a bigger pain in the ass
to deal with and I know that's gonna
piss some people off if you like nitro
great
I had a rivo that was fully built I just
didn't like having to clean it out it's
as you can see there's not a whole lot
going in here and if we compare this
here to the original slash which you got
here and you can see this has paddles on
it you can tell he likes to go to the
sand everything appears to be pretty
much the same so I think the only thing
that's really going to be different here
is looks like the ESC is a little
different if you zoom in on that ESC you
can see the new one there's got some
capacitors there same basic design for
the heatsink the power buttons in the
same spot that seems to be the only
visible visible difference is the
capacitor sticking out of the new ESC
there suspension here this is a this is
a four wheel drive the suspension here
you can see it has helper springs so
theoretically you could jump this it's
got a pretty decent amount of travel on
the suspension here it feels pretty good
but I mean most of the time first thing
people do when they get their RC cars
they put better Springs and Federer
shocks the shock body is on there one of
the first things I did with my Revo as
well as my twin hammers but you know
it's not a whole lot to say about it
really I've had the battery charging now
and that's gonna be my biggest complaint
about this particular kit from Traxxas
is the fact that the battery that they
send with this now I know that the
battery chargers that come with these
kits are always bottom shelf they're
cheap ease expect you to probably buy
some sort of a special you know custom
electronic charger whether it's what I
use with my twin hammers actually it's a
auto-sensing it automatically sets
itself up but this one here only comes
with a cigarette lighter charger so if
you want to play with it at home the
only way you can charge it is take it to
your car plug it into the cigarette
lighter which is kind of weird because
any other RC car I've ever had has come
with at least a wall adapter an
alligator clip so you have the
flexibility to charge it out wherever
you might be playing with the car but if
you want to be using it at home then you
have to charge it in your car which is
what we're actually doing right now
and one thing I want to point out with
the charger here is that I'm charging it
right now my 370z which you know is a
push-button start and what I thought was
really strange was the moment it plugged
the charger into the cigarette lighter
and then plugged the battery in without
touching the key or the button the
accessory turned on in the car the radio
turned on in my laser and radar scanner
started beeping low voltage at me okay
so here's the charger we're in the car
you can see show the radio here
nothing's on
nothing's doing anything but watch what
happens the second I plug this thing in
see my scanner showing low volt and it
turns on the stereo so going to show
that show the starett show the stereo
and the battery here now watch let's do
that again
that's weird some of the things that
they send here obviously they send you
some spare parts
you've got your wheel nut right are your
wheel wrench right here you've also got
a wrench on here so you can adjust your
shocks you also have some spare parts of
things that will commonly break extra
body clips looks we've got some extra
hubs wait Rob what are these yeah shot
that's my bow shock spacers here so you
can do some tuning of the shocks and
then you have also got right here more
body clips so the foam piece for would
use this foam piece for okay so yeah so
this is to take up space on the if you
go with a higher output but smaller cell
see this is why we go to someone who
knows more so that you can sound smart
but really just repeat what he's saying
something else that's included in here
which is kind of cool it's out of the
box this thing is rated 40 miles per
hour and that's fun and that's quick but
we like to go fast right and they know
that you guys want to go fast but they
also include a high speed gear in here
as well which looks like it attaches to
the pinion and this is actually gonna
turn it into a 60 mile-per-hour
truck out of the box with the same cell
that it comes with
now one thing they do recommend is that
you only use this on hard surfaces and
that you don't use it on start conmen
start stop start stop because they say
that this gear will overheat the motor
if you do that because as use
accelerating that's the most output and
torque the motors going to give and so
it can actually build up a lot of heat
in there so you definitely want to keep
that in mind but anyway yeah let's go
ahead and wait for that battery to
charge I'm gonna see how long it took I
timed when I started so we'll see if
it's a quick charging battery like it
promises and then we'll see how much
runtime we can get out of that battery
in this cold condition because as you
guys know the harder the electronics get
and harder the ESC gets the more power
draw so it can actually kill your
battery faster in a hotter condition now
it's really cold today so I guess this
would be more of a best-case scenario
but anyway it's got some fun a few
moments later oh this is a four-wheel
drive unit here as you can see I guess
we're definitely testing the water
resistance portion of it I think it's up
and moves even in the mud Mickey
Thompson baby hope there's no cars
coming that was a bad idea we're obeying
the speed limit
obeying the speed limit coming back up
that's pretty stable
I don't even found a little jump right
there so far that's full lock on the
turns it's not rolling whoa
right as I say that oh no that's not
cool at all as soon as I say that it
makes me a liar
I'll be honest I don't even feel like I
want the high-speed here especially if
we're in the dirt I mean I know it says
not to this is so much fun as it is
already
whoa two wheels
the suspension seems to be pretty well
sorted out for the dirt it's kind of got
that rear squat going on
if you'll think it's got a really good
balance of both on and off road
that's kind of cool if I flip this up
around automatically
every time I get away from that spot
that's a terrible thing
now it's one thing important to point
out too is you might have you may have
known that may not have heard it right
there these are not locking diffs so of
course the powers going to transfer to
the wheel that has the least amount of
traction so that's one thing to keep in
mind that's why with my rock crawler I
had to put in locks diff that way we
could actually climb up things without
getting the wheel with the least weight
on it spinning and nothing happening so
that was what was happening right there
and is getting up on two wheels the
right side wheels are turning with
nothing happening I think for an
out-of-the-box ready to run racer given
they're not they're not too expensive I
mean RC hobbies not cheap any hobby
really isn't cheap I'm standing here in
the rain with the radio no problems
hopefully my mic isn't failing in the
rain that's more expensive to this truck
and I'm having a lot of fun
see we can see we get coconut monkey wet
here joke's on me though if I do because
it's my camera we're not turning it
right anymore though oh that's cuz I've
got ya it's time to clean out the
undercarriage you got some stuff stuck
in there okay so I had some twigs and
branches and stuff stuck up here in the
steering mechanism which was what was
keeping it from turning but what's nice
about this and it's something I forgot
to mention was that this does have servo
sabers on it so if this thing got jammed
up like it was and you're sitting there
trying to turn it and turn it this is
gonna keep you from burning out your say
your servo especially your steering
servo because it does have steering
servo saver in it but I just want to
kind of open this up now and let you see
that I mean not like we could pull any
movie magic here and like I know how to
do any of that this thing is soaked
almost as wet as I am and you guys can
take that however you want I guess I
came to feel my fingers they're numb we
are not worth or used to this weather
I'm telling you so there's the inside I
got half the lawn in there yeah
everything kept working I'd say it lives
up to its promises of being water you
know it says water-resistant to be fair
but I mean you can't go driving this in
the pool necessarily and expect the best
results this you might be able to for a
short amount of time but remember I I
smacked the hell out of that phone box
out front
no damage no bends it's got a huge
bumper on the front of this before
anything that actually has any sort of
mechanical mechanism in the front for
steering or drivetrain was affected this
absorbed everything there's no cracks no
bends I thought I might have cracked
this I've done that before no in this
truck but on my twin hammers when the
first times I hit something whether to
just crack the bumper off but yeah
everything looks like it's nice and
intact to me now my buddy says I can
actually get away with doing this and I
think we're gonna go ahead and well if
we're wrong and it was fun while it
lasted
the truck oh we need more pressure
captain hey my problem is I've got all
the grass just gunked-up in here I'm
gonna pick that out with my hands I'm
inside the body out there I guess now
I'm gonna follow this up with showing
that it still works huh let's see if it
still works
all right radios on truck is on all
right that lives up to the to the
promise there okay so this was a lot of
fun as you guys saw cleaning it off was
pretty easy make sure you don't let it
sit there with water in it turn it
upside down blow it off if you have a
compressor don't let the water just
chill on the electronics that wouldn't
be a good thing but let's talk about
this real quick if you're a seasoned RC
enthusiast this is gonna be kind of no
big deal to you it's not the first time
you've seen waterproof electronics it's
not the first time you've seen a slash
in fact you might even think that the
slash is not that great of a truck but
this is really designed especially the
ready to run stuff from Traxxas is
designed to appeal to people who want to
get into RC stuff not break the bank to
do it have something that can really be
thrashed on and just hold up you got let
me you guys so I was a full throttle
frontal impact into that TV pole or that
that phone pole which was not or there
was a cable box but that was not
intentional I'm just really bad at
determining where my line is from a side
perspective because I don't have a lot
of experience with fast-moving trucks
like I said I built a rock crawler you
would never even know I hit it there's
not even a mark on the front of this
thing at all so this is really intended
for someone who wants to get into the
sport but have it ready to run model
that's also upgradable because there's
lots of upgrades you could do to this
it's already got brushless components in
here it's already got a pretty decent
ESC am i doing a simple lipo or lithium
polymer battery lithium polymer right
yeah let the in polymer I didn't know
exactly the post in it or I just guessed
you can you can get more speed out of
this you could change that gear running
on hard tarmac which honestly me
personally I'm gonna leave this gear in
here I have more fun with the off-road
but it's fast it's fun I had more
battery charge left out it in fact we've
probably ran it for a solid ten minutes
right there and it wasn't
fully charged it was 75% charged in
about the 40 minutes I had it going and
probably the cold weather was attributed
to that but this is the sign for someone
wanting to get into it not spend a lot
of money
durable upgradable and you really don't
need to do much to it to go have fun
which is the point here ready to run out
of the box and lots of fun anyway guys
thanks for watching today's video
the huge thanks once again to mass drop
for sending me this guy here again this
is part of their new RC page it's opened
up where you guys can get some group by
and group discounts on RC stuff you can
find the link to that down in the
description well probably doing some
more RC stuff here in the future it's
another hobby of mine it's tech related
I wish I was able to do the smart
component to it where you can connect to
the receiver and connect to the car or
in the transmitter and control things
with the car and see what's happening
with the telemetry but that requires an
additional piece that I don't have so
I'm not able to do that maybe we'll
check that out in the future anyway
thanks for watching guys let me know if
you thought of this if you want to see
more RC stuff and if you want to see
more RC stuff tell me what you want to
see I want to do some aviation I'm
thinking some some helicopters not
really quad copters but I like to see
helicopters planes and even boats
maybe we'll get out to the lake but if
the boat flips over coconut monkeys
going to get it not me alright guys
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
