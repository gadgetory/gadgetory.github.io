J's to sense a lot of you guys have been
tweeting me and messaging me and making
comments and asking me for my opinion on
the new FX 9000 series desktop
processors unveiled by AMD this week at
e3 there's a couple of things I just
want to kind of start off right off the
bat by saying one we have no benchmarks
yet a lot of this information I'm about
to give you is hardware based and then
I'm gonna be giving you some speculative
Ori predictions if you will on what to
expect when it comes to the performance
of the new AMD 9000 series FX processors
at e3 this week AMD unveiled the FX 95
90 and the FX 90 372 brand new desktop
processors designed to replace the FX
8350 and a 8320 which is currently their
top-end processors now I wanted to make
sure I had all my facts straight before
I made this video so I did a little bit
of research and here's what we know so
far the 9000 series is based off of the
current Vishera
piledriver architecture it's also just
important to note that these are both
eight core processors there were no
announcements for new six core or four
core processors the way it works is AMD
uses four core modules that have two
physical cores each now what that means
is they are using shared cache for both
of those cores now because of this type
of architecture it puts AMD just a
little bit behind when it comes to core
core performance when it comes to Intel
but this is nothing new we already know
this we've already known this through
this 3770k and the hyper threading and
especially the 35 70 K when it comes to
single thread performance so the
question is what exactly is it 95 90 and
the 9370 bringing to the table it's kind
of interesting to me that they're
calling this the 9000 series when it's
the exact same architecture as
piledriver
they are bashir based cores and is on
the piledriver architecture so it's
really curious how AMD went from the
bulldozer architecture to the piledriver
they kept the same 8000 series process
that they just bumped it up from the 80
150 to the 80 350 so I don't know if
this is just some sort of a marketing
ploy where they're trying to make people
think that something brand new but it's
really not so when it comes to
performance here are my predictions now
for the rest of the video I'm going to
go ahead and use the 95 90 as my FX
processor for comparison
and we're going to use 8350 when it
comes to talking about the generational
gap between the two the FX 8350 had a
maximum speed of 4.0 gigahertz with a
turbo core of 4.2 gigahertz so only a
200 megahertz jump with turbo mode
engaged
engaging of a dieter turbo makes the
process that go so much faster
whereas the FX 95 90 has a base clock of
4.7 gigahertz and it has a turbo clock
of 5 gigahertz turbo and GAE now MD
definitely has a track record of being
first to reaching some of these
processor milestones AMD was the first
to break 1 gigahertz back in 2001 and
AMD West first of the quad core
processor back with the Phenom Series
now a lot of people complained about how
power-hungry the FX 8350 was because it
has a hundred and twenty-five watt TDP
compared to the 37 70s 77 watt TDP
however the FX 95 90 jumps up all the
way to 220 watt TDP Oh Mike holy
that's more than some graphics cards are
using now I don't see the enthusiasts
AMD user being happy about this 220 watt
TDP or nearly double what the current
TVP is of the 8350 when it comes to
their power bill especially when they're
gaming or doing very heavy intensive
tasks now before I get into my
predictions here I want to go ahead and
just start off by saying I was an FX
8350 user I was at FX 81 20 user and I
was a phenom x4 965 Black Edition user
so I have used the last three
generations skipping the x6 series when
it came to the t10 90 and the t 1100 but
I do have experience with these
processors now recently I did jump over
to an Ivy Bridge processor 4 Intel but
that's not to say that if AMD doesn't
make huge leaps in the future that I
wouldn't switch back I fortunately had
the freedom to be able to kind of switch
around my components as I see fit
so I'd like to think of myself as being
sort of like this triple Oreo right here
it's chocolate and it's the white stuff
I don't order what you call it early
vanilla so I am coming from both sides
of the fence because I have owned and
used the top end of both of these series
so I'm not speaking with a biased so I'm
going to do my best to bring you guys
the best speculation and prediction that
I possibly can when it comes to the new
FX series processors now because they're
using bashir and they're using
piledriver I've kind of got an idea of
what it is that they've done here the
higher TDP means to me that they
probably seriously bumped up the factory
voltage in the stock voltage to the CPU
and they basically have hand-picked and
cherry-pick the best silicon they found
while manufacturing the pile driver or
the 8350 series set it aside and now
they're coming out with a basically a
factory overclocked even though they're
not calling it an overclock basically
it's going to be a factory overclocked
8350 running five gigahertz turbo core
Tegra and gauge it's probably going to
end up shipping with some sort of an
integrated or built-in water cooler
system which is very similar to the
antec or the H 50 H 60 series from
Corsair where when the piledriver first
came out that's the way they were
shipping they had a water cooler built
on with them now if AMD does go this
route this means that they are
definitely bumping up the stock voltage
when it comes to the CPU it also means
to me that's probably not going to have
quite as much overclocking Headroom as a
lot of people are expecting now I am
expecting the 95 90s base clock of 4.7
and the turbo clock of 5 gigahertz to
probably annihilate the 37 70 at its
stock 3.5 gigahertz now the reason why
I'm saying this is I have actually had
my 8350 overclocked to 5.3 gigahertz now
I've run Cinebench on both my FX 8350
and my 3770k in overclock trim including
a couple of different overclock
frequencies so you can see just held the
benchmark scales with different
overclocks now we'll go ahead and take a
look at the 8350 first now you can see
right here that I've got three different
over clocks going 4.8 to 5.0 - and 5.05
what I want to show you here is just how
much of a jump you get with only a
couple of hundred megahertz at four
point eight two gigahertz we got an
eight-point-two forced an event score at
5.0 two gigahertz we got an eight point
five two and at 5.05
only 30 gigahertz faster we got an eight
point six six now you can see a
difference of just two hundred and
thirty megahertz brought the score up
point four on Cinebench now let's go
ahead and see how the over clocks
compare when it
to the Intel side of things now for some
reason Cinebench is being very strange
and it's not actually showing the speed
that my processor was running in the
highlighted area there so it's showing
it running at the factory speeds of 3.5
gigahertz which just isn't accurate so I
want to throw that out there right off
the bat but the bottom score there of a
nine point one four is my 24/7 overclock
of four point seven gigahertz at one
point two six volts the number three on
there or the darker orange score of a
nine point four four is at four point
eight gigahertz so you can see there 100
megahertz difference on the overclock
brought us up a whole point three on the
score now there's a lot of people who've
been able to get their 37 70s to five
gigahertz I would have to assume that at
five gigahertz the scored probably be
somewhere near ten point oh but one
thing you definitely want to keep in
mind is that this is just a synthetic
benchmark when it comes to day to day
tasks playing games surfing on the net
going to Facebook watching pornography
doing whatever it is that you do you're
not really going to see much of a
difference between these two processors
they boot in pretty much the exact same
amount of time programs load and pretty
much the same amount of time it really
doesn't start to show its difference
until I start rendering videos kind of
like this one now my prediction for the
9000 series as I've already said it's
going to look a lot like the scores that
you're seeing here I'm practically
willing to put money on that because of
the fact that the architecture is the
same my 8350 overclocked to five gigs is
giving you basically the same
performance you can expect to see on the
Cinebench scores there's a couple
questions that really matter when it
comes to whether or not this processor
is going to be important to you do you
overclock and how much overclocking
Headroom is there in these processors
now my speculation here is AMD took some
of the best performing silicon from this
exact series the 8350 and set it aside
and allowed them to make themselves sort
of their own little niche socket series
if you will just like nvidia did when it
came with a Titan they're basically
seven 80s that performed better than
expected they came out with a boutique
series of card called the GTX Titan and
they charge more for now we have no idea
what the 95 90 or the 93 70 is going to
cost so whether or not this processor is
worth it to you really is going to
depend on the cost fortunately this
isn't an three-plus processor so if
you're on an older AMD board chances are
you're going to be able to use it it may
require BIOS update though some of the
motherboards probably won't recognize
is the factory speeds that are being
sent to the motherboard motherboard BIOS
can be scary for the average user but
those are my predictions I'm predicting
they won't overclock very far they're
going to be very hot
they're very power hungry that's not
even prediction that's guaranteed just
based on the way the TDP is on the box
and I'm expecting them to look a lot
like these scores that I've just shown
you so let's just go ahead and wait and
see they're not even going to be
available to the public until later this
summer and even then you're not going to
be able to buy it in retail packaging
like this until later on probably in the
fall because all of these are being sent
to integrated builders first companies
like HP CyberPower ibuypower
or cyber PC the Alienware I don't even
know I don't think anywhere uses AMD but
the bottom line is don't expect it to
overclock very far and if it does and if
it reaches something like five point
five or even five point eight and God
forbid six gigahertz then I think
steamroller gosh depending on the
performance of steamroller I might be
joining team red once again damn being
an addict just being sucks thanks for
watching this video you guys requested
it I brought it to you guys I hope you
guys use this information and helps you
when it comes to the future you're
probably just confused as when you
started this video about whether or not
the new AMD series is worth buying
you're going to have to wait we're gonna
have to see the benchmarks but until
then I think what I've just shown you
here is a pretty good example what you
can expect with the new FX 95 90 and 90
370 make sure you hit that subscribe
