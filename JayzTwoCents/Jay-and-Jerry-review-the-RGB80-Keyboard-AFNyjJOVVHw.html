Jays to Barclays he's actually in the
room fellas what is that smell so since
I've got the one and only Jays or the
one and only Jays barnacle so since I've
actually got Barclays in the room I
figured you'd be perfect time for us to
do a keyboard review because who else is
more of a keyboard whore than me so guys
today we're taking a look at the RGB 80
I'll be honest I don't know why it's
called 80 maybe czar 80 Keith is 10
keyless and AV key versus a one ohm or
yeah I learned something today okay guy
says we got the RGB 80 16.8 million
color backlit keyboard here from
Roseville it's a mechanical gaming
keyboard we'll go ahead and take a look
and see what the hell this thing is all
about now just a little disclaimer here
on the box it does show kind of a
varying color grade on here as the
different regions of the keyboards are
met this is just photoshopped really it
says right here on the front that you
can only have one color at a time will
you mute your phone freakin amateur I'm
sorry okay so feature wise here it does
have sixteen point eight million color
capable with a firmware update that's
coming in the future
six level backlight adjustable does that
mean six levels of brightness I guess
we'll find out yeah anti-ghosting
functions I that's good I hate ghosts
there you go scary goes are horrible
people a hundred percent mechanical but
it doesn't say what kind of keys they
are it doesn't say anywhere on here if
they're Cherry MX or whatever other any
other mechanical switch I've never heard
of another mechanical switch other than
Terry there actually are oh I didn't
know but I'm looking to see where
switches now as mechanical gaming
keyboard switches okay here's the bottom
line with the keys I've used this
keyboard already the console video which
it's very controversial apparently
amongst many people you guys can hear
it's very distinctly clicky now I sent
them an email and ask them what keys are
in this and they basically replied in
today's they're like cherry blues I mean
you see they're clicky yeah and they do
feel a lot like a blue and if these are
not Cherry MX switches I couldn't
actually tell you
but they are because they feel an awful
lot like cherries that's a party
keyboard a clearly it is a 10 kilos
keyboard which a lot of gamers seem to
like helps keep down some of the cost if
you're not using that that number pad
over there the 10 keys are for poor
people Jay yeah an accountant and
accountants I would agree it does have
on the bottom here your USB plug plug it
in channel all that stuff you'd expect
rubberized feet that pop out
big fat rubber feet down here on the
bottom for big fat guys like this oh
yeah
rubberized texture all around little
embossed rge RGB right yeah it stands
for red green blue yeah yeah yeah
actually kind of a though I know it's a
GB a GB it's got a nice clean look to it
here we'll get some close-up shot are
you still Ballmer ish but you know the
most important part about this is
features where does it feature what are
the colors look like and what comes in
the box so it's got a 5.9 foot cable
they couldn't quite get that six foot
they got a nice 5.9 foot but hey they're
honest what can I say I wonder if they
accidentally put their own connector on
and you like cut it off and shorten it a
little bit all right like oh god this
isn't firewire now it's zip tied
together I did that actually but it's
alright paracord yeah but it's really
stiff that's like me some stiff paracord
Jay so the court is nice it's kind of
stiff I wish it was a little longer
because I do have a long run from my
keyboard to my tower and most of us do
now especially put your keyboard on the
floor might not be long enough but it's
kind of the same gripe I have with every
manufacturer so cord aside they do give
you a key cap puller and they give you
some exhilarate
they're kind of different in the sense
that key cap who are pretty pretty
universal there but they give you clear
keys Lou that they're pretty clear their
sides printed with clear so if you
wanted color to show straight through I
mean I guess you could do that all right
so enough about that let's go ahead and
just get this thing powered up let's get
the software loaded if I could find out
how since it's a CD disc and I don't
have a CD drive and I'm not sure if
these are available online yet since I
don't think these are out yet we'll
figure it and if they are then I'm just
way behind on this review so yeah enough
about talking about it let's go ahead
and click on it let's see how fast this
guy can type on it I type 100 words per
minute he's up to 130 so I guess that
makes you 30% better yeah you're gonna
get raped you can't say that
or not I don't know if people get mad
logo okay so the RGB ad here from
Roseville took me a little bit to figure
out the software
I think mr. barnacle even have to agree
that the software has a little bit of a
learning curve that goes along with it
oh yeah yeah but fortunate thing with
that is software can be improved over
time this is early software for them
I certainly hope it improves now before
we get to the software let's just talk
about some of the functionality here of
the keyboard so here's the RGB we've got
profile one on here default which is
blue as you go through the different
profiles you can have each profile have
its own color if you kind of need it you
can do like a disco effect and just kind
of let it go
it's advertises sixteen point eight
million colors but right now we were
stuck to the standard 256 there was like
ten blacks on there actually because it
was every RGB main beta main prime color
all the way adjusted a shade down to
black so really it's not even 256 colors
it's like nine yeah with every shade of
those nines but they did tell me in an
email that there's a software update
coming out that will allow you to get
the full RGB and I'm assuming at that
point what will be getting is like right
now currently when you go in and you
look at the colors and you say LED
settings and you click the color you
just get this what looks like mspaint
little palette here but I'm assuming
what's gonna happen in the future is
you're gonna get a color wheel yeah
that's that's probably what's gonna
happen and and they've decided to go
ahead and launch the keyboard prior to
the software being completely matured
that's not unusual for a lot of
companies I mean Microsoft does that all
the time and you can adjust the colors
of this by simply you know kind of
clicking on the let's see what color
should we make this red well we already
have a red let's do right let's just do
white there's no white on the base there
you go all right so this is kind of
downside to the software number one
we're not sure what processors in here
like a lot of keyboard manufacturers are
starting to go with like arm 32-bit
processors which are good enough for
like mobile phones and when you hit
apply and save this oh okay and apply
you can see on the screen right now it
says loading it actually takes a little
while I think it has like that's 100
bought modem in it it's a
yeah it's actually calling the computer
right now see we're getting a little
progress on the load bar so I do feel
that currently the weak link in this
keyboard is the software I really hope
that they improve it but there's macro
functions on there they do have a sync
program button where if you click that
pushing the button that you assigned can
open up a program or some sort of a
process yeah see it's still going see
that it takes a long time to save your
settings to the keyboard like a
30-second it's a tiny change a color a
key macro something you have to go
through this and there it's done and you
can see now we have well I thought it
was white I guess it's really really
green like light light light light green
maybe I selected the wrong color but
anyway you can't adjust the colors that
way now what I'm a little disappointed
about you cannot set individual key
colors I thought you could I thought you
could I mean I know in the box that said
that you can't do different zones of
colors but you can't do individual
colors either the whole keyboard or
nothing it's a little misleading because
the box also shows on the front let's do
this it's actually showed different
regions of colors on the front in the
picture so you kind of want to assume
that you could do that but right now
anyways you can and I guess we don't
know if you will even be able to do that
in the future right
we don't know all I know the only thing
they really talked about in the an email
with me was that they are going to be
making it 16.8 color capable they have
to because they advertised is that yeah
but who knows what changes they're
making to the actual software and let me
turn the camera towards you so you're
not nothing but echo or them that might
get me
there we go how's that it's pretty good
they did advertise it as being five back
a brightness adjustable but I think
that's a misprint it is because we've
only found three adjustment levels to
zone levels plus the breathing mode yeah
so I think that was a misprint because
if we hold down the function key in the
up and down arrow we have the first
brightness which is awful yeah it's kind
of a given
brightness number two is a medium
brightness number three is full bright
you push it again
it doesn't change but it's got one of
the slowest breathing modes I think I've
seen yeah wait for it okay there goes
no.8 wait wait oh here it's coming back
yeah and there we go so it's a really
slow breathing mode that's mode number
four and then if you push it up again
you get like a gamer modes just WASD
arrow keys enter in the F row yeah or
the F eight through twelve anyway which
is your profile settings and then you do
it again you get I guess this would be
like guns different guns and gyms and
like macros and minecraft and yeah
control shift caps tab and then you push
it again give nothing else so there's
just so the five levels are actually
three brightness into zone three
brightness two zones plus breathing four
six total seven if you want to include
off and it's also got this look I think
that back it would be six cuz they count
the first brightness is off which is
kind of cheating but office they call it
they call it a brightness level okay
so yeah but there is there's other fun
stuff there's like the macro keys
obviously I mean I had a little fun here
with with the F Road f1 macro as you can
see right here in the on the keyboard
hopefully you guys can read that well
see Jerry is a big poopoo head hahahaha
he's such a noob yeah that's true
this keyboard where does it fit in the
market well it's the cheapest RGB
keyboard so far that I could find it
comes in at $99 it does have its
shortcomings but I think if you're not
if you're like me and I can only talk
about me Jerry can give his opinion I
don't use macros I'm not a macro guy I'm
not a big macro guy either if it doesn't
have dedicated macro keys I'm guaranteed
not to use macros yeah because I don't
want to hit f1 in some other program it
starts typing Jerry as a noob like I
started to reply to an email to Luke
Luke over at Linus tech tips and I hit F
wanted to start typing out Jerry is a
noob haha so it could get you in trouble
if you don't have demonstrated macro
that's true but it'd be fun if something
if a friend of yours has one of these
like I was telling Jane when he's not
looking I'm gonna program it so that
like that when he presses the period key
it types something really fast that's
obscene and then hits ctrl s which is
usually the universal send email right
code so hopefully you'll stumble across
that wall writing and if you guys start
seeing any promotions of Jerry's channel
it's probably he got into the macro
settings so I went in to log into
Twitter and it's like everyone go follow
the Barclays he's awesome yeah thing so
that's it's $99 right now and I don't
think there's any other 10 key we did
confirm that yeah are there already I
gots blue switches they're actually
green light
there but well we'll get a close-up of
that they are MX blue switches in there
I love blues blues are my favorite
switch so I'm gonna be using very smurfy
never a clicky I love the click and you
got the ability to disable the Windows
key so you can switch between game mode
and PC mode which essentially kills the
Windows key right which is kind of the
one other negative we had we found about
this PFD ant macro that key we've spent
about maybe 40 minutes right now playing
with the macros we were trying to macro
in some of the windows command functions
so that you could bring up a program
like we were gonna macro in that you
push f1 and it brings up notepad to
start it starts typing out Jerry as a
new but the problem is that if you go
into PC mode there PC mode by the way
which they call that's that's the only
mode where the windows key works and
it's do you do function PC mode right
now the color is purple for that one
yeah the windows key works as you can
see on the screen behind us but if you
go into any gamer profile it's dead it's
dead you have no control over that every
other gaming keyboard have ever used you
have the option of disabling that key in
any profile or enabling it in your
profile yeah so Jerry has a theory as to
why they might be doing that yeah the
theory is is the windows key it's it's
not very deterministic if you disable it
you can't use it if you enable it then
it's for system functions so if you
could Mac her while it was disabled eyes
up here buddy sorry I'm like I can see
myself everyone's you be like what yeah
I know I even do that in my camera I had
to get used to that so with the Windows
key basically if you disable the Windows
key and you were able to create a macro
like Windows key did something and then
you went in and you re-enable the
Windows key we're now Windows means to
the system to open the system menu
you've now altered the functionality of
that key that's not just a macro where
is in the macro sense f1 f1 has always
have one it always does what f1 does but
being able to disable enable the key
changes how it works so that's why I
think that they basically just said
let's not mess with it let's just leave
it off the menu
but in ROS Mel's defense I dunno I can
enable and disable that key but I had
not checked on the other keyboards I
have if you can macro that keys I
suspect you can't that's true I haven't
tried it either so that's actually a
good test so guys the RGB 80 from ROS
will it has all the stuff gamers want
it's a 10 keyless if that's what you're
into
I'd love cherry MX blues my favorites
which custom backlighting any color you
want so you could match it to
color theme I could go yellow for
skunkworks or red for this PC green if
you're an Nvidia fanboy right if your
team red and it's got its comfortable
you could actually type pretty quick on
it yeah he typed on it he really liked
the feel of this keyboard it's it's
heavy so it doesn't slide it's got nice
rubber feet it doesn't move around on
you and it's really basic approach our
GP keyboard it doesn't break the bank I
mean some of these 10 keyless be 150
bucks or more well hello Plain Jane
Cherry MX mechanical keyboard can hit
one hundred and fifty dollars that's
like that's like the middle price point
for them so guys right now it's
available over at new egg I don't know
where else it's available but is a rose
well RGB eighty sixteen point eight
million colors in the future go and
check it out guys make sure if you
stumbled across this channel you guys
follow us on Twitter I never have to say
follow us it's weird yeah at Barclays
Jay's two cents over here we both have
the book face and the other YouTube
channel this guy has one it's a little
little channel though it's not
incredibly it's still a little itty bit
only like 121,000 little tiny one so
guys wring it the neck on out of here
I've been hanging out do too much lately
yeah we're gonna see what other trouble
we can get in as always guys we'll see
you in the next one which are probably
very soon yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
