going to talk about something that's
near and dear to my heart and I don't
mean cholesterol I mean multi-gpu
support this is something that I have
always been a huge enthusiast of if you
guys have followed my channel for any
length of time you've noticed that most
of my builds that I do that are for
myself include multi-gpu even though
it's a terrible scaler it costs more
money and it doesn't get nearly the
utilization it used to in the past it's
something that I still truly am
passionate about when I want kind of
want to talk to you today is towards
people who are considering multi-gpu
support or multi-gpu setups what you
should think about and what you should
stay away from because in 2019 it's easy
to accidentally waste a craft out of
money
miss oh man that was a better way to
play warships we're gonna play on the
computer apparently you haven't heard of
world of warships and yeah you play it
on a computer
well the warships is a free to play
strategy game where you take command to
some of the most iconic war vessels from
World War one and World War two vessels
like the HMS hood USS Missouri or the
ships that changed naval warfare forever
the dreadnought class each ship is
recreated using historical photos and 3d
scans of the real vessel to ensure the
most realistic detail possible so real
in fact you will swear you were on the
ship itself but we all know that the war
is won in the sky so that's why world of
warships features a completely revamped
carrier play style where you get to take
control of squadrons of aircraft
performing bombing and torpedo runs to
devastate your enemy in fact new players
can start devastating their enemies by
using offer code play Langley 2019 to
receive a free starter pack featuring
the USS langley aircraft carrier 302
balloons 1 million credits and three
days of premium time now get out there
and start putting some shells downrange
sailor yeah this is so much fun shit you
can start having fun too by downloading
world of warships by using the link in
the description below
so what actually started this whole
concept of this video was I was
intending to do a dual 5,700 xt system
benchmarking to see kind of like hey you
know foreigner dollar graphics card
let's see how this compares to an $800
graphics card you put two together which
was always kind of the thing it was it
was common to take like a 950 TI or a
960 or something in sli those and get
pretty damn close to like the 980
performance type of error and did with a
400 series cards a 500 but will be
noticed was that anything below the 70
series leading up to Pascal was pretty
much dropped and and nullified any SLI
support whatsoever and so when I
realized the 5700 XT could be enabled
with crossfire mode although AMD was
kind of like you know it's not supported
it doesn't mean it doesn't work and
because we were able to enable it I
started doing some testing and realize
there was absolutely zero activity
happening on the second card even in
titles like 3d mark which are synthetic
and they are designed to scale nearly
perfectly with multi at least with two
cards we were seeing crashes we weren't
even getting 3d mark to run it would it
would start to load the test I'd get a
solid white screen and then it would
completely lock the system now we are
and and when it comes to AMD you can
still actually crossfire things like
Vegas 64 and Radeon 7 and all of that
it's something specifically with this
launch with Navi that they've decided to
basically have 0 out-of-the-box support
for crossfire what makes that a little
bit disappointing is because what we
talked about with Pascal was with
implicit and explicit SLI or multi-gpu
Windows 10 could have done something you
know the DirectX 12 is it's got
different modes of multi GPU support and
it could technically be supported at the
OS level it could be supported at the
driver level it could also be supported
at the game rendering level and I think
what happened here and I did a video
about this a couple years ago is when
you got three cooks in the kitchen now
handling multi-gpu support it became a
little convoluted where it wasn't just
handled with the driver and so I think a
lot of people dropped it for that simple
fact of there was no way to make it a
perfect situation or even scale really
well when you
too many things too many cooks in the
kitchen like I said but Nvidia does
still at least support SLI on the series
series or the 70 series cards and higher
so 2070 2070 super and up does support
SLI obviously these are all the Titan RT
X's that we've been using in the rip GN
series recently we've used 2080 T is
these 1080 T is but what happened was
even though you do have up to 4 Way SLI
is still supported with the Pascal
series cards they dropped 3 &amp;amp; 4 way
entirely with the RT X series cards so
that's why if you go on 3dmark and look
at the Hall of Fame and you can see that
like on x by extreme and x by and even
firestrike you'll you'll see that the
top scores are still 4 Way SLI configs
running last gen hardware because the
new hardware although great still isn't
able to outperform ln2 cooled massive
modified overclocked 1080 is even the
Titan RT X cards so it's an interesting
time right now where although that
support was taken away it still exists
now I'm here to tell you that SLI does
still scale nearly perfectly with those
synthetic benchmarks things like far cry
5 and 3d mark x by on poor royale with r
TX based cards but if you're looking for
true gaming performance increases you're
not gonna see it with modern titles
let's say 2017 ish and newer because
what sort of happened here was the need
for SLI has changed it was something
that was kind of needed no no that's all
I goes I'll be back to like the TNT era
it's like way back and like the Voodoo
cards and stuff like that but it's
something that is just not necessarily
but it's not something that's really
necessary today because what's happened
is GPU performance has definitely caught
up to the pixel count and monitors 1080p
was a super hard resolution to run about
five years ago you were talking limited
vram on the graphics cards very limited
core clocks and core speed the
architectures were huge and slow I
remember when we first crossed the
gigahertz mark the one gigahertz mark
when it comes to GPUs it was massive it
didn't take long for us to start passing
to gigahertz with triple - quadruple the
amount of cuda cores that are in the
cards quadruple the amounts of ram so
the hardware has definitely advanced to
the point to where you could run 1440p
and even 4k with single cards get
60 FPS just three years ago we still
were dealing with the Titan X Maxwell
and the 980ti
era we still needed two cards to run
60fps with settings around the meat
medium to low for 4k so it's definitely
one of those things that's not
necessarily needed anymore for the
resolutions that you're running but now
that we're seeing the introduction of 8k
TVs and possibly panels it's gonna I
think resolutions are about to jump
ahead again but I don't think we're
gonna see multi GPU support be how we
get there I think we're gonna see as a
GPU race coming from the manufacturers
that's gonna push GPU technology forward
even further that's gonna allow us to
get more horsepower out of single cards
now part of the problem with SLI or even
crossfire or any multi GPU support was
the introduction of micro stuttering and
that's because there's different ways to
achieve multi GPU support you would have
you know alternate frame major AFR where
one card would handle every other frame
you would also have like it almost like
an interleaving where each card would
handle a different portion of the frame
simultaneously rendering the scene so
there were lots of different ways to
achieve the end result and I think
because of that when it comes to now the
implicit and explicit through dx12 it's
one of those things where like I said
it's too convoluted and the developers
are just not even trying anymore
in fact when battlefield 5 first came
out the first thing we tried was 20 atti
sli with our TX going to see if it
scaled at all with our TX and what we
found was there was even a menu option
in there that was great out for turning
on things like RT X or DX R and it
warned you like look if you have
multi-gpu you cannot run like you will
only get zero support whatsoever for
turning on DX R so you had to run DX 11
and then you would get multi GPU support
in battlefield 5 in fact as recently as
when I did my life playthrough on Twitch
of my Resident Evil playthrough but the
remake the very first thing I looked at
cuz I had the to tighten our TX cards
both of these cards with their air
cooler still on there in my system and
started playing and checking for multi
GPU support and not only did it not
support it something happened to where
it actually reduced the the main clock
all the way down to its base clock when
I was trying to run the game
and so the the first clock or the first
gpgpu zero did not boost up to where it
should have when SLI was enabled as soon
as I wouldn't Nvidia control panel
disabled SLI then we got the first card
to boost all the way up to where even at
34 40 by 1440 100 megahertz panel was
getting like a hundred FPS with a single
card hundred Hertz there we go
at the fast panel one hundred Hertz
panel at we don't need a hundred
thousand frames per second whatever it
is but yeah that but the fact that the
first card was jumped by the second card
with SLI going that's all about profile
and driver profile and all that we used
n V inspector to go in there and try and
even brute force some stuff same thing
as battlefield 5 so we saw that there
was even zero scaling whatsoever
although they've got this fancy NB link
on top of the Nvidia cards and PCI
Express 4.0 in fact the funny thing
about PCI Express 4.0 when it comes to
AMD is when we talked about the NV link
bridge that exists on Nvidia they
basically said in their exact words
where we don't need a bridge we've got
PCIe 4.0 so we've got way more
throughput through the PCI Express Lanes
to handle multi GPU support than needing
anything with fingers and then the irony
is they don't support it at all anyway
so one of the things that people tend to
usually do is buy two mid-range cards
SLI or crossfire them together and get
and usually exceed the performance of
the top two your card and that's not the
case here the 2060 super which is kind
of like the equivalent to the 5700 XT in
terms of pricing neither one of those
support multi-gpu anyway so I guess the
whole point of this video is multi-gpu
for all intents and purposes with the
exception of bragging rights and
synthetic benchmarks for like 3d mark is
dead which is kind of a sad day for me
and I think Phil should cue the sad
piano music now because it's true even
on skunkworks where I've got 220 ATT is
and I'm playing my games the second card
does nothing in fact when I do
livestream though it's kind of nice
because the encoder that's built in the
end deck encoder from Nvidia is really
really efficient and it's really good
it's got a very good bitrate control
it's got very good image quality and
nearly zero hit to the system and these
when you have a second car
handling your gaming on the primary card
yeah so this is more of a PSA if you're
thinking about buying two cards I
wouldn't I would just save that money
get the top two your card something like
a twenty eighty I would I would love to
recommend something in the top tier
range for AMD but we already know the
Radeon seven is definitely a flop
compared to the 5700 XT which is beating
it in many benchmarks without even
overclocking it if you're going from the
top tier I need to have the best of the
best you're gonna shop at like a two
twenty eighty or twenty atti or a super
card and then you could SLI those
together but like I just said if you're
looking for practical performance you're
not gonna get it with SLI take that
money put it into a better motherboard
better CPU more RAM just you could
upgrade the entire tier of nearly every
component in your system by dropping the
second graphics card if you're thinking
about doing that but it's but yeah I've
had a lot of people reach out to me
asking me about multi-gpu and SLI is it
still worth it and the answer is truly
no and it's something that I've held out
and to the bitter end on admitting that
it is completely unnecessary and
impractical and here we are J is two
cents which should be J's two graphics
cards admitting it's dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
