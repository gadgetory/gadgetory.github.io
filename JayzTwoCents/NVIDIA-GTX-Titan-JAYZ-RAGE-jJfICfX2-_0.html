don't even know where to start today I
am just I'm so frickin mad no no no no
stop the music just forget all that so
Nvidia decided to go ahead and come out
with the GTX Titan and they didn't call
it the 695 or the 685 like a lot of
people were thinking because it has the
gk110 chip in it or the gk110 die or
whatever you want to call it in there
this some of you might recognize is the
GTX 680 this is the card that I have
what what was supposed to be
maybe the GTX 780 or the new series
coming out they come out with the GTX
Titan because they think the AMD is
going to be launching a new 8000 series
card in the first quarter of 2013 in
January of 2012
AMD launches the 7970 which is the first
Kepler based GPU it's a smaller die and
it was faster than anything GTX had on
the market so they admitted okay okay
you know we jumped the gun a little bit
here because they had already put this
thing in the development and knew that
okay we're gonna come out with this
thing before the end of q1 2013 and what
happens
AMD announces just a little while ago
that oh you know we're not going to be
coming out with any new cards until
quarter four of 2013 a Nvidia admittedly
says oh well no we're kind of we jumped
the gun on this one a little bit now and
so they don't want to call it a 685 and
they don't want to call it a 780 it's a
stopgap card they call this thing a
boutique card what the is that what
is a boutique card supposed to mean huh
do I have to go down to like huh Rodeo
Drive to buy the damn thing and then
okay okay well let's go ahead and see
what the performance is like and of
course they send out these review models
to all these different forms they're
under a non-disclosure act or an NDA
we're not allowed to talk about any of
the specs until Nvidia officially
announces the car so okay fine an Nvidia
holds its press conference and it talks
about the card and the specs are
impressive hey 384 bit memory bus six
gigabytes of ddr4 what does it have as a
base clock 837 megahertz with an 800
in 76 megahertz okay fine fine I know
enough about computers to know don't
judge a performance simply by the mega
hurt twenty six hundred and eighty eight
CUDA cores holy that's more than a
thousand more than my six eighty has and
it doesn't use that much more power than
the six eighty the things thirty to
forty percent faster and that's really
enticing to someone like me because I
want to get something like that to
insist in faster renting or my videos
that way I could bring videos to you
guys the GTX 680 costs above five
hundred give or take a little bit less
you can find it as cheap as four hundred
in like sixty dollars okay fine and the
six ninety debuts at nine hundred and
ninety nine dollars okay fine so this is
a single GPU the six ninety is
technically the flagship and it's gonna
cost somewhere between the six eighty
and the six ninety okay fine I dig it I
can handle that when we talking here
$6.99 right six fifty something like
that a thousand dollars they review this
thing I'd a thousand dollars I
don't have a thousand dollars to throw
away for Christ's sakes I have kids I
have a wife I have things to pay but
damn it if I don't have the addiction
where I have to have the top of the line
and the best all the time because now
all of a sudden this thing is a piece of
 nobody wants that anymore the six
80s now old news I'm trying to base a
goddamn YouTube channel and the fact
that you don't have to have breaking
budget performance out of a PC to do PC
gaming but Nvidia you're making a
little bit difficult considering the
fact that you want to scare people away
with thousand dollar price tags on GPUs
and then you have the nerve to call it a
boutique card yeah
go and get your nails done get
your pamper and go get your goddamn lacy
panties in video and I think right now
team red AMD is starting to look a whole
lot better
on second thought Nvidia I think I've
come up with a more productive way to
burn $1000 Nvidia Titan that's what it
does for your money
 you Nvidia</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
