and today we're gonna change gears a
little bit we're not gonna talk about
anything computer related we are going
to talk about smart devices and
protection for that because if you own a
smartphone and I don't care if it's an
Android or Windows Phone or an iPhone
these things are freaking expensive and
with how terrible insurance plans are
for these devices it could still cost
you hundreds of dollars to replace this
thing if you damage it if you've ever
dropped your smartphone especially if
you don't have a case or any sort of
protection on it you know that feeling
 and it always lands facedown so
you're gonna pick it up dude I've never
double turnover and that's like it's
like this terrible suspensive is the
screen shattered and then when you look
at it and it's not you know well you're
probably one more drop away from it
shattering because every time you drop
it you weaken it a little bit the
fractal design r5 is so amazing it fits
all kinds of cool hardware in there
water cooling air cooling and on top of
that it's silent and it's awesome like
explosions or like today we're going to
talk about OtterBox and some of the
cases available for the brand new Galaxy
s6 as well as other smartphones on the
market and well considering I've been
using OtterBox for a while
figured we'll go ahead and share a video
with you guys showing you just how
comfortable I am with throwing around
devices that are protected by OtterBox
so last month OtterBox reached out to me
and asked if I want to do a video about
the new galaxy s6 and some of the new
cases for it and I said well
unfortunately I don't have an s6
I am an Ambo at amboy I'm I am an iPhone
user and I just had I don't have access
to any of the Android stuff and they
said well that's no problem we'll go
ahead and send you a device so here it
is right here they sent me an Android s6
and you guys saw on
Tech Talk that I actually chucked this
thing over my shoulder and it bounced
around the walls in this room because of
how comfortable I am with OtterBox cases
in fact my old day job when I worked at
IT we had over 300 handheld devices
between iPads and iPhones in the field
for our field reps and they were all
protected by OtterBox Defender cases so
OtterBox is not like some startup brand
they've been around for a long long time
now the galaxy s6 along with a lot of
other smartphones and current design
iPhone 6 included have nice rounded
metal edges which makes the thing
absolutely terrible for handling I don't
know if the developers of these phones
are putting like lubricated materials
built into their their bodies because
they all are extremely slick and easy to
drop it's almost like they're doing it
on purpose
and it's a way to help boost sales I
don't really know but the OtterBox is
designed to give you not only a lot of
protection but also a lot of grip now
OtterBox has three different types of
protection for your smart devices they
have the Defender case which is like the
giant behemoth case you've got the
commuter case which is a little bit
smaller but still very very rugged the
simmetry case which is a one-piece easy
to install just clean of a clip-on or
sort of a snap-on case and then you've
got your alpha glass which is their
glass screen protectors we'll be taking
a look at three of them today the
defender the symmetry and the alpha
glass now I'm personally a fan of the
symmetry because it's one piece it's
rubber inside where it matters
everywhere it touches your phone it's a
soft rubber so you're not going to
scratch your device especially on these
new devices like this has a glass back
on here you don't want to scratch that
up you are gonna have a nice rubber grip
where it matters everywhere your thumb
pretty much would touch it's a nice
rubber grip rubberized buttons and it's
going to give you a ton of dropp
protection now installing it's extremely
easy and that's what I like about the
simmetry case being a one-piece snap-on
is the fact that you don't have to do
like the OtterBox Defender case where it
comes apart you got to put it in and
snap it on and snap this and I don't
care for that I'm not a handyman I'm not
a police officer or a fireman or working
in construction I don't need that level
of protection so the simmetry case is
perfect for me where it keeps it nice
and thin it's easy to handle it's not
too bulky in my pocket it's not too
small but it's not too big
we're deuce yeah I totally ripped off
Barclays right there we all know he was
the first person to ever say wooden butt
is but installation is extremely easy
you just take a side slide it in pop the
corners
/ it's flexible and there you go but you
also have a nice hard shell on here
where it's gonna be nice and rugged
where it counts
that's why I'm able to do things like
that with this phone and have absolutely
no worries whatsoever about there being
any damage to it so if this thing ever
slips out of my hand I'm not gonna be
too worried about it in fact the wife
has been using one right here on her
iPhone 6 for quite a while she's got the
teal and blue one fortunately the pink
kind of changes color and turns a little
bit dirty because bright colored rubber
picks up dyes from your jeans and stuff
like that unfortunately now the other
case that we have here is the OtterBox
Defender which is a multi now the other
case we have here is the OtterBox
Defender I totally left that in it's
worth I'm fumbling all this stuff around
which is a perfect example of why you
need this now if you are a handyman or a
police officer or a construction worker
or somebody who's just extremely hard on
your phone or you want a case that's
gonna protect against camping or
dirtbike riding or whatever then the
OtterBox Defender is definitely going to
be for you now this is a multiple piece
case and it comes with a belt it can
snap on to your belt there this is fully
360 rotatable it's got built-in screen
protection and it's just completely
rugged I mean there's this is like a
man's case this is the case for men the
charger port has a little cover for it
here so you can keep dust out of it same
with the headphone jack but it is not a
waterproof case they they did have
waterproof case for the iPhone 5 and 5s
I don't know if they're gonna have one
for the six I did do a review on that
one I actually dunked it in water and
had no concerns whatsoever but the thing
I don't like about these cases
personally for me is to get them on it's
actually quite the struggle and I only
know this because like I said earlier we
used a ton of these at my old job so
you've got this rubber piece right here
that you have to peel off so this is
kind of like your outer protection
protection or like your shock layer then
it's going to expose here a plastic
clamshell that you've got to pop apart
at the particular spots all right there
we go so it's a three piece
as you can see in dealing with multiple
layer cases like this I just like be
able to get my case or my phone in and
out of the case really easy if you guys
have an Android device with the
expandable storage or removable battery
you'd probably get annoyed taking this
thing on and off but the inside of the
case right here is very very soft
material but when you put your device in
there it definitely feels like it's
cushioned on a nice soft layer take the
outer piece right here clap clamp that
down
you take the outer piece and this pretty
much just clips on make sure all the
tabs are clipped down so then you have
your device in the inner shell and then
you take the rubber piece and you put
that on over the top we'll probably be
doing some close-ups here to show you
guys this and then once that fits in the
groove all around and it's all nice and
groovy they've got the inner clamp
shield put together and the outer rubber
protective layer and as you can see it
has glass protection on there and then
if you wanted you can you know slide it
into the belt clip and you have got at
that point a freaking massive case to
protect your phone but one that you can
just literally I mean you could do
whatever the hell you wanted with this
thing it's not it's not gonna hurt it at
all it's not so if you were a very
active rugged outdoors person your men's
man with a man's phone you're gonna need
a men's case well that would definitely
be the defender apparently I'm not a
man's man because I like this imagery
probably more of a girly man yeah it is
a girly man about shut up nobody asked
you now the last thing we're going to
talk about here is their alpha glass
glass protection it is the screen
protector that goes on but it's glass
it's anti scratch it's anti shatter it's
going to basically be a level of
protection for your glass so this glass
will break
before your glass it's actually designed
to take an impact spread it out over the
glass and absorb but once it breaks you
need to change it because then it's no
longer really offering any protection
for your device but it's extremely easy
to put on it is removable you can put it
back on and re straight
if you get it on there crooked and it's
really cool because it's almost like
self applying and I'll show you that
right now
now I wasn't personally all that excited
about glass protection you know glass
screen protectors when they first came
out I mean yeah they're a lot easier to
install
they're not gonna scratch as easily
they're not going to fade or turn cloudy
depending on if you get like you know
the cheap dollar store ones or those
mall kiosk ones versus you know the
twenty five dollar name-brand ones but
the wife has been running one ever since
we got her iPhone 6 and as you can see
hers has already saved her glass so it's
time to replace this one but you can see
that it definitely offered the glass
screen protectors definitely offer a
level of protection for your device
there you go guys a huge thank you to
OtterBox for supplying me the device to
show you guys these different cut types
of cases remember they are available for
a lot of different devices if you've
never heard of OtterBox I'm wondering
which Rock you've been living under and
I'd kind of like to go down under that
rock with you from time to time and just
get away from the world because if you
don't know who OtterBox is and you've
definitely been away from the world and
they cover all kinds of different
devices as new devices come out they're
always available usually on launch day
because they work closely with the
manufacturers so I'm curious what device
you guys are using and what you're using
to protect your devices so once again
guys this has been Jase - sense thanks
for watching if you guys are not
subscribed and you enjoyed what you saw
feel free to hit the subscribe button
it's totally free it will always be free
won't be free of corny jokes though
because that's the way we do things
around here and I say we but I'm the
only one one is the loneliest number
also if you've enjoyed the video feel
free to hit that thumbs up button if you
hated the video feel free to hit the
thumbs down and then get on with your
bad self anyway guys I'm gonna go ahead
and get the heck on out of here thanks
for watching you guys make these videos
possible
couldn't do it without you eternally
grateful for that and so I'm gonna try
and do the best videos possible you guys
have been bugging me where the heck is a
skunkworks benchmark I had a Samsung 840
main drive failure now granted I didn't
lose anything any important data I have
all that data backed up on other drives
but I had to get the system back up and
running in all the
OS installed and all my overclocking
utilities and all of my benchmark stuff
so that's why we're delayed a little bit
here but we will be bringing it here
shortly in the future but enough about
that anyway it's time to get on out of
here you guys are probably already
clicked off the video and if you haven't
well once again thanks for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
