your first time here stick around maybe
you'll enjoy it maybe it won't most you
don't it's okay
did what it's so small you really think
so what is the wife thing she says it
gets the job done - ugh that smell
mm-hmm
the fractal design No - OH - it's not
about how big it is but all about how
you use it okay so going on behind me is
the very strange panel array and
although very very functional and I'm
gonna miss it trust me I'm gonna undo it
entirely I mean I've got its freaks out
the Nvidia drivers especially with SLI
it just doesn't know what the heck to do
half the time switching in and out of
programs sometimes it just completely
flips up and here's why the main panel
in there is a 27 inch Acer Swift panel
which is 144 Hertz 1440p g-sync panel
that in itself is fine but then on
either side of that I've got 2 VG - for
8qe 144 Hertz 1080p non g-sync
although g-sync upgradeable panels and
on top of everything else I've got the
34 inch ultra wide curved LG you see 87
panel so which again is a 1440p
widescreen so everything is just
completely foo barred when it comes to
the resolutions and how its set up so
although very functional makes editing
really really easy with all that real
estate it's time to downsize I've lost a
lot of desk space get even half blocks
skunkworks I can't even see the damn
thing really when I'm sitting at my
system plus it puts off a lot of heat
this much panel
I mean panels do put off heat and it
gets hot and it gets sweaty in here and
I get under boob sweat and I just don't
feel like getting sweaty in this room
anymore unless it's for different
reasons we know what I'm saying so
NVIDIA was kind enough to send me I
actually maintain a relationship with
them after doing the Titan videos
imagine that they sent me over the brand
new Acer x 34 predator curved
ultra wide IPS overclockable panel and
I'm going to kind of see if I can go
back to one panel and be happy if you
guys in the future see extra panels pop
it up then you know that one panel
wasn't enough I think I can deal with
going back to one panel
I hope so with that said let me go and
tear this
handles down box them up and I'm gonna
put up the predator and I'll hook it up
and kind of give you guys some of my
first impressions and then over time
we'll see how it does but it is g-sync
and even though it is a hundred Hertz
and I'm coming down from 144 Hertz main
panels personally I can't distinguish
the difference between 100 Hertz 144
Hertz and I've already tested that I can
definitely tell the difference between
60 and 100 between 100 and 144 and it's
very hard to distinguish the difference
there so I am going to go ahead get this
bad boy hooked up get some desk bass
back get this place cleaned up and we'll
go from there
well there we go it's pretty much done
and real quick if you guys hear any
chirping and stuff in the background the
window is open it's actually a really
nice day here in Southern California I
think it only got to like 74 degrees
it's kind of chilly actually I'd turn on
the heater but ultimately going from
those four panels of the really strange
or array if you will down to the single
34 inch ultra wide qHD is actually very
pleasant now I haven't done any editing
yet obviously this is gonna be the first
video that I edit on this display and a
lot of folks are me asking about full
review of this monitor yes I'm going to
be doing a full review but not today
because I need more time to spend with
this thing get intimate with it take it
out to dinner maybe you know see where
it goes from there but I have to spend
some time at the panel before I can
actually really learn all about it and
give you guys any sort of opinion or
review of it but there are some really
cool features that I can mention right
off the bat that I like for instance it
does have under glow lighting right here
it's kind of hard to see in this
particular environment it's very bright
because I have the studio lights going
but when the lights are off it looks
very neat you can switch between a bunch
of different colors and I think I was
actually getting ready to head out to
Home Depot to buy some accent lighting
but since this sink had it built in I
really don't see any need for that now
it even has four USB 3.0 pass throughs
with a built-in hub on the panel so one
thing I'm a little confused about and I
will say this and I will repeat this in
the review for the panel is I'm confused
about why it comes out of the box as a
60 Hertz panel when you can simply go
into the settings until it to run 100
Hertz and it seems to run 100 Hertz
pretty much no problem so I'm not sure
why they even give it the option of
running at the slower speed
it's capable of running at 100 Hertz so
I'm I guess I don't know why they didn't
just do it out of the box but whatever I
digress but anyway overall I'm happy
with the amount of desk bass that I have
back and you know it doesn't feel
overcrowded I can actually see my system
again without the right candle blocking
that so I'm kind of happy but I'll
report back again and maybe a Tech Talk
update or something about how I feel
about going from four panels back down
to one panel and they'll let you guys
know how I feel about that anyway it's
time to get on out of here guys I will
do a full review of the x34 predator
from Acer I promise just give me a few
weeks on that I want to give the thing
time to really get to know it and make
sure nothing goes wrong with it
especially since it is a cutting edge
panel it's brand new it's I mean there's
not a lot of reviews on the thing so far
and some of the reviews out there have
been hit and miss where some people have
had a lot of problems with them so I
don't want to give a positive review and
have it go wrong later I'd rather wait
and make sure nothing's going to go
wrong before I give you my opinion on
the thing but time to get out of here
guys we will see you soon
Tech Talks on Thursday at about 5 p.m.
Pacific fish you guys tune in for that
it is right here on YouTube right here
on this channel also make sure you're
following on Twitter at Jay's $0.02 I've
got a huge huge announcement coming up
something I would be doing for my 500
thousand subscriber giveaway here pretty
soon you guys are not going to want to
miss that trust me when I say it is
going to be the biggest thing that has
happened on this channel yet with that
said I've actually said too much time to
get out of here and we will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
