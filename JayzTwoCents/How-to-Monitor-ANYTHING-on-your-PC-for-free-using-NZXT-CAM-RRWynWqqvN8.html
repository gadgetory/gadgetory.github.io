over here in the corner a quick warning
if you guys are watching this on a
smartphone or a tablet it might be
better to watch this on a desktop only
because we're going to be looking at
here as an application that's got a lot
of little text that's going to be
difficult to see on a tiny little screen
so you've been warned don't complain to
me that you can't see the screen you
can't read it because I just warned you
right now but anyway I said on Twitter
that I want to do more review of
inexpensive or more affordable items and
this can't get any more affordable
because it's free and today we're gonna
be taking a look at NZXT scam software
which is actually something I've been
using for a long time now you guys have
seen it in the background of some of my
videos many of you have asked about it
well it's now been updated several times
it's gotten really really good and so
I'm going ahead and show you guys today
what I use to monitor pretty much
anything going on with my PC and I do
mean anything
with its unique freeform modular system
the new master case maker 5 from
Coolermaster allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description so before we get started if
you guys want to download this and
follow along again it is absolutely free
in fact this isn't even a sponsored
video because it's free it's just
something that I actually use and I want
to share with you guys so this is the
NZXT cam software and it works with
pretty much anything or any PC you don't
even have to have NZXT components
installed like the hue or the Kraken or
any of that stuff you can still use this
with your system although if you do have
any of those particular items
particularly the hue plus which is the
lighting kit that I am using here in
skunkworks the Kraken the grid plus
which is their fan control or anything
else that NZXT software controlled this
is going to be how you control it so you
might already have this if you have any
of those items but anyway head to the
link in the description you will be
taken to the page that you're looking at
right here where you can download the
software and signup is not even required
it's recommended and the reason being
you can see full logs and some of the
software features do require a sign up
so I guess it would NZXT you know they
want you to sign up for it but you don't
have to you can continue as a guest just
keep in mind some of the features are
going to be locked if you don't actually
sign up so anyway once you've done that
go ahead and pause the video download
this install it and then you can go
ahead and continue from there so it'll
automatically download the app and once
you've gone through all that you can log
in and then this is what you should see
now I don't want to take up too much
space here on the screen obviously with
the webcam I want you guys to see
everything especially once I expand this
so I'm gonna do right now is I'm going
to go ahead and want to turn off the
webcam I don't want to kill any pixels
and that part of your screen right there
my face is known to do that
I can cause dead pixels so I'm gonna
head and turn that off but you will hear
the sexiness of my voice still anyway
dashboard we're going to move kind of
quickly through this here I want to show
you the parts that I use the most so the
dashboard this is the main screen you'll
start on and you'll see you can see your
CPU temperature right here you can see
or load right here and that so
a good indicator of what your computer
is doing so like right now obviously my
computer sitting about eight or nine
percent we are rendering and copying
this video as as I record it
it's my CPU temperature also to your
graphics cards can be seen right here so
we've got GPU one sitting at 29c GPU two
sitting at 25 C and in my case GPU three
also sitting at 28 C you can also see
the load that they're under and it also
uses this circle chart to kind of
represent what's happening with the
temperatures here based on where they
are they're rated maxes so you can see
29 C is only about this far of the GPUs
rated max moving down here you can see
we've also got our RAM so you can see
I've got 4 8 gigabytes tix equalling 32
gigabytes of corsair memory and my
memory is under about 12% load or 3.9
gigabytes used you can also see
unfortunately right here it's not
actually properly scanning what is using
that memory but I do have this software
installed on one my other pcs and it
will show you the order of what programs
are using memory and what is using the
most but as you can see you know
obviously there's a lot of difference of
hardware and software and stuff and for
whatever reason cam on this machine is
not showing me that but that's okay I
don't really care about what's using
memory because I've got a lot of it but
if you don't have a lot at least you can
get an idea of what's using memory over
here you can also see your hard drives
you can see your different drives like
for instance my C Drive is a kingston
225 gigabyte SSD it's a 240 gig SSD but
you know that once a cache part and
partition is used up you don't get the
whole thing but anyway i'm using 121
gigs of that and 101 gigabytes left yeah
obviously when I do the skunkworks
update I'm going to be putting in much
bigger SSDs and then the drive D is an
it drive and in it drive it's
technically this is my it is a 4
terabyte Western Digital black and I'm
using 1.7 terabytes I've got 2 terabytes
free now the bottom right here you can
see I have the hue plus installed
obviously that is my lighting
configuration of my lighting control so
that's how I control all the lights and
skunkworks and you can change the modes
right here using these buttons you can
turn the channels on and off and that's
kind of a quick just run down the
dashboard here now the dashboard is
simply just kind of a high level but if
we go to the advanced
you can see we see even more happening
with the temperatures and watch this if
we expand it to full screen babe look at
all that info you get right there you
get a lot of information happening here
with your system now the cool thing
about if you signed up for an account
and again this is not a sponsored video
I swear
but signing up for an account it's free
and it logs all of your information to
the cloud so it spends a little bit of
your bandwidth not not a lot I mean just
a few k of upload to send this
information to the cloud and you can
access this from any device a smart
device like your phone or your tablet
another computer to monitor what is
happening with your machine and you can
also see in different duration what
happened to the last hour wiping over
the last day the last week you can see
trends of what's happening with your
machine if you see that your
temperatures are steadily increasing you
can compare like okay why was I why was
i running so hot yesterday you can see
what was happening what was a CPU load
etc etc so we'll be coming over here on
the left it gives you everything about
your machine you got your CPU core type
right here your video cards you can see
I still have the three tight nexus we
haven't done my update yet technically I
guess it's a downgrade to go to two
cards from three I don't know whatever
our memory our motherboard type gigabyte
x99s Oct n' CF I actually don't even
know what the C F stands for crossfire I
don't know
I'm running SLI I digress and then right
here we have our hard drives the other
screen only showed two for some reason
not even sure why they run out of room
but I've got 240 gig SSD for the main
drive for the operating system and I've
got two Western Digital black 4 terabyte
drives right here and then I've got a
480 gig kingston SSD as well but anyway
you can see your ram load right here in
graph format but the cool thing here is
your temperature you can see what's
going on with your temperatures here and
if you double-click you can expand that
particular core and you can kind of see
a history right there of what's going on
this is over the last minute this is
what's happened here over the last hour
and as I showed you earlier last day and
last week this will show up if you've
got the account set up so that you're
actually sending that information up to
the drive and then FPS stats right here
it says right here start gaming to see
your stats if you click that you can
actually get an overlay which is very
similar to like MSI Afterburner
so this will actually scan your games or
kind of keep track of what your games
are doing as you're playing them at
least if they can hook it I don't know
if it works with Vulcan or OpenGL which
is pretty much only going to affect doom
but anything that is a DirectX based
game you are going to be able to monitor
that see it in real time and it will log
it so you can see what's happening right
here now moving back to the dashboard
tab if you click over here to where
build is you can see even more what's
going on here with your systems you can
see the code name for your CPU you can
see your TVP the socket type the
frequency if anyone ever asks you like
what BIOS version are you running on
your motherboard you don't have to let
leave your system and go into the BIOS
oh you can go right here to the build
and see I'm running an X 99 SSE champion
I'm on the f-22 H BIOS and the BIOS date
is 5/3 2016 this was the BIOS that came
out in preparation for Broadway II you
can see here how long your hard drive is
even been powered on I mean look at this
right here my my kingston SSD has been
running for 3097 hours it's not really
all that long for another true what I
find kind of interesting though is the
fact that my 480 gigabyte Drive has been
running for longer but I guess it's not
that weird because I had it in the
system before the other one you can see
your video cards right here
how many shaders you've got your turbo
clock your default clock all that stuff
is showing right here so there's a lot
of cool things EBC in memory timing so
everything you've ever wanted to know
about your system is here it's going to
make you an expert on your system the
gaming tab does pretty much the same
thing we showed you four games the and
the other in the other window but as you
can see right here with it being greyed
out I'm not going to start any games
right now with you know the fact that
I'm streaming this but you can kind of
see through here it's got a list of
games and what's cool is it will keep
track of how long you played those games
and your average FPS in those games and
the resolution at which you got those
FPS so you could sit there and literally
benchmark your own stuff on your own if
you wanted using this app and don't have
to spend a lot of time figuring all out
all you do is play your games and come
back here and look oh here's here were
my averages now the last tab we're going
to go into right here this is still a
beta but it's going to actually already
part of it in here so you can't see the
disclaimer but it's gonna pop up saying
if you blow up the graphics cards that's
your bad bro but anyway so yeah you cam
is looking to become an all-in-one piece
of software where you can do anything
for your system you want to do
in one place without having to have a
bunch of different software running at
the same time running a bunch of
different software that's scanning
things like temperatures and voltages
and stuff they can start to give false
readings when they're all tapping into
that sensor themselves and probing it
probe anyway yeah when they're when
they're probing it you can start to get
some false readings so you want one
piece of software that can do everything
so this right here they're tuning tab is
where they're allowing you to be able to
start playing around with the
overclocking and fan profile of your
GPUs now it's some pretty basic stuff
here you can increase anything that's
accessible by something like say MSI
Afterburner or that's unlocked in the
BIOS you can pretty much apply here
inside of CAM but I just want to say
this real quick if you are using
something like MSI Afterburner or
precision X or GPU tweak or whatever
you're going to want to uninstall and
disable those profiles and the other
software you don't want those software's
conflicting with trying to take control
over things like memory clock core clock
and voltages bad things are going to
happen so only use one piece of software
but you can control your power limit
right here you can control your core
clock you can even show you right here
your percentage of overclock so for
instance if I was to get it you know
let's run this thing at that's only
allowed me to go 1250 but anyway I guess
obviously the only let you go so far for
the sake of being safe I guess I know my
graph might tight next is can go much
higher than 1250 but again this is a
beta so keep that in mind it's going to
reset the settings here but you can
control the memory clock fan profile and
all that stuff so it's kind of a big
deal if you ask me just have an easy
place to go in here and start changing
things like fan profile and give
yourself a pretty basic overclock
without having too much to worry about
now up here at the top right here you
can take screenshots of your ticker that
you can take a screenshot of particular
settings if you want to keep track of
something and then this little moon mode
here this is how you can change the
colors I think the white is way too hard
on the eyes so I like to keep it in the
night mode if you will but on a high
level guys that is the NZXT cam software
have you guys have any of the NZXT
hardware like I said like the Kraken
water-cooler the grid plus fan
controller
or the hue plus then you've probably
already seen this software and are
already using it because this is how you
have to control it but I think it's
really neat that NZXT has expanded this
to be an all-inclusive suite to take
control of various things happening with
your system and to monitor everything
happening with your system I use NZXT
24/7 the cam software as a monitoring
suite that way I can see what's
happening with things like voltages and
whatnot because I don't want to have to
have a bunch of pieces of software
running to try and capture everything
that's happening so far NZXT scam has
been pretty stable I did follow it
though up through the beta process so it
was kind of rocky in the beginning with
some crashes or some hard locks of the
software itself not the system but the
software just stopped responding or just
certain things not being recognized but
that seems to have really started to
work itself out to where it is a much
more stable piece of software but hey
it's free you might as well at least try
it out I mean the link is down in the
description if you guys don't like it
uninstall it and move on at least you
guys aren't out anything out of pocket
anyway I'm gonna get out here guys tell
me if you like this kind of reuse
software review if so let me know what
other pieces of software you think I
should review well that said guys I'm
gonna go ahead and get on out of here
thanks for watching and as always I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
