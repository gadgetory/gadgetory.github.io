that comes across and just sweeps the
nation and the world by storm and
everyone's talking about it and then a
new game comes and just makes everyone
forget about the one everyone was
talking about so obviously we're talking
about fortnight replacing pub G as one
of the most popular games in the world
right now probably because it's
free-to-play and all that sort of stuff
but whatever that's besides the point
because it's the most popular game in
the world at the moment it seems like
there's a lot of questions about whether
or not you can play it how much hardware
do you need and it's got some pretty
relaxed requirements so we're gonna do
today is we are going to show you how
you can actually play fortnight without
a graphics card which is perfect because
right now it's not exactly easy to get
your hands on what are you doing
shopping for a case from when you build
what are you looking for I want
something designed for water cooling
fractal design define us all the way
check it out plenty of air flow plenty
of open interior for water cooling
radiator support it even has mounts for
your reservoirs I don't have enough room
for my hard drives ok
fractal design r5 look at all those hard
drive cages and you can fit your
radiators and water cooling in here no I
got a lot of hard drives but I also have
an e ATX motherboard ok I'm gonna try
something here
ok bear with me you might wanna stand
clear I never actually tried this before
yeah it works fractal design define r6
you can fit all your radiators a
crap-ton of hard drives and if it's a
ATX did this is perfect nailed it so for
the parts in this build I used a risin
520 400 G which has a Vega 11 a GPU
built-in into it so it's an APU using a
risin fork or eight thread CPU with a
Vega 11 GPU inside it uses system memory
for the GPU though so that's why we're
running 16 gigabytes of g.skill flair X
memory 32 hundred megahertz memory that
we're actually running at 3466 right now
with CL 16 timings so it's a relaxed a
little bit but still pretty quick
because we don't have built in g ddr4
the eye GPU it has used system memory so
the speed is crucial when it comes to an
APU we also are using a 500 watt power
supply right here this is just an 80
plus it's not a bronze or anything you
get a power supply at this for about
3540 bucks but the reason why maybe even
cheaper but the reason why I went to 500
watt when we could have actually gone
with a lot less wattage is because I
wanted to give room for expanding to a
GPU later so this is just a gtx 960 if
we have time we'll throw that in and see
how it does compared to the apu but all
of this right here including a case and
this SSD we have a 250 gigabyte Samsung
Evo SSD it's an 850 Evo SSD you could
actually save some money by nixing that
entirely dealing with longer load times
and going with a hard drive because
obviously we don't have a lot of storage
on a 250 gig but all of this was could
be had for about 550 bucks including a
case and the SSD or you can easily shave
some money by going with a you know a
regular hard drive like I said so this
is basically built on the concept of you
have no computer you want to play for
tonight you've heard about it at school
you've heard about it with your friends
and you just want to see what it's all
about but you don't have the money to
build a high end system or even maybe
you have the money you just can't find a
GPU so this is the next best alternative
so with that said guys why don't we go
ahead and just fire up some fortnight
and see how well you can actually play
it in 1080p with no graphics card so
when it comes to settings here's what
I've kind of settled on obviously 1920
by 1080 view distance set to medium so
be a little bit of a disadvantage that
you don't have that super far view
distance when it comes to identifying
enemies but hey I mean you can't see the
enemy at all if you can't play the game
right
shadows are set to off because shadows
are usually pretty big impact in just
about any game we've got anti-aliasing
set to medium and you can actually turn
that off if you want it doesn't look too
bad in the game with it off but I have a
set to medium because I want to kind of
do some real-world testing here textures
are set to high otherwise everything
looks super blurry and I don't like that
look so I set textures to High effects
are set to medium and then our
post-processing is set to low motion
blur off of course and then show FPS is
on that way I can actually see where FPS
is and vsync is off I want to see how
high the FPS will go so these are the
settings I chose I also limited the
frame limit to 120 instead of 60 because
I want if we go above 120 or 60 I want
to know so that's why we did that but
with that said let's go ahead and take
beat Kensington here I think the B
stands for Britney since it's a female
character I don't really know we're
level 2 so you know to get on our levels
bro all right so we're play high
explosives b2 solo I think that just
means there's rocket launchers all over
the map
and I always seem to be the guy who
never finds one now one thing to point
out I'm not gonna be using fraps or msi
afterburner or any of that I seem to be
having some crashing issues whenever
that was open so there's a tiny little
FPS counter right up here in the corner
that you can sort of see hopefully you
guys can see it on the zoomed in camera
otherwise I'll just make some FPS
call-outs
but like right here in the starting zone
we're sitting in the upper 60s low 70s
if you look straight down the ground we
hit 95 ish so flying in the bus here
we're sitting at 85
we look down at the ground we go into
the 50s it's not terrible it's go ahead
just jump out yet because we're moving
so fast is why the FPS dips a little bit
here while we're skydiving
that's okay let's just get to the ground
as fast as we can and you can see now
we're near the ground we are immediately
back up into the 60s a lot of this has
to do with draw distance as well
everybody got myself a gun so that helps
no idea what kind of gun it is so as you
can see we're moving around here in oh I
know I found a golden chest oh my get up
rocket launchers yes
oh yeah it's give me the rocket launches
what is this a hamburger a hamburger
it's a medkit that's probably gonna come
in handy and I'm dead we'll try that
again
you slept laughing at me these graphics
actually look pretty damn good I'm not
gonna lie like for what we're playing on
right now
I mean how could you not like it taking
forever to float down yeah I wish I
could just like drop off the thing there
we go since we got in here
the jump juice Oh wrong button nope
nope oh I'm dead again
how'd they reload so fast I'm not doing
high explosives this time I'm gonna wait
a little bit before I jump off this time
trick everybody look at all those people
jumping out back there look at all those
fools and we're off
learn in the farmhouse you know there's
gonna be a gun here this guy already has
a hot rod this this car actually drive
you can actually drive cars oh man I
hear somebody else in here it's okay
though I got a gun whoo rookie day we
could day I I killed him still somebody
here I met here
and I was stuck in the bush so we're
gonna go and do a gtx 960 swap and see
if it's any better than what we
currently have experienced 60 FPS was no
problem whatsoever for the 2400 GL
overclocked in 49 y as you can see in
the menu we're hitting 120 FPS
immediately with the 960 installed so
it's laxed requirements definitely help
what having a GPU now will not have
expected it to be no better than the AI
GPU built-in but now i'm just gonna put
all these settings up farther and see
what happens here because now that we've
got obviously a GPU in here we want to
get all the FPS so check this out now
we're sitting here in the 70s dip down
to the 60s for a second there hey hey
hey hey hey hey people beat ball dove it
so I'm gonna soon change shadows yep
see shadows are that all I do is bump it
down one setting and it jumped up to the
hundreds immediately I think that's why
this game is so popular so many people
can play this game without needing you
know super high-end hardware it's very
cartoony it's like the Warcraft of pub G
it's kind of the best way to put it I
think it's very cartoony graphics you
don't have to have high-end PC to play
it and a lot of people just find it to
be super uber addicting I merely that
they got look at that
I'm just gonna go fight this guy I'm
just gonna go after this guy that the
pair of shooting it in front of me do
you think I'm just gonna follow him is
it the same crap gear I've got so I'm
gonna expect them to be as bad as me you
don't even see me I'm following you
why something following me - I'm gonna
get you we go to the bridge
I'm gonna get you
don't grenades
damn this is the Battle Royale baby
look at that told you I was gonna catch
you hey so yeah I mean the FPS as you
can see definitely high up there so what
if we go ahead and just put this to like
max settings just to see what happened I
think we've already then we've already
proven the point of today's video is
that even on epic settings we're at 55
FPS like that so we just go back to like
high next week enough yeah so yeah we're
in over 60 FPS and high with a GTX 960
so anyway that's the NSA's video guys
that's one to kind of do this I've had a
lot of people ask requesting that I do
something with fortnight because of my
minimum specs series
I thought the minimum specs on this were
extremely conservative so I went ahead
and tested this with no graphics card at
all which it didn't say you could do and
obviously you could do that so I'm gonna
continue to suck and not be any good at
this game while you guys can go ahead
and subscribe if you're new around here
and check out some of my other videos
and I found a house full of guns all
right that's my cue to just get out of
here and I'll see you guys in the next
I suck so bad this game and that guy
that keeps clicking to like when you
just hold it down no way I got a beat
the wall must click at million times
when you could just hold the button down
