might notice I'm in a space it doesn't
really look very familiar
I ran into someone he invited me in and
I want to go and introduce yourself you
guys might have seen him before
hey hey what's up guys it's Terry Crews
here with J 2 cent we told you it was
going down I said on we told you we told
you what's happening and now it is
happening what's up J okay so this is
this is kind of been behind the scenes
things here for a little bit because
this guy is yes I was busy okay so you
got 17 jobs or something like that I
think you said you did a facebook video
about you were just addicted to building
your computer cuz he built that yourself
yes yes I did first thing I want to ask
you before I move into how we're here
today what got you started what made you
say I want to build a computer first of
all uh my son I was losing him
okay it was a thing where he was always
in the video games always talking video
game and I had no idea what he was
talking about right you know and it was
kind of like you know and I had a basic
overview of things but you know what was
wild is that he just loved him so much
and I said we have to find something I
have to find something that we can do
together that piques his interest
because you know it's weird because I
and I came from the football era you
know but a lot of kids today Rams right
LA Rams Packers charges risk as Eagles
seven year now they're back at home and
brought out of back home I was only
original saw you were there an opening
day the original you know 91 Rams and I
said I have to get close to him so but
it was wild on the first really real you
know big big interest I took into it was
I went to the EA battlefield event oh I
don't see it what you ready three no it
is there to that behind-the-scenes
closing yes yes it was like Snoop Dogg
Jamie Potts myself and the whole thing
and and we saw that and us youtubers are
kind of going Snoop Dogg in battlefield
yeah what what is happening here it was
wild man I mean what this is the thing I
thought everybody you know my feels like
okay they're gonna give me a controller
and the whole thing but then I watched
and I saw these beautiful glowing
machines yeah you gotta
and I was like wait a minute game was
part of it it was so much the equipment
pulled yeah and this I got goosebumps I
was like this thing is beautiful it's
glowing and it's and I was like and it
was clear and you could see all the
components in the whole deal and I was
like and these guys had keyboards and
Mouse's and and I was and then so other
people pick you know grabbed Xboxes and
Playstations you were drawn to that
Nelson keyboard that was the thing I was
like and they were like well you know
the real PC guys we play this way and I
said well I want to play that way right
right and so when people saw me with the
keyboard and the mouse they were like PC
master-race what's up you know right and
I remember hearing it for the first time
and I was like oh is that realize that
with a whole there was a movement right
you know and then I then I started going
online it's a it's a it's a subculture
all to itself I mean and there's there's
some fierce battles there console versus
PC and Terry already kind of touched on
there but there's just the thing with PC
is you can make it yours yeah that's
kind of why we're here today
yes you built your first PC yes how did
you pick those parts how'd you know to
get well you know it was funny
um while I was there you know I
befriended one of the guys he gave me an
initial list and then I went online and
and just started doing my own research
man you know the list or the everything
then I started saying I got to make this
thing badass right you know I want to
make it really really nice so I saw the
great companies that were doing the
right stuff and I bought it all myself
my thing was people were like well they
can give it to you but I was like mmm
you know what because I want I want the
authenticity right of seeing if it
really works you know what I mean
because this is one of those things
where I've been on sets where you know
they hand you this and you got to act
like it worked and I'm like no you know
I know for a fact I said I want to be a
you know a real gamer a real guy who's
doing this stuff and I shipped
everything I literally ordered
everything at once at all handed my
house and boxes and I was like oh
what I do oh my god it was like man look
I got this I got this
and then what I decided to do I said my
son and I I said we're going to build
this together but we're also going to
build it with my whole Facebook
community you know hey yeah
and I said any question that I had I
just decided to throw it out to Facebook
and there were some really really like
harsh times probably notice right then
and there that not what you asked no one
could agree
no no one could agree on what you should
have done is why'd you get this why
didn't you get that that's the tough
part it was intense yeah but Jim I saw
the build I saw your videos and I've
seen some of the streams you done with
your son and it works you did not scrimp
on the parts you went high-end I got it
I gotta confess this is kind of crazy
man I did it all I put it together I
pushed the button and it didn't work
nothing happened and I'm going oh my god
no this is the thing with once you start
building your own stuff you start
second-guessing everything like did I
plug this into the right whatever the
motherboard you know you just kept this
you start running and you just train
where you're insecure about everything
dude I wasn't pushing the power button
you're pushing the reset I was pushing
the reset but I had I took it the best
by literally like is how did how did I
do this it did not work he was like hey
boot it up and I said it wasn't the
power but yeah I was so embarrassed
everyone everyone needs that humbling
experience it was humbling very humbling
when you put up your video on Facebook
we know specifically the one when you
were just talk about being addicted to
building it and tweaking it and working
on it yes so many people linked me over
and over my social media feed my inbox
exploded with everyone saying Terry
built a computer
Terry built a computer need to build him
a computer I'm paying myself he just
built himself a computer what can I
possibly do but then I showed you red
mist which was actually a pretty amazing
build but still very budget oriented and
I say budget oriented it's like a $7000
tower but it's not there were limits
yeah
but given now that you've found a new
passion right a new community that you
kind of didn't know existed Zak with you
and given you've had so much of an
influence and on different aspects of
people's lives I thought why don't we
build a computer for you that is kind of
an accommodation of your achievements
yeah so that's why I asked you what
theme would you want to do we talked
about that for a bit back and forward
we're a couple months into this
discussion already
I mean you've talked about president
Camacho we talked about Old Spice
and we talked about Brooklyn nine-nine
we've kind of lean towards Old Spice but
have we made up our mind on that one
well you know I I think Old Spice you
know I want to ask you do you think we
could ask have the people decide what it
would be or would that be a wise move
no it's always good to ask right even if
you don't go with their choice at least
you know where they're leaning right
because ultimately it's yours it's
really - it's between to come between
Camacho or Old Spice and given where we
are right now in 2016 Camacho now they
told me if I didn't make me pot yeah
it's already done every time I look away
I'm trees over here news happening is
happening so don't I can only do that if
I jump okay I'm gonna put a straw poll
down below okay and you guys and you can
go to the video you can click this
whenever you want you'll see it will let
it go two choices president Camacho
theme which would be very patriotic yeah
right yeah I almost like we need to put
a wig on it all right or Old Spice
now Old Spice is is like did they give
you a lot of freedom on how you want to
do that or was it is literally standard
on the green screen and do what they
said yeah well let me tell you one we
may it was Wow
I was only like contracted to do two
commercials okay okay it went way more
than two we did wait the first day as
they saw what was happening they there
were contracts backs from the parent
company they were going we want more we
want more we were doing we did more that
day right that was so crazy we were
making commercials up on the spot when
they saw the stuff I was doing it it was
breaking into other commercials yeah
exactly it just became like yeah I'll
give you a perfect example the one where
we were like blah blah blah that was
like a total like off-the-cuff it is
just like edited just keep going and
we'll keep doing something you know and
do it's again one of the most successful
campaigns and advertising history yeah
because it's it's so different it's you
could not this is love it or hate it you
couldn't forget it exactly and that was
the thing and it became the first time
people were watching commercials as
entertainment like truly people would
watch a half-hour of Old Spice
commercials like you know as a sitcom I
like I told you before we started here I
told
my seven-year-old yesterday so I'm gonna
summon go work tomorrow with a with a
Hollywood celebrity she's like oh really
who I say Terry Crews and she's like who
cuz she's seven right let me show you
some of the Old Spice stuff and she's
giggling cuz it's so silly
then I showed her hot chicks right Jess
white chicks and you know with the with
the Wayans brothers and and she's she
was cracking up at that whole scene in
the car oh you got and then click she
saw the click theme for the scene so
this is the deal cuz she likes to dance
in the car this right here this is the
computer world this is the guys that are
into gaming and a whole deal but I have
fans in every segment which is nuts
I mean when you talk about the kamacho
stuff the comedy world goes nuts over it
uh Conan O'Brien will Ferrell came up to
me and was like dude that's genius it's
actually genius then I go to church and
everybody's like where everybody hates
chris you just a wonderful father it's
amazing you know and then you go to
white chicks I go to the mall like a
little girls like aah screaming then I
go to the football games or basketball
games it's all Expendables and you know
it's a Longest Yard and the whole thing
did and it's funny then get the pants of
the Brooklyn nine-nine pants so I'm
always hit all these you're not taking
acid that's what's awesome that's the
best thing but it's all funny and so on
but that's why I'm here today to us
because I crossover a lot of things I'm
a very big car enthusiast in fact Sunday
I'm taking my car to the racetrack right
so I'm huge into cars and I've crossed
over into that genre and that's not my
main audience here but the amount of
people that watch me and watch that and
to see it come together just like this
is amazing that's good why do you have
to have one more than why do you have to
have just one thing I really believe a
lot of people are always like man you
can only have one dream but that has
always been alive always if that was the
case then I played my football career
and I was supposed to go off into the
sunset but that's not true I've lived
like several different lives yeah I mean
pro athlete to actor comedian gamer
that's good almost tells like you're
going backwards tears god that's righti
that's good that's good okay no not
backwards I'm going forward I've said
earlier to show gamers that look you can
be in shape you're not you you have also
lost a lot of weight you sorry 50 pounds
this metric let me tell you something
right now
I love Jade you sit
got this guy since he is 200 the man has
lost me
I'm 240 power so you he literally has
lost 250 pounds and he's still into the
game he's still a gamer I'm actually I'm
here to encourage a lot of gamers who
are overweight that you don't have to
just settle for that you know what I
mean you can be you can get in shape you
can play the games it's all good you
can't have it all a lot of people feel
like you got it's got to be either/or
but it's not you can have it all I got a
funny story for you real quick here I
got a tell because I told you we did a
fan meet in the park earlier this week
one of my fans came specifically to meet
me and congratulate me on the weight
loss and he's a personal trainer Wow so
he brought some ropes and then we hung
him on a tree and we started working out
in the park in the middle of this meet
right and I couldn't help but Channel
bridesmaids cuz I was just 12 bucks I
literally was like I just felt like it
was working out in the park yeah you
know I almost forget the stuff I bit it
you know it's kind of because I always
concentrate on the future then let me
tell you something too
this has always been my dream and I'm
gonna tell you just for you guys to be
in a video game I mean for real the
motion capture the whole thing it's a
huge production I want to be in a video
game because I really believe a video
game are the future of entertainment
yeah I think the television movies as it
all gets more Netflix oriented
everything streamed it's got to be more
interactive right I mean to the fact
that I really believe you'll be able to
choose the ending of the movie that you
want you know I mean like though it'll
have alternate ending like those books
we used to like choose something and go
to a different page exactly I really
believe within the next 50 years and
maybe earlier than that that you know
that's the nature of movies you're going
to go into a movie theater you're gonna
be able to sit down and have a keypad
and based on the mood of the audience
right your experience is going to change
that would be cool it's the coolest
thing guys I'd like to see the movie
multiple times but that's the thing I
mean when you look at games like Red
Dead Redemption you know somewhere you
can you can go back into the world
explore different time different places
you can go off
you know and you can go in different
time periods or whatever that's a really
fulfilling experience cuz there's a lot
of games that already offer that write
multiple endings but I see that becoming
mainstream and media and movies I think
movies I think right now in a future
we're gonna have to film two different
endings when you do a move cuz
copyrights already on files don't try
haha got rights on intellectual property
right 2016 right now all rights reserved
I own it okay so let's talk about the PC
here yes um are you afraid of
water-cooling are you afraid of the idea
of having water in there oh man that was
not that's very very intimidating I mean
I again I put my thing in I did my you
know I got my graphic card I thought it
in glowed and I was like crude but when
I the idea of water it just scares me
you know I mind a lot of my channel has
been built upon the whole water cooling
concept I think most people would agree
that of course there's a little bit of
added element of risk in there but it's
one of those things that generally it
happens so rarely now because the water
cooling parts have gotten so much better
back in the day we used to build them
out of aquarium pumps and we made it
ourself and it wasn't meant for it and
there was a lot of risk so we're talking
like back 2000 2001 well now there are
there are huge multi-million dollar
productions of parts being machines
specifically for this and a lot of them
carry a pretty decent warranties with
them - mm-hmm so to make it truly custom
I feel like we kind of need to throw
water in there no I'm with it okay I
listen I want to take it you know I want
to take it to the scary place okay you
know what I mean now can you tell me
have you ever seen an example where
water cooling went wrong uh yeah
actually there's okay so I'm gonna throw
another youtuber under the bus right now
his name is Kyle bit away he went to
turn on his system and test it when his
all put together and he forgot to put on
one of the fittings and it just looked
like a geyser but nothing got ruined
okay because he he caught it and turned
it off
I've personally made some overtime so a
bad fitting give me a little drip but
not in the place I caused any damage of
course it could have right I recommend
not leaving it running when you're not
there right right if you if you have a
here on the desk or whatever I would
recommend turning it off every time you
leave
okay but you know there are a lot of
coolants out there that are not
conductive they won't hurt your system
with a leak the problem is if you leave
it in the system for a long time then it
starts to get conductive because it's
touching metal Wow okay but I think it's
one of those things too though where for
the purpose of this i think the risk is
outweighed by the reward yes of what the
system's gonna look incredible I want to
make this literally above and beyond
anything I've done on this channel yeah
because I mean the modding community to
have access to a lot of probe modders
out there that can do anything that we
want we'll kind of put together a team
and make this computer literally
one-of-a-kind
Wow because why not why not well
obviously this is the room it's going to
be in you know what I mean there's Star
Wars on the wall yes this ought to be
roll this I'm trying to tell you man
I don't play this is you know I made
this office to be my inspiration this
office is my you know where I get this
is my muse his gaming view is the 30th
floor of South LA nightly exactly what
you know I have to say you know the
reason I want to move it here is because
the internet at where I live is just not
very good yeah and down here in this
office
it's absolutely blazing I want to do
twitches I want I mean I want to really
really step up the you know the game and
we got the multi play and bringing
people in and the whole thing and then
having people view it and be it there
with me but I couldn't do it at the
house justice and I apologize a lot of
people were waiting for more but it's
just the the bandwidth and you know the
internet just was too weak now if you
don't have good if you don't get
internet streaming is terrible terrible
experience do you spend a lot of time
here I do I do I mean when I'm not
working it's funny when I'm not on set I
treat this thing as an eight-hour day
right you know what I do instead of
going to set I've come down here from
9:00 to 5:00 and really I mean work on
my new plans right draw work on
different things you guys don't know he
also has a design company yeah yeah it's
called a minute amen
exactly we're design furniture my wife
has been kind of looking at that stuff
and I want to say my pocketbook does not
appreciate a lot of what you're doing
right now though I took it to Milan our
last our last thing was in Milan and we
got a big surprise coming at ICF felt
the international contemporary Furniture
Fair in New York this May so I'm not
playing man but I get why stop why not
exactly why not in fact I was thinking
about kind of working on new gaming
furniture that could be like okay
another lot of people complain about the
only the only true gaming chairs out
there like race car seats but ya know is
the most comfortable they're not and
they don't look good and they don't go
with the decor there's a way to make
this thing work
you're like five six hundred bucks so
there's a lot of budget there to play
with people are willing to spend on a
chair exactly exactly so uh you know my
mind is always racing on how to you know
do these worlds because the design is
still it's still key because right
that's the thing with the PCs the PCs
look so good that's what turned me on
about him you know what I mean I was
like I mean I can just get a box and put
some stuff in it but that water cooling
is good I didn't know that you were so
big on design yes until I started
talking with you and following a lot of
what you're doing on the side and that's
what it hit me like okay this guy cares
about aesthetics this guy cares about
you know taking something and making it
yours yeah so that that's what mates
made a lot of sense on why you would
want to do this right after you just
built a computer when I saw red mist I
was like holy cow
apparently he hasn't seen skunk work oh
yeah yeah I see I haven't seen you want
you know idea I did see some work but
I'm telling you the redness was the
first one I saw right so and then I went
on and started to looking at you looking
up your stuff yeah and then I saw oh my
god this is actually possible it's
possible yeah and I started to say okay
I'm a lay out my PC is gonna be right
over here I got I'm gonna line this the
set up becomes the tower's is one aspect
to set up the monitor I saw you got a
x34 predator I usually best monitor it
for gamers and content creators is IPS
is a good color
so obviously this is more than just a
computer it's also a setup so we're
going to have to collaborate more though
behind the scenes and talk about the
design because we want it to all tie in
yes exactly exactly but I think again we
got we got the bass here
old spice or camacho I'm leaning I'm
leaning toward Old Spice I am I'm
leaning in there but stop me if I'm
wrong I almost feel like there's no
reason why over time you could have both
that's true
but I build another one exactly how
these are doing like I do where you
literally build systems and just put on
display yes I've got three or four
systems right now that do nothing but
are display pieces exactly so there's no
reason why you couldn't do that well get
will get you'll get the one up and
running for you again he's not
guaranteeing is gonna go with whichever
one you choose he's kind of asking I'm
just asking
I just want opinions like I said you
know I'm leaning toward Old Spice but if
all of a sudden I hear out of nowhere
there's a mass of people that say I know
no no I might change but we'll see but I
think an Old Spice PC would be nuts yeah
nuts I mean have it say something when
you turn it on Wow well yeah we have to
get a good recording for that yeah
there's a couple of things here and I'm
really hoping I can make this work okay
um I'm gosh II gotta get some engineers
involved with this to make this piece
but fortunately I know some people that
work on tested and with like the
Mythbusters guys so we've got a lot of
access here I want if you're going to do
Old Spice I think it'd be cool to have
something where you can put one of the
aerosol cartridges in there so when it
yells power it squirts so I have your
favorite scent you know every time you
turn a computer it's phrasing or so it's
like an aerial glove it for me it's bear
glue right I am a bear glove guy so I
think that if I can pull that off that
would be amazing that's that's a big
feat though if we're talking some major
case design here another question I have
how big or small do you want this to be
oh is it can my skunkworks build is 85
pounds Wow
so or you can build a small one that
would fit in that little case over there
so I would say medium I would say
because again I would love it to
I wouldn't slide that over and then we
have all this space right here to use
you know and I mean it could just I mean
because this is a justa below you know I
just don't want to put it under there
but it would be able to be right to the
side and it can you want to be you want
to see it yeah that's the thing right
exactly you want to see the whole thing
and you know it'll be beautiful man this
is this is this is exciting because I've
got my work cut out for me now because
this is all on my shoulders no I
again I could not be more thankful for
Jay for coming all the way down and
really volunteering to put this thing
together for me because you know I'm in
this world I'm in this world forever now
you know yeah this is the future I've
always been an early adopter and the
fact that you know you he this is the
man for water-cooling I could try to
call him I remember I hit you up
I was literally tweeting you from Hawaii
I'm ready I'm ready did I was at Jerry's
place I funny story for you by the way
um Jerry
Terry Cruz is now being told you exist
he's like tell him I exist please he's
my Jerry okay he's my partner in crime
on my podcast it's another big youtuber
in about eight hundred thousand subs God
does allow the 3d printing stuff in fact
he's offering some of his 3d printing
services to make some of this stuff so
Jerry I'm telling him all right what's
up so I'm at his place okay and we're
playing battlefield one actually when
you're when you're DM came in on Twitter
well you really hate I'm ready let's do
this yes I've been waiting and I'ma try
not to nag him as I know he's busy uh
and every time I got closer to December
I'm going ah this is going to 2017 he
was so excited he goes I can't believe
you're talking to Derek Terry Crews on
my internet you went downstairs and told
his wife he's talking to Terry right now
on our internet can you place like what
is toll fan I'm with it man as I said
again he was excited to meet me that's
why what because you know what this is
the deal man I mean first of all you
know this is the way everything is going
you know what I'm saying and it's I mean
the design the computers I mean if you
resist this world you're just gonna be
so behind you're in the dark ages
right now this this is gonna cost you
something though what I've got to get a
premiere to somewhere oh yeah that's not
a problem got a problem I mean they
gotta roll out the red carpet oh yeah
I'm sure honestly I think Row 1 is
coming up pretty so uh yeah I don't know
I don't know I I got it I got it worked
magic we'll see what happens oh wow see
that would be amazing just to make my
sister and my brother-in-law jealous
they work at Disney in but I wanna make
oh god I'm not making any promises yet
no but that just the idea that you would
try is enough try I would try believe me
I got some people and make some phone
calls and the whole thing so because
I've got a few to make regarding all
this alright say hey I appreciate it man
gay man and I think people are gonna be

what you've done man I have a I have a
hashtag movement I did last year cuz I
took up cycling I lost seventy more
pounds last year where I was hashtag go
team J and what I encourage people to do
was tell me their stories and I never
realized how much one person can really
move people yeah because collectively
thousands of pounds were lost because
people were motivated by what I was
doing and they were showing their before
and after and they're their weight loss
tracking and I'm just one person I
wanted to look a little better and get
made fun of a little less on the
Internet and then here we are thousands
of pounds later across the world so
again one small step I tell people all
the time all you have to do is just
start doing once you stop moving and
doing do you get people behind you you
know enemy and you are perfect example
of that bro as long as you as long as
