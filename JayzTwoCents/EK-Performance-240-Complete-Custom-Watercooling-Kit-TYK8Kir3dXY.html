you've ever found it frustrating to put
together a PC part picker list for the
first time while building a computer
then trust me when I say that it can get
a whole lot more frustrating trying to
pick out all those water-cooling parts
if you have no idea what any of it means
so that's why today we're gonna be
taking a look at ek s new performance
240 which is a starter liquid cooling
kit inside of the box
it's got everything you need tubing
fittings obviously blocks pump radiators
we're going to take a look at the parts
that come inside this kit because the
idea here is to spend less time worrying
about whether or not you got the right
stuff and more time building and playing
on your PC now the cool thing about
these kits here is this is not just an
upgraded AIO of sorts these are actual
off-the-shelf custom parts that you
would pick if you're putting together a
custom loop but ek has already done the
legwork for you they've already put the
right sized tubing in there the amount
of fittings that you need the block of
course the radiator the fans the pump
and even a mounting option for the pump
that's probably one of the most
frustrating parts of putting together a
new loop in a in a case it's trying to
figure out where you're going to mount
stuff but not only does this have
mounting option for the pump they also
are what we'll talk about the bracket
here in a minute but you can mount this
to a fan so you can use a fan as an
actual mounting spot something else
worth mentioning here is it does have
brackets for Intel and AMD 50 did you do
do go to the route is literally first
time I'm looking inside this guy alright
so when you open it up this is the first
thing you find on top here this is the
excellent ek coolant Evo clear is a
concentrate so you're going to mix this
with distilled water or deionized water
whichever you have available
it is a clear though so there's no color
pigment to this you can add dye to it if
you want though
here are our fittings right here these
are compression fittings we'll look at
those up close more in a minute
here is our tubing we've got what
appears to be a 3/8 inch inner diameter
I'm not sure the outer diameter is but
it's a little bit thinner wall some of
these do come with really thick wall the
nice thing about this being a slightly
thinner wall is you can get some pretty
good bends in there
we have guts PWM fan splitter right here
this is going to be important for having
both fans controlled by PWM temperature
CPU control so you don't have to worry
about having multiple headers on your
motherboard available as long as you've
got one PWM header available we can
split that off to your fans we've got a
jumper here which is what we use to
start and bleed the system so that's
important you plug this into the 24 pin
on your power supply and you can use the
switch on the back your power supply to
turn it on and bleed your system without
having to turn on the motherboard which
you don't want to do until it's
completely bled here's the bracket that
I mentioned right here we'll look at
that closer in a second we've got some
LEDs right here which you can put inside
the supremacy water block if you want to
light up and we've got some small
mounting screws right here I'm not sure
what these are for
they're probably going to be for
mounting the pump and the bracket and
then in here is is all the goodies like
they're really good stuff here's our
pump combo so this is a reservoir and a
pump in one which is kind of neat
because one it limits the amount of
fittings that you need when you do it
this way because the pump in the
reservoir are one unit and - it means
you're always going to be priming the
system properly because the reservoir is
on top of the pump it's directly feeding
the pump so you only have to worry about
putting it in the right order this is
the most important part of bleeding a
system and they have already done it for
you here is our anti voice xfinty R is
the rest of the unit itself right there
the cables here are not sleeved I would
have really liked to have seen them go
the extra mile and sleeve this because
this is going to probably be visible in
your system where you're wherever you're
routing it to so here is the anti
vibration ring you can see they've got
one already mounted right here on the
pump which mounts to the reservoir right
here it's actually pretty nice unit I
like that in and out on the reservoir
clearly marks you there's no guesswork
on which's Inlet and outlet so that's
already done for you good to see what
else we got in here oh ok so here is our
ek supremacy Evo block this is literally
exactly as it would come off the shelf
if you've ordered it separately I've got
several of these I've got one in
skunkworks one of these is going in
Terry Cruz's build I've got one on the
test bench right here
I love the ek supremacy
Laak yeah so anyway it comes
pre-installed with the Intel bracket
here's the AMD one which you can switch
if you need to here's all your hold down
hardware of course a manual on how to
install it and then here is the block
right here of course it comes with
thermal paste which you need you need
thermal paste and it's got the different
jetting in here depending on the CPU
that you're installing so you're going
to want to make sure that you check the
manual and install the right jet 2011 -
three uses the different jetting then
1151 eleven fifty etc so make sure you
check the manual it'll show you how to
install this in fact you guys have seen
me do this on some of the builds where
you see me change out the jetting that's
why I'm doing it
alright so these are the Vardar fans
I've actually got I love the Vardar fan
they include the eighteen hundred and
fifty rpm fan these are PWM controlled
which I already showed you the splitter
for and that's neat because as your
systems load increases so will the fan
speed so you want to worry about setting
any of that up in any sort of fan tuning
software but if your motherboard and
such does include fan tuning software
then you can control these as well as
long as they are hooked up to a PWM
circuit on your motherboard but you can
see they've got pretty static optimized
blade design on here
I love everything about these fans the
way they're swooped on the ends so air
can't trap we are get lost between the
blade and the shroud I absolutely love
these fans in fact I've got I've got
three of them running right there's a a
white one right there you probably see
it got three of those here on the test
bench so yeah see the Vardar fans
included is a nice little the phone is
ER these are great fans I can't say
enough about them and then hardware wise
last but not least we have our cool
stream PE radiator I have actually got
these are the same rads I put in skunk
works you guys have already seen these
get installed
they're pre clean too so you can have
some pretty good faith in the radiator
cleanliness when you go to install it
you should still flush it just for good
measure and then this one because it's
the PE is a little bit thicker so you
want to make sure when you're installing
this in your system or you're choosing
your case or you're buying the system
for a case you already own make sure
that you're accounting for the thickness
of the radiator as well as the 25
millimeter thickness of the fan on top
of that so it's a it's a pretty beefy
design so you can get some pretty good
cooling out of this 240 of course we
have our installation manual here which
is good because it guides you through
installation for first time bill
of course is available in a 240 a 280
and a 360 this is actually pretty good
manual everything's fully Illustrated
it's not cheaply made they buy they put
a lot of effort into how this manual
looks here's the the Jett installation
right there I was telling you about so
it shows you how to do it the proper
order the pieces go in there's no
guesswork here sometimes you guys know
the manuals on some things just suck
really badly but not this one here it's
actually color Illustrated
well at least they put they make it
Orange the part they're referring to so
you're not guessing if it's all black
and white you're just guessing like what
part are they talking about nope it's
actually colored and pointed out yeah
I'm impressed this is a really good
manual now I mentioned earlier that it's
got mounting options included for the
pump and there's two different ways you
can mount this you could drill holes and
mount this to the back wall of your case
if you've got a case with a big enough
opening like an SMA eight or something
huge and then just mount the pump to
that and off you go the holes are
already pre-drilled here's the four
holes that mount with the pump it is a
shock mount on there so there's a little
bit of play but at the same time that's
going to give you a lot of vibration
control so the pump isn't going to be
vibrating into your case make sure you
put these two screws in right here on
the side though right now it's kind of
left open so that you can take this off
and change the mount type if you need to
and also so that you can rotate the
entire pump assembly in there if you
need to so you can rotate this whole
assembly that way the reservoir is
pointing the way you need them to go now
here's the bracket I showed you
momentarily ago this is actually spaced
out at 120 millimeters so that you can
mount them to a fan you can mount them
to the radiator itself and the radiator
then turns into a mounting bracket now
let's say you have this radiator mounted
on the front of a case like a defined s
or something like that you can then
mount the pump to the back wall of this
mount just like such and actually you
have this opening here in the bottom of
the bracket so you can run the wires
through again this is why I kind of wish
that they were sleeved wires I think you
can see that's really the only
improvement I can think of so far to
this kit it's leave the wires so anyway
this mounts on here just like that you
can see that the holes do indeed line up
and then you can mount this to the
bottom of the radiator and there it is
right there it turns the radiator the
water pump and the reservoir kind of
into a combo all on its own and then you
still have enough clearance on the top
there as you can see so that your
fittings are not being interfered by the
reservoir and last of all we have our
compression fittings here these are true
compression fittings with lockdown
collars so that you're not going to be
dealing with leaks and such in your soft
tubing there you go these are very
nice-looking they're all nickel-plated
so these go into your components and
then you just lock this down on the
collar on the tubing as tight as it'll
go and then you're correct pretty much
leak free so there you go guys that was
my first look here at ek performance 240
uh they call it a starter liquid cooling
kit but there's literally nothing
starter about this I mean it's got top
shelf parts put into a box that's
literally what it is they take all the
guesswork out of it for you if you
bought the Evo by itself this is exactly
the package you would get if you bought
the d5 pump res combo this is exactly
the box that you would get it's not like
it's something special put into this box
they've literally taken all the
guesswork out of it for you and
simplified it that way you can spend
less time trying to figure out what
parts you need and more time putting it
together and enjoying your system so now
you guys tell me what you think about
these custom kits in a box I think as an
experienced water cooler has been doing
this for well over a decade I think this
is exactly what the community needs
confusion is never a good thing so why
be confused take a look at kits like
this and the fact that it comes in
multiple sizes a 240 a 280 and a 360
means it's got you covered when it comes
to expandability and of course if those
radiator sizes aren't enough you need
more just add another radiator to it add
a little bit more tubing and get the
same size fittings you're up and running
it's very very simple alright guys
thanks for watching this video here I
will find a situation to put this system
in I think I've got one I've got a
system I'm working on here soon
that I think that this will be a nice
addition to anyway time to go thanks for
watching guys and as always I will see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
