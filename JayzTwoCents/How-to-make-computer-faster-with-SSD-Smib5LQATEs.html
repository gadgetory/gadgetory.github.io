today's video is going to probably be
really more down-to-earth and apply to a
lot more viewers than say high-end ATT
eyes and Titan X's and Pascal and all
that sort of stuff
now whenever I get to work on a friend's
computer I like to do the as much as I
can on video because I think it really
parallels a lot of things that you guys
are going through with your computer
builds and your quest for more
performance without emptying out your
wallet gigabytes flex display technology
automatically detects and connects up to
four displays for the best gaming
experience in multi display Ultra HD
click the link in the description to
find out more now my friend Rob is
brought over his computer which is one I
built back and I want to say like 2010 I
believe and even then it was built on an
extreme budget of five hundred bucks and
he wants to keep his computer running as
long as he possibly can now recently I
upgraded his graphics card from an old
GTX 460 to a gtx 950 extreme because he
likes to play you know Marvel and World
of Warcraft and stuff like that and he
wants to get as much performance as he
can but again without killing the bank
and he's running on an old athlon x4 and
eight gigabytes of ddr3 1333 megahertz
Ram so it's not like a blazing fast
machine but it gets the job done
now when I installed that graphics card
we noticed that the boot was incredibly
slow and even though he's on Windows 10
and it is a very lightweight operating
system that's supposed to make your
system run as fast as possible on things
like tablets and phones and whatnot I
was a little surprised by how long it
actually took the boot his system and he
asked me how can I make that better I
don't have money for a new processor and
RAM and motherboard and stuff while I
told them you know this really old
notebook hard drive you're using it's a
5400 rpm and it was old at the time that
he used it I told that probably the best
bang for buck is going to be upgrading
to an SSD so what we're going to do
today is we are going to clone his drive
that way he doesn't have to reinstall
everything we're going to clone it over
to the new SSD and then we're going to
do some performance comparisons so let's
go ahead let's boot up the system let's
time it so we can get some benchmarks
here on you know how much performance
he's actually gaining by going from an
old mechanical Drive to an SSD alright
so let's go ahead and see that SSD is
worth it here that's your
benchmark spoiler alert I promise you
it's worth it so we're going to time how
long it takes to start there will be a
jump cut it's going to take a little
while anyway one two three it's going I
swear
see it's going now he does have a
password on his system so once we get to
the password screen I'll stop it I'll
enter the password and then I'll start
it again because then it's going to load
all the desktop items and auto load you
know programs on there which take just
as long as anything else alright so we
are at the login screen that was 45
seconds all right password is in and
we're off to the races again I'll see
you guys in a little bit I'm getting
kind of bored now so I'm just dancing
the phone around on camera I got to show
there's no shenanigans here I'm not like
cutting it or anything and making it
look longer for the sake of dramatic
effects right a minute 13 or at the
desktop I'm glad you have a clothes
making my Nicki Minaj desktop on there
right now
he likes Nicki Minaj we still boot in
there alright so we're gonna go and say
was about a minute 15 whatever was I
don't know I'll annotate it I was too
distracted suddenly by his desktop so
anyway it was greater than a minute to
boot up the entire system that's a big
improvement over what it was though when
I turned off all those auto starts
alright so let's go ahead and clone this
thing and I'll show you how I'm going to
do it something needs to improve here
because if you look at the disk zoom in
on that it's at 100% right now it's at
100% just kind of chillin there doing
its thing and as you can see it's pegged
I mean look at that look at the
performance chart it's pegged all the
time because that drive it's tired even
though he's done you know defragment and
stuff it's just the drive is not able to
keep up with the demands of everything
else going on and I've looked before in
the past to see exactly what was running
and it's just background processes for
the OS that's pegging out this system he
should do a fresh install and a wipe but
we're going to clone it anyway just to
see for the sake of performance how much
better it is and if he decides later he
wants to wipe and start over well he's a
I do it with an IT degree so he can
figure out what he wants to do from
there anyway he did go to tech school I
totally get au moded mounted that with
two sided tape don't judge me
alright so to do this I'm gonna use my
test bench here and I'm going to use the
method here with the this is actually a
hyper X external enclosure here I can
put the new drive in here and then it
basically just uses this USB 3.0 cable
and it has power and everything it runs
to it
so that's the way I'm going to do it if
you don't have one of these handy and
you literally can just hook both drives
up to an existing computer through SATA
it's going to be easier to use another
computer than the actual drive itself
installed because then a Cronus has you
have to build an Acronis like boot drive
and then it will go into sort of a Doss
environment then it will clone it over
and then you have to switch them
physically and boot it up that takes a
lot longer but in this case here this
isn't a video about how to clone your
drive it's just a video about the speeds
comparing this to but since I know
people are gonna ask that's how I'm
doing it 1 X 1 external enclosure this
guy's going to be plugged into SATA in
there and then we're going to run the
software and clone it now Cronus is
actually really really easy you simply
select a source you select the
destination so you make sure you got the
right drive selected and it will clone
the drive including the UEFI and
everything over exactly as it is so when
you put the old the new drive in the
system the system will boot regular it
will have no issues whatsoever same
drive number everything simply because
of the fact that it is it's cloning
everything the partitions exactly as
it's built and then you just put it in
your new system and you're off and
running alright so the new drive is in
we're going to do the exact same test
here where we're going to well you know
time the boot otherwise what's the whole
point of this so in the count of 3 1 2 3
I told them this is the best bang for
the buck and I try not to be a liar
hopefully I'm not a liar so you see here
it's taken approximately 12 seconds to
get out of post
all right so 30 seconds to get to the
windows login screen so we're going to
go ahead and do a login here and then
we'll continue all right one two three
Wow
36 seconds yeah I'd say that was an
improvement okay so here's the reality
it doesn't matter how fast your
processor is your memory is your
graphics card or your motherboard if
your computer CPU is waiting on
information to be found and served by
the hard drive then it's going to keep
your system slope that hard drive is
having a hard time keeping up yeah hard
drives have a hard time keeping up these
days because you've got a spinning
platter and you've got a needle that's
got to go and find that information and
it can only find bits of information at
a time and you can easily bottleneck can
you guys love how much I love that word
but you can easily bottleneck all of the
tasks of the CPU because the hard drive
can't keep up well SSDs are amazing
because of the fact that it is NAND
memory it's pretty much instantaneous
and that you can serve or you can
actually search the entire Drive pretty
much simultaneously rather than dealing
with a spinning platter so I know I've
done this video before I know I've done
it with laptops now I just showed you at
the desktop the reality is I will always
recommend an SSD to anyone looking to
speed up their computer if they're
running a hard drive and not an SSD
already even if you have failed fairly
outdated hardware like this computer
here with the old x4 Athlon neo slow
memory and an old motherboard because as
you can see everything he does now his
games load nearly instantaneous is a
Marvel Universe loads at least four
times faster than it used to and now he
can even install World of Warcraft again
which he loved playing because it was
nearly impossible because of games that
take a lot of intense loading time are
no longer going to be what's holding him
back so I know this video right here was
kind of quick it wasn't a whole lot to
it but I wanted to show you guys a
real-world practical situation here
where a friend legitimately asked me how
can I make my computer faster made the
recommendation applied it and showed you
guys the before and after anyway I hope
you guys have enjoyed this video if you
have any other suggestions on types of
improvements you guys
want to see comparison apples-to-apples
will do that in fact we're going to be
we are actually going to be upgrading
this computer here in the near future
with a newer AMD 970 motherboard we're
putting in a AMD 6100 FX I believe it is
yeah it's an older CPU but then again
it's one that's kind of been sitting
around for a while so he's going to gain
a couple extra cores and then that alone
is also going to improve the overall
experience when it comes to his computer
anyway guys I'm done rambling tell me
what you guys thought hit me up on
Twitter and Facebook Instagram and all
that stuff and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
