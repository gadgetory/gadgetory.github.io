sure you get DIY anything but why do

laptops are something that I'm pretty
passionate about because I've spent so
much time traveling in the past I spent
a lot of time traveling now and I as
much as I do love my Microsoft Surface
and I use it a lot you can't game on it
you can't edit on it and having to carry
believe it or not I carried two
different laptops for a while I used to
carry that to be lightweight but then I
had a gaming laptop that I could set up
in the hotel if I wanted to game and I
thought it's just stupid to carry two
laptops for that reason so that's why I
taking a look today at the new Razer
Blade 15 this is the advanced model in
mercury white we're gonna see how well
this thing can perform while gaming one
of the things I love about the razor's
construction as they are in my opinion
the absolute benchmark that everyone
should achieve to be when it comes to
chassis construction because I I mean
it's aluminum unibody which gives it
just a a rough or iead amount of
rigidity that you just don't get with
other manufacturers you take it out of
the bag and it just feels solid in your
hand that's because it is a solid
construction unibody with a cover on our
aluminum with cover on the bottom we'll
take a look at the inside so you could
have the best Hardware sitting in a
crappy chassis it's gonna take away from
the entire experience of having a
durable rugged mobile solution for
gaming slash productivity work and the
nice thing is because this is the
mercury white even if it the black one
it's not embarrassing this is just it's
just I mean I'd hate to even say it has
that Apple feel but let's face it
Apple has always been very good in the
aesthetics department not necessarily
the best in terms of value and usability
for a lot of people but that's a whole
another discussion that's going to be
hundred percent
objectives who won't even touch that but
the fact that this has the nice raw
aluminum look makes me happy because if
you're taking in and out of your bag if
you have something that's anodized in
black or scratches this is gonna hide a
lot of that and I tend to be really
rough on my mobile equipment because of
the fact that like I said I travel a lot
it gets banged it gets bumped and it's
just gonna hide scuffs and scratches so
that's why I opted for the mercury white
so anyway here are the specs on this guy
and it's kind of funny we're in this
in-between kind of a generation gap
right now we're eight gen 87 58 which
has been like the dominant cpu platform
for notebooks for about the last six
months or so 6 cores 12 threads we've
looked at in the past and several other
laptops but this has a 20 70 max queue
from Nvidia now you can start specking
this up to a ninth gen 9750 h i believe
is the model that was just announced so
there's gonna be kind of an overlap
period where you've got 8th gen and 9th
jet availability I think as the 8th gen
becomes no longer available then it'll
just switch to 9th gen but you can get
it in the advanced chassis up to a 20 80
max queue starts at 2060 which is a full
board or a full-blown GPU die the
2017-2018 are the max q variants now I
chose the 27 T because I felt that this
is gonna be a better middle ground which
will keep the cost a little bit more
reasonable where you know the 20 80 max
queue is going to give you the best
overall performance in terms of gaming
but what happens when you kind of shoot
for that middle ground and we're gonna
see kind of where we land there now what
makes this sort of an amazing
productivity and gaming laptop it's not
just the hardware that's in there it
does have 16 gigabytes of ddr4 so-dimm
2667 modules which are upgradable so
they're not soldered in there you can
switch go up to 32 gigs possibly even 64
if you find dual 32 gigs so dims I'm not
sure if those exist but I'll probably
end up doing that I'll probably end up
upgrading this to 32 gigs of ram same
thing with the storage though this only
has a 512 gigabyte SSD in here I'm gonna
upgrade this to Thor a 1 terabyte or a 2
terabyte just so I have to deal with
having external drives with me so I can
put more than a few games on here
without filling it up I kind of feel
like razors always sort of a little bit
on the low end in terms of max
compatibility with storage but at least
it's upgradable but when I started to
say and I cut my own self off and now
I'm back guessing back to myself to
digress to where I started to digress
is the panel this is a 144 Hertz IPS
1080p panel so none of that 4k squished
down to fifteen point six inches which
would be ridiculous
manufacturers do it in fact you can get
this one actually in an OLED 4k panel
with HDR but I feel like 4k at this form
factor it does me no good I would rather
have the smooth high or the low response
time high refresh rate for gaming while
we still have IPS color accuracy and
have a hundred percent srgb so I'm
actually using my trusty iFixit kit here
which my wife got for me for Father's
Day a couple years back I will try to
remember to put my amazon link down
below for this kit because people ask me
all the time Jay where did you get that
kit now ways forget to put the link down
there but it will be my Amazon affiliate
link so full disclosure I do get a
little bit of support if you buy through
that link so that's why I try to
remember to put that down there but I've
also got this guy and I said this isn't
sponsored this is me I vote we paid for
this we also have this guy here which
has all the little tools and stuff for
prying apart plastic and all that so
that we don't damage anything so I
started to show that because every time
I use this kit people ask me where'd you
get that what is it
so as you can see we've got fans right
here dedicated for both the GPU which I
believe might be this side and the CPU
which I believe is this side bring an
air into the bottom and exhaust it out
the back we've got our heat sinks right
here and this is the direction that the
air flows here's our RAM as you can see
100% serviceable it looks like these are
Samsung so dims as I said eight
gigabytes per stick upgradable as you
can see the only problem is to upgrade
this one you've sort of got a ribbon
cable in the way so that would make me a
little nervous if I were say experienced
at working on laptops as a new person I
would be concerned about that so you'd
want to be very careful it does connect
right here and then here is where your
m2 drive is and then as you can see
we've got a big old battery in fact
here's the CMOS battery right here it's
actually a 12:20 sized battery that way
if you ever need to clear the CMOS kinda
like we showed you in the past Hey look
the computers on right now so the fans
are turning anyway that's final all
touching stuff as it's going you can pop
that battery out and clear CMOS if you
need
- so alright it's gonna get this back
back on and then let's start actually
doing some gaming on this so Razer
synapse is kind of like your hub we're
gonna control everything going on with
your computer at least the Razer
functionality built in here you can see
I've got the main keys here set to white
and the F row set to red and the nice
function to hear is that when you push
the function key it actually turns off
all the lighting and actually
illuminates the function key
independently so that's kind of neat so
this is also we can go in here and
disable functions - like in gaming mode
you can go in here and disable the
Windows key alt tab alt f4 we can also
go in here performance this is where I
said you can have increased graphics
power a balanced or an increased
processor power and then you have your
factory fan curve and as you can see it
brings with gaming performance the fans
up way high you set the maximum refresh
rate of your panel you can manually set
the fans if you want so there's a lot of
functionality here inside of synapse
including macro control so our GPU is
currently idling at 46 C which makes
sense it's got that small fan on it
that's very very quiet it's barely
moving air at idle because the system is
not hot that's a perfectly reasonable
temperature at idle if we go in here and
you look we can do unlock voltage
control force to see if that works when
we restart I don't think it will yeah so
we don't get voltage control but we do
get core clock as well as memory clock
that we can play with which you cannot
play with the fan curve so you can't
overclock the graphics card just a
little bit so let's go ahead and go into
some battlefield 5 and the reason why
we're gonna do that is this is after all
an RT X GPU so we want to see how well
this can handle it in a mobile edition
so now sitting in the menu at
battlefield 5 it is rendering that
background with all this blur that's a
pretty good amount of stress on the GPU
you can see we're sitting at 68 C 98%
utilization of the GPU in the menu we're
running at 1500 and 60 megahertz now it
is a max cube version so it's not going
to be going to the 1900 megahertz you
might be used to seeing on the desktop
GPU our CPU is also showing an average
of about 50% use but our temperatures
and stuff in a laptop is going to get
warmer and as you can tell by the
acoustics those fans have their cut
their work cut out for them but so far
our temperatures are staying very very
reasonable where I expect them to be I
do not know what the actual
maximum temperature of Mexico is going
to be some curious as to where this sort
of balance is out remember in laptop
conditions you are sacrificing acoustics
for sure but in terms of our settings
here is where we are everything is on
ultra this is maxed with the exception
of ray-tracing I have a set to medium I
do not have DL SS on because it looked
fuzzy when we tested earlier we can play
around that once we're in the map but
let's go ahead and get ourselves into a
game here and let's see how this looks
now this isn't exactly the most
reflective map in the game but what
we're going to look at right now is just
overall performance this is DL SS off
and this is ray-tracing on medium
and hearing I'm hearing like gun fires I
did him aah explosions all right let's
go ahead and set like the advanced stuff
to like hi not a whole lot of difference
that's good a metal for spawn Ian
I mean this is so playable this is
pretty awesome
they do watch like unapologetically r-tx
alright so this is Metro Exodus here the
very beginning when you're in the sewer
and then goes about to be a spider
crawling across my face or something
here
everything is set to max Exodus uses
ray-tracing for global illumination
which is how light is bouncing and
shadows and all that sort of stuff so we
actually can pretty good yes right here
it's like you've got to remind yourself
you're on a laptop because it's kind of
crazy in terms of the fps and stuff this
is this is good sit down we're now not a
bullets so here's what the actual
thermal print looks like of the laptop
itself the hottest point on here which
looks like it's going to be obviously
right where the monitor meets the
chassis is about 46 C you can tell they
obviously have the you can see what the
fans are on the sides because that's
where its coolest you've got heat sort
of being channeled through the middle
because where the heat pipes are as well
but you can see where you put your palms
it's about 35 C the trackpad is 34 C and
then this side over here is about 35 and
a half to 36 C so that's kind of crazy
you can see how a little bit of the heat
seems to be escaping the side right
there though you can kind of see what
the laptops been sitting on the table if
we take a look at the back as well you
can see it's the very same sort of a
heat print on there where it's the very
center that's the hottest and look at
the hottest point back here is about 50
degrees right in the very center of the
chassis so yeah if you're kind of
wondering where the heat is directed on
this you can see that where you put your
hands although warm I mean that's
certainly warm it's not unbearable I got
experienced in the past like the pro got
really really really hot right here so
if you're wondering whether or not the
razor blade 15 is any decent at gaming
as you can see it does a really good job
of it I'm a bit
prai's that how well the 27 he actually
stacks up versus the 2080 mxq in games
we were seeing over 60fps and pretty
much every scenario with high and ultra
settings and even DXR turned on both in
Exodus and battlefield 5 and the reason
why we show you those is these are kind
of like what the worst-case scenarios
are going to be so you know that if you
turn off some of those features to
reduce some of those settings the
temperature is gonna go up even more now
the acoustics well it's gaming we kind
of talked about for a second I've had
heaven just kind of going on a loop
right here it's sitting at the 74c 97%
utilized on the GPU GPU dropped about a
hundred megahertz as we reach those
temperatures so it's bouncing between
1400 and 1500 depending on the scene I
mean I have desktops I'd built that
can't come anywhere near this level of
performance by remember it is an Intel
six core 12 thread CPU that has 16
gigabytes of memory as well as a 20 70
max Q so this definitely is higher than
a lot of laptop specs now the downside
here I'm gonna go ahead and exit this we
can let this thing quiet down a little
bit here the downside is that it's
definitely pricey if you go to the
website and take a look at the various
configurations your price can range
about $15.99 and up that definitely is a
bit of a premium kind of a boutique
price but at the very least at the end
of the day what you're getting with it
is a fully unibody aluminum chassis that
does a pretty good job at rejecting
heaps and you get a very decent screen
with it and you can configure it which
you could also do technically if you
wanted is you could configure it with
some lesser hardware and then it is
upgradable in the future so by lesser
Hardware I mean storage options as well
as your memory so you can kind of
configure that in the in the future if
you want to but the sound is also
surprisingly good one of my biggest
complaints with laptops is and and I've
said this a million times I'm gonna say
it again
ever since buying my surface my
Microsoft Surface it has the best
speakers I have ever heard in a laptop
I'm not I'm talking big form-factor and
tiny thin like MacBook Air level a form
factor which is kind of what the surface
is once I heard the sound that comes out
of that and it's a rear firing which
means it bounces off of the screen and
back at you after hearing how good that
sounds I have
told manufacturers of laptops over and
over you have no excuse for bad sound so
at least with the price point that this
is coming in at you are getting direct
fire speakers that fire right up at you
and they are full you don't feel like
you're just getting this tin cans sound
like you're listening to it through an
aluminum can held up to your ear it
actually has full rich sound which is
good to see I wish it was a little bit
louder though but for most people I
think you might end up just wearing
headphones anyway I don't I'd actually
don't wear headphones very often so
that's one of those things that I would
notice I would want louder speakers to
kind of overpower some of the ambient
noise that comes from the chassis and
the fans once you are gaming on this and
putting it under any sort of load but
that's it you guys tell me what you
think of the Razer Blade 15 Razer is
definitely one of those companies that
puts a lot into their R&amp;amp;D their bid on
the price of your side but at least I
feel like you get something for that
price and if you're anyone that has
traveled as much as I have in the past
you could certainly appreciate the
amount of robust durable quality that
this chassis has so guys tell me what
you think in the comments down below if
there's another laptop you think we
should take a look at in the future I'd
be more than willing to do it and yeah
so you can tell me that down below or
head on over to Twitter but this is like
the worst outro ever what I'm trying to
say is thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next one uh the sound goes
through that still but if I double it up
like that no no alright we got a video
to make better GP performance when it
comes to not muting your damn phone
