potential to your system is to add an
all-in-one water cooling loop so today
we're going to talk about a iOS and
particular how to choose the right size
for you because the summer months are
coming winter was coming and it came in
it went and was kind of like yeah but
summer is coming and you know you're
gonna melt but your computer doesn't
have to so let's talk about is take
overclocking reliability to the next
level with the new z3 90 dark
motherboard from EVGA the z3 90 dark is
built for extreme overclocking utilizing
features such as a 10 layer PCB 17 phase
power delivery triple BIOS and 150
percent more gold content meaning you
get more of what you need to build the
ultimate Intel based PC to learn more
about the z3 90 dark in its world-class
features visit EVGA calm ok so what I've
got here are four different coolers from
Corsair they sent these over
specifically for us to do this talking
head piece but what we're going to talk
about is not features we're not talking
about RGB we're not gonna talk about any
of the like RGB fans or software we're
gonna talk specifically about the two
components that matter most in an
all-in-one water cooling loop that being
the radiator and the fans now the pump
and all four of these is pretty much the
same they are based off of an ASA tech
design so there's there's a lot of
similarities between all four of these
but what you're gonna find here is that
what we're going to talk about today is
going to apply to most brands so you can
take some of the confusion out of about
being like well Jed I'm not getting a
Corsair cooler that's okay because we're
gonna talk about here on the specifics
in terms of sizing is going to carry
over with the only difference really
being the fan designs the RPM static
pressure and that sort of stuff so let's
get started it's what we have here is a
small medium and large offering from
Corsair but the information I'm gonna
tell you today or at least provide you
today is not specific to Corsair
themselves but they were of course kind
enough to send over the the visual aids
for me to talk about this so we've got
here's the h-60 the H 100 I Pro and the
H 150 I pro and as you can see obviously
as you move from your left to right this
is a single 120 a dual 120 and a triple
120 this is kind of the norm now we've
seen other sizes sort of pop up 280 s
which are
40-millimeter fan and variants and stuff
but that's just because we have seen
we're seeing a lot more cases start to
support 140 millimeter radiators that
you're starting to see that but the
information I'm gonna give you here
regarding 120s is applicable to 140
millimeter fans as well now one of the
things you have to keep in mind before
you can start to decide which cooler is
best for you is what case are you using
those are the two things that are more
responsible and compatible with each
other in terms of you know picking out
your parts then the CPU why people might
go well I've got a 90 100 case so this
isn't gonna get the job done because
that's a hot CPU well no to be honest
this would actually do a great job at
cooling a stock speed 90 900 K and
keeping it well below t.j.maxx
the issue here is going to be if you try
and get a 360 millimeter radiator but
cram it into some sort of an ITX case or
a mid tower that is not going to be able
to support a 360 or it's not going to
have the space between the top of the
case and the motherboard or even on the
front then it doesn't really matter what
cpu are you running because it's not
going to fit now the other thing that
you want to keep in mind when it comes
to these is their Max wattage that
they're capable of dissipating or their
max rating this is one of those formulas
that you kind of have to take with a
grain of salt because just like fan
statistics a lot of companies will like
to show the best possible rating which
is usually going to be in a
non-restrictive open environment where
the fan has nothing in front of it
nothing behind it no case no radiator
it's just sitting here on a table and
the amount of static pressure and
airflow that it can move max rpm under
those conditions once you stick it in a
case or you put in a fan on a radiator
or you have any sort of resistance that
number can fall off sharply and quickly
if the fan is not up to par when it
comes to the task being given to it so
what you're gonna need to keep in mind
though and that what seems like a
digress conversation does tie in is
because the fan in all of these plays a
very big part interestingly enough all
three of these do not have the same fan
attached to them you could also have a
low rpm low static pressure fan that
would cause the temperatures in this h
6d to climb versus having a high static
pressure high rpm fan at the sake of
noise is going to then bring the
temperatures down so what you're going
to find other ratings on the Box are
usually going to be dependent
on the fan that comes with the kit added
to max rpm which is also gonna be its
most noisy you'll find 120 s to be the
most common a iOS that are included with
things like graphics cards and hybrids
and stuff like that because I've always
found that a single 120 millimeter
radiator is more than enough to cool off
a single non overclocked component the
age 60 is also going to be a great
solution for small form-factor cases ITX
cases or anywhere where you can't get a
large air cooler the thing with single
120 millimeter radiators is because you
have to run a fan at higher speeds with
higher noise to get you know max Cape
cooling capability of this heat
exchanger you start to encroach into the
area where big air coolers cool just as
well if not better something like a
knock - a big cooling tower versus a
single 120 millimeter radiator the
difference is you're much more likely to
be able to fit Vic's
this in an ITX case then like a knock to
a D 14 or whatever
so this is where sizing is more
important with your chassis than the
actual CPU itself now if you've got the
room and you want to step up and maybe
deal with it a little bit of
overclocking and you want to kind of
push your CP a little farther maybe
apply the turbo clock to all your cores
without increasing the clock speed
you're gonna find that the 240
millimeter variant or two 120 millimeter
fans is going to be the sweet spot this
is where most people shop this is the
most common size you're gonna find for
any a i/o regardless of the brand
because you most cases on the market
very few do not support a 120 millimeter
double or a 240 millimeter radiator now
what you're gonna find here is that this
is not double the cooling capacity of
this there is a diminishing return as
you move up in sizing it's a diminishing
return exponentially flattening would
you say
what he said asymptotic interestingly
enough the 240 variant of all three of
these although they both belong to the
same family of cooler the 240 has the
highest rpm rating of the fans although
all three of the fans look alike they
have the gray blades they're like a
static pressure optimized fan this one
is PWM controlled up to 2400 rpm so what
that means is if you're able to say I
don't care about the noise I care about
the cooling then you could set this to
its max rpm and just go balls to the
wall with cooling and also balls to the
wall with volume so there's that
something you want to keep in mind what
we've seen kind of come to market more
over the last couple years are the three
hundred and sixty millimeter variants
now what you're gonna find with this is
a lot more cases are supporting 360s on
the top many of which are now supporting
360s on the front what this allows you
to do is gain more cooling capacity more
thermal capacity of the actual heat
exchanger with a three sixty millimeter
radiator you are capable of running the
fans at a lower speed a lot less
intrusive but you have more air volume
going through the heat exchanger which
means better cooling it's slower to heat
up it's quicker to cool down and you can
allow yourself to have bigger overclocks
without having to intrude in your space
in terms of volume so the actual heat
exchanger size itself is only part of
the formula and I think a lot of people
get caught up on that where they care
more about the radiator size itself than
the fans which are responsible for
moving air through the radiator if you
were just to let these radiator sit
static or passive and no air is moving
through them whatsoever all three of
these would eventually overheat because
if you don't have air moving through
this taking the heat out of this which
is taking the heat out of the fluid and
exhausting it to the atmosphere what's
then being dissipated these do nothing
so fan choice is just as important
fortunately with the Corsair coolers
here they are a standard pwm plug so you
don't have to worry about any sort of
proprietary connector with changing out
your fans and so what a lot of people
will often do is they'll take their
favorite a i/o that has features that
they want where there be RGB or
expandability or whatever then what
they'll do is they'll take their
favorite fan back in the day one of the
most popular fans out there for water
cooling where the gentle
typhoon unfortunately they're not made
me more there are other brands that are
similar but the gentle typhoon was king
that was the fan to have on your
radiators if price was no object and
cooling was the most important you know
desire of your water cooling loop now
all three of these coolers are designed
with either a push or pull config and
that's another thing we're not going to
really get too in-depth on on this video
we've talked about push-pull in the past
we'll do another test moving forward
where we do a push-pull configurable
variables that can impact those results
so it's kind of hard to come up with
anything that's concrete but all of
these are designed with either a push or
pull whether it's pulling the air
through the red or pushing the air
through you're only gonna have enough
fans for one side with the radiator but
one thing you're going to find that
really varies between brands in terms of
a iOS are going to be the features now
Corsair features the IQ software which
allows you to control your pump and it
can integrate with all your other
corsair products fortunately they do
have standard plugs for the pwm circuit
we've got RGB on the pumps which are
integrated into any other RGB setup that
is in your particular system the order
the 280 the H 159 now these this one
actually features RGB fans as well where
all three of these just feature a basic
static pressure pwm fan with just a
great blade but this one here actually
is it's kind of the newer line it's the
Platinum line so you can get this in
various sizes as well it's just a
different family of cooler that features
as I said earlier 140 millimeter fan so
you can you can get a lot of cooling
capability out of your AIO
and reduce the cost if you're not
interested in all the RGB features and
such something else that can kind of
impact the price of your cooler is also
the the quality of the materials that
are used so the h-60 because it's
designed to be more of an entry-level
get the job done not as many extra
features to keep the cost low features
just a rubber quarter inch tube like
this it's it's highly flexible as you
can see I mean flexibility is important
that was the cover not that nothing
broke I promise the weight like that on
the cover a way besides player you have
a rubber tubing as you can see here it's
very very flexible I'm not a fan of fep
tubing and it
a cooler that's got Fe Fe P where it's
just a flexible pipe and it's very rigid
looking those are very stiff they kind
of wanted to do their own thing you
can't twist them up as much which makes
it's my least favorite tubing on the
market but as you move up the product
line you get a little bit more premium
feature like the 240 here or the H 100 I
Pro features a sleeved tube so it's
basically the same tube is this but it's
got a sleeving on top of it this is like
a paracord type of sleeve so it just
gives it more of a premium look and feel
get the same flexibility as you would
expect so you can mount this however you
need it and you know get the cables to
where you want them to be all the
coolers feature a rotatable fitting on
the pump so you're not putting extra
excess pressure on the barbs which could
crack you don't want that over time and
then the H 150 I Pro is the same as the
100 only it's a 360 millimeter cooler as
we already talked about but I've got a
lot of emails lately asking me
specifically about a iOS and which one
should they buy because if there's one
thing that is apparent is the a i/o
market is heavily saturated and not just
by the fluids that are contained in
these Oh bad joke but everything there's
there are tons and tons of brands there
are brands that are just rebrands of
other manufacturers like ASA Tech there
are brands that are featuring bringing
in their own features that tie in with
other systems that are available like
Corsair but there are so many different
brands from both very entry-level basic
companies to brands they've been doing
it for years there's a lot of confusion
out there on what people need so in
terms of priority for me it is making
sure you get the largest size that will
fit in your chassis comfortably you
might be able to fit a 240 but you may
not be able to do it comfortably as I
mentioned not all cases will give you
enough room between the top of the case
and where your motherboard sits and if
you're using any sort of overclocking or
gaming motherboard it's probably gonna
have a tall heatsink where the VRMs go
which could impact on the fan because
it's not just the thickness of the
radiator that matters it's the thickness
of the red plus 25 more millimeters to
clear the actual fans so you have to
keep that in mind whether they be on
or they'd be on the bottom so you might
hold this up into your case and go oh
yeah that fits no problem it clears
until you put the fans on and guess what
now you can't mount your radiator in
there if you're going with ITX case one
thing to keep in mind as well is
although you may be able to fit the
radiator and the fan are you going to be
supplying enough intake to the to the
case to be able to supply the amount of
air that this needs so this is
exhausting a 100 and you know a 20
millimeter fan it's an exhaust is there
any intake on the front of the ITX case
or on the bottom or on the top or
whatever these are the types of things
you have to think about prior to
installing your coolers so hopefully
this has been food for thought and it
gives you some things to think about
when you're shopping for your next AIO
they are all pretty much created equally
in terms of what the heat exchangers
themselves are capable of doing these
are all aluminum units that are
featuring copper plates on the blocks
with aluminum radiators they all feature
a non corrosive coolant that's not
something to worry about we've cut open
a radiator that's been sitting for years
with the same fluid in there with mixed
metals and aluminum these sealed units
are designed to run that way so don't
forget about that that's a whole
different conversation not something you
need to worry about so when it comes to
a IO is what is it you guys often find
confusing comment down below if you guys
have any answers to some of the comments
you see down below then feel free to
have a civilized conversation about
all-in-one coolers oftentimes you'll
find that a premium AIO does not
outperform a custom high-end
water-cooled loop because of 360 to 360
almost any way you look at it different
metals this is an aluminum rad versus a
copper 360 you might find a couple of
degrees of difference we tend to find in
custom water cooling loops though is
just the customized look you can make it
much more premium product and it usually
will last longer in terms of
serviceability these are not designed to
be serviced an open-loop is but that's
another conversation we'll have another
video later this summer because you know
I like to do summer months are water
cooling once around here on this channel
so if you have any topics who wants to
talk about make sure you let us know and
as always guys we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
