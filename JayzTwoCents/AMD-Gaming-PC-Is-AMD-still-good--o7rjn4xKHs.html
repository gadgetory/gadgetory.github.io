with its specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance-free plug-and-play
operation the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
hey what's up guys j su cents here and
today we're going to build a computer
we're going to see how well a fully
built AMD system would do when it comes
to a new game like battlefront now for
the cpu we are using the AMD FX 8350 it
bumps up the base clock and the turbo
clock a little bit and it does give us
four dual core modules in here for eight
performance threads now I'm using some
RAM here that I have used in several
other systems and I'm just a huge fan of
and that is the a data X PG v 2 Ram this
Ram is 1600 megahertz it's 2 4 gigabyte
DIMMs for 8 gigabytes total which is
more than enough for any modern modern
gaming system now to keep the CPU cool
I'm using cooler masters new Gemini 2's
524 version 2 now this is a downdraft
blower which is going to help keep the
chipset on the AMD motherboard cool
because we do know the Northbridge can
get kind of hot so we're looking forward
to see how this thing does with its five
copper heat pipes now the motherboard is
a new MSI 990 fxa gaming motherboard
basically the chipsets nothing new but
MSI has basically taken a lot of new
features like the killer e 20 200
network card and USB 3.1 and rolled it
into an older motherboard architecture
for the AMD so you're getting an AMD
chipset and an AMD CPU with some more
modern technology built into it now for
graphics cards I am using the Radeon r9
380 X AMD graphics cards from XFX this
is their double dissipation cards which
are going to be factory overclocked we
got two of these guys here when we
testing out some crossfire performance
and battlefront and see how well it does
and we're gonna probably overclock these
just a little bit maybe something around
11 20 megahertz around there but these
things are I chose these cards because
they are very cool and very quiet now
powering the system here is the
Coolermaster v7 50 I chose this power
supply because it is a gold rated power
supply it's got all black fully ma
jeweler cables so that we can take out
the cables we don't need doesn't give us
any that ugly rainbow colors and it is
small and compact and very very quiet
not to mention it's going to be more
than enough power to power all of the
parts in this system and of course we'll
be shoving everything into cooler
masters new mastercase 5 which I did a
review of great case great mid tower
case that can fit a lot of hardware and
then we're going to be building this
thing out with as many of these silent
FP 120 basically there's Coolermaster
silenzio 3 pin fans 1200 rpm very very
quiet so we want to keep this system
cool and quiet so those are the parts
let's go ahead and do the build and then
let's see how things actually perform
you
well obviously building the system was
very very simple it was pretty much plug
and play AMD systems are some of the
easiest that you can build especially if
you're a first-time builder their CPUs
are a lot more robust and easy to deal
with then something like say an Intel
chipset an Intel and an Intel
motherboard it can be a little bit scary
with all those really delicate pins but
the bill turned out really really nice
especially with the inclusion of the
NZXT hue plus which I put in here which
is kind of neat because you can make the
system any color that you want
now obviously the 83-70 being an older
architecture CPU I was really curious to
see how well things were going to
perform now I did things basically on
stock settings and then went into the
MSI BIOS and then just did the OC Genie
which really didn't do anything other
than force the CPU to run at its turbo
clock a 4.3 gigahertz at all times and
then bumped up the memory from 1333 to
1866 that's really all it did was it
pretty much did like an XMPP profile and
then overclock the memory just a little
bit to 1866 instead of 1600 but other
than that it's it's really not much of
an overclock at all really it's just the
turbo clock 24/7 a temperature stayed in
check nicely with the cooler master
Gemini 2 and the reason why I chose that
cooler is because of the fact that it is
a downdraft and AMD chipsets especially
the Northbridge can get really hot
especially we start to overclock them on
990 FX chipsets so I wanted that
downdraft to give a little bit of active
cooling as well to the motherboard and
the RAM so the big question on
everyone's mind is how well did it
perform well it performed pretty damn
good especially considering we are on
CPU architecture that is quite a few
years old but still very relevant today
especially with budget minded builders
now 380 X actually did a fantastic job
at running this game by itself on ultra
giving us about 70 FPS average I guess
at 1080p ultra with freesync on we were
able to get about 70 FPS average the
nice thing about the Nick seus panel
which I'm using back here is unlike some
other freesync panels is the 144 Hertz
panel that this is it's free sync up to
144 Hertz were some panels for free sync
technology
can limit around 75 FPS you don't get
the full panel refresh technology
through three sync which is really nice
about this thing here so we did have the
nice even frame pacing as you would
expect with freesync technology all the
way up to the max hundred and forty four
Hertz now considering when I turned on
to 380 X's because I was like well we
can do one 380 X or we could just kind
of go for broke put in two and see what
happens we really didn't gain much in
fact we set around eighty one FPS
average with two in crossfire but that's
because the current catalyst drivers
right now are not really optimized for
crossfire right now with battlefront
we're still waiting official drivers
from AMD I am running the beta drivers
right now which were better than the
official Crimson drivers that are out
right now but we still saw some
stuttering and usually in the beginning
of the game and then will seem to kind
of smooth out as time went on but
definitely not the performance I was
hoping for with crossfire but that's
okay that is a driver and application
problem with battlefront not really a
hardware problem so I would still right
now tell you guys that I would recommend
one powerful GPU like a 380 X or even a
390 or 390 x over to lower end GPUs like
380 X's or 370 X's or 370's if you guys
were going to be looking at doing
possibly two cards instead of one so
when it comes to building for games I
still recommend one powerful GPU if you
can swing it now temperatures on this
system are kept super cool in fact I
never saw the CPU go over 48 degrees
Celsius with the side panel on while
even overclocked to 1.45 volts on the v
corps which you guys can't compare that
to Intel Viva love v core it's different
for AMD but 1.45 volts is no chump when
it comes to voltage and this gem and I
kept things nice and cool even with a
room temperature of about 78 degrees
Fahrenheit yeah guys is California it's
still pretty damn warm even in the
wintertime
I think one thing that really made the
gaming experience kind of nice here is
the inclusion of this mixes panel which
I've had it for a little bit here and I
finally got a chance to get my hands on
and I have to say this is the NX v ue
24a now it's a TN panel but then again
at that super high refresh
I do I don't know what what other kind
of panel you would have expected but 144
Hertz 1080p and lots and lots of
settings in here where you can control
the backlight it's got its own built-in
anti blue filter so that you're not
straining your eyes when you're looking
at documents or webpages and stuff it
takes out some of that blue its rid of
some of your eye fatigue but the refresh
rate is absolutely fantastic 144 Hertz
and it didn't skip a beat and with the
free sync technology built-in I have to
say that gaming on it was absolutely
butter smooth and I've gained on gsync
systems obviously I have a g-sync system
and gaming unfree sync I have to say
pick your poison they are both fantastic
but this Nick seus panel really
surprised me it's not very expensive
it's a 24 inch panel but it gave you a
super buttery smooth fast response
gaming experience I couldn't have asked
for more and the point here is that
gaming on this thing for several hours
now
I completely forgot I was on an AMD
system I wasn't sitting there thinking
in the back of my mind like oh man this
is not the latest and greatest of
technology it's not my big bad x99
skunkworks system no I got into the
games I wasn't sitting here thinking
about the stuttering and stuff well
until I had disabled crossfire because
like I said there is crossfire bugs with
current drivers and crimson with
battlefront but AMD says they're working
on that
I know graphics cards and Driver issues
who'da thought but ultimately gaming on
it was perfectly smooth and fine I had
no problems whatsoever in fact I think
the only thing I noticed was going back
to a hard drive based system rather than
SSD based system was probably the most
noticeable but even the WD black in this
is a very fast mechanical Drive you can
hear the thing ticking away but other
than that load times are a little bit
longer than an SSD but once you're in
the game no noticeable issues whatsoever
whether it be AMD or Intel was the point
was I was gaming and I was having fun
and it just wanted to show you guys with
a video like this that gaming on AMD is
obviously still relevant I'm asked all
the time about AMD builds so I said
let's build one and let's see how well
it does but anyway I really don't have
any need to keep this system because I
have so many systems in fact as I've
been showing you guys on Instagram and
stuff the skunkworks build is moving
along and here is obviously the orange
team as a
together with all those chrome fittings
and stuff looks fantastic so obviously I
don't need this thing now not today but
very very soon I am going to be giving
away this monitor that tower that you
just saw get built and a brand new
mechanical quick fire rapid eye keyboard
and a brand new gaming mouse so you guys
don't ask me now how to enter because
you can't enter yet but trust me
somebody's going to win this and
somebody's going to be enjoying some
multi-gpu amazingness and games and all
that stuff which is ultimately the point
here enjoy some freaking games I stopped
worrying about what hardware you're
using all right guys time to get out of
here thanks for watching today's video I
hope you've enjoyed I hope you've
learned something I always have fun
doing these builds and I really couldn't
do this without your guys's support so
as we get towards the end of the year I
just want to say thanks again guys for
an amazing 2015 I'll try and do some
sort of a rewind video for you you guys
have made this the best year of my life
that's why I want to give something back
to you guys and hopefully one of you
will win and enjoy this system all right
guys I'm gonna get out of here following
social media if you guys want to
interact with me personally otherwise I
will just see you in the next video
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
