and you've opened up this video because
you are interested in seeing what it
takes to unlock the voltage and load a
custom BIOS on your Kepler based
graphics card
now first things first there's going to
be some things that we talked about in
this video that reference a previous
video of mine called how to overclock
your video card and that video is right
here and I recommend that you watch that
video before doing this that way you
have a total understanding of what it is
we are about to do if you haven't seen
that video go ahead and click it now
it's going to pop up on the screen click
it and watch it and then come back I can
wait
I've got all night
seriously I have like absolutely no life
I'm waiting okay so now that you've gone
to watch that video there's a couple of
programs that we're going to need in
order to unlock our graphics card and
those programs are gpu-z NV flash and
KGB we have an optional program in here
called Kepler BIOS editor we'll touch on
that a little bit later now the result
that we're looking for here is we want
to be able to up the power percentage of
our Kepler based graphics card and by
doing so it tells the boost clock that
you're looking to add more power and
more megahertz and more stuff to make
your games awesome so if you open up
your MSI Afterburner or EVGA precision
or whatever program you used to over
overclock your graphics card you can see
the power limit is stuck at 132 percent
that's the max can't go any farther and
the maximum voltage is one point one
volts as you can see right here we're
idling at zero point nine if I hit apply
we will pop up to 1.0 eight seven volts
and there that's it that's all we got
and because of that it really limits the
amount of overclocking that we can do
right now the maximum stable overclock
I've been able to achieve my 680 it's
1306 megahertz which is a great
overclock in fact that's much higher
than many many 680 s out there and very
few people have been able to reach that
overclock on stock bolts like I have but
because I want free power
I want to overclock this farther and so
here we are today now as always before
you continue you have to realize that
there's a certain level of risk involved
when you do that
because you are going to be flashing a
custom BIOS on to your graphics card
unlikely something's going to go wrong
but there is always the slight chance
that something could so you're doing
this at your own risk
I'm not responsible if you break your
graphics card because somehow power got
shut off to your computer in the middle
of the flashing process which will leave
it a very expensive doorstop and if you
need to send it back to get it serviced
they'll see that the RAM rom was messed
with and it's half flashed and they
won't RMA it for you unless they're
amazing and which case maybe they will
but we don't want that to happen so
remember this is at your own risk you
are also going to want to make sure that
you have adequate cooling in your case
and your graphics card you want to make
sure that you have plenty of airflow
because airflow is very important now
you can do this on a reference cooler
however I do recommend that you'll be
doing this on a custom after hour custom
or aftermarket water cooling I am water
cooled as you can see right here my
graphics card is currently running at 24
degrees and my CPU is at 27 and my cores
are all low 20s so yeah my water cooling
is more than adequate but so is your
EVGA duel fans or your direct cu2 from
asus all of those are more than adequate
for this as well the blower style fans
you can do it it's just going to be a
lot louder because you're going to have
to run the fans a lot faster in order to
make sure that you have adequate cooling
so you're going to sacrifice a lot of
noise level for this okay getting back
to the whole reason why you're here
I'm going to leave that file or
presenter wasn't there okay so gpu-z and
NV Flash and KGB of the main programs
we're going to use Kepler BIOS Editor is
an optional program we'll talk about
briefly a little bit later first thing
you want to do is open up gpu-z now I am
not putting links to these programs in
this video because the links are
constantly changing and eventually the
links will be broken and I don't want
that so you're going to have to go to
Google and do a search for these
programs they're easy to find and
there's plenty of tech forms of people
talking about these programs won't be
hard for you to find it at all now with
gpu-z open you can see all kinds of
numbers and things on here but the only
thing you care about is the bios version
right here and all the way to the right
you'll see this little download link
it says save BIOS click that click save
BIOS it's going to extract the BIOS from
your graphics card and it's going to
turn it into a rom file here that you
can now save save it to the location of
these files and I highly recommend that
you make a folder with all three of
these programs inside that folder that
way they're easily accessible in one
place so go ahead and save it and you
can see now we've saved our GK 104 ROM
you can close gpu-z and here's our realm
right here the next thing I recommend
you do is that you make a copy of it and
you save it to your desktop and then
rename this GK 104 backup with no spaces
there you go there's a backup of our rom
we're now good to go in case we have to
revert this rom back for whatever reason
second thing you're going to do now is
you're going to take a copy of this rom
the one you download it to your flash
tools folder which is what I called my
folder on the desktop I called it flash
tools and I put the programs in there
we're going to open up the folder called
KGB and we are going to save a copy of
our ROM right there so now you have
three files in here GK 104 or whatever
yours is named a KGB config file and an
application file now if you open the KGB
config file you're going to see a bunch
of stuff in here all the stuff with the
hash tags is items that can be modified
basically or they're commented out like
this warning right here telling you
don't go with a voltage higher than one
point two one two so your fan minimum is
still thirty but if you recalling the
overclocking video the fan profile
wasn't allowed to go any higher than 85
but now with this ROM or the addition to
the ROM that we are adding and by the
way what we're doing here is we're
adding these parameters to the stock rom
so we're not replacing it entirely we're
modifying it now the fan max is set to
100 so now you have control of your fans
all the way up to 100% up from 85 that's
pretty cool huh your max power target as
you can see now is at 150 up from 132 I
recommend leaving this at 150 I wouldn't
go any higher than that
now down here your settings down here is
probably going to look more like this
where the voltage has no hashtag next to
it for the value of one point one eight
volts that's because this ROM by default
says okay one point one eight is
probably a pretty good place to assume
that all graphics cards can handle that
voltage if you have adequate cooling
like I do you could add the hashtag back
to that and back out the hashtag next to
the one point two one two so this would
now become the active voltage if you had
left the hashtag there and you commented
out this hashtag next to the one point
two zero then one point two zero would
be the max so what you're telling this
is how far up you'll allow it to go and
that is whichever one you take the
hashtag off so once you're done with
that file save you now have a saved
version of that ROM in the KGB folder
the next thing you want to do now is you
want to apply these changes to the stock
rom so go to your Start menu hit command
if you're on Windows 8 I don't know how
you bring up a command prompt you have
to figure that one out on your own and
you want to navigate to wherever you
saved your flash tools folder which is
what I recommend calling it so it's nice
and simple I saved mine on the desktop
so for that this is a command prompt it
looks a lot like DOS if you don't know
how to use this is you're going to be a
little out of your element but it's easy
you're going to do CD for change
directory space the name of your hard
drive which is in my case the c drive
colon backslash users backslash the name
of your computer
backslash desktop now this is only a
good path if you save it to your desktop
if you put it in your C Drive you'll
have to navigate to it that way
backslash flash tools because that's the
name of the folder backslash KGB now
we're in the KGB folder what we want to
do now is we want to run a simple
command to count to tell KGB to apply
this config to this ROM and from inside
the KGB folder in the command prompt
that is KGB Exe for execute the name of
the ROM GK 104 dot ROM space unlock hit
enter and there you go you saw some
stuff happen now you can see the new map
power target is 150% and now you can see
we've got a voltage table that's been
applied congratulations you've now
modified this rum but you're not done
yet because now you have to copy this
rum or cut I like to cut and I like
copies of it everywhere and paste it
inside your envy flash folder and as you
can see I had a backup folder file in
there because we were already playing
around with this so now we have a copy
of GK 104 and if you wanna make this a
little bit simpler to keep track of this
you could rename that to unlocked
doesn't matter what you name it and now
we have GK 104 unlocked ROM so now we
need to flash our graphics card and that
is the most important point of this
entire video is getting this ROM on your
graphics card so move over here to your
command prompt and navigate to your
flash tools Drive and if you were still
had it open from inside the KGB you
could do CD dot for change directory and
go back Dada's go back and you're now in
your flash tools and you can do actually
you can up arrow and instead of the KGB
you can put an NB flash and now you're
in the NB Flash folder now we're going
to run another simple command to apply
this ROM to your graphics card and that
command from inside the env flash folder
in the command command prompt is env
flash space the name of the ROM GK 104
unlocked because we renamed it dot ROM
don't forget the dot ROM and there you
go now it's going to say okay here's the
current version of the ROM and here is
the replace with version of the ROM they
pretty much look identical because
remember we took the stock rom and
modified it and it says update the
display driver firmware yes to confirm
or any other key to abort press Y and
off it goes and now warned you that it
may flash the screen a few times it may
go black for a little bit that's normal
and as you can see here it's cleared the
original firmware image if you're
reading it and it says now it's storing
the updated firmware this is the most
detrimental part of the entire process
this is also the part where under no
circumstances should you reboot should
you do anything on your computer until
this is complete and says
that's full which it does right here
verifying update update successful
congratulations you've now unlocked and
loaded a modified rom on your kepler
based graphics card and this works on
anything gtx 660 and newer i'm not
positive it works on the 650 or the TI
boost or not you're going to have to do
some research on that before you try
that now apply it to apply the rom you
simply restart your computer and we will
come back as soon as we're rebooted okay
we're back my desktops loading up and
we've got our backup rom here we've got
our flash tools and we have modified the
rom and we've applied it to our graphics
card using envy flash and guys before
you ask this is an nvidia card with an
nvidia process i don't know how to do
this on AMD you're going to have to do
research on that if you are using an AMD
graphics card now to make sure that our
apply actually worked you can bring up
msi afterburner and the first thing you
want to do is slide the power limit all
the way to the right and as you can see
we now have control all the way up to
one hundred and fifty percent of our
power limit you can bring the voltage
all the way to the right as well
and if you look down here where the
voltages on the monitoring it's
currently one point nine eight seven
volts or excuse me zero point nine eight
seven volts if we hit apply you can see
you've got one point zero eight seven
another reason for that is because we
are still in the non boost mode and we
can play with our core clock here in a
moment now if we open up a program like
say valley benchmark and we load this in
a windowed mode just so that we don't
cut off our recording here we can take a
look at our core clock right here
see our core clock right now is at
900
right now it's not I'm sorry you're in a
bitch both what's memory guys it's late
don't judge me okay
as you can see right here we have
and thirty-three beggars
a overclock of 140 megahertz now one
thing you have to keep in mind is that
and if you're wondering how I got that
overclock again you have to go watch
another video it explains all of this
now one thing that's different though in
this video and how the overclocking
works from the other video is that the
140 doesn't necessarily equal 140 mega
Hertz anymore it's and it's a nonlinear
slide where it's affect the mult it's
affected the multiplier a little bit and
so it's you're gonna have to play with
it like read adding 1 mega her try
actually adds about 8 megahertz to the
overclock so it does change that in that
aspect but that's okay because as you
saw we had a thirteen hundred and thirty
three mega heard overclock now because
the boost was 1050 and we're at 1333 we
were just under 300 mega her overclock
nearly 30 percent overclock on a
graphics card guys that is almost
unheard of and so unlocking your voltage
as you can see is just free power as
long as you have the cooling capacity to
handle that now real quick before we
move on to the next item you saw earlier
there's this Kepler BIOS editor version
1.1 now what this is it's a program that
will open up any bios that you've pulled
off and as you see right here we have GK
104 unlocked we can open that and this
gives you the details about that you can
change what the boost frequency goes to
you can change what the in fact here is
that chart with the multiplier right
here so you can see we were at 1050
which is a 34 multiplier not much you
need to really worry about their power
you can see what a new power limit is
which is 255 watt or 150 percent power
limit low high and you can see your fan
control now goes up to 100% if you had
loaded the stock rom in here you'd see
it said 85 believe that at 100 even
though I don't have a fan in here now
the voltage it says one point one eight
seven but as you can see down here when
we load it up for a moment there we did
go as high as if you look at my cursor
we did go up to one point two one two
which is exactly what we
in the BIOS so if you wanted to use this
program here you could modify the BIOS
and save it and then load that so you
could play with what the boost clocks
are so you don't have to have MSI
Afterburner or EVGA precision or any of
those programs running to get your boost
clock it could just be automatic in the
BIOS
now you guys knowing me the way I am
trying to get as much power and
performance as I can out of my stuff I
want to push this to the limit all right
now I want to see if I can get a 250
mega her over clock on top of the boost
let's see if we can't get fourteen
hundred megahertz out of this bad boy I
mean honestly what is the worst that can
happen
