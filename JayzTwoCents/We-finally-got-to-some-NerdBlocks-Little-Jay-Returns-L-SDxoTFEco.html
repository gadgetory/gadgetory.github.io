head on over to mod coolermaster calm
and watched the biggest names in case
modding compete for over twenty thousand
dollars in cash and prizes
check check check warranty see that's
the microphone right there that things
ticking off the side you mean the gravy
hmm check check the line teal hey whats
up guys Jays two cents here and no J we
haven't done this in quite like months
and months and months yeah people have
been asking where is the little girl on
the Internet we've been getting so many
people asking us to do more nerve blocks
that we decided we'll go ahead and do it
so which ones are we gonna look at today
okay but that doesn't tell them what it
is yeah it's not an answer I want to do
the girl one first what's your nerve
blocks are these right here don't tell
everyone what this is these are our
nerve blocks and these two are the kids
wants and this one is the arcade ones
for this one is the arcade ones for
grownups and they are also allowed for
girls too first we are going to be
opening the kid girl nerd block all
right okay I don't have a knife candy so
I'm just using a screwdriver like have
to take on this hey now basically what
nerve block is it's a monthly
subscription where you get like a
mystery box every single month they got
a boy branded one a girl branded one can
you like please tell people what's in
there first there is an Elsa little
plastic figure okay and there's a bunch
of people in there too it's not just
Elsa there's also people from a toy
story there's from finding nemo there's
disney princesses disney classics
incredibles and you just happen to get
Elsa who's your favorite I wasn't there
Kermie you know who Kirby is I'm proud
of you hey I've never talked to her
peugeot Kirby Kirby West ok so this is
like a Kirby plushie key chain thingy
which apparently is Jay Bruce I came
over the day that's a strong feet holy
cow what look finished look at this
differently this hey I can't get this
open there we go feel that hello all
right what is this hey careful idiot the
brickwork yeah don't what kind of
look at that I can one do and that's
cool so it's almost like fabric on the
outside huh yeah you love to write
stories and things you could write all
kinds of stories in this hey that is
cool 300 pages that you could write
stories on let's go you gotta write
stories in here hey we gonna write a
story about I'm gonna write a story
about frozen the first one and then i'm
going to say the end then I'm gonna say
once upon a time in Turkey other okay so
we so good Elsa what else is in the box
obeying this talk to the video where
else in the box nerd block exclusive
item ok this is look then meet with me
shaking push this it's called quizzers
clin stirs oh oh this is just one of
those time wasters you just kind of sit
there and you can be like oh okay and
then there's like badly just bend it
around whatever you want with it looks
like we have another one in there you
know with two of these this is probably
a girl cousin from yep this one's pink
and black CZ
oh this is a comic book of marchers with
nerve block jr. huh boy edge coloring
book so the good time it's also one is a
coloring book but they're just a bunch
of different monsters and so you have
word searches that's cool there's a
comic book in the back so basically the
kid blocks are 1399 per month and now
you get about at least 1399 worth of
stuff in there same thing at your feet
cheese that got 400 tickets yes it's the
same thing at Chuck E Cheese that cost
400 tickets now you have one that I
didn't have to spend eighty dollars to
get 400 tickets alright let's do the
boiling Sun well pretty much every
single month you get one item that they
freak out over which kind of I guess
kind of makes it worth it unfortunately
there's still no kid shirts in the kids
nerve blocks no one else why would they
be something scary yes not a hoarder
block yeah that's the only downside
about doing the girl blocks on the boy
watch rainbow her music one time she
said that she likes boy toys so they
just send her both but sometimes they
kind of have the same stuff in it
because of the fact that you know they
build these blocks and then there's two
of the curvy they only got one infected
they tend to change it around based on
what they think of oiled like or a girl
would like and so there's gonna be some
things in here the same like friends
since we have two of those time wasters
here just like in the girl block and
then we have the same book because that
stuff's pretty much unisex but this is
what you say what it is for is that it's
a hobbit and it's a legal character
figure that you can no no this isn't
Legos this is just like they're just
like little two years if they're not
Legos
that's a list of all of them this one
came with two of them but see they're
just little plastic guys I got mad guy
and you get a good guy you sure it's a
bad guy I know nothing about The Hobbit
it has a sword well then human he must
be a bad guy against the word okay so
you got a thin bid the hunter and lets
them at the hunter there and that bald
guy right there front that is dwell in
the door or awful wall in the dork the
dwarf I don't all right and then of
course you have Gollum Gollum was the
little guy is my friday so the arcade
blocks the ark see the arcade block the
nerve block classic as well as the
horror blocc for adults there are 20
bucks a month and they all include my
t-shirts so figure of every single month
you get a brand new t-shirt then it can
be worth it depending what's in there I
guess most of the time the t-shirts are
some sort of a mash-up now this one here
I'll be honest I don't really know what
it's a mash-up of most of the time I
don't know like this is always gaming
stuff like that kind of looks like it
could be linked I don't know I'm sorry
guys I'm just not up to snuff on all my
aim culture that's clearly only that's a
link plushie doll you guys are into
legend of zelda clearly the arcade block
is going to all be like gaming stuff so
this is a link plushie we've gotten like
batman plushies and all end bunch of pop
caps and other boxes so is that this I
bet she's going to be a coffee mug ok so
the t-shirt it tells us right here
inside the story they just show the
picture of the teacher doesn't tell me
what is this ok
whatever could you just deal for me oh
this is the legend of zelda map of the
game but it's nice guy pac-man pac-man
keychain as a hack hack pack this one
actually makes sounds it looks like
let's open them that's all I need is a
keychain that makes noise put your hands
out of my book Batman Patman Pac Man
eats pills and sees ghosts there's
nothing immoral about that you're gonna
break it buddy alright says nothing
 in their chronic yeah in every
single arcade block this month is said
that there was a there was a sonic
character in there we guy yeah wait hun
ex-girlfriend no we actually got Sonic
that's rare we never ever get like we
had to put them together again hey house
building oh there are actually yeah
there's that's really funny does it have
girlfriend oh no this is a sonic this is
like the this guy's like I don't know
then even save their names what good
does that do me it's like a robot
looking sonic you guys look at the close
ups here and tell me who this is it's
really terrible when I don't know half
the stuff i guess my gaming culture is
not again not very good I don't know
where did the arms go I guess he has no
worse all right and I'm pretty sure this
is a coffee mug just based on the box
let's see what it is a mug up right Oh

cool like Starbucks but its star fox do
a barrel roll you don't know that is
that it all right there we go guys that
