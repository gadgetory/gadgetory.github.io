summer long working hard saving money
and it's time to upgrade or build your
computer and you've been picking all
your parts and you've gotten to the part
where you have to pick your video card
and you're just lost you don't know what
to do it's overwhelming and you're like
oh my god why is this have to be so hard
graphics cards typically aren't cheap
and it's an important decision you need
to make because it makes well all the
difference when it comes to your gaming
experiences on your computer so today
we're going to go ahead and talk about
graphics cards we're going to talk about
what a lot of the different types of
specs mean and hopefully by the end of
this video you will be a entry level
expert on what video cards are and you
should hopefully be able to make the
right decision for you when it comes to
buying your next video card now my job
today if I technically have a job is not
to pick the graphics card for you and
say hey you James why don't you go ahead
and just pick up at r9 280 brah that's
going to be the card for you that's not
what I'm doing today what I'm going to
do today is if you were finding yourself
in a pickle where you don't know what a
lot of the terminology means and you
don't know what some of the basics are
of graphics cards it's going to be
impossible for you to pick your card so
I'm going to arm you today with the
information of what a lot of the specs
and a lot of the terminology means so
that you can then start hunting with
armed with some information and it will
start making sense to you now the first
thing I want to go ahead and cover is
the cooler the cooler is quite often
referred to either as a custom cooler or
a reference cooler when I'm holding
right here is the reference gtx 780
cooler designed by nvidia for well you
guessed it the gtx 780 and this is an
all nvidia design if you did design this
cooler to go on their card that's why
it's referred to as reference this is
the reference sent over by nvidia to the
bar board partners all these guys behind
me here and they are going to basically
use this cooler on the graphics cards
that they're just following the
blueprint sent over to them
quite often they're going to say well
you know we don't necessarily want to do
the blower style they're hotter they're
noisier and they just don't want to do
that they're going to come up with some
sort of a custom
which is what I'm holding right here
gigabyte is very well known for their
wind force edition it's got more fans
slower rpms bigger heat sinks and they
run an awful lot cooler now often times
reference coolers are also going to be
mated with a reference PCB what does
that mean well the PCB guys that's the
circuit board that's this guy right here
on the back now that has a blueprint
that goes along with it it's sent over
by the board designers again AMD at ati
or nvidia and then the board
manufactures msi visiontek EVGA XFX
gigabyte they are taking the blueprint
and actually building the card believe
it or not these cards are not built by
Nvidia or AMD they're built by the
partners putting their name on them
they're just taking the blueprints and
building it now custom PCBs is when they
take the blueprint and they make their
own in-house changes the gigabytes 970
is a fully custom PCB fully custom
cooler every single component on here
the capacitors the power phases the VRMs
the heat sinks everything on this is
completely built in-house designed
in-house and really the only thing it
shares with the Nvidia design at all is
the fact that it's running a GK 204 GPU
on the inside that's really it in fact
GPU stands for graphics processing unit
I might have wanted to start a little
more basic with something like that now
the logical way of thinking would be
well if it's better in every way why on
earth would I want to go with a
reference model it sounds amazing it's
cooler it's quieter it's faster at
overclocked better higher quality
components it's going to last longer
hold its value better why on earth would
I not want to go with that well quite
often guys that comes with a price
premium it's going to cost more often
times 30 40 50 or $100 more depending on
the model so really it comes down to
price now there's another aspect that
you may want to consider maybe you want
to water cool the graphics card in the
future if that's the case you're going
to have a hell of a time trying to find
a water block for this guy or many of
the other custom PCBs because they're
much narrower portion or market share
there's not as many of these on the
market there for tooling and building
custom water
bucks for a card that is very very small
in terms of percentage of the market
that has this card it's not going to be
lucrative or worthwhile for these
waterblock manufacturers to actually
build blocks for them if you own a
windforce card and you've wanted to
water cool any version of the wind force
card you know exactly what I'm talking
about
so reference PCBs make more sense
because reference PCPs are what the
blocks are being made for now with that
said I'm gonna go ahead and point out
that I've got my three GTX 980 s right
here and people have asked me J why did
you go with the reference style and not
the for the wind or classified or
whatever that's because if I want a
water cool these bad boys I've got to go
with the reference PCB now oftentimes
you'll find an aftermarket cooler on a
reference PCB and that's what we have
right here from EVGA the GTX 980 there's
a number backplate it's kind of goofy
but it's a reference PCB this is all
reference with their component that they
picked usually higher quality capacitors
and things like that with their own
custom cooler on there so you kind of
get the best of both worlds you keep the
reference PCB quiet cool and you can
water cool it if you want so that's why
I went with those now when it comes to
the amount of VRAM that you need people
tend to really get caught up on that and
I seem to think oh my god if I don't
have enough vram my computers going to
explode
I've actually seen some comments where
people have said I'm not even kidding
guys I have seen the blind leading the
blind I have seen some people say no you
need to have X Y Z amount of VRAM
because if you don't then your
computer's going to suddenly shut off
and that sudden shut off could trigger
your power supply to catch fire and burn
your house down guys I'm not making this
up I have seen that comment in my own
videos and it brought and it brought a
very disappointing tear to my eye guys
if you don't have a VRAM what's going to
happen is your frames per second is
simply going to cap out and won't go any
higher now let's talk about vram real
quickly Ram is video RAM for video
memory gddr5 currently and people seem
to think that you have to have gobs and
gobs of it well that's true to an extent
if you're running a 1080p panel at 60
frames per second or 60 Hertz chances
are you don't need more than 2 gigabytes
of vram 1080p
is not using that much vram unless
there's always an unless right got to be
the bust burster of bubbles the unless
being if you're running custom texture
packs or high amounts of MSA a
or anti-aliasing that really eats up
vram like the shadow of Mordor game they
have a texture pack that apparently
requires six gigabytes of vram and
there's only a couple of cards on the
planet that have six gigabytes of vram
available to it the other thing that
tends to eat up via RAM as I mentioned
is high amounts of MSAA turning up to 2x
or 4x or even all the way up to 8x
it's just multi sampling and it's going
to cause the RAM to be chewed through
like crazy so if you can get two
gigabytes of vram for 1080p that's
usually going to be enough most graphics
cards now we're going to be offering
three gigabytes or higher but like the
760 right here has got two gigabytes the
r9 285 right here has two gigabytes the
7 or the 270 has two gigabytes you can
kind of see what the cards and where
they're designed to really run that
that's kind of a telltale sign of it
being a 1080p card if it only has two
gigabytes of vram now if you're gonna be
running higher resolutions like 1440p
1600 P or 4k yeah you want to pack as
much vram on there as you can and a lot
of the custom PCBs will also come with
higher amounts of VRAM so often that's
kind of killing two birds with one stone
but once again when you start dealing
with these custom cards that have more
vram usually there's a pretty hefty
premium on there as well one of the
benefits though to running high
resolution monitors is you don't need to
run as much MSAA because MSAA is
designed to make the edges more less
jagged not more jagged less jagged
because the lower resolution means
you'll get smooth edges and high
resolution by default is giving you
smoother edges you don't have to run as
much MSA a the last thing I want to talk
about here is there seems to be this
common misconception of it's better to
get to lesser cards and run them an SLI
or crossfire than it is to get a single
high-end card guys here is my
professional opinion and I'm speaking of
someone who has multi-gpu configuration
has been dealing with them for a while
it is always always always better to get
the highest
single card that you can get and then
SLI across fire that later don't make a
conscious choice now to get to lesser
cards and run them in a parallel SLI or
crossfire config thinking you're going
to get better performance more often
than not to lesser cards are going to
match the performance of a single card
but introduce other things like
possibilities of micro stutter higher
power supply requirements games that
just simply don't scale are gonna give
you the same performance as one card in
your left going why the heck am I only
getting 50 frames per second or 60
frames per second I have two cards I
should be getting a bajillion frames per
second this doesn't make any sense it
does make sense to people designing the
games and the people designing the cards
have to create profiles for the cards to
even know what to do in tandem and if
those don't exist you're not going to be
benefiting from going with a multi GPU
configuration anyway so my
recommendation on this one go with the
single GPU and the highest and single
GPU that you can afford you'll thank me
later I promise I know the other
question is just on all of your minds
and you're dying to ask it and you may
have already typed it before even
getting to this part of the video and if
you did shame on you you should always
watch the entire video before commenting
you guys want to know AMD or Nvidia what
I can't answer that in this video I just
can't I've done videos in the past by
AMD versus Nvidia I will do future
videos
AMD verses in video but in this video
today I can't answer that both sides
offer great offerings to the community
AMD is really pushing mantle although
DirectX 12 is supposed to be kind of the
global version of better API when it
comes to hardware and software
utilization guys I can't answer that
both of them have their great offerings
and they continue to trade blows and
they continue to get stronger and Trump
the other and all I can say is that's
great for the community it is great for
pricing and it's great for the consumer
if you guys are team red go with an AMD
graphics card more power to you if you
guys are team in green good for you as
well it's great to have community
support
just remember guys we're all PC gamers
and as a whole we are we belong to one
big giant collective and that is PC
gaming and we should all be happy that
we just have our gaming PC's to begin
with whether they be AMD or Nvidia but
it's going to take a whole nother video
to talk about pros and cons of either
versus the other we're not going to
tackle that with a 25-foot pole today so
guys it's been Jays two cents I hope
I've given you some information to make
it a little bit easier making your
choice you're still stuck with that AMD
versus a video question but hopefully
you guys can make some informed
decisions and as always if you guys have
any questions or something I missed put
it down in the comment section or follow
on that their Twitter I'm very active up
on that Twitter and I don't know why
will sudden a third talk a lot of
southern but we did now I'm stuck so
this is probably the best time to end
the video the people from the South
don't like when you pretend from the
South although I am from Southern
California you can't deny me my southern
southern blood alright guys see you next
be huh
