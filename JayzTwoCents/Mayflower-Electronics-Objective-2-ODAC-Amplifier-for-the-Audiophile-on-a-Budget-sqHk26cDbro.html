two cents and I just can't even describe
how much I love making videos now
because of my new and improved office
yeah I do miss the little man cave
effect but you know it certainly works
pretty damn good as a tech cave still
fighting the echo though got to figure
that one out now are you the kind of
person that fancies yourself an audio
file that we won't even we won't even go
there we won't well cut cut have you
recently bought yourself a pair of
headphones that just don't really seem
to be cutting it well if you're hooking
up those headphones to something like an
iPhone or an iPad or even maybe the
headphone jack on your computer chances
are you just may not be getting nice
clean power to those headphones so what
do you do to get that nice crisp clean
sound
well you consider taking a look at the
Mayflower objective - Oh doc amp combo
and that's what we're going to be taking
a look at today let's go ahead and talk
about Mayflower electronics real quick
now when I pick a company to support or
take a look at their products or even
buy the products or whatever it may be I
like to know the company that I'm buying
from so when Tyler at Mayflower
electronics agreed to send me one of
these to do a review on I immediately
sent him an email saying ok I know about
your product tell me about you tell me
about your company and here is his story
and I think it's actually pretty pretty
cool now Tyler who's the guy that I was
talking to I believe he's the owner of
Mayflower was going to school for
electrical engineering and he wanted a
headphone amp for his headphones because
he fancies himself a fan of music and he
likes nice clean sound well he couldn't
afford any of the amp set on the market
so he had taken some soldering classes
and was currently an electrical engineer
student so he decided you know what I
could take these plans off the internet
and I can make my own so that's what he
did he made himself a very crude
homemade amplifier for his headphones
and then he found himself needing some
money so he sold
his beloved homemade amplifier on eBay
and made a few bucks above what it cost
him to make that so he found himself
later again needing an amplifier so he
made another one and once again he sold
it but this time he was able to get more
money for it and then took that money
and made more amplifiers and created a
little bit of supply and demand for
himself people started talking about his
homemade amps people loved it the price
to performance ratio was great soon
thereafter he was getting enough
amplifier orders to where he was making
more money making these things from
scratch than he was at his part-time job
while going to school so he did what
anyone else would do
he saved 15 percent on his car insurance
wait that's the wrong video nope he quit
his job which we all would love to do he
quit his job because he was able to make
his income doing something he loved now
let's go ahead and fast-forward he's
done with school and is now doing
mayflower electronics objective two
amplifiers now these things are made
from scratch now the O DAC built into
this the interface with the computer is
a USB it's right here on the back but
this is actually a part that's made in a
factory that he integrates into his
homemade enclosures now the amplifier is
actually built by hand by him the knob
this is the actor this is actually the
aluminum upgraded knob aluminum you know
the more you guys correct me and say no
it's aluminium here the closed the pwned
you guys make me feel weird now when I
say aluminum so aluminium I also watch
Top Gear so I know how you guys say it
Roger Jeremy Clarkson says it a right so
I do have the upgraded aluminum knob on
here and this has gone suit through some
revisions so this is a little bit
different than what some of the older
ones are like for instance now the power
plug is on the back instead of the front
you do have a power switch on here if
you have your output you can also choose
to use an analog input instead of the
USB if you want it is 12 to 20 volts AC
input on there so and it does come with
the power brick here just basic little
triad power brick so that's included
also included with it is a heavy duty
USB cable that's plenty long I don't
have that in front of
it's in the cable box in there but trust
me comes with a nice high quality cable
very heavy-duty sticky rubber feet this
thing does not slide on the desk it's
actually very very stuck short of
putting double-sided sticky tape on
there I don't think it could actually
get any more traction on the desk
without moving now this thing actually
puts out a lot of power now the reason
why I needed this was as you guys know
from the sennheiser games zero review
those are 150 ohm headphones which means
they have very high resistance and very
power hungry so they needed an amplifier
like this to power them in fact my
iPhone and my motherboards built-in
sound card just could not give them the
punch that they needed now testing this
on a 150 ohm headphone I've got to tell
you I can leave the knob at about half
and my ears still hurt on a 150 ohm
headphone so testing these on lower ohm
headphones like the immune issues I've
got up there and the funk headphones and
even the cooler master headphones up
there the sound quality of this is
amazing because it has a built in ode
ACK this is also now your sound card so
this completely takes all of the sound
that's inside your system out of the
equation and the sound floor on this is
amazing that may be okay if you guys
ever plugged in your headphones and you
have nothing playing on your computer
and you just hear that kind of a bat
noise that's play it's like it's like
static but it's just no it's actually
just referred to as noise but it's just
kind of a it's really effing annoying
yeah this doesn't do that if I crank
this knob all the way up and I have
nothing playing through this just the
sound of the electronics you cannot hear
a thing the noise floor on this is
really really low now the quality of
this really made me enjoy gaming and
playing music again in fact when I'm
just sitting here sometimes I like to
just listen to music once again because
I've got nice beautifully clean sound
this thing creates and recreates all of
the frequency ranges of the input coming
to it amplifies it beautifully no static
no distortion even cranked I'm not
getting distortion I'm just getting
punched in the freaking head with sound
and that's what I like I like being
punched in the head again that doesn't
sound right
the fact that it's right here built in
America hand-built by a guy who decided
he could do better than what was on the
market and I love those kinds of stories
unfortunately mine came with a little
dent on the bottom you can kind of see
it right there it's on the bottom its
hand-built so I'm going to go ahead and
just kind of let that one slide because
you can't see it but this does
everything I needed and more so if you
are looking for a no DAC or even a
headphone amplifier definitely consider
this not get any kickback I wasn't paid
to say that this is 100% in my opinion
this is an amazing amplifier for for the
cost and that's the reason why Jerry has
it because as you know he's poor people
there you go guys the mayflower
electronics objective to ODE AK
headphone amplifier combo make sure you
go and check them out the description
has the link to their website no
affiliation code or anything just go
there and check it out if that's what
you're looking for
follow on Twitter if you'd like to talk
a little bit more about this we have any
questions about this or anything else
tech related or maybe you just want to
send me a funny joke or a funny meme I
love those two I'm gonna get on out of
here and go let this thing punch me in
the face and the head a little bit more
and as always I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
