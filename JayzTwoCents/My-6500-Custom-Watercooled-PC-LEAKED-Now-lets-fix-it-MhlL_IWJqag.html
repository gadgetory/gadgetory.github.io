breathe air
this is a sad day recently on tech talk
I said that in the 11 years I've been
doing water cooling I've never had a
leak well you know my policy is no one's
ever done anything until they do it and
skunk works as a leak
alright there's skunk works and all her
glory do you see how that right
reservoir right there is a little bit
lower than the left you see how the
levels are a little bit below the cap
well I have filled that reservoir up
about an inch worth over the last couple
of weeks and I just assumed that the
fluid was evaporating or still bleeding
because these 45 mil thick radiators
especially when they're set up for
vertically like this radiator is was
just bleeding or still evaporating
slightly because you do lose some
coolant through evaporation even in
hardline and through soft tubing but
that's not the case but as you can see
there's the proof in the pudding right
there so I had suspected that this one
of these fittings under here one of
these 90s was leaking so last night I
cleaned it up and there was a drip in
there but I had a lot of tension pushed
on this this tube right here I had a lot
of tension pushed on that when I have my
old cables in there so I thought that
maybe it was just kind of binding on
that that 90 degrees so I cleaned it up
and it didn't seem to be dripping or
anything so last night before I did my
live stream I put that in there to see
if it was dripping and as you can see it
certainly is there's even a little bit
on the radiator right there that you can
see let's see if I can get it to drip
right now no not dripping but I was
doing that and I was able to get some
drips to come out so yeah we're going to
be replacing that guy right there the
only unfortunate thing is the way that
this system is set up is it connects to
this end right here and that just
happens to be the hardest tube to bleed
in this entire system so that's alright
we enjoy this kind of stuff where we
wouldn't do it right that's why we water
cool we enjoy this stuff even if even
the failures now the way my drain system
works which probably freaks a lot of
people out is I just have a tea splitter
coming off the
humph with a little bit of extra hose
and a fill port on there that has a plug
which I simply pulled the plug off and
let it drip down into the bowl and then
when I loosen up the fitting on the top
of the reservoir then it will just come
run and out so there's a little bit of
splash Ã¤j-- but I've got about $75
worth of nano fluid in this system so
I'm not about to lose it so I'm going to
go ahead and we're going to drain this
this bad boy now
that's just cracked open their gums the
rest of the fluid skunkworks is taking a
pee
hashtag skunk work tease alright we got
it all blood I got the fitting off put a
cup there in case it drips as you can
see it is dripping and there's the
there's the bad fitting you can see we
even have a little bit of staining on
there so we're gonna get that that elbow
out of there and I'm actually going to
be putting on a kind of a nice sharp 90
like that but sort of a like that black
one on the left right there where it's a
dual rotary fitting although it's gonna
be a chrome one like the one in the
middle because I don't have any black
ones believe it or not yeah water
cooling part I don't have so now we're
going to go ahead and alright unthread
this guy and we'll take a look at it
here and do it all one-handed one-handed
unthreading blurry video there we go
yeah as you can see it's I don't touch
my camera now with the yellow fingers
there it is
what fitting is this you might be asking
well this is an EK fitting basically
it's like a non branded bits power
fitting i believe they feel just the
same so the leak actually happened
focus so the leak so the leak actually
happened right there in the rotary part
and how does that happen well i mean
really the part doesn't move or anything
so i don't know it just eventually
fluid worked its way into the o-ring and
once a leak forms well then it just gets
bigger and bigger and bigger so let me
show you how much play is in there now
because here's the rotary fitting it
turns right there that way you can
rotate the fitting that's why it's
called a rotary and these parts are held
together nothing more than by the
pressure fit of an o-ring and a groove
in there so it feels fine right now but
if you look there's there's quite a bit
of play in that
now that play was there when I installed
it on all of them but it's not uh normal
for there to be play in a fitting in
fact just about every fitting I've ever
installed or ever used has had play in
it
bits power seems to have the least
amount of play but also the least amount
of rotation because it's extremely stiff
but even bits power have been prone to
leak in those joints so all we do is
replace this fitting refill and bleed
will be up and running in no time so
this is what we're going to be putting
in there and you'll notice that this out
also has a little bit of play but I've
been used but this one actually is a lot
tighter when you turn it and I've been
using these dual rotary fittings from
alpha cool for a while now but the
reality here is any fitting that you use
is a potential failure point and we'll
talk more about water cooling at the end
of this video probably spark a pretty
good discussion and there's a new
fitting installed all that's left to do
now is fill it and bleed it which really
would take longer than the replacement
of this fitting itself it's just because
gunk works is a little bit complicated
down here in the basement area it can it
takes a lot longer this was just a
regular old water-cooled soft tube build
oh well it's all part of the enthusiasm
enthusiastically lifestyle I guess
alright well the system is running as
you can see right there it's bleeding
and maybe checking for leaks over here
on this side and so far we're looking
okay we're going to let this run for a
while and we'll see how this goes this
is the leak test part that you should
always perform and it's no different
when changing one fitting
you know check the entire system again
so that's definitely not something I had
planned to do this morning but
regardless it needed to be done so we're
going to let that leak test run for a
while the wife and I actually we have to
go to the doctors because my two month
old unfortunately has to have an
outpatient surgery nothing major but
still don't ever like having to you know
hear that your your child needs a
procedure anything done so we're going
to go deal with that which is obviously
more important than this computer and
then when we get back we'll check and
see how we're doing see if we leaked let
it bleed and then we'll be back up and
running so see you guys a little bit
okay we're back
and baby J had her surgery everything
went well so thank you guys for the
wishes of what wishes on Twitter but
back to the system now see if she's
going well as you can see the new
fitting right there and we're still dry
so what we're doing now is we've been
letting it bleed now for like the last
four hours or something you can see it
there it's letting get the air out we're
gonna go and top that off close her up
and it's pretty much done at this point
now let's go ahead and just as button it
up and let's talk about what happened
and whether or not this is the kind of
thing you should be afraid of yeah I
could have hidden this video I could
have just not put it up not put a public
that I had a failure in a fitting and I
could have maintained my reputation of
I've never had a system leak in 11 years
but then again nothing's ever happened
until it's happened so I think one
system leak in 11 years is not bad and
this one was not catastrophic obviously
because the leak wasn't up there in the
system it was down in the bottom where
there was no electronics anywhere near
that in fact if you saw the pictures on
Instagram or Twitter and you should be
following by the way because you get a
lot of behind the scenes stuff up there
you would see it just fell down into the
case floor and just pooled up there and
didn't go anywhere so there was nothing
for it to damage however if it had been
a rotary fitting up at the top it could
have been a lot more catastrophic and a
lot more costly now it's going to talk
about what
happened here whether or not you should
still do water cooling and all that so
this is what was at fault and already
showed you guys that this is my this is
an ek 90-degree rotary fitting here I
can't hold this against ek it doesn't
matter what brand it is I couldn't hold
it against it because there are failures
things do happen in fact I still can't
find anything wrong with this if I if I
blow in this thing I still can't get any
air to go through the o-ring watch so it
holds air and believe it or not I use
air to do a lot of my leak testing as
well if I put a system together I'll
I'll blow in it really hard and I'm
opening myself up to a lot of jokes here
I know but if they can hold air then
like little bit holding fluid is good so
my first test is always the air pressure
test and then I put in fluid into my
leak test so this thing is still right
now not leaking now it's possible
because I had this thing torqued with
cables against it when I had all the
extra cables prior to doing the custom
sleeve kit and I had them shoved in
there that it was torquing against this
to where fluid was able to make it past
the o-ring and once fluid makes it past
it then it's got a pathway that doesn't
steel up again until it's dried out and
has a chance to seal so this fitting
could still very well be good in fact
I'll test it but the point is the more
of these things that you add to your
system the more fittings are more elbows
anything you add more parts is going to
add more points of failure so if you're
building a system and you're worried
about leaking and stuff just know that
if you go with soft tubing compression
fittings and do as much as you can do to
keep from using elbows and rotary
adapters like this the chances of
leaking are very very slim but it does
and can happen so you want to keep that
in mind as well but as you can see the
system is up and running and holding
fluid pretty sure may had to do a leak
test for about five hours so but anyway
yeah this is the problem there now Jay
are you worried about water cooling now
in the future absolutely not I always
knew this was a risk in fact because I
knew this was a risk it never forgot
that over the last 11 years is why I was
able to catch it early before it turned
into a major failure where all of the
fluid leak
the bottom then we would have had a
problem especially if I wasn't home now
wasn't leaking when the system was off
it was only leaking when the system was
on and built up pressure inside the
system and leaked even more when the
system got hot and was doing you know
overclocking graphics cards and gaming
because that was a graphics card loop
that was leaking the CPU loop was
independent that was completely
unaffected by this but I do have about
six more of these fittings in the system
so there's the potential for it
happening again but of course the
important part here is to always monitor
your fluid levels that's why I do nice
giant reservoirs like this that are very
easily easily visible because that's
your first indicator that something is
happening here and I happen to notice
you know that fluids going down a few
millimeters a day that's a problem so
that's why I caught it while it was a
drip before it was you know Niagara
Falls so guys this is a risk you take
when you do water cooling it's not going
to change it I'm everything I do is
still going to be water cooled and if
that's not the kind of risk you want to
take than water coins not for you but if
you are willing to take the risk and
just know that I've had one bad fitting
in 11 years it's pretty good odds then
by all means take all the precautions
necessary water cool away and have a
good time so guys you guys have been
wanting a lot more water cooling videos
for me I am proud to report that are
pleased to report a proud proud listen I
have about three giant boxes full of
water cooling gear from ek primo chill
alpha cool I think that's it but a lot
of different stuff plus I have three
custom water cooled systems with acrylic
builds to do case mods on skunkworks are
going to happen in the near future
because you know the PDX land really
sort of made me wish I had a modded PC
but anyway so we're doing that we're
also be doing more how to's a completely
revamped beginner's guide to water
cooling getting all the people ready for
summer who are going to be doing their
first water cooling builds and we are
also going to be doing more acrylic
we're actually going to do our first
full tutorial of how to bend acrylic
tubing
so our PE T G tubing and I'll explain
why you want PE T G over acrylic 2 which
is kind of a question a lot of people
have so there you go guys
just one head and put this out there in
public opening myself up to ridicule and
pointing and laughing with people saying
haha your system leaked well haha
nothing broke ro alright see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
